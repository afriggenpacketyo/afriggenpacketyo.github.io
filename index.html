        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate once again failed to pass government funding bills, ensuring the shutdown will continue, as negotiations between the White House and Democrats remain at an impasse. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer refuted President Trump's claim of active negotiations on healthcare, stating Democrats are ready to talk if Trump is serious. Both Republican and Democratic proposals failed to reach the 60-vote threshold, with only a few senators crossing party lines. The repeated failures highlight deep divisions over including healthcare provisions in the funding legislation.</p>

          <p>New research published in Environmental Research has found a link between long-term exposure to sulfur dioxide, a pollutant from fossil fuel mining and combustion, and an increased risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The study originated from observations of higher ALS incidence in New Brunswick, Canada. Researchers compared diagnosed individuals to healthy controls, finding a 23% higher chance of an ALS diagnosis for those with higher SO2 exposure. While the study indicates association, not causation, it highlights potential environmental factors in neurodegenerative disease and the need for further research.</p>

          <p>Phony modeling agencies are increasingly targeting older individuals, exploiting the fashion industry's embrace of diverse looks, similar to long-running scams against younger aspirants. The article details how victims, like 79-year-old Judy Corker, were tricked into paying hundreds of pounds for fake photoshoots and non-existent jobs. Scammers often demand payments via unprotected methods like PayPal's "friends and family" option. The report provides crucial warning signs and advice on avoiding such tricks, emphasizing the importance of using protected payment methods and reporting fraud.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has entered its second week, with the Senate failing for the fifth time to pass competing funding bills. Democrats are insisting on healthcare-related concessions, including extending Affordable Care Act tax credits, while Republicans demand a "clean" funding bill. President Trump hinted at a willingness to negotiate on ACA subsidies, a claim quickly refuted by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. The White House has warned of potential federal worker layoffs and cancelled energy projects in Democratic-governed areas, intensifying the political standoff.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer is bullish on Take-Two Interactive, stating its "scarcity value" in the video game market could drive its stock higher after top competitors went private. With Activision Blizzard acquired by Microsoft and Electronic Arts by a Saudi-led consortium, Take-Two is now the sole major publicly-traded American pure-play video game company. Cramer highlighted the company's strong recent quarter, growing player accounts for GTA Online, and the anticipated release of "Grand Theft Auto VI." He suggested any delays in the game's release could be a buying opportunity for investors (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is reportedly struggling to increase arrests and detentions, despite receiving an unprecedented $45 billion in new funding for expanded capacity. Current and former officials express frustration that daily migrant custody numbers have barely grown, and arrests have fallen. They attribute the slow pace to a Homeland Security policy requiring Secretary Kristi Noem's personal approval for large contracts and the influence of DHS advisor Corey Lewandowski. Lewandowski is accused of prioritizing state-led detention agreements over lower-cost private facilities, complicating the administration's deportation goals.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown extends into its second week, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) has directed its members, deemed essential workers, to continue working without pay. The union warned that job actions could lead to termination, despite acknowledging the financial hardships faced by its members. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy reported a slight increase in sick calls among air traffic controllers, raising concerns about potential flight delays and the impact on worker morale.

The order mandates Google to allow rival app stores within Play and permit developers to include external links to bypass Google's billing system.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has appointed Frank Bisignano, the current Social Security Administration Commissioner, to the newly created role of CEO of the IRS. Bisignano will oversee daily operations at the IRS while continuing to lead the SSA, a decision Bessent justified by shared technological and customer service goals between the agencies. However, Social Security advocates express concerns about a "leadership vacuum" at the SSA, especially given recent job cuts and unconfirmed deputy positions. This article highlights the challenges of a single individual leading two major federal agencies.</p>

          <p>Illinois and Chicago have filed a lawsuit to block President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago, calling it an "unconstitutional invasion" and an attempt to sow chaos. Despite the legal challenge, a judge declined to issue an immediate restraining order, and it was revealed that Texas National Guard troops are already on their way to Illinois. Governor J.B. Pritzker and Attorney General Kwame Raoul strongly condemned the federal action, citing constitutional clauses and the Posse Comitatus Act. The situation escalates the ongoing conflict between federal and state authorities over military deployments.</p>

          <p>China has strategically given up its "developing country" status at the World Trade Organization (WTO), a move seen as a tactical retreat that offers more gains than losses. While this status entitled China to special trade treatment, Beijing has already conceded some privileges and used the label to align with the Global South. By relinquishing the designation, China removes a key talking point for the U.S. and EU, which criticized the inconsistency of a hi-tech powerhouse claiming such benefits. This article frames the decision as a clever maneuver to reframe the global trade battlefield.</p>

          <p>A new intelligence bulletin from Secure Communities Network warns that extremist groups are increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence tools to intensify antisemitic propaganda, recruitment, and operations targeting Jewish communities. AI-generated content, including deepfakes and generative text, blurs the line between real and fake, making false narratives more credible. The article cites instances like the chatbot "Grok" posting antisemitic content and AI assisting in planning a physical attack. These threats pose significant challenges for law enforcement and communal security, contributing to a rise in anti-Jewish hate crimes.</p>
