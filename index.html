          <p>Relations between the Czech Republic and Slovakia have significantly cooled since Robert Fico became Slovakia's prime minister in October 2023, diverging on key foreign policy issues, especially regarding Ukraine. The Czech government, led by Petr Fiala, has halted governmental meetings with Slovakia due to Fico's pro-Russian stance and cessation of military aid to Ukraine. This divergence extends to domestic policies, with Czech concerns growing over Slovakia's actions against independent media and anti-corruption efforts. Public sentiment in the Czech Republic towards Slovakia has also declined, reflecting the strained political relationship between the two nations, marking a notable shift from their historically close ties.</p>

          <p>Syrians are increasingly expressing openness to peace with Israel, marking a significant shift in the region's political landscape, as direct talks between Syria and Israel have occurred, facilitated by the U.S. These discussions, focused on border security, signal a potential departure from decades of hostility, influenced by President Trump's engagement with Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa. While the talks are in early stages, they represent a move towards normalization, driven by a desire for economic development and stability within Syria.

          <p>Harvard University is resisting the Trump administration's demands, which include changes in how it operates and external audits of campus viewpoints, leading to a battle over academic freedom and federal funding. The administration has frozen billions in federal contracts and grants, primarily for scientific and medical research, and is considering revoking Harvard's ability to enroll international students. These actions are seen by some as an attempt to intimidate and control institutions of higher learning, while others view them as necessary to address issues such as antisemitism and ideological orthodoxies on campus. Despite the financial pressure, Harvard has challenged the administration's actions in court and garnered support from various campus constituencies.</p>

          <p>A Republican-led budget bill proposing restrictions on federal student loans for professional programs, including medical school, is drawing criticism from doctors' associations and medical schools. The proposal would limit federal student loans to $150,000, eliminate a graduate loan program, and restrict loan forgiveness, potentially discouraging low-income students from pursuing medicine. Advocates warn that these changes could worsen the projected shortage of physicians, particularly in primary care and underserved areas.

          <p>Top U.S. universities, often divided by internal strife, are finding common ground in opposition to the Trump administration's efforts to defund research, increase endowment taxes, and dictate admissions and faculty appointments. This campaign has united faculties, student bodies, donors, and alumni groups who recognize the threat to academic freedom and institutional autonomy. The administration's actions, including banning diversity programs and imposing demands on universities in exchange for federal funding, are viewed as an overreach that could harm the sector's global standing. University communities are rallying to defend higher education's role in society and resist federal pressure.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's policy of deporting individuals to countries other than their origin, such as South Sudan, is facing legal challenges over concerns about due process and safety. Immigration lawyers argue that deportees are not given sufficient time to contest their removal to these third countries, potentially exposing them to violence or persecution. A federal judge ruled in favor of the lawyers, mandating a credible fear interview for migrants facing deportation to countries other than their own. The administration defends the policy by stating that it is necessary to remove individuals with criminal records whom their home countries refuse to accept.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Helene exacerbated an existing housing crisis in North Carolina, leaving over 100,000 homes damaged or destroyed and resulting in at least 94 deaths due to rainfall flooding. The Pacheos, a couple from Fairview, lost their home of 30 years, along with all their belongings, highlighting the storm's devastating impact on individuals and communities. Efforts to convey the storm's threat were hampered by a lack of media attention and difficulties in communicating the severity of the risk to residents. The aftermath has prompted discussions on improving forecasting, warning systems, and building resilience against future climate events.</p>

          <p>A study published in 2007 challenged the long-held belief that lower voter turnout benefits Republicans, suggesting that the party's affluent electorate could vote even when it was inconvenient. The study found that each inch of election-day showers dampened turnout by 1%. This shift in voter behavior indicates that the impact of stricter voting laws may no longer automatically favor the Republican Party, prompting a reassessment of traditional assumptions about voter turnout and political advantage.</p>

President Macron announced that the base will be the first to welcome the latest Rafale jets and France's ASN4G nuclear-capable air-to-ground missiles.

          <p>China maintained a low profile at the Shangri-La Dialogue, a prominent Asian security summit, by sending a lower-level delegation and canceling a plenary session on China's security. This absence of a strong Chinese presence led to increased criticism and questions posed by the U.S. and its allies, particularly regarding China's military actions. The absence of Defence Minister Dong Jun also meant that no bilateral talks were held between China and other nations. This understated approach contrasts with previous years, when Chinese military delegations actively countered American messaging at the forum.</p>
