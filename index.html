          <p>The Eurovision Song Contest is set for its grand final in Basel, featuring a diverse mix of 27 countries. Sweden, represented by KAJ, is the favorite with their sauna-themed song, but novelty acts rarely win. Other top contenders include Austria's JJ with a pop-opera ballad about unreciprocated love, France's Louane with a torch song about grief, and the Netherlands' Claude with an Afropop-chanson dedicated to his mother, who brought the family out of the Democratic Republic of Congo when he was nine years old. Finland's Erika Vikman brings a Eurodance song about female pleasure to the stage, and the UK's Remember Monday is hoping to make a splash with a musical theatre performance.</p>

          <p>A cyclist in Belfast's Victoria Park was surprised to spot a 4ft starry smooth-hound shark swimming in the Connswater River. Marine biologist Dr. Patrick Collins said that these sharks are not often seen in cities, but they have been recorded in urban areas. The shark was likely feeding on crabs in the river. The Connswater River rises in the Castlereagh hills and runs northwards through east Belfast, getting wider until it reaches the sea at Belfast Lough.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement that the U.S. would lift sanctions on Syria took Treasury Department officials by surprise, creating confusion about the specifics and timeline. The announcement, made at an investment forum in Riyadh, contrasts with previous policies targeting the Assad regime for human rights abuses and support for terrorist groups. While Syria's transitional government has been lobbying for sanctions relief to rebuild the war-ravaged country, the sudden reversal has led to internal discussions at Treasury to determine the scope and pace of the rollback. Turkey and Saudi Arabia support normalizing relations with Syria and have offered aid.</p>

          <p>Ten inmates, including one convicted of murder, escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in New Orleans early Friday morning, prompting a large-scale search. The inmates broke out by creating a hole in a cell wall and exiting through a loading dock, according to Sheriff Susan Hutson. The Sheriff's Office is investigating the possibility of inside assistance and security failures, including defective locks and doors. The escape has drawn criticism from officials who questioned the delay in notifying the public and raised concerns about security protocols at the jail.

          <p>President Trump has engaged in a flurry of diplomatic activity this week, including lifting sanctions on Syria, brokering deals in the Gulf, and claiming credit for a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. This suggests a shift towards a foreign policy focused on trade and non-intervention, prioritizing American interests. Trump's speech in Riyadh emphasized "commerce not chaos," signaling a pragmatic approach to international relations. However, this approach has also drawn criticism for its potential lack of consistency and disregard for traditional diplomatic norms, and the Syrian government billboard thanking the US and Saudi Arabia for lifting sanctions is a visual example of the week's events.</p>

President Trump criticized the decision on Truth Social. The ACLU praised the ruling, stating that it prevents individuals from being hurried away to a brutal foreign prison.

          <p>A Republican-backed tax bill touted as delivering "PERMANENT tax cuts and bigger paychecks" is projected to disproportionately benefit the highest income earners, while offering more modest gains to lower-income Americans. Households with over $1 million in annual income would see a 4.3% increase in after-tax earnings, while the lowest-earning 20% would receive a 0.6% boost. The fate of the bill is uncertain after some Republican members of the House Budget Committee voted against it, arguing it doesn't do enough to cut federal spending. Some analyses suggest that low-income households could be worse off due to potential cuts to federal programs like Medicaid and food stamps.</p>

          <p>President Trump launched a social media tirade after returning from a diplomatic trip, targeting critics such as Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift. He threatened Springsteen after the musician criticized his administration and questioned Swift's popularity after she spoke out against him. Trump's posts came after a week of lavish praise and opulent displays in the Middle East. The White House communications director declined to clarify the nature of Trump's threat against Springsteen.</p>

          <p>A top adviser to the Director of National Intelligence ordered a senior analyst to redo an assessment of the relationship between Venezuela's government and a gang after intelligence findings undercut the White House's justification for deporting migrants. President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants relies on a claim that U.S. intelligence agencies think is wrong. A political appointee told a career official to rework the assessment, a direction that allies of the intelligence analyst said amounted to pressure to change the findings. The National Intelligence Council reaffirmed the original findings after re-examining the evidence.</p>

          <p>Ten inmates escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans early Friday morning, prompting a large-scale search operation. The inmates, including one convicted of killings, are considered armed and dangerous. The inmates reportedly tore off the toilet-sink appliance in one of the cells and exited the facility through a loading dock. The sheriff confirmed that one inmate had been caught as of Friday. Officials said "defective locks" were a factor in the escape, but also that there was "a lapse in security."</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court rebuked Texas judges for moving quickly and secretly to deport detained Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador. The justices said the judges must offer a hearing to the detainees. The ruling noted that the government may remove the plaintiffs under other lawful authorities. The order carries a clear message that the justices are troubled by the Trump administrationâ€™s pressure to fast-track deportations and by the unwillingness of some judges to protect the rights to due process of law.</p>

          <p>A brain-dead pregnant woman in Georgia is being kept on life support to allow her fetus to develop, due to the state's abortion ban. The woman, Adriana Smith, was declared brain-dead in February, but her family says Emory doctors told them they are not allowed to stop or remove the devices that are keeping her breathing because state law bans abortion after cardiac activity can be detected. Smith's family is upset that Georgia's law doesn't allow relatives to have a say in whether a pregnant woman is kept on life support. The law was adopted in 2019 but not enforced until after Roe v. Wade was overturned in the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's "big, beautiful" package of tax breaks and spending cuts failed to advance through the House budget committee. Several Republicans argued the cuts did not go far enough and torpedoed the measure. Among the primary sticking points in the negotiations is just how much to slash from the budget bill, with several conservative congressmen demanding steeper cuts. The bill would require that states deny Medicaid coverage if able-bodied Americans using the programme are not working at least 80 hours a month or undertaking other community options from 2029.</p>
