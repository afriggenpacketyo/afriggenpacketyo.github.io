          <p>President Donald Trump and over 20 other world leaders gathered in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to sign the first phase of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. The summit, marked by a "Peace 2025" banner, included leaders from the Palestinian Authority, France, Germany, and key Arab nations, who formally endorsed the document aimed at establishing new rules for the region. Notably, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was absent from the ceremony, citing a Jewish holiday, despite having been praised by Trump in Israel's parliament just hours earlier. The agreement marks a significant diplomatic step, though many questions remain about the future governance and rebuilding of post-war Gaza.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The first phase of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas commenced with the release of the final 20 living Israeli hostages and the return of some deceased captives' remains. This exchange, which also involved Israel freeing Palestinian prisoners, prompted emotional family reunions after more than two years of captivity. In a live-update format, this article chronicles these developments, including President Trump's declaration at a peace summit that the "war in Gaza is over." However, Israeli officials noted that the return of only four bodies, instead of the agreed-upon 28, represented a failure to meet commitments, highlighting the fragility of the new agreement.</p>

          <p>South Africa's women's cricket team achieved a dramatic comeback victory against Bangladesh, winning by three wickets with just three balls to spare in the World Cup. After their top order collapsed, leaving them at 78-5 while chasing 233, half-centuries from Chloe Tryon and Marizanne Kapp revived their chances. Nadine de Klerk, who finished with an unbeaten 37, ultimately guided the team to their third consecutive win. The match was marked by several crucial dropped catches from Bangladesh, including a pivotal error in the penultimate over that gave de Klerk a second chance to secure the win for the Proteas.</p>

          <p>A former student allegedly stabbed two teachers at the Switzer Learning Center, a school for children with special needs in Torrance, California, leaving both victims in critical condition. The suspect, who has not been identified, reportedly carried out the attack on Monday morning and also threatened that he was in possession of a pipe bomb before being taken into custody by police. The motive for the attack is currently unclear, and law enforcement has established a large presence at the campus to conduct a thorough investigation. News helicopter footage from the scene showed what appeared to be a knife on the ground near the school building.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump hailed the signing of the Gaza peace agreement in Egypt as a historic achievement, declaring that "at long last, we have peace in the Middle East." During his remarks at the summit, he stated that the international community had "achieved the impossible" by brokering the deal that ended two years of conflict. The agreement's first phase saw the release of the final 20 living Israeli hostages by Hamas and a pullback of Israeli forces. Trump affirmed that mediators would now begin working on "Phase Two" of the comprehensive peace plan, signaling a shift toward reconstruction and long-term stability in the region.</p>

          <p>Human rights advocates and legal experts are expressing alarm over the increased presence of U.S. Border Patrol agents in major American cities, far from the nation's borders. The agency, traditionally focused on rural and border areas, is now a visible part of immigration enforcement in cities like Chicago and Los Angeles, leading to accusations of aggressive and constitutionally questionable tactics. Critics argue that Border Patrol agents are not trained for urban community policing and are operating under a broad legal authority that allows warrantless searches within 100 miles of any international boundary. This expansion is seen as part of the Trump administration's broader strategy to intensify deportation efforts nationwide.</p>

          <p>A 24-year-old woman, Julia Wandelt, is on trial for stalking Kate and Gerry McCann after allegedly claiming to be their missing daughter, Madeleine. Leicester Crown Court heard that Wandelt, along with a co-defendant, repeatedly contacted the McCanns between 2022 and 2025, demanding a DNA test to prove her identity. Voicemail messages played in court featured Wandelt asking, "what if I am Madeleine?" and sending childhood photos to show a supposed resemblance. The prosecution asserts that this campaign of contact, which included an in-person visit to the McCanns' home, caused the family serious alarm and distress. Both defendants deny the charges against them.</p>

          <p>A reverse mortgage allows homeowners aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash, but the ability to remain in the home indefinitely depends on meeting specific obligations. Homeowners can stay for life as long as the property remains their primary residence and they continue to pay for property taxes, homeowners insurance, and general maintenance. The loan becomes due and payable if the borrower moves out, passes away, or fails to meet these financial responsibilities, which could potentially force a sale of the home. This article clarifies that while there is no set term, the arrangement is conditional and requires careful financial planning to avoid foreclosure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the initial successes of the Gaza peace plan, including the release of hostages and prisoners, significant challenges remain for achieving lasting stability. The next phases of the U.S.-brokered deal must address contentious issues such as the postwar governance of Gaza, Israel's demand for Hamas to disarm, and Palestinian calls for statehood. While an international body is proposed to oversee a new Palestinian security force, the current Israeli government has rejected a two-state solution. The successful implementation of these later stages will depend on fragile negotiations and the ability of mediators to bridge the deep-seated distrust between Israel and Hamas.</p>

          <p>This article clarifies the specific traffic laws in Wisconsin concerning the legality of passing other vehicles on the right side. While it is generally illegal to use a paved shoulder or a designated bike lane to overtake another car, there are specific conditions under which passing on the right is permitted. These exceptions include when the vehicle ahead is making a left turn, or on a multi-lane or one-way street with sufficient unobstructed pavement. The maneuver, often called the "Milwaukee slide" by locals, is a persistent issue in the city, and illegal passing on the shoulder can result in a fine ranging from $30 to $300.</p>

          <p>New guidance for doctors, developed by researchers at King's College London, recommends simple dietary changes as a first-line treatment for constipation. The advice suggests that eating two or three kiwi fruits per day can effectively relieve symptoms, as the fruit's fiber increases stool volume and water content in the gut. Additionally, the guidance indicates that drinking mineral water, which is often high in magnesium, is more beneficial than tap water for promoting bowel movements. This research emphasizes practical, food-based solutions over immediately resorting to a complex high-fiber diet or various supplements for a condition that affects one in ten people.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview with the BBC, King Abdullah II of Jordan issued a stark warning that the Middle East is "doomed" without a peace process that leads to the creation of an independent Palestinian state. Speaking ahead of a summit in Egypt on the Gaza peace plan, the king stressed that a two-state solution is the only viable path to long-term stability for both Israelis and Palestinians. He expressed deep distrust in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but remained hopeful that progress could be made with other Israeli leaders. The king underscored the urgency of the situation, stating that peace is the only option to prevent recurrent, widespread conflict.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Debunk Three Prevalent Myths About Managing Credit Card Debt</h2>

          <p>With credit card interest rates averaging over 22%, this article addresses three common and costly myths about managing debt. The first myth is that carrying a small balance helps improve a credit score, which is false and only results in paying unnecessary interest. Another harmful misconception is that making only the minimum payment is an effective debt management strategy, when in reality it can prolong repayment for decades. Finally, the article advises against closing old credit cards, as this can negatively impact a credit score by increasing the credit utilization ratio and shortening the length of one's credit history.

          <p>Los Angeles Rams' standout rookie receiver Puka Nacua is dealing with an ankle sprain that could sideline him for the upcoming game against the Jacksonville Jaguars in London. Coach Sean McVay stated that while scans showed the injury is not long-term, Nacua's availability for Sunday is uncertain. Nacua, who currently leads the NFL with 54 catches, was injured during the second quarter of the Rams' victory over the Baltimore Ravens. The team is preparing a contingency plan in case he is unable to play, which would likely involve an expanded role for veteran receiver Davante Adams and second-year player Jordan Whittington.</p>

          <p>Exploris Expeditions & Voyages, a French-based cruise line specializing in Antarctic expeditions, has filed for Chapter 11-equivalent bankruptcy protection due to what its leadership calls a "small cash flow problem." The situation was worsened by a last-minute cancellation from a major charterer and the failure of a partnership deal that would have expanded its fleet. The company, which launched in 2022 and operates a single 144-passenger ship, will continue its operations while it seeks to restructure its finances. Despite the filing, Exploris has stated that all tours planned for the upcoming season are still scheduled to proceed. (not investment advice)</p>
