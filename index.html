          <p>Early Friday morning, Israel initiated a series of airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities and military sites, prompting a state of emergency declaration by Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the operation, dubbed "Operation Rising Lion," as a military effort to diminish the Iranian threat. Iranian state television reported the death of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander Hossein Salami in the strikes. The United States confirmed it was not involved in the unilateral action taken by Israel, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasizing the protection of American forces in the region and urging Iran not to target U.S. interests. The strikes have led to heightened tensions and market volatility. Optimism score for this article is 20.</p>

          <p>Democrats are expressing outrage after Senator Alex Padilla was forcibly removed and handcuffed by Secret Service and FBI officers during a news conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem regarding Donald Trump's immigration policies. Padilla was apprehended after attempting to ask a question about the administration's immigration crackdown in Los Angeles, which has sparked tensions and protests. Democratic leaders have condemned the incident as a violent suppression of dissent and an abuse of power, drawing comparisons to authoritarian tactics. The incident has further fueled the ongoing conflict between Democrats and the Trump administration over immigration policies and the use of federal forces to quell protests.

          <p>Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins has sent letters to California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, criticizing their handling of anti-ICE riots that led to the closure of the Los Angeles Ambulatory Care Center for five days. Collins stated that the VA made the decision to close the center after its outer walls were defaced with graffiti threatening federal immigration officials, affecting over 600 veteran appointments. He accused Newsom and Bass of prioritizing opposition to President Trump's policies over protecting Angelenos and questioned the safety of veterans benefiting from VA programs. The letter requests specific actions to restore order and demands that the city and state pay for the damages due to their lack of police presence. The optimism score is 30.</p>

          <p>In the second and final debate before the June primary, Democratic candidates vying for New York City mayor engaged in heated exchanges, particularly between former Governor Andrew Cuomo and democratic socialist assemblymember Zohran Mamdani. Cuomo attacked Mamdani's inexperience, while Mamdani criticized Cuomo's past scandals and mispronunciation of his name. Candidates also addressed the Trump administration's immigration raids in Los Angeles, with Cuomo pledging to protect immigrants and Mamdani vowing to block NYPD cooperation with federal immigration agents.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Donald Trump illegally deployed the California National Guard to suppress protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles and ordered the troops to be returned to the control of Governor Gavin Newsom. Judge Charles Breyer found that the president failed to demonstrate a "rebellion" in Los Angeles requiring federal intervention and did not properly notify the governor. Newsom praised the court's decision, stating it was a win for all Americans and a check on authoritarianism. The temporary restraining order does not affect the deployment of Marines, who the Justice Department claims are only being used to protect federal buildings and personnel.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeological research suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago, according to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). The team, including researchers from Dartmouth College and the Zhejiang Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology, analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region. The findings indicate that the domestication of Sus scrofa occurred alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles in ancient society. This challenges the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East. The optimism score is 75.</p>

          <p>Official campaigning for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election has commenced, attracting attention as a precursor to this summer's House of Councillors race. With no party holding a majority in the 127-member assembly, the focus is on whether Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party can maintain its seats amid sluggish approval ratings. Parties are utilizing social media to appeal to voters, particularly those unaffiliated. Major issues include support for households facing rising living costs, political funding scandals involving the LDP, and regional concerns such as child-rearing and measures against heat. The optimism score is 50.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are pursuing overseas expansion to ensure their long-term survival amid ongoing trade tariffs, according to executives at China's largest solar industry exhibition. Despite a temporary truce in the US-China tariff war, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the US remain subject to high tariffs. Chinese firms are diversifying their production base, with plans for overseas capacity expansion primarily in the Middle East and Africa. The industry believes that localizing production abroad is essential due to the impossibility of exporting if tariffs were to significantly increase. The optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>Approximately 45,000 grocery workers at Ralphs, Albertsons, Vons, and Pavilions stores in Southern California have authorized a strike to protest what they consider unfair labor practices. The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) locals representing these workers announced that members voted overwhelmingly in favor of authorizing their leaders to call a strike. The vote comes after contract negotiations began four months prior, with the workers' contracts expiring on March 2. Among the key issues in the negotiations are staffing levels, with the union arguing that staffing shortages have negatively impacted service and working conditions. The optimism score is 40.</p>

          <h2>Trump Orders Merger of Wildland Firefighting Forces Despite Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has directed the US government to consolidate its wildland firefighting force into a single program, despite warnings that this could be costly and disruptive. The order aims to centralize firefighting efforts currently divided among multiple agencies. Trump's proposed budget includes creating a new Federal Wildland Fire Service under the Interior Department, shifting personnel from the Forest Service. Critics argue that this restructuring could increase the risk of catastrophic fires. The order does not mention climate change, even though it exacerbates wildfires. The optimism score is 30.</p>

          <p>At the US Open, JJ Spaun leads the field at four under par, while top-ranked players Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy faced challenges at Oakmont Country Club. McIlroy finished with a four-over 74 after a strong start, while Scheffler is three over par following an uncharacteristically ragged round.
