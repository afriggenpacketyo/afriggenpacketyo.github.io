        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's export growth has slowed down for the second consecutive month due to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, with exports to the U.S. shrinking for the first time since December of the previous year, falling by 1.8%. This has narrowed Japan's trade surplus with the U.S. to 780.6 billion yen in April, compared to 846.9 billion yen in March. Experts anticipate that net exports will continue to negatively impact GDP growth in the second quarter, leading the central bank to potentially delay its next interest rate hike until there is more clarity on U.S. tariffs.

          <p>A federal judge expressed concerns that the Trump administration may have violated a court order by deporting migrants to countries where they could face danger. The judge, Brian E. Murphy, held a tumultuous hearing after immigration lawyers reported that a deportation flight was headed to South Sudan, a violence-plagued country. Trump officials initially could not provide the flight's destination, claiming it was classified information, but later stated that one migrant was returned to Myanmar instead of South Sudan. The judge warned that officials involved in the deportations could face criminal sanctions, adding to the ongoing legal clashes between the Trump administration and the judicial system over immigration policies. </p>

          <p>The Justice Department has launched an investigation into former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo regarding his testimony to Congress during the COVID-19 pandemic. This investigation follows accusations that Cuomo lied to Congress about his involvement in drafting a 2020 state report on nursing home deaths. Congressional Republicans have been pressing the Justice Department to investigate Cuomo for months, alleging he was involved in editing the report but testified that he was not, potentially violating a law against making false statements to Congress. The investigation comes months after the DOJ dropped charges against current New York City Mayor Eric Adams, one of Cuomo's rivals in the upcoming election.</p>

          <p>A fifth inmate who escaped from a New Orleans jail last week has been captured, leaving five still at large. Corey Boyd, 19, who faces charges including second-degree murder, was taken into custody, but details of his capture were not immediately provided. Ten inmates broke out of the jail on Friday, exploiting a breach in a cell wall and a lapse in security. A maintenance worker at the jail has been arrested on allegations he helped the inmates escape, and the sheriff's office is seeking additional funds to upgrade faulty locks.</p>

          <p>A health report commissioned by President Trump, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has sparked concern within the agriculture industry.

Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith cautioned Mr. Kennedy against interfering with farmers' livelihoods by suggesting pesticides are unsafe.

          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to push for support of a budget package containing his legislative priorities, but faced resistance from dueling factions within the party.
