          <p>Edan Alexander, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen, has been released by Hamas after being held hostage in Gaza for over 19 months, marking a significant development amid ongoing conflict. The release was facilitated through mediation efforts, primarily involving the U.S., and occurred just before President Trump's scheduled visit to the Middle East. Hamas portrayed the release as a goodwill gesture aimed at fostering a broader ceasefire agreement, although Israel stated it made no concessions for the release. Alexander, who was serving in the Israeli military when abducted, grew up in New Jersey and moved to Israel after high school. His release highlights the complexities of hostage negotiations and the involvement of multiple international actors in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>Six Bulgarian nationals have been sentenced to prison in the U.K. for their involvement in a Russian spy ring that conducted surveillance and intelligence operations across Europe. The spies, motivated by money, used sophisticated gadgets and covert communications to target individuals and places of interest to the Russian state, including investigative journalists and Russian dissidents. The operation, directed by an alleged Russian agent, involved plots such as abductions and the collection of mobile phone data. The sentences reflect the severity of their actions, which were described as a real threat to national security and democratic values.</p>

          <p>A group of white South Africans has arrived in the U.S. after being granted refugee status, sparking debate and criticism. The Trump administration expedited their applications, citing alleged persecution of Afrikaners, a claim disputed by South Africa's government and some experts. The resettlement has raised concerns about preferential treatment compared to other asylum seekers and strained relations between the U.S. and South Africa, particularly regarding land reform policies and accusations of racial discrimination. The BBC has confirmed that the UNHCR was not involved in this resettlement scheme, showing how much the white Afrikaners have been fast-tracked and in a way that has not been done for others.</p>

          <p>The UK government is grappling with persistent high levels of immigration despite repeated pledges to reduce numbers, with Prime Minister Starmer promising tighter border controls. The article examines the measures set out by the government and the challenges ahead. While work visa applications, particularly in health and social care, have decreased due to tightened rules, overall net migration remains significantly high. The government's plan to wean the economy off cheap overseas labor faces hurdles, particularly in sectors like social care where low pay deters British workers. The impact of reduced overseas student numbers on university finances and the need for increased skills training for domestic workers also present significant challenges.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense has spent over $21 million on flights to Guantanamo Bay in support of the Trump administration's migrant deportation efforts. These flights transported migrants to the facility, which was designated as a holding site for "worst" offenders. The revelation has sparked outrage, with critics condemning the use of military resources for political purposes and raising concerns about the broad rules allowing non-criminal detainees to be held at Guantanamo Bay. The costs include 46 flights totaling 802 hours, averaging $26,277 per flight hour.</p>

The injury occurred during Leinster's Investec Champions Cup semi-final defeat to Northampton on May 3. Doris was also left out of the British and Irish Lions squad for this summer's tour of Australia by head coach Andy Farrell. The back row could now also be a doubt for Ireland's series of autumn matches against New Zealand, Japan, Australia and South Africa in November.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at lowering U.S. drug prices by forcing drug companies to match the lower prices paid in other developed countries. The order proposes multiple approaches, including directing the U.S. Trade Representative and Department of Commerce to take action against policies that lower drug prices abroad. The administration is threatening to directly tie drug prices paid by government programs like Medicare to those paid in other countries if drugmakers don't comply voluntarily. The executive order has faced criticism from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues it would harm innovation.</p>

          <p>Germany has implemented stricter border controls to curb irregular immigration, ordering asylum seekers without valid entry documents to be turned away. The new policy is based on Chancellor Merz's pledge to tighten border controls and aims to prevent migrants from attempting to reach Germany. The legal basis for the refusals is controversial, as it potentially breaches European law mandating the determination of which country is responsible for the migrant's asylum application. German neighbors Poland and Switzerland have expressed concern about Germany's actions.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party in the UK has unveiled its immigration plans, focusing on tightening work visa requirements, increasing residency waits for indefinite leave to remain, and scrapping the dedicated care visa. The plans aim to reduce net migration by tightening work visa requirements for some and loosening them for others. The government says firms in sectors deemed to rely too much on overseas workers will be "expected to comply" with strategies to boost workplace skills. The prime minister said the government wants to "significantly" reduce net migration - the number of people coming to the UK minus those leaving - from the record levels it has reached in recent years.</p>
