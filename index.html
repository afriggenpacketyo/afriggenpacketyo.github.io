          <p>IBM announced first-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analysts' forecasts, with revenue increasing slightly to $14.54 billion. The company maintained its full-year outlook for $13.5 billion in free cash flow and 5% revenue growth at constant currency. While net income declined compared to the previous year, software revenue saw a 7% increase, driven by growth in hybrid cloud software. IBM also settled lawsuits with GlobalFoundries and completed the acquisition of HashiCorp during the quarter, but the stock slipped in extended trading due to customer prioritization of efficient spending.

          <p>Southwest Airlines announced plans to cut flights in the latter half of the year, citing concerns over weakening domestic bookings and macroeconomic uncertainty. The airline expects unit revenue to remain flat or decrease by up to 4% in the second quarter, and it's holding off on updating its full-year guidance. Despite these adjustments, Southwest's first-quarter earnings and revenue exceeded analysts' expectations, reporting a smaller-than-expected loss per share and higher-than-anticipated revenue.

          <p>Former President Trump criticized Ukrainian President Zelenskyy for his refusal to accept Russian control of Crimea, claiming it harms peace negotiations and prolongs the conflict. This comes as Vice President JD Vance outlined a US vision for a deal that would freeze territorial lines and require both Ukraine and Russia to cede some territory, an idea Zelenskyy rejected as unconstitutional. The US is intensifying its efforts to broker a deal, with officials pulling out of a London meeting to focus on talks in Moscow. Russia has also intensified its attacks on Ukraine after a brief lull, further complicating the situation.</p>

          <p>A coalition of a dozen states has filed a lawsuit against President Trump and his administration, challenging the legality of his newly imposed tariffs on foreign imports. The lawsuit argues that the president lacks the authority to arbitrarily impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The states contend that Trump's actions disrupt the constitutional order and harm the American economy, as tariffs are essentially taxes passed on to consumers. The suit seeks a court order declaring the tariffs unlawful and preventing their enforcement.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's proposed plan to end the war in Ukraine is being criticized as effectively rewarding Russia for its aggression and war crimes. The plan, which involves lifting sanctions, accepting a cease-fire with Russian troops on Ukrainian territory, and recognizing Crimea as part of Russia, would leave Ukraine vulnerable and cede control over its foreign policy. Critics argue that Trump is acting as a proxy for Putin, and that the proposed deal is an instrument of surrender that the Ukrainians are unlikely to accept. The US has threatened to walk away if either side refuses Trump's deal.</p>
