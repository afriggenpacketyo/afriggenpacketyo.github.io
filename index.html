        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Southern Small White butterfly, a species native to Southern Europe, has been sighted in the United Kingdom for the first time, marking a significant northward expansion. A volunteer photographed the butterfly at the Landguard Nature Reserve in Suffolk, confirming a trend that has seen the species spread across Europe at a rate of about 62 miles per year. While a warming climate is considered a contributing factor, experts note this expansion is happening much faster than models predicted. Whether the species will establish a permanent breeding population in the UK remains uncertain, as its primary food source is not widely available.</p>

          <p>Two Pennsylvania State Police troopers are in stable condition after being shot in what authorities described as an ambush in Susquehanna County. The suspect, who had earlier killed a woman at the scene, was armed with a rifle and was killed by police after a standoff. The incident, which also resulted in an injury to a responding EMT, is part of a rising trend of ambush attacks on law enforcement. Governor Josh Shapiro praised the troopers for their bravery, noting one likely saved his partner's life by applying tourniquets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has directed the Department of Commerce to develop a census methodology that would exclude undocumented immigrants from the population count used for congressional apportionment. The U.S. Constitution mandates a decennial census to count all persons, which determines the number of congressional seats each state receives. While the Trump administration's previous attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census was blocked by the Supreme Court, this new directive reopens the contentious issue. Critics argue such a change would lead to a significant undercount of minority populations and manipulate political representation.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly called for the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, labeling him as "highly conflicted" in a social media post. This demand follows a letter from Senator Tom Cotton that raised concerns about Tan's investment ties to Chinese companies, including some allegedly linked to the Chinese military. The senator's letter specifically mentioned Tan's tenure as CEO of Cadence Design Systems, which recently pleaded guilty to illegal exports to a Chinese military university. Intel's stock experienced a decline following the president's statement, which adds pressure on the semiconductor giant.</p>

          <p>The Aalborg Zoo in Denmark has sparked public outrage and criticism from PETA after announcing a program that encourages people to donate unwanted pets like rabbits and guinea pigs. The zoo stated that the donated animals would be humanely euthanized and used as feed for its predatory animals, such as the Eurasian lynx, to replicate their natural diet. In its announcement, the zoo argued this practice ensures natural behavior and proper nutrition for its predators, asserting that nothing goes to waste. PETA condemned the initiative, arguing there is nothing natural about feeding captive predators with domesticated companion animals.</p>

          <p>A boil water advisory remains in effect for parts of Malibu after a water main was disrupted during bridge construction work at Solstice Creek. The restoration of the water supply was delayed when concrete unexpectedly blocked the pipeline, according to the California Department of Transportation. Crews have since completed repairs and are now in the process of re-pressurizing and testing the water system for contaminants.

          <p>Records from Las Vegas police reveal that the man responsible for a recent fatal shooting in New York had a known history of mental illness, including two emergency psychiatric holds. Despite these incidents and his mother's reports of him being suicidal, he was still able to legally purchase the AR-15-style rifle used in the attack. Experts explain that under Nevada law, temporary mental health holds are not automatically reported to the national background check system unless they result in a court-ordered involuntary commitment. This case highlights the gaps in existing gun laws and the varying effectiveness of "red flag" laws across different states.</p>

          <p>Newly released court documents reveal that Erin Patterson, recently convicted of murdering three relatives with poisoned mushrooms, had also allegedly made multiple attempts to kill her estranged husband, Simon Patterson. The allegations, which were previously suppressed, claim she tried to poison him with various foods, including cookies she said their daughter had baked. One such attempt reportedly left him in a coma for weeks. These charges of attempted murder against her husband were ultimately dropped before the trial, but his testimony details a long-term pattern of suspected poisonings that he had begun to document.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly millennials and Gen Z, are moving away from dating apps in favor of old-fashioned, in-person singles events. Companies like Date Cincy are capitalizing on this trend, organizing gatherings for individuals tired of the impersonal nature of swiping and seeking face-to-face connections. According to Eventbrite, attendance at such events rose by 42% last year, reflecting a desire for more authentic interactions that cannot be replicated online.

The administration argues the ban severely hampers its ability to enforce immigration laws in the nation's most populous judicial district. Civil rights groups counter that lifting the ban would essentially authorize racial profiling by federal agents.</p>

With criminal gangs controlling most of the capital, Saint-Cyr emphasized that restoring state authority is the top priority and called for international partners to bolster a U.N.-backed security mission.

          <p>Travel companies in the United Kingdom are observing a distinct shift in holiday booking patterns, with Britons increasingly opting for shorter, last-minute trips closer to home. Firms like Booking.com and Airbnb report a surge in spontaneous domestic getaways, a trend attributed to both cost-saving measures and a desire to take advantage of favorable weather. Campsite booking sites have seen a quarter of reservations made with just two days' notice. This "later, closer, shorter" approach reflects how economic pressures and a preference for convenience are reshaping the UK's domestic tourism landscape.</p>

This move is part of President Trump's intensified focus on arresting and deporting undocumented migrants, which has seen the use of military resources and bases for immigration enforcement.

With a slim GOP majority in the U.S. House, creating more favorable districts in states where the party has full control of government is seen as a key strategy to maintain or expand their power.</p>

          <p>China's leading semiconductor manufacturers, such as SMIC and Hua Hong Semiconductor, are not expected to be significantly impacted by President Trump's proposed 100% tariff on imported chips, according to research from CLSA. The analysis suggests that the direct impact will be small, partly because Chinese firms have been diversifying their exports to other regions like Southeast Asia. In the first half of 2025, China's chip exports to the U.S. had already declined by 11% year-on-year. The report also notes that these companies could potentially benefit from retaliatory measures from China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's public demand for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign over alleged ties to China has sent shockwaves through the tech industry.

This move puts intense pressure on Intel, a recipient of billions in U.S. government funding to rebuild domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Analysts suggest the president may be using the controversy as leverage in negotiations over Intel's U.S. investment plans.</p>
