          <p>Ben Roberts-Smith, Australia's most-decorated living soldier, lost his appeal against a defamation judgement that found allegations he committed war crimes were true. The articles alleged that Roberts-Smith murdered four unarmed Afghans while deployed in Afghanistan between 2009 and 2012, claims he denied. The civil trial, dubbed "the trial of the century," assessed war crimes claims against Australian forces for the first time, with the court ultimately upholding the original verdict. Roberts-Smith maintains his innocence, although the articles published in 2018, when he was considered a national hero, have ruined his life, he said.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers initiated a strike after failing to reach an agreement with the agency regarding pay raises. The union, representing approximately 460 members, has been at odds with NJ Transit for five years, demanding wage increases. NJ Transit President Kris Kolluri emphasized the need for a fiscally responsible deal, as the agency has to consider the needs of New Jersey commuters and taxpayers. The strike will disrupt the commutes of tens of thousands of riders, and Gov. Phil Murphy said he may declare a state of emergency.</p>

Comey deleted the post, stating he did not realize the numbers were associated with violence and that he opposes violence of any kind.

          <p>Lawyers are increasingly seeking out federal jurisdictions with sympathetic judges to address divisive political issues, a practice known as venue shopping. Conservatives often file cases in small Texas federal courts, ensuring rulings from Republican appointees, while liberals favor venues in the 9th Circuit and Massachusetts. The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single federal judge should have the power to dictate policy for the entire country through nationwide injunctions. The trend erodes confidence in the courts and politicizes the judicial process, according to some legal experts.</p>

Ventura acknowledged her love for Combs but testified that his personality changed over time, becoming violent and jealous.

NYU said it "strongly denounces" and was "deeply sorry" for Rozos' remarks, claiming he abused the privilege of speaking. The college spokesman said Rozos' diploma would be withheld while NYU pursued disciplinary action against him. Rozos' speech condemned the atrocities in Palestine, drawing cheers and some boos.</p>

These horses undertook multiple migrations between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago, with genetic exchanges occurring in both directions.

          <p>The US Supreme Court justices took issue with Donald Trump’s attempt to sidestep the constitution to limit birthright citizenship, in a trio of immigration cases that could reshape presidential power and the role of federal courts. The cases before the court stem from the president’s January executive order that would deny US citizenship to babies born on American soil if their parents aren’t citizens or permanent residents. The court is mulling whether there is some weight to the justice department’s argument that “nationwide injunctions” often issued by federal judges unfairly tie the president’s hands.</p>
