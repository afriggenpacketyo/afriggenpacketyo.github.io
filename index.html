          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell advised Princeton's Class of 2025 to safeguard their integrity, especially amidst ongoing criticism from President Trump. Powell highlighted the importance of maintaining honor and respect, emphasizing that one's life matters to loved ones and that personal integrity is paramount. He noted that Trump's demands to lower interest rates have no effect on the Federal Open Market Committee's operations. The Fed will continue to prioritize maximum employment and price stability based solely on economic data and outlook. </p>

This statement comes amid White House suggestions that the two leaders might speak this week, following stalled trade discussions. Trump accused China of violating a trade agreement reached in Switzerland on May 12, citing China's failure to ease restrictions on rare earths exports. China, in turn, criticized the U.S. for limiting China's access to advanced technology and revoking visas for Chinese students. (not investment advice)</p>

Key projects include tram extensions in Greater Manchester and the West Midlands, as well as the start of the West Yorkshire Mass Transit programme.

          <p>The United States has doubled its tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%, a move that has significant implications for global trade. While most European exporters will be heavily affected, the United Kingdom has been granted a temporary exemption, maintaining a 25% tariff.

          <p>Tesla reported a significant rebound in Australian electric vehicle sales in May, reaching their highest level in nearly 12 months. This surge was primarily driven by record sales of the revamped Model Y compact SUV, which saw a 122.5% year-over-year increase. Despite this positive performance, Tesla's overall sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared to the same period last year. Globally, Tesla has faced challenges due to increased competition and reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk's political activities, but Australia stands out as a bright spot.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the Navy to rename the USNS Harvey Milk, a ship named after the slain gay rights activist and Korean War veteran. The decision, described as aligning with President Trump's objective to "re-establish the warrior culture," has sparked controversy. Critics, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, have condemned the move as a surrender of American values and a display of contempt for veterans. The ship, christened in 2021, was intended to honor LGBTQ community leaders who served in the Navy.</p>

          <p>Approximately 20,000 residents were evacuated from Cologne's city center as experts worked to defuse three unexploded World War II bombs. The operation, one of the largest of its kind in the city, involved closing off large areas, including the old city, hotels, care homes, and Rhine bridges. The bombs, manufactured in the US, were discovered in the Deutz district. Cologne was heavily targeted during World War II, making bomb defusals a common occurrence.</p>
