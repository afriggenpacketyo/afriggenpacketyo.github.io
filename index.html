Previous attempts to translate US late-night shows to the UK have struggled, but the sketch format is well-suited to social media and could find a new audience.</p>

            <p>Women in Russian-occupied Ukraine share their experiences of repression, fear, and resistance. They face restrictions on language, traditions, and movement, with some being denied healthcare for refusing Russian passports. The women describe an atmosphere of suspicion and surveillance, with underground resistance groups distributing leaflets.
