          <p>The Trump administration has delayed the implementation of higher tariffs on imports from 14 countries, including Japan and South Korea, pushing the effective date from July 9 to August 1. President Trump announced plans for new rates, such as a 25% tax on Japanese and South Korean goods, via letters to world leaders, noting the rates could be adjusted. This move extends a 90-day pause on some of the administration's most aggressive trade actions. The administration argues tariffs protect American industries, but economists warn they could raise consumer prices and harm international trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have decided against pursuing legal action against individuals who participated in the city's prohibited Pride parade in late June. The decision alleviates fears that participants could face fines and organizers, including Budapest's liberal mayor Gergely Karacsony, could face prison time. Despite a government ban under Prime Minister Viktor Orban's anti-LGBTQ+ agenda, the event drew a record crowd of over 200,000 people. The mayor had declared the parade an official municipal event to circumvent the state-level prohibition.</p>

          <p>Nearly 600 tech founders and executives have signed an open letter demanding that venture capital firm Sequoia Capital denounce controversial comments made by partner Shaun Maguire. Maguire, a supporter of President Trump, posted on social media that New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani "comes from a culture that lies about everything" and is pursuing an "Islamist agenda." The letter calls for a public apology, an independent investigation into Maguire's conduct, and a zero-tolerance policy on hate speech. Sequoia has declined to comment on the matter.</p>

          <p>Former New York Knicks player Derrick Rose has shared insights into Tom Thibodeau's mindset following his dismissal as the team's head coach. Rose, who has a long history playing under Thibodeau, mentioned that he spoke with his former coach and found him to be in good spirits. He noted that while the firing was surprising, Thibodeau is set to receive a substantial $30 million buyout. The Knicks, who made the playoffs in four of Thibodeau's five seasons, have since hired Mike Brown as their new head coach.</p>

          <p>A report from the chief inspector of prisons warns that a massive flow of drugs into prisons across England and Wales is critically destabilizing the system and undermining rehabilitation efforts. Criminal gangs are reportedly using drones to smuggle contraband to inmates, who are often bored due to overcrowding and staff shortages. The report found that criminality is rampant in many facilities, with inexperienced staff unable to control the situation. A prisoner survey revealed that 39% found it easy to obtain drugs, posing a significant threat to safety and security.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from cutting off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. The ruling freezes a provision within the recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" that targeted organizations primarily involved in family planning and reproductive health that also provide abortions. Planned Parenthood argued in its lawsuit that the law was an unconstitutional attempt to single out the organization. The group warned that losing federal funding would force the closure of health centers, particularly in underserved areas, and disrupt access to non-abortion services.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flooding in central Texas has led to intense scrutiny of the emergency warning systems and the National Weather Service's (NWS) preparedness. Survivors and local officials have stated the disaster, which caused the Guadalupe River to rise over 20 feet in an hour, came with little effective warning. Questions are being raised about why a more robust alert system was not in place in the flood-prone area and whether staffing shortages at local NWS offices affected forecasting accuracy. While the White House defended the NWS, critics point to budget cuts and vacancies as potential contributing factors to the tragedy.</p>

          <p>The deadly flash floods in Texas serve as a stark warning for California, which faces similar risks from extreme weather events, according to experts. California's topography, with its hilly terrain and numerous rivers, makes it susceptible to the same kind of rapid and destructive flooding. Climate scientists note that while California's floods are often driven by different weather patterns like atmospheric rivers, the catastrophic impacts could be replicated, especially as climate change increases the intensity of storms. Past events in Los Angeles, Montecito, and the Central Valley highlight the state's vulnerability to such disasters.</p>

          <p>The government of El Salvador has informed a United Nations working group that the United States holds legal responsibility for over 200 migrants sent to its CECOT mega-prison. This claim contradicts the Trump administration's position that it cannot retrieve the migrants because they are under Salvadoran authority. The migrants, mostly Venezuelans accused of gang ties, were deported under the Alien Enemies Act as part of a deal with El Salvador. In its report, El Salvador stated its role was limited to facilitating the use of its prison infrastructure for individuals detained under the U.S. justice system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Six months after major wildfires, California Governor Gavin Newsom called for $40 billion in federal recovery funding while also delivering a sharp critique of the Trump administration. Newsom condemned the recent deployment of federal immigration agents in Los Angeles's MacArthur Park as a "disgrace" and proof of President Trump's "polluted heart." This places him in the difficult position of criticizing the Republican-led administration and Congress from whom he is requesting vital disaster aid. He argued that the immigration raids could disrupt the state's construction workforce, which is essential for rebuilding fire-ravaged communities.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats have introduced an amendment to the UK's Football Governance Bill that would require at least 10 Premier League games per season to be broadcast on free-to-air television. The proposal also includes making the League Cup Final and the major English Football League play-off finals freely available to the public. The party argues that the "jewel in the crown of British football" has been locked behind expensive paywalls for too long, citing the high cost of subscription packages for fans. The government's Sports Minister has previously expressed reluctance to have the new football regulator intervene in commercial broadcast deals.</p>

          <p>The small Australian town of Korumburra is grappling with the aftermath of a notorious murder case, after a jury found resident Erin Patterson guilty of murdering three family members with toxic mushrooms. The victims, Don and Gail Patterson and Gail's sister Heather Wilkinson, were well-known and beloved members of the tight-knit community. The 10-week trial brought unwelcome global attention to the region, which locals say has been difficult for the grieving community. Residents are now hoping for closure and a return to normalcy after the tragedy turned their quiet town into a subject of pop culture intrigue.</p>

          <p>Guizhou, historically one of China's poorest provinces, is aiming to play a key role in the country's national economic strategy amidst ongoing trade tensions. Provincial leaders are leveraging the "strategic hinterland strategy," a concept introduced in late 2023 as part of the nation's 2026-2030 development plan. The goal is to utilize the province's comparative advantages to serve the broader national interest, effectively turning inland regions into secure and vital economic zones. This initiative is part of a larger effort to reshape China's industrial and economic landscape in response to external pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to ban employers from using non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to silence victims of workplace sexual misconduct, harassment, or discrimination. An amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will render any such confidentiality clauses void, allowing workers to speak out about their experiences. The move follows years of campaigning by activists like Zelda Perkins, who broke her NDA to speak out against Harvey Weinstein. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated it was time to "stamp this practice out," bringing the UK in line with other countries that have enacted similar protections for workers.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of people marched in Mexico City to protest against rising rents and gentrification, which they attribute to the influx of foreigners, particularly American remote workers. The demonstration, held on U.S. Independence Day, included signs like "gringo go home" and saw some protesters vandalize storefronts. The city has become a popular destination for "digital nomads" due to its lower cost of living, but locals complain this has priced them out of their neighborhoods. While Mexican leaders condemned the xenophobic tone and vandalism, they acknowledged that gentrification is a legitimate issue that needs to be addressed.</p>
