Speaking from his Turning Point USA office, she attributed his killing to his patriotic and faith-based message, thanking law enforcement, Vice President JD Vance, and Donald Trump for their support. Despite his polarizing views on issues like transgender rights and immigration, Mrs. Kirk pledged to continue his college campus tour and urged young people to join his cause, framing the struggle as primarily spiritual.</p>

          <p>China's instant commerce market is rapidly evolving, driven by intense competition between tech giants like Alibaba and Meituan, which are offering consumers extensive promotional subsidies and swift deliveries. Services have expanded significantly beyond food, now including high-value items such as Apple's new iPhone 17 models, with promises of delivery in as little as 30 minutes. This aggressive rivalry, characterized by heavy subsidies and a sharpened focus on efficiency, is fundamentally transforming China's retail landscape. It blurs the lines between online platforms and traditional bricks-and-mortar stores, aiming to capture market share and redefine consumer expectations for speed and convenience in online shopping.

          <p>The Connecticut Republican Party has strongly accused Bill Beckert, a Democratic state education official and Farmington Board of Education Chairman, of celebrating Charlie Kirk's murder. The accusation is based on a social media repost by Beckert that read, "They Reap What They Sow." State GOP Chairman Ben Proto condemned this action as "grotesque" and a "betrayal of values every educator and public servant should embody," interpreting it as an endorsement of political violence. This incident underscores the deep partisan divisions and heated rhetoric surrounding Kirk's assassination, prompting calls for public officials to demonstrate restraint and decency in their online expressions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is facing mounting pressure after initially defending Lord Mandelson, who was subsequently sacked as UK ambassador to the US, despite officials reportedly knowing about supportive emails between Mandelson and paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The BBC understands that both No 10 and the Foreign Office were aware of media inquiries detailing the messages before Starmer's public defense. Mandelson's emails, later published, revealed strong expressions of support for Epstein, leading to his dismissal by Downing Street which cited "new information." This incident has sparked significant criticism of Starmer's judgment and raised questions about the transparency of the appointment process within the government.</p>

          <p>Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, a leader of the Belarusian opposition, claims that dozens of political prisoners released by Belarus this week were forcibly deported, not genuinely freed. The release of 52 prisoners was part of a US-brokered deal to lift sanctions on Belarus' national airline. While some ex-prisoners thanked former US President Donald Trump for the deal, others expressed a desire to remain in Belarus, with many nearing the end of their sentences. Tsikhanouskaya, living in exile, urged Western governments to demand that President Lukashenko allow political prisoners to stay in their home country, highlighting the complex nature of the "freedom" granted.</p>

          <p>Missouri state lawmakers have successfully passed a Republican-backed plan to redraw the state's congressional maps, a move that could potentially add another GOP-leaning House seat. The plan, which now heads to Governor Mike Kehoe's desk for signing, aims to transform the state's current 6-2 Republican-Democratic House delegation into a 7-1 split by making a long-held Democratic district more conservative. This effort aligns with a nationwide redistricting push championed by former President Trump to strengthen Republican majorities. However, opponents, including the ACLU of Missouri, have swiftly filed a legal challenge, arguing the new map is unconstitutional, rushed, and designed to dilute the voting power of Kansas City's Black and white residents along racial lines.</p>

          <p>A new study from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health has revealed a significant link between experiences of stalking or obtaining restraining orders and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women. Researchers analyzed data from approximately 66,270 American nurses over two decades, finding that women who experienced stalking had a 41% higher risk of CVD, while those who obtained restraining orders faced a 70% higher risk. This association remained strong even after adjusting for traditional risk factors, underscoring the profound impact of violence on women's heart health. The article suggests these findings could lead to doctors incorporating questions about such experiences into future heart health screenings to improve women's overall well-being.</p>

A CBS News analysis identified numerous instances where X's AI chatbot, Grok, misidentified the suspect and generated contradictory or incorrect information, even falsely stating Kirk was still alive. Other AI services, including Perplexity and Google's AI Overview, also provided inaccurate details, underscoring the challenges generative AI faces in delivering accurate information during rapidly unfolding events.

          <p>This article analyzes Charlie Kirk's significant influence in mobilizing younger voters, particularly young men, which contributed to Donald Trump's 2024 presidential election victory. Kirk's organization, Turning Point USA, was instrumental in engaging this demographic, traditionally dominated by Democrats, by leveraging social media and targeted outreach. Experts note Kirk's ability to project strength and masculinity resonated with many, even if they disagreed with his views. His "Ballot Chasers" program in battleground states also played a crucial role in getting low-propensity Trump supporters to vote, earning him direct credit from the former president for helping to secure the win.</p>

This elevated valuation is largely driven by intense AI optimism and high expectations for future earnings, with other metrics like the 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio also reaching near dot-com era highs.

          <p>This article argues that the online discourse following Charlie Kirk's assassination immediately devolved into finger-pointing, rage bait, and conspiracy theories, highlighting a fundamental problem with the algorithmic internet. In the absence of facts, the online "justification machine" rapidly rearranges information to fit preset narratives, often fueled by a desire for certainty. The article notes how initial speculation about the killer's ideology was quickly debunked by emerging details about Tyler Robinson's background and the nihilistic, trollish inscriptions on his bullet casings. It suggests that many shooters use online communities as a stage for violence, bringing networked chaos into reality.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Moves to End EPA Greenhouse Gas Tracking Program</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 19:26:35 EDT</div>

          <p>The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to terminate a federal program that tracks greenhouse gas emissions, including methane and carbon dioxide, from over 8,000 industrial facilities. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated this move aims to save American businesses $2.4 billion in regulatory costs and streamline operations, asserting it complies with the Clean Air Act. However, environmental and health experts strongly warn that ending the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program would prevent the public from accessing crucial climate pollution data, thereby hindering informed policy decisions and public health protection. Critics argue this decision aligns with broader efforts to cut climate research and makes it significantly harder to assess environmental and economic impacts.</p>

Astin secured 79% of the votes, succeeding Fran Drescher, who famously led the union through a 118-day strike in 2023. He assumes leadership at a critical time, as the entertainment industry grapples with significant challenges including consolidation, productions moving overseas, and the growing impact of artificial intelligence. Astin, whose mother Patty Duke was also a past president, expressed his determination to secure a fair deal in upcoming contract negotiations, advocating for a moderate approach and emphasizing the importance of avoiding strikes as a last resort.</p>

          <p>A new report from US House Republicans is escalating scrutiny of US-China academic partnerships, identifying dozens of joint institutes and degree programs as "high-risk." These collaborations, which include partnerships between New York University and East China Normal University, and Johns Hopkins University and Tsinghua University, are deemed problematic due to their potential links to China's military and technological modernization. Congressman John Moolenaar, chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, explicitly stated, "These partnerships must end." This move reflects growing concerns in Washington about academic ties that could inadvertently advance Beijing's defense or intelligence objectives, prompting a reevaluation of educational cooperation between the two nations.</p>

          <p>England opener Phil Salt has boldly declared his ambition to become the "best in the world" as a T20 opener, following his record-breaking unbeaten 141 off just 60 balls against South Africa. His sensational century, achieved in a mere 39 deliveries, shattered Liam Livingstone's previous England record and propelled his team to a historic T20I total of 304-2. Salt's aggressive approach from the very first ball, which included 23 boundaries and eight sixes, set the dominant tone for England's decisive 146-run victory, leveling the series. His performance exemplified a unique blend of staying at the crease while maintaining an exceptionally high strike-rate, a skill he has continuously refined throughout his career.</p>

          <p>Controversial artist Andres Serrano discusses his decision to photograph Jeffrey Epstein in 2019, four months before Epstein's death, and Donald Trump in 2004. Serrano, known for provocative works like "Piss Christ," states he photographed Epstein for a sculpture he desired, describing the financier as "uninteresting" except for being a paedophile. He also shares insights into photographing Trump, whom he found "fascinating" and "persistent," collecting over 1,000 Trump-related items for an art installation. Serrano's article provides a unique perspective on these high-profile figures, and he believes the Epstein story will eventually fade, much like the Kennedy assassination conspiracies.</p>

          <p>This article offers a stark glimpse into the fear experienced by undocumented immigrants in Trump's America, focusing on "Luz," a Mexican woman living in a DC suburb. Luz, who has been in the US for 17 years, describes being afraid to leave her home, drive her child to school, or be detained by ICE agents. The article highlights the increased frequency of early morning ICE raids, where individuals are apprehended without warrants, often based solely on their inability to prove legal status on demand. Despite having jobs, paying taxes, and contributing to society, many like Luz, who have established lives in the US, now face the constant threat of deportation, forcing them to consider leaving everything behind.</p>

          <p>This article reviews "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues," finding that the sequel to the iconic 1984 mockumentary struggles to recapture its predecessor's satirical magic. While the original brilliantly ridiculed rock's excesses and industry comebacks, the follow-up suffers from the band's newfound reverence, including cameos from music legends like Paul McCartney and Elton John, which undermines the comedy of outsider tension. Although there are agreeable moments exploring the trio's solo lives, the film often feels like an extended outtake reel rather than a fresh take. Despite some improvisational charm from the leads, the review suggests the movie is a nostalgia lap that doesn't quite hit "11."</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with terminating legal protections for approximately 430,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. This decision by the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals marks a victory for the administration, which announced in March its intent to revoke these humanitarian parole protections. Plaintiffs, including affected migrants, argue that this mass revocation—dubbed the "largest mass illegalization event in modern American history"—inflicts irreparable harm on individuals. They face the difficult choice of leaving the country or being separated from their families, communities, and lawful employment. The ruling allows the termination to proceed while the broader lawsuit continues to play out.</p>

          <p>The federal government has initiated a lawsuit against Uber, alleging widespread discrimination against passengers with disabilities, including those who travel with service dogs. The Department of Justice claims that Uber drivers routinely refuse to serve disabled individuals, impose illegal cleaning fees for service animal shedding, and charge cancellation fees following service denials. These alleged actions have reportedly caused disabled individuals to miss appointments, experience significant delays, and become stranded in adverse weather conditions. Uber, while stating it prohibits such discrimination and takes action against non-compliant drivers, expressed disagreement with the lawsuit's allegations. The Justice Department is seeking $125 million for affected individuals and aims to end this persistent discriminatory practice.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have successfully passed Senate Bill 79, a landmark housing bill designed to significantly increase housing density near transit hubs by overriding existing local zoning laws. Introduced by Senator Scott Wiener, the bill permits taller, denser housing—up to nine stories—adjacent to and within a half-mile of various transit corridors, including heavy and light rail lines, and bus routes. Proponents argue these drastic measures are essential to address the state's severe housing shortage and affordability crisis. Conversely, critics claim the blanket mandate constitutes an overreach, stripping local authorities of their ability to promote responsible growth and potentially disproportionately affecting lower-priced neighborhoods. The controversial bill now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom's signature.</p>
