          <p>South Korea's GDP experienced a 0.1% year-on-year contraction in the first quarter of 2025, marking its first decline since 2020, largely due to a sharp fall in construction activity. This contraction, which missed Reuters' expectations, is attributed to prolonged political uncertainties following the impeachment trials of the former president and prime minister, coupled with ongoing trade war turmoil impacting exports. The Bank of Korea had previously warned of slower GDP growth and has held interest rates steady amidst these challenges. Trade talks are underway with the U.S. to address tariffs on steel and automobiles, critical exports for South Korea.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the Trump administration sees "an opportunity for a big deal" with China on trade, suggesting a possible easing of the tariff war. Bessent emphasized the need for China to shift away from export-led manufacturing growth and for the U.S. to rebalance towards more manufacturing. He also critiqued the IMF and World Bank, urging them to focus on economic stability and growth rather than lending volume. Bessent's comments followed news that the administration is considering slashing tariffs on China to de-escalate tensions.</p>

          <p>CEOs from Walmart and Target privately cautioned President Trump that his tariff policies could disrupt supply chains and lead to empty shelves. They warned that tariffs could lead to higher prices for consumers, particularly on goods imported from China and Mexico. The Trump administration has imposed substantial tariffs on Chinese goods and other countries, prompting concerns about rising consumer prices and slower economic growth. The administration is reportedly considering a working group to handle supply chain strains caused by the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Geoscientists have discovered a magma cap beneath Yellowstone National Park, located approximately 2.4 miles below the Earth's surface, which appears to be critical in preventing massive eruptions. This "volatile rich" cap traps pressure and heat, acting as a lid on the volcanic system. Seismic imaging indicates the magma reservoir is releasing gas in a stable manner, preventing imminent eruption. The discovery provides insights into the dynamics of the Yellowstone supervolcano, one of the world's largest active volcanic systems.</p>

          <p>A coalition of twelve states, primarily led by Democrats, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration challenging the legality of its tariff policies. The states argue that President Trump is overstepping his authority by unilaterally imposing tariffs, a power they believe is reserved for Congress. The lawsuit contends that the tariffs reflect a national trade policy based on the president's whims rather than lawful authority, seeking to block their enforcement. This action follows a similar lawsuit filed by California.</p>

          <p>California is offering residents another chance to receive up to $2,000 toward the purchase of an e-bike, using a drawing system to allocate vouchers. The new system, which requires applicants to enter an online waiting room during a specific hour, is designed to address issues from a previous voucher offer that saw overwhelming demand and technical difficulties. Eligibility requirements include being a California resident aged 18 or older with an annual household income at or below 300% of the Federal Poverty Level.</p>
