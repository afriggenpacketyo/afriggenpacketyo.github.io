          <p>The BBC Proms are planning an all-night concert at the Royal Albert Hall, alongside other events including a music night dedicated to the hit TV show The Traitors, and a classical repertoire. The all-nighter, being planned by organist Anna Lapwood, has been several years in the making and will feature a wide variety of artists, all connected by an enthusiasm for "messing around" with music. This summer's season is the first since the departure of Proms director David Pickard.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price surpassed $94,000, resulting in $635 million in liquidations across crypto markets, primarily affecting short positions. The surge triggered speculation of a potential short squeeze towards $100,000, though some analysts remain cautious due to broader economic factors. The surge in short liquidations suggests a highly leveraged market environment. Upcoming economic events like the FOMC meeting and trade talks will likely influence Bitcoin's future trajectory.</p>

          <p>Geoscientists have discovered a magma cap at Yellowstone National Park, which is thought to be critical in preventing a massive eruption. The cap acts as a lid, trapping pressure and heat below it. While Yellowstone has substantially more magma than previously thought, an eruption is likely not imminent. Data indicates that the magma reservoir is actively releasing gas but remains in a stable state.</p>
