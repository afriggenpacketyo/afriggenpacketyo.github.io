          <p>Wise, a British money transfer firm, has announced its intention to move its primary listing to the U.S., a move that will deal a blow to the London Stock Exchange. The company's full-year earnings statement revealed plans for a dual listing, with the main hub shifting to the U.S. while maintaining a secondary listing in London. This decision aims to allow Wise's shares to be traded on both a U.S. stock exchange and the LSE, potentially increasing its access to capital and broadening its investor base. The move reflects a growing trend of companies seeking U.S. listings for their greater liquidity and higher valuations.</p>

          <p>E-commerce giants Temu and Shein are experiencing a significant drop in U.S. demand following President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports and the closure of the 'de minimis' trade loophole. Temu's daily active users (DAUs) in the U.S. fell by 52% in May compared to March, while Shein's DAUs decreased by 25%, according to data from Sensor Tower. This decline is also reflected in the platforms' Apple App Store rankings, with both companies experiencing lower positions than the previous year. The user drop-off coincides with reduced advertising spending in the U.S. since the tariff announcements.</p>

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has criticized NATO's efforts to involve India in "anti-China" initiatives and has reiterated Moscow's desire to reinstate the Russia-India-China framework.

          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation banning travel to the U.S. from nationals of 12 countries, citing national security risks, and imposing partial restrictions on seven additional countries.

This deployment has raised questions about the use of military force in domestic law enforcement, with critics accusing Trump of bypassing the Posse Comitatus Act.

          <p>A lawyer representing families of victims of the Boeing 737 Max crashes has described the deal between the aviation giant and the US Justice Department (DOJ) as "morally repugnant." The deal allows Boeing to avoid prosecution by paying $1.1 billion, including $444.5 million to families of crash victims and $455 million for improving compliance, safety, and quality programs. The families believe the payout is insufficient, arguing that it allows Boeing to sidestep true criminal accountability. The agreement stems from two crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people, linked to faulty flight control systems.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into Joe Biden's actions during his presidency, accusing aides of a "conspiracy" to "deceive the public about Biden's mental state." Trump's move targets the use of an autopen by Biden's aides to sign executive actions, questioning the legitimacy of decisions made during Biden's term. Biden, who ended his re-election campaign last July, slammed Trump's claims as "ridiculous" and aimed at distracting Americans from his administration's policies. This investigation is the latest effort by Trump to discredit his predecessor and question the legality of his actions in office.</p>

          <p>A Pakistani think tank suggests China could play a leading role in Pakistan's energy transition by promoting decentralized solar power, which could serve as a model for other countries in the Global South. The report highlights that cheap Chinese solar panels are undercutting demand for power from Chinese-financed coal-fired plants in Pakistan, creating a cycle of stranded assets. The report emphasizes the need for indigenous manufacturing, given rising global trade tensions and China's export restrictions on critical minerals. China and Pakistan should transition from an importer-exporter relationship to co-creators of a clean-energy innovation ecosystem.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to suspend operations at 99 contractor-operated Job Corps centers nationwide has left thousands of students in limbo. The Labor Department stated that the program was "no longer achieving the intended outcomes that students deserve," citing a high number of serious incident reports and fiscal analysis. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from eliminating the Job Corps program while the case plays out. Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have denounced the Trump administration's move to suspend Job Corps operations, calling it illegal.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily barred the Trump administration from deporting the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, the Egyptian national accused of attacking a group of demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado. The order came a day after the family was taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Lawyers for the family argued that deporting them for the crimes of their relative would violate the foundations of a democratic justice system. The family entered the United States in late August 2022 and applied for asylum in September 2022.</p>
