          <p>The Conservative Party in the UK is advocating for arming prison officers who deal with violent inmates, proposing that specialist guards should have access to Taser stun guns and baton rounds as a last resort. Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick believes this would give officers more confidence in handling threats, and the party also wants to see high-collar stab vests immediately rolled out to frontline officers. While the Ministry of Justice is trialing the use of Tasers by some prison officers, they argue that providing lethal weapons would put them at greater risk.</p>
