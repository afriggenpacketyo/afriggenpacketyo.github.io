          <p>Australians are voting in a general election, grappling with inflation, housing affordability, and relations with the United States and China, according to the New York Times article. Voters express concerns about the rising cost of living and question whether either major party offers substantial solutions. The opposition leader's attempts to mirror Trump's rhetoric have been met with resistance, as voters prioritize domestic economic issues over culture wars. The trend of voters shifting away from major parties towards independents and minor parties indicates a broader dissatisfaction with the status quo, but the article still expects the current prime minister to win.</p>

          <p>A dispute stemming from a blasphemous audio recording has led to deadly clashes in Druze-majority areas of Syria, resulting in over 80 deaths, according to a report by DW.

Druze leaders have called for international peacekeeping forces to protect the population, while the Syrian government rejects foreign intervention.

          <p>Ghana's ambitious national cathedral project has become a symbol of economic mismanagement and political conflict, according to The New York Times. The $400 million project, designed by architect David Adjaye, has stalled due to a severe economic crisis and corruption allegations. The new government has halted funding and dissolved the managing agency, with the unbuilt cathedral becoming a major target of an anticorruption initiative. The project, initially intended as a personal pledge to God, has faced criticism and is unlikely to be completed.</p>

          <p>Many Russian families are struggling to locate soldiers missing in the Ukraine war due to the lack of a formal tracking system by the Ministry of Defense, according to The New York Times. Bereaved families are left to search on their own with limited information. Estimates suggest tens of thousands are missing, and the process of identification is slow and frustrating, with morgues overcrowded and families facing bureaucratic hurdles. The families are also expressing their frustration online, and some are publicly appealing to Putin for help.</p>

          <p>The United States has implemented 25% tariffs on imported auto parts, which could increase prices for new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance, according to The New York Times. These tariffs, aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing, follow earlier tariffs on imported cars. While some parts from Canada and Mexico are exempt, the tariffs are expected to raise costs for consumers and disrupt the auto industry. Automakers are unlikely to relocate assembly lines quickly due to uncertainty surrounding trade policy.</p>

          <p>Rising sea levels threaten South Africaâ€™s coastlines, but a counterforce is at play: drought, according to DW. New research reveals that parts of the country are slowly lifting out of the ocean due to water loss underground. This phenomenon may appear to offer a natural buffer against rising sea levels, but scientists caution against drawing overly optimistic conclusions. Researchers use GPS measurements, satellite data, and hydrological models to study the correlation between areas experiencing severe droughts and significant land uplift.</p>
