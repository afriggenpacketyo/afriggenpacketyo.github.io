          <p>A near-complete skeleton found on Dorset's Jurassic coast has been identified as Xiphodracon goldencapensis, a unique new species of ichthyosaur or "sword dragon." This dolphin-sized marine reptile, dating back 185 million years, is the only known example of its kind and helps fill a crucial gap in ichthyosaur evolution. Scientists suggest the 3-meter-long creature may have died from a predator's bite to the head and showed signs of injury or disease during its life. The fossil, discovered in 2001, was fully analyzed recently, revealing distinctive features like a prong-like bone near its nostril and an enormous eye socket.</p>

          <p>Israel's government has approved a framework deal for the release of all hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, encompassing both living and deceased individuals. This US-brokered "phase one" agreement also includes a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli soldiers to a specified line in Gaza, aiming for a "Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace." US President Donald Trump announced the initial approval, with subsequent phases focusing on post-Hamas governance. This significant development follows the October 7, 2023, attacks, which led to 1,200 deaths and 251 hostages, and an Israeli military operation resulting in over 67,000 Palestinian casualties.</p>

Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices fell, while South Korea's Kospi saw a modest gain after a holiday, with its small-cap Kosdaq declining. Futures for Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index also indicated a lower open. Overnight, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite pulled back from fresh all-time intraday highs, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average also dropped, as the ongoing U.S. government shutdown continued to weigh on market sentiment.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Virginia on charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. The indictment alleges James misrepresented her use of a Norfolk home, obtained with a Fannie Mae-backed mortgage, by renting it out despite loan terms requiring it as a secondary residence. James, a long-time antagonist of President Trump who publicly called for charges against her, stated the indictment is a "continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system" and politically motivated. If convicted, James faces a maximum of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine per count, though actual sentences are usually less severe.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Chicago has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the deployment of National Guard troops from any U.S. state into Illinois for 14 days. The judge cited a lack of credible evidence for a "rebellion" and expressed concerns that the deployment could incite civil unrest, requiring a response from local law enforcement. Concurrently, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments regarding a similar block on deployments in Portland, Oregon. These legal battles highlight a high-profile dispute over President Donald Trump's authority to deploy military forces in Democratic-led cities, with local governments arguing against what they perceive as an unconstitutional blurring of military and civilian roles.</p>

          <p>The United States has initiated a controversial $20 billion financial rescue effort for Argentina, including the purchase of Argentine pesos, aimed at stabilizing the country's severe currency crisis. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the finalization of the terms, emphasizing Argentina's "reform agenda" is of "systemic importance" to US strategic interests in the Western Hemisphere. The move has drawn criticism in the US, with Senator Elizabeth Warren questioning the use of American dollars for foreign aid amidst domestic spending cuts. Argentina faces significant financial turmoil ahead of midterm elections, with its peso declining and billions in debt payments due soon. (not investment advice)</p>

Drake had alleged UMG endangered his life by promoting the song and devalued his music ahead of contract renegotiations.

The legislation bans online marketplaces for dog brokers, voids pet purchase contracts with nonrefundable deposits, and mandates sellers to share health certificates with the state's Department of Food and Agriculture. These measures address loopholes that emerged after a 2019 ban on commercial pet store sales, which led to a surge in online resellers often masking the origin of puppies from out-of-state commercial breeders.

          <p>Scotland achieved a "monumentally befuddling" 3-1 victory over Greece in a World Cup qualifier, despite being outclassed for much of the game and trailing 1-0. The article describes Scotland's turnaround as a "weird cosmic force," highlighting their initial disorganization and lack of attempts on target for an hour. However, two late goals, one from a scramble and another a Lewis Ferguson poke, secured an improbable lead, followed by a third in added time by Lyndon Dykes. This "Houdiniesque act of escapology" puts Scotland in a strong position for World Cup qualification, with the team now looking towards their next match against Belarus to improve their standing score.</p>

          <p>Two Pennsylvania State Police troopers were wounded, and a suspect was killed, during an exchange of gunfire on Interstate 81 in Franklin County. Troopers responded to a theft at a Dick's Sporting Goods, leading to a pursuit that ended when spike strips stopped the suspects' van. The male suspect, identified as Lamar Foy, opened fire on troopers, wounding Thomas Pack and Lucas Amarose, before being fatally shot by a third trooper. One trooper has been released from the hospital, while the other is in serious condition. Authorities found large amounts of drugs, cash, and stolen merchandise in the van, believing it may be linked to a larger crime pattern.</p>

          <p>The new animated film "Aztec Batman: Clash of Empires" reimagines Batman as Yohualli, a young Aztec warrior whose father is killed during the arrival of conquistador Hernan Cortes. Yohualli transforms into a bat-themed warrior, protected by the Aztec bat deity Tzinacan, to confront the conquistadors in Tenochtitlan. Produced by Mexico's Ánima Estudios, the film aims to generate pride in Indigenous cultures and tell a chapter of history from a less-often-told perspective. Key to its authenticity were insights from an Aztec culture historian, influencing character design and incorporating Nahuatl language, while also reinterpreting classic Batman villains within the Aztec context.</p>

          <p>Residents of Pacific Palisades are directing anger at Los Angeles City Hall for alleged failures in preparing for and responding to a deadly fire that killed 12 people and destroyed over 6,700 structures. Federal prosecutors arrested a man for setting a small fire that later reignited, but residents argue city officials' handling, including a dry reservoir meant for water supply, contributed to the disaster. While civil cases against government entities are challenging due to broad immunity laws, lawyers for victims are filing complaints against the city and state, citing a "dangerous condition" exception for allowing smoldering embers to reignite. The legal battle over accountability is expected to be complex.</p>

          <p>The East Coast is bracing for a potential coastal storm this weekend, forecast to develop off the southeastern U.S. and bring heavy rainfall, strong winds, and coastal flooding. The Interstate 95 corridor, from the Delmarva Peninsula to New England, is on alert, with parts of the mid-Atlantic facing a "slight" risk of excessive rainfall. Current models suggest 3-5 inches of rain are possible along the I-95 corridor, potentially causing significant disruption. While not yet definitively classified as a nor'easter due to evolving development location, the system is expected to diminish after Monday, reducing the overall threat level.</p>

          <p>England coach Thomas Tuchel expressed frustration over the "silent" atmosphere at Wembley during his team's dominant 3-0 friendly win against Wales, despite scoring three goals in 20 minutes. Tuchel felt the team's performance warranted stronger support from the stands, stating, "We never got any energy back from the stands." This criticism, unusual for a coach towards home supporters, follows a series of strong performances under Tuchel. While some understood his concern about the lack of atmosphere, others questioned the timing and potential impact of his comments on fan relations, highlighting a disconnect between the team's success and crowd engagement.</p>
