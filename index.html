          <p>The Arizona home of Diamondbacks star Ketel Marte was burglarized while he was competing in the MLB All-Star Game in Georgia. Scottsdale Police are investigating the incident as a "high-dollar residential burglary," reporting that jewelry and other personal items were stolen from the empty home. This event is the latest in a series of break-ins targeting high-profile athletes while they are away for games. The FBI has previously warned that organized crime groups may be using social media and public schedules to track and target athletes.</p>

          <p>An Israeli military strike hit the Holy Family Church compound in Gaza, the only Catholic church in the Strip, resulting in three deaths and injuring ten others, including the parish priest. The church was sheltering hundreds of displaced civilians, including both Christians and Muslims. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged the strike was a mistake caused by "stray ammunition" and expressed deep regret. The incident drew condemnation from Pope Leo XIV and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, adding to international pressure for a ceasefire and protection of civilians.</p>

          <p>This article explains the role of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the reasons for President Trump's persistent criticism of its chair, Jerome Powell. Trump's frustration stems from the Fed's decision to maintain relatively high interest rates to combat inflation, a policy he believes hampers economic growth. The article details Powell's background, the Fed's dual mandate of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices, and the legal questions surrounding whether a president can fire a Fed chair. It provides context for the ongoing tension between the White House and the independent central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents conducted several raids in Sacramento, including at a Home Depot, arresting 11 undocumented immigrants. A top Border Patrol official stated the operation was intended to send a message that "no such thing as a sanctuary state" exists, directly challenging California's policies. The action drew immediate condemnation from Governor Gavin Newsom's office, which accused the agency of illegal racial profiling. The raids occurred despite recent federal court orders in California limiting the agency's ability to use racial profiling for warrantless arrests.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has authorized Juul Labs to continue marketing its tobacco- and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes in the United States. This decision reverses a 2022 order that would have removed the products from the market, which Juul successfully challenged in court. The FDA stated that Juul's studies demonstrated its products are less harmful for adult smokers who switch completely from traditional cigarettes. Anti-tobacco groups heavily criticized the move, citing Juul's significant role in sparking the teen vaping epidemic several years ago.</p>

However, this article argues the change is more symbolic than substantive from a health perspective. Public health experts note that cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are metabolically almost identical and that the focus should be on reducing overall consumption of sugary drinks. The move is seen as a political win for Trump, aligning with the "Make America healthy again" movement, despite its limited actual health impact. (not investment advice)</p>

In that letter, she appeared to equate the prejudice faced by Jewish people with that of redheads, which caused a significant outcry. Given Labour leader Keir Starmer's pledge to eradicate antisemitism from the party, her lack of regret for the original comments left the leadership with little choice but to repeat the suspension.</p>

          <p>A settlement has been reached in a class-action lawsuit filed by investors against Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other company leaders. The lawsuit alleged that officials failed to protect the company from the financial fallout of the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal. Shareholders were seeking to have executives reimburse Meta for billions in fines and legal costs, arguing they violated a 2012 FTC consent decree. The terms of the settlement, announced in a Delaware court, were not disclosed, concluding a trial that was expected to feature testimony from Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg.</p>

          <p>In a first-person account, an international health worker describes the harrowing conditions in Gaza, labeling the situation a "massacre" rather than a war. The article details the immense suffering of children, including a 10-year-old girl with catastrophic injuries whose mother and brother were killed in an airstrike. The author rejects being called a hero, instead bestowing that title upon the local Palestinian healthcare workers who continue their duties despite losing their own families and homes. The piece is a powerful call for a permanent ceasefire and an end to the blockade.</p>

          <h2>Experts Explain Record-High Beef Prices in the U.S.</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. consumers are facing record-high prices for beef, with a pound of ground beef now averaging over $6. This article explains the key factors driving the surge, which experts say is unlikely to ease soon. A decades-long shrinkage of the U.S. cattle herd, exacerbated by recent droughts that raised feed costs, has severely tightened supply. Additionally, high cattle prices incentivize selling over breeding, and a ban on cattle imports from Mexico due to a parasite has further constrained supply. Strong consumer demand continues to push prices higher. (not investment advice)</p>

Hankison blindly fired ten shots into Taylor's apartment building during the fatal 2020 raid. Because the DOJ memo also requests credit for time served, the sentence would mean Hankison serves no additional jail time. This recommendation is seen by critics as a major setback for police accountability efforts that gained momentum following the racial justice protests of 2020.</p>

          <p>Following the White House's announcement that President Donald Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, medical experts have provided context on the condition. It is a common circulatory issue, particularly in older adults, where vein valves in the legs struggle to pump blood back to the heart, causing swelling. Doctors describe the condition as generally benign and manageable with non-surgical treatments like compression stockings and lifestyle changes. The diagnosis was made after Trump experienced mild leg swelling, and his physician has stated he remains in "excellent health."</p>
