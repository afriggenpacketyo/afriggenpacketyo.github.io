        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>North Carolina has been ranked as the top state for business in America for 2025, according to a comprehensive CNBC study. The state's success is attributed to its strong economy, skilled workforce, and business-friendly policies, attracting major investments from companies like Amazon and JetZero. However, the article notes significant challenges, including a low ranking for quality of life and worker protections. Potential headwinds from federal budget cuts and the economic impact of recent hurricanes could also affect its future business climate.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines has reinstated its 2025 profit forecast, causing its stock to surge after announcing that travel bookings have stabilized. While overall demand is lower than initially projected at the start of the year, the airline reported strong growth in premium seat sales and its partnership with American Express. CEO Ed Bastian noted that travelers are booking closer to their travel dates, prompting surgical adjustments to flight capacity. The company now projects full-year adjusted earnings of $5.25 to $6.25 per share, revising an earlier, more optimistic forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has unveiled Grok 4, a new version of the AI chatbot for his X platform, just one day after its predecessor generated antisemitic content, including praise for Adolf Hitler. During a livestream, Musk described the new model as "the smartest AI in the world," while also acknowledging the "terrifying" pace of AI development. In response to the controversy, Musk's company, xAI, stated it is actively working to remove inappropriate posts and improve the model's training to prevent hate speech.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's burgeoning drone industry is exploring opportunities to export its battle-tested technology, positioning itself as a key partner in rearming Europe. Having developed rapidly during the war with Russia, Ukrainian companies leverage unique battlefield experience and data, though they face competition from well-funded European firms. The Ukrainian government is now considering loosening export restrictions to attract investment and fund further development. This move could allow for joint ventures and production outside Ukraine, addressing security concerns and balancing domestic needs with international market potential.</p>

The proposal would make exceptions for those covered by international agreements.

          <p>In a thought-provoking analysis, economist Dean Spears challenges the long-held belief that a smaller global population is inherently better for the planet. He argues that the current trajectory of falling birth rates could lead to an unprecedented and continuous population decline, which would stifle innovation, scientific progress, and economic vitality. Spears suggests that rather than an unending decline, humanity should aim for population stabilization, which requires a careful, non-politicized conversation about making it easier for people to have children. He emphasizes that this requires addressing systemic issues like gender inequality, rather than resorting to traditionalist or coercive measures.</p>

          <p>This essay reflects on the significant role that movies played in shaping public consciousness about the threat of nuclear war during the Cold War. Films like "Dr. Strangelove," "Fail Safe," and "The Day After" provided a visceral vocabulary for understanding the apocalypse, from mushroom clouds to fallout shelters. The author argues that as these films have faded from cultural memory, subsequent generations have lost a crucial framework for comprehending the persistent danger of nuclear weapons. The article suggests a need for new films to re-engage the public and remind them that the horrors depicted in these older movies remain a terrifying possibility.</p>

The study ranked 150 cities based on affordability, economic strength, and quality of life, with McKinney, Texas, claiming the top spot. Sarasota, Florida; Atlanta; Austin, Texas; and Huntsville, Alabama, also ranked in the top five. These cities are noted for their lower-than-average cost of living, ample high-end apartments, and strong job growth, making them attractive options for renters seeking a balance of affordability and amenities.</p>

          <p>Dr. Shoshana Shendelman, a Columbia University trustee, has formally called on the school's board to fully comply with the Trump administration's demands regarding antisemitism and Title VI civil rights compliance. In a letter, she argued that leadership's failure to decisively address antisemitism has tarnished the university's reputation and created legal and financial risks. The demand follows the release of text messages from acting President Claire Shipman suggesting Shendelman's removal from the board. The Department of Education has already canceled $400 million in grants to Columbia over the issue, threatening its accreditation.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has issued a stark warning that the country faces a "rising, persistent and unpredictable threat" from Iran, urging the government to adopt a more strategic, long-term approach. The Intelligence and Security Committee's report highlights a sharp increase in physical threats, including at least 15 attempted murders or kidnappings on UK soil since early 2022, primarily targeting opponents of the Iranian regime. The report accuses the government of focusing on "fire-fighting" and calls for more resources to counter Iran's wide-ranging hostile activities, which include espionage and cyber attacks.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is preparing for a heatwave to intensify over the weekend, with temperatures forecast to reach as high as 34°C (93°F). This marks the third official heatwave of the year for some regions, prompting the UK Health Security Agency to extend yellow heat-health alerts across all of England. The sweltering conditions are expected to continue into early next week before cooler air moves in. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service has also issued an "extreme wildfire warning," urging public caution as the hot, dry weather increases the risk of fires.</p>

The attacks, which began in mid-April, involved data theft and the deployment of ransomware, causing significant operational chaos and financial damage.

Wang urged members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to maintain unity on free trade and not undermine the interests of others in their negotiations with the United States.

Trump's threat, issued in a letter, was explicitly linked to what he called a "witch hunt" trial against his political ally, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Lula rejected the demand to end the trial, asserting Brazil's sovereignty and challenging Trump's claims of a U.S. trade deficit.

          <p>President Trump's proposal to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports could lead to higher prices for a wide range of consumer goods, according to economists and industry experts. Copper is a vital component in everything from home construction and appliances to electric vehicles and advanced military hardware. The White House argues the tariff is necessary to rebuild the domestic copper industry and reduce reliance on foreign imports for national security. However, critics warn it will inevitably raise costs for manufacturers, which will be passed on to consumers, potentially fueling inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article contrasts the outcomes of two recent, severe floods in neighboring states: one in Ruidoso, New Mexico, and the other in Central Texas. While the Texas flood resulted in a catastrophic loss of life with over 120 fatalities, the New Mexico flood, though destructive to property, had a much lower death toll of three. The difference is attributed to preparedness; Ruidoso officials, aware of heightened flood risks from recent wildfire "burn scars," had plans and experts in place. The comparison underscores how community familiarity with specific weather risks and proactive adaptation can significantly influence the human cost of natural disasters.</p>

          <p>New analysis indicates that Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) flood maps significantly understated the flood risk for Camp Mystic, the Texas summer camp where over two dozen people died in recent floods. According to data from First Street, a private climate risk firm, at least 17 structures at the camp were in the path of floodwaters, including four cabins in an area FEMA had not marked as an extreme hazard. This discrepancy highlights a major issue with FEMA's methodology, which relies on historical river and tidal data but often fails to map risks from extreme rainfall events, leaving many communities with a false sense of security.</p>
