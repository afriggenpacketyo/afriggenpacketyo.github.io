          <p>A devastating shooting unfolded at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis during a school Mass, leading to the deaths of an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old, with seventeen others, including fourteen children, sustaining injuries. The gunman, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, a former student whose mother previously worked at the church, died by suicide at the scene. This horrific event, occurring on the first week of school, has sparked profound grief and renewed calls from officials like Mayor Jacob Frey and Governor Tim Walz for an end to gun violence. Law enforcement is actively investigating the shooter's motive and examining social media content.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump affirmed his pledge to protect Social Security from congressional cost-cutting, emphasizing his administration's "One Big, Beautiful Bill Act" which offers a temporary tax deduction for seniors. Critics, however, suggest this act has little bearing on the program's long-term solvency. Despite the President's confidence, the 2025 Trustees Report projects the Social Security trust fund will be depleted by 2033, potentially reducing benefits by 23%. The administration also plans to transform the Social Security Administration into a "digital-first agency," aiming for 200 million digital accounts by next year. This article reports on financial matters but does not offer investment advice.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched an investigation into the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) and its Air Resources Board (CARB) concerning potentially discriminatory employment practices. The Department of Justice will assess if CalEPA's "Practices to Advance Racial Equity in Workforce Planning" violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act by incorporating protected characteristics into hiring and promotion decisions. This action reflects President Trump's ongoing opposition to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and further intensifies the administration's clashes with California over state-level policies. The DOJ states it has not reached any conclusions and will consider all relevant information.</p>

          <p>British tennis star Jack Draper has withdrawn from the US Open, citing an arm injury that became too painful to continue playing. The 23-year-old, who was a semi-finalist last year, has been battling a bruised humerus in his left serving arm since April, leading him to miss prior tournaments in Canada and Cincinnati. Despite completing his first-round match, the discomfort persisted, prompting his decision to prioritize his long-term health. This withdrawal will significantly impact his ATP ranking, likely causing him to fall out of the top 10, and casts doubt on his participation in the season-ending ATP Finals.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved updated COVID-19 vaccines for the upcoming fall/winter season, implementing the narrowest eligibility restrictions since their initial availability. These new shots are primarily cleared for individuals aged 65 and older or those with high-risk underlying conditions, a significant shift from previous universal recommendations. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic, supported this change, which could lead to increased out-of-pocket costs for healthy Americans as insurance coverage often follows CDC recommendations. The context includes Kennedy's recent replacement of the CDC's vaccine advisory committee with members known for their skeptical views, further impacting vaccine policy and public health strategy.</p>

The visit highlights the precariousness of Moldova's Western pivot ahead of critical parliamentary elections, with EU leaders warning of relentless Russian hybrid attacks, including election interference and disinformation.

          <p>This article elucidates the maximum Social Security payments available to seniors in 2025, emphasizing that the benefit amount is contingent on factors like retirement age and extensive high lifetime earnings. For instance, retiring at age 70 could result in a maximum monthly payment of $5,108, but this is an exceptional achievement for most. Given that Social Security often doesn't provide sufficient income, the article explores supplementary retirement strategies, including reverse mortgages, annuities, and continued part-time work. It underscores the critical need for individuals to proactively develop diverse income streams and comprehensive financial plans well in advance of retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Google has significantly reduced its management structure, cutting over one-third of managers overseeing small teams in the past year as part of a broader efficiency initiative. This move aims to streamline operations and reduce bureaucracy, with many affected managers transitioning into individual contributor roles. CEO Sundar Pichai reiterated the company's focus on scaling efficiently without solely increasing headcount, following previous rounds of layoffs and voluntary buyouts. While some employees chose the exit programs, the ongoing organizational changes have reportedly impacted morale, despite Google's robust financial performance and rising stock value.

          <p>President Donald Trump has accused Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud, alleging she falsely claimed primary residency in two states. Cook's attorney announced a lawsuit to contest her removal, arguing Trump lacks the legal authority. Experts clarify that owner-occupancy mortgage fraud, driven by lower interest rates and tax advantages for primary homes, is notoriously difficult to establish in court. Proving specific intent to defraud, rather than a mere error, is a significant legal hurdle. This type of fraud is also challenging to detect early in the mortgage lifecycle.

It explains that rate adjustments from card issuers are typically slow and less substantial following Fed cuts, unlike the swift increases seen with hikes. The prevailing high risk in the current economic environment, characterized by increasing credit card delinquencies and inflation above target levels, contributes to issuers' reluctance to lower rates. Consumers are advised to proactively manage their debt by negotiating with card companies, utilizing balance transfer offers, or considering debt management plans or personal loans to reduce interest expenses.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent studies on universal basic income (UBI) and cash transfers have intensified the debate surrounding their effectiveness, with some findings indicating that unrestricted aid did not consistently lead to long-term improvements in recipients' mental health, stress, or financial well-being. This has led to a re-evaluation of the "basic income" concept, previously hailed as a solution for economic justice. The article highlights the political polarization of cash transfers, with some states enacting bans while others continue to fund experiments. Advocates emphasize that cash primarily provides basic security and addresses market failures, rather than serving as a panacea for all societal issues.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter in her high-profile Massachusetts retrial concerning the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, but was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol and sentenced to one year probation.

The extensive timeline of the case detailed conflicting evidence, accusations of witness intimidation, and internal investigations into police conduct.

In a separate development, O'Leary voiced strong skepticism regarding the UK's sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandate, labeling SAF as "nonsense" and asserting that the 2030 target of 10% is unattainable due to supply shortages.

The Nabataeans, renowned for their architectural marvels in Petra and extensive trade networks, constructed such structures to facilitate their desert voyages. The discovery of intact baptismal pools offers a tangible link to their historical transition to Christianity around the 4th century A.D. This exploration served as a profound reminder of the continuous evolution of societies and the ultimate impermanence of even the most enduring civilizations across millennia.</p>
