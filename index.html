          <p>American Airlines has hired Nat Pieper, a seasoned executive with nearly three decades of experience at carriers like Delta and Alaska Airlines, as its new chief commercial officer. The move follows the departure of the previous CCO after a corporate travel strategy failed, causing profits to fall behind competitors. Pieper, who most recently headed the Oneworld airline alliance, is expected to leverage his extensive background in network planning, finance, and technology to enhance the airline's commercial strategy and improve customer experience.

          <p>A recent CNBC Housing Market Survey indicates that a majority of prospective homebuyers are waiting on the sidelines, anticipating that mortgage rates will fall further. Despite rates reaching their lowest levels in a year, nearly three-quarters of real estate agents report that this expectation is a primary reason for delayed purchases, alongside broader economic uncertainty and affordability challenges. This has created a standoff, with sellers still pricing for a competitive market while buyers are willing to wait for better conditions. To cope, some buyers are turning to adjustable-rate mortgages or receiving financial help from family. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not attend the ASEAN summit in Malaysia in person, a decision that has fueled speculation about strained relations with the United States. The absence comes as the Trump administration pressures India to cease its purchases of Russian oil, with President Trump recently claiming Modi had assured him they would do so. This diplomatic friction is compounded by new US sanctions targeting major Russian oil producers, which could penalize foreign banks facilitating such transactions. Indian officials maintain their priority is energy independence and low consumer prices, creating a tense standoff.</p>

          <p>Rivian Automotive is set to lay off more than 600 employees, representing about 4% of its total workforce, as it navigates a challenging market for electric vehicles. The company is facing headwinds from the elimination of federal EV incentives, slower-than-expected consumer demand, and significant financial losses, which amounted to $1.1 billion in the second quarter. Despite a year-over-year increase in third-quarter sales, Rivian has narrowed its annual delivery forecast and anticipates a larger adjusted core loss for the year. The layoffs reflect a broader trend of EV manufacturers adjusting to a more difficult economic environment.</p>

          <p>Despite earlier trade tensions, relations between the U.S. and the European Union have improved, largely due to a united front against Russia's actions in Ukraine. This alignment was demonstrated this week as Washington and Brussels announced complementary sanctions targeting Russia's critical oil and gas industry. The U.S. Ambassador to the EU stated that both sides are on the same page regarding the need to increase pressure on Moscow to end the war. This shared geopolitical goal appears to be fostering closer cooperation, overriding previous disagreements over tariffs and trade practices under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has recorded at least 20 detainee deaths this year, the highest number since 2004, as the agency's custody population swells to nearly 60,000. Former officials warn that the sharp increase in detentions, combined with staffing shortages and reduced oversight, is creating a dangerous situation that will likely lead to more fatalities. The rise in arrests away from the border means more individuals are entering custody with unknown or chronic health conditions. Critics also point to staff cuts at oversight offices and a government shutdown hindering monitoring capabilities as contributing factors.</p>

          <p>The U.S. gross national debt has exceeded the $38 trillion mark for the first time, a milestone reached as the ongoing government shutdown disrupts the economy. Fiscal policy experts warn that the shutdown exacerbates the debt by delaying economic activity and increasing costs, while the rapidly accumulating debt itself leads to soaring interest payments. These payments are projected to total $14 trillion over the next decade, potentially crowding out other essential public and private spending. The situation has raised concerns among economists and credit rating agencies about long-term investor confidence and the erosion of consumer purchasing power. (not investment advice)</p>

This continued inventory shortage is keeping home prices elevated, with the median price up 2.1% year-over-year, marking the 27th consecutive month of annual gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kelly Reichardt's latest film, "The Mastermind," is reviewed as a compelling and humorous character study rather than a conventional heist movie. The film follows an unemployed carpenter, J.B. Mooney, whose comically inept plan to steal paintings from a museum goes wrong immediately. The narrative focuses on the aftermath, deconstructing the protagonist's hubris and selfishness as he clumsily attempts to evade capture. With an understated performance from Josh O'Connor and a rich depiction of 1970s suburbia, the film is praised for its precise exploration of self-destruction and its subtle, observational humor, making it one of Reichardt's funniest works.</p>

The article suggests that a more open negotiating position is necessary, even if it leads to an imperfect outcome.</p>

          <p>The European Union has imposed sanctions on two mainland Chinese oil refineries and a Hong Kong-based trader for their role in supporting Russia's war economy. The companies, including subsidiaries of the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, are part of a larger package of measures targeting entities involved in illicit trade with Moscow. The move marks a significant step by the EU to crack down on third-country actors enabling Russia's war in Ukraine. Beijing issued a stern rebuke, stating that the EU is not in a position to criticize normal trade relations between China and Russia.</p>

          <p>The British Medical Association (BMA) has announced a new five-day strike for resident doctors in England, scheduled to begin on November 14th, after talks with the government broke down. This marks the 13th walkout in a protracted dispute over pay and working conditions that began in March 2023. The BMA stated that it engaged in negotiations in good faith but was left with little choice but to call for further industrial action due to a lack of progress. The strike is expected to cause significant disruption to hospital services as the NHS prepares for a challenging winter.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued a strong warning to Israel regarding a symbolic parliamentary vote on annexing the occupied West Bank. Vice President JD Vance labeled the move a "very stupid political stunt" and stated he was personally insulted by it. President Donald Trump was even more direct, telling a magazine that Israel would lose all U.S. support if it were to proceed with annexation. The sharp rebukes underscore the official U.S. policy against such an action and signal significant diplomatic friction over the issue, despite the vote's lack of immediate practical effect.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is hearing a case that could significantly weaken Section Two of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, a provision that has long been used to prevent the drawing of electoral maps that dilute the voting power of racial minorities. If the court rules to limit the scope of this protection, it could fundamentally alter the landscape of redistricting across the country. Such a change may provide new opportunities for partisan gerrymandering, potentially allowing legislatures to create less competitive districts and further entrench political power along party lines, with significant implications for future elections.</p>

          <p>After more than 50 years, the criminal trial of a former British paratrooper, known as Soldier F, for his role in the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre has concluded with a not guilty verdict.

The trial revisited one of the most painful events of the Troubles, but the legal process ultimately ended without a conviction, closing a long and controversial chapter for the victims' families who had campaigned for decades for justice.</p>

Rallies against the proposition highlight deep-seated concerns that it could further diminish political competition in the state. The debate over Proposition 50 is a key front in the broader national conflict over how electoral districts are drawn and the fairness of the democratic process.</p>

          <p>China is reportedly gaining a strategic advantage in the development of next-generation tanks, as its export controls on advanced lithium batteries are creating supply challenges for the U.S. military.

The reliance on this technology, now subject to Chinese restrictions, highlights a significant vulnerability in the U.S. defense supply chain.

For the author, continuing to run became a way to maintain control and find resilience, culminating in a triumphant return to the New York City Marathon after his illness.

The legislation aims to fix the often confusing "math error notices" that the IRS sends to taxpayers for simple clerical mistakes on their returns. These notices, which were sent over a million times for the 2023 tax year, have been criticized for being unclear about the nature of the error and the steps required for correction. The new law will require the IRS to provide more straightforward explanations, making it easier for taxpayers to understand and resolve issues without professional help.</p>
