          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized Elon Musk, referring to him as the "man who has lost his mind," following a heated exchange between the two. This occurred a day after their disagreement became public. Trump's remarks came in response to Musk's criticisms of a GOP spending bill. The future relationship between the two remains uncertain given the recent escalation of their conflict. The situation is evolving, and further developments are expected as both figures continue to react to each other's statements. The fallout from this public dispute could have implications for Tesla and Musk's other ventures, given Trump's influence. The overall tone is negative due to the conflict and the potential ramifications for both parties. </p>

          <p>A new analysis highlights the return of deficit politics in the debate surrounding President Trump's proposed tax cuts. The legislation under consideration by Republicans could significantly increase the fiscal imbalance, despite promises from party leaders to reduce it. The potential for a swelling deficit raises concerns about the long-term economic impact of the tax cuts. This development is particularly noteworthy given the historical focus on fiscal responsibility by some members of the Republican party. The article suggests that the tax cuts could have unintended consequences for the national debt and economic stability. </p>

          <p>Meta has taken down numerous advertisements promoting "nudify" applications, which use AI to create sexually explicit deepfakes from real people's images, following a CBS News investigation. The ads were found on Instagram, promoting tools that could "upload a photo" and "see anyone naked." Meta stated that it has strict rules against non-consensual intimate imagery and has blocked the responsible pages and URLs. This issue highlights the ongoing challenge of combating AI-generated content that can be exploited for malicious purposes, despite efforts to strengthen enforcement. The proliferation of these ads raises concerns about user consent, online safety, and the potential for misuse of AI technology, especially concerning minors. </p>

          <p>Russia's central bank has lowered interest rates from 21% to 20%, marking the first cut since September 2022. This decision indicates that inflation pressures, previously described as "alarming" by President Putin, are beginning to subside. The inflation rate in April was reported at 6.2%, a decrease from the 8.2% average in the first quarter of 2025. While domestic demand still exceeds the capacity to expand the supply of goods and services, the central bank believes the Russian economy is gradually returning to a balanced growth path and monetary policy will remain tight for a long period to return inflation to its 4% target. </p>

          <p>A House GOP megabill could lead to millions of Americans losing their health insurance due to proposed Medicaid cuts and changes to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The bill includes new work requirements for Medicaid recipients, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates would cause 5.2 million adults to lose coverage. Experts also say that ending the use of health care provider taxes and delaying Biden-era eligibility rules would create funding challenges for states. The expiration of enhanced ACA subsidies would further increase costs for consumers, potentially leading to more people becoming uninsured. </p>

          <p>Kenyan President William Ruto's new youth employment plan, NYOTA, aims to create 800,000 jobs for young Kenyans, but it faces skepticism from Generation Z. Many question the plan's feasibility given budget constraints and past unfulfilled promises. Experts also doubt the funding and sustainability of the project, citing a lack of clarity in the budget. The initiative comes after youth-led demonstrations against tax increases and unemployment, reflecting a strained relationship between Ruto and young voters. </p>

The microburst formed as atmospheric systems collided, with the rapid cooling from hail making the storm especially dangerous. </p>
