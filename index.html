          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is scheduled to testify before the Senate Finance Committee, where he will face intense questioning regarding recent turmoil within U.S. public health agencies. His appearance follows the FDA's decision to narrow access to the COVID-19 vaccine, a move that precipitated the ousting of the CDC director and the subsequent resignation of four top officials in protest. While Kennedy is expected to promote his "Make America Healthy Again" agenda, senators from both parties are poised to press him on controversial changes to vaccine policy and his replacement of a key vaccine advisory committee with his own appointees.</p>

          <p>Graham Linehan, the Irish comedy writer known for co-creating "Father Ted," is on trial in London, facing charges of harassment and criminal damage against a transgender woman. He has pleaded not guilty to allegations that he posted abusive comments on social media and damaged the mobile phone of 18-year-old activist Sophia Brooks in October 2024. This trial is separate from his recent high-profile arrest at Heathrow Airport on suspicion of inciting violence, which sparked a debate on free speech and policing. The current proceedings focus specifically on his interactions with Ms. Brooks during the Battle of Ideas conference.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to host approximately two dozen high-profile technology and business executives for a dinner at the White House's renovated Rose Garden. The guest list includes major figures such as Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, Bill Gates, and Sam Altman, highlighting the administration's complex but close relationship with the Big Tech sector. The event, which follows a separate White House discussion on artificial intelligence, is seen as an effort to foster collaboration on emerging technologies and American reshoring. Notably absent from the invitation list is Elon Musk, who previously had a public falling out with the president.</p>

China's Southern Theatre Command stated that its forces remain on high alert to safeguard the nation's territorial sovereignty and maritime interests. The naval operation occurred shortly after the conclusion of a major joint military exercise between Australia and the Philippines in the region.

          <p>British luxury brand Burberry is scheduled to rejoin the U.K.'s prestigious FTSE 100 stock index this month, marking its return after being demoted a year ago. The upgrade reflects early signs of success from a turnaround strategy implemented by CEO Joshua Schulman, which has focused on timeless pieces and cost-cutting measures.

          <p>Former NFL star Jay Cutler is facing a civil lawsuit in Tennessee following a DUI crash last October for which he has already been sentenced to jail time. The lawsuit, filed by Perry Lee, whose vehicle was struck by Cutler, seeks damages exceeding $25,000 for injuries that allegedly cause daily pain and have diminished his quality of life. Cutler previously pleaded guilty to driving under the influence and is scheduled to serve four days in jail starting September 29. According to the arrest affidavit, he smelled of alcohol and attempted to pay the other driver $2,000 to avoid involving the police.</p>

          <p>The French women's boxing team has been barred from competing in the Boxing World Championships in Liverpool after failing to submit mandatory gender test results by the deadline. World Boxing, the sport's governing body, recently instituted a new policy requiring genetic sex testing for all female competitors. The French federation sent its five-member team to a lab in the U.K. for the tests, as they are banned in France, but the results were not provided in time for the athletes to be eligible. The French federation expressed indignation, blaming the recommended laboratory, while World Boxing maintains that managing the testing process is the responsibility of national federations.</p>

Perceptions of Kennedy Jr.'s job performance are strongly linked to views on his vaccine policies, with those who see him as restricting access largely disapproving of his work.

          <p>A recent tentative agreement between Air Canada and its flight attendants to provide compensation for work performed during boarding has ignited a push for similar changes across the North American airline industry. For decades, many flight attendants have not been paid until the aircraft doors close, but the three-day strike at Canada's largest carrier resulted in a deal for partial ground pay. U.S. flight attendant unions, like the AFA-CWA, see this as a pivotal moment that pressures American carriers to address the issue. While some U.S. airlines have started offering boarding pay, the Air Canada agreement could set a new, higher standard for ongoing negotiations.</p>

          <p>The bipartisan embrace of exempting tipped income from taxes is being scrutinized as a substantively flawed policy despite its popular appeal. Critics argue that the "no tax on tips" measure arbitrarily benefits certain blue-collar workers over others and disproportionately helps higher earners, such as servers at luxury restaurants, while offering no relief to the lowest-paid workers. The policy also creates incentives for tax avoidance and entrenches an inequitable compensation system reliant on patron generosity. While politically popular, the article suggests it exemplifies a form of anti-expert populism that aligns with public intuition but undermines sound economic principles and fair tax structures.</p>

The process for joining the EU is lengthy and complex, offering Russia numerous opportunities to interfere through its allies within the bloc.

          <p>Stacey Williams, a former model who dated Jeffrey Epstein in 1993, has penned an opinion piece demanding the full release of government files related to the convicted sex offender. Williams recounts being in a consensual relationship with Epstein but states that non-consensual events occurred, including being groped by Donald Trump while Epstein watched and being filmed without her consent. She argues that transparency is not a partisan issue and is crucial for the healing of hundreds of victims who have lived in the shadow of Epstein's crimes. Williams criticizes the secrecy and political maneuvering surrounding the files, asserting that accountability is impossible without full disclosure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>FIFA has confirmed it will use a dynamic ticket pricing model for the 2026 World Cup, a move that critics argue prioritizes profit at the expense of ordinary fans. While initial ticket prices will have a set range, the algorithm-based system will allow prices to fluctuate based on demand, likely causing them to soar, especially after the tournament draw is announced. This effectively allows FIFA to absorb the secondary resale market, subjecting fans to potential price-gouging directly from the governing body. The article argues this decision undermines any pretense that FIFA is focused on growing the game, instead revealing its primary motive is to maximize revenue.</p>

          <p>As his iconic detective series featuring Easy Rawlins marks its 35th anniversary, author Walter Mosley is releasing the 17th installment, "Gray Dawn." The series has provided a unique chronicle of Los Angeles's evolution, particularly for its Black residents, from the post-WWII era into the socially turbulent 1970s. In the new novel, an older Easy Rawlins navigates a world of Black militants, corrupt officials, and family crises while remaining a voice for the voiceless. Mosley discusses how the character has served as a lens to explore themes of race, class, and community, creating a lasting impact on the crime fiction genre.</p>

          <p>An Alabama man who allegedly threatened a Catholic monastery in Orange County has been charged with multiple felonies after traveling to the church with a large cache of weapons. Joshua Michael Richardson, 38, reportedly sent an email to St. Michael's Abbey claiming to be the "Angel of Death" and stating he was coming to "do the Lord's reaping." He was later arrested after appearing at the church, where investigators found firearms, high-capacity magazines, a sword, and body armor in his truck. Prosecutors argued successfully that he poses a serious public danger and should be held without bail.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has relieved three deputies of duty amid an investigation into an alleged off-duty assault outside a Santa Clarita bar last year. Parker Seitz, 25, filed a federal lawsuit claiming the deputies violently attacked him, resulting in serious injuries including a fractured jaw and a punctured lung. The lawsuit also alleges a cover-up attempt by department leadership, accusing a then-captain of trying to intimidate Seitz and his family to dissuade them from pressing charges. The Sheriff's Department has stated it takes the allegations seriously and has initiated an internal investigation into the incident.</p>

The city has now opened a 45-day public comment period for residents to provide feedback on the needs-assessment study, which outlines strategies for turning the system around. Key findings show L.A. invests significantly less per capita in its parks than other major cities and faces a deferred maintenance bill of over $2 billion.

          <p>In response to increased federal immigration raids, California's legislature is advancing several bills designed to protect immigrants in sensitive locations like schools and hospitals. One key bill would bar immigration agents from nonpublic areas of a school without a judicial warrant, while another would apply similar restrictions to healthcare facilities to prevent the disclosure of a patient's immigration status. These measures aim to ensure that schools and hospitals remain safe havens where all residents, regardless of legal status, can access education and medical care without fear of detention or deportation. The bills now await consideration by Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>

          <p>School districts across California are navigating the implementation of a recent Supreme Court ruling that allows parents to opt their children out of classroom lessons that conflict with their "sincerely held religious beliefs." The decision, which originated from a lawsuit over LGBTQ+ storybooks in Maryland, is creating uncertainty for educators on how to handle opt-out requests and provide alternative instruction. While state law requires inclusive curricula, conservative groups are encouraging parents to submit broad opt-out requests. School officials and LGBTQ+ advocates worry the ruling could lead to administrative chaos and make some students feel unwelcome and unaccepted in the classroom.</p>

          <p>Recent data indicates that Los Angeles County is making headway in its efforts to combat homelessness, with a 14% decrease in people living on the streets over two years. However, this progress is now at risk due to significant funding reductions from local, state, and federal sources. A slowing economy has reduced sales tax revenue earmarked for homeless services, and this is compounded by state budget cuts and anticipated federal reductions. Service providers are already feeling the impact, with layoffs and the suspension of new applicants for rental subsidy programs, creating a bottleneck that could reverse the recent positive trends.</p>

          <p>The president of the University of California system, James B.

Milliken described the situation as one of the gravest threats in the university's history, stating that a substantial loss of the $17 billion UC receives annually from the federal government would devastate its research, patient care, and student services, leading to massive job losses.</p>

Decades of research confirm that creatine monohydrate can help increase lean muscle mass and improve performance in short, high-intensity exercises when combined with resistance training. However, evidence for other claims, such as boosting brain function or regulating blood sugar, is still emerging and considered less robust by scientists. Experts advise that while the supplement is generally safe for adults, users should choose products certified by a third party and understand that its effects on performance are often modest.</p>
