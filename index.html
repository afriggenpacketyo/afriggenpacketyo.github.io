          <p>Devastating flash floods in central Texas have caused a mass casualty event, with at least 47 people confirmed dead, including 15 children. A significant number of the missing, over two dozen, are from Camp Mystic, a children's summer camp on the Guadalupe River. Rescue efforts are extensive, with over 850 people saved, some found clinging to trees after the river rose with unprecedented speed. The sheer volume of rain was not predicted by weather services, leaving communities with little to no warning before the catastrophic flooding began.</p>

          <p>The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) dispatched a fighter jet to intercept a civilian aircraft that violated a temporary flight restriction over Bedminster, New Jersey. The incident occurred while President Trump was at his nearby property, marking one of five such airspace incursions in a single day. The pilot of the aircraft was non-compliant with radio communications, prompting NORAD to use a standard non-verbal maneuver to escort the plane safely out of the restricted zone. Officials are urging private pilots to be vigilant about checking for temporary flight restrictions before flying.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter performed for a crowd of 65,000 at London's BST Festival, delivering a show that was noticeably toned down from her typically racy performances. While still maintaining her energetic and charming stage presence, she modified some of her more sexually suggestive routines to cater to the diverse, family-friendly audience. This adaptation comes after recent criticism for a pre-watershed TV performance and controversial album artwork. The successful show demonstrated her professionalism and ability to adapt her brand for different contexts while continuing her rapid rise to global stardom.</p>

          <p>At least 43 people have died and more than 20 children from a summer camp are missing after flash floods tore through the Guadalupe River area in Texas. The event has drawn international attention, with hundreds of emergency crews conducting an urgent search for survivors. In response, Texas has requested a federal disaster declaration, which the Trump administration has confirmed it will honor. The crisis has also raised concerns about recent budget cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a key agency for weather forecasting and emergency preparedness.</p>

          <p>England's women's national football team began their Euro 2025 title defense with a disappointing 2-1 loss to France. Pundits and players described the performance as timid and error-prone, with the team being physically dominated and struggling to create chances until late in the game. The defeat puts the Lionesses in a difficult position in their group, needing strong results against the Netherlands and Wales to advance. Manager Sarina Wiegman acknowledged that the team created its own problems, but players remain confident they can recover and still contend for the championship.</p>

While the National Weather Service issued increasingly urgent alerts, many residents and summer camps were caught off guard by the rapid rise of the Guadalupe River. Local officials have defended their actions, stating the rainfall's intensity was unforeseeable, but questions remain about why a more robust, siren-like warning system was never implemented and why evacuations were not ordered sooner.

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's foreign policy approach, suggesting he employs the "Madman Theory," where a leader cultivates an image of unpredictability to gain strategic advantages. This doctrine has been used to pressure allies, such as compelling NATO members to increase defense spending, and to keep adversaries off-balance. However, the strategy carries significant risks, as it can undermine trust and long-term alliances. Critics question whether this approach is a calculated tactic or a reflection of the president's temperament, and whether it can be effective against determined foes like Russia or Iran.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made his first public appearance since the recent 12-day war with Israel, according to Iranian state media. He was shown on television attending a religious ceremony, ending widespread speculation about his health and whereabouts during the conflict. The war, which began with a surprise Israeli attack, saw retaliatory strikes and the killing of top Iranian commanders.

          <p>A new study conducted on women in Los Angeles has found a correlation between exposure to extreme heat and wildfire smoke and negative birth outcomes. The research, summarized in a brief audio report, suggests that these environmental factors, which are becoming more common due to climate change, can have tangible, harmful effects on pregnancies. These findings contribute to a growing body of evidence about the public health risks associated with climate-related events. The study underscores the vulnerability of pregnant individuals and their unborn children to environmental stressors.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party called the "America Party," positioning it as an alternative to the current two-party system. The move follows a public falling out with President Donald Trump, largely over a massive government spending bill that Musk vehemently opposed. Musk, who previously advised the Trump administration, claims the new party will focus on a small number of key congressional races to act as a deciding vote on contentious legislation. This development injects a new layer of unpredictability into the U.S. political landscape.</p>

          <p>Lifeguards in Newport Beach, California, performed 350 water rescues on the July Fourth holiday as powerful rip currents created hazardous swimming conditions.

The National Weather Service had issued warnings for dangerous surf and strong rip currents along the Southern California coast for the holiday weekend.

The delayed aid includes critical air defense missiles and other munitions needed by Ukraine to defend against intensified Russian attacks.
