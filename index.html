          <p>Iran's Foreign Ministry has announced that the country is no longer bound by the restrictions imposed by the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the landmark nuclear deal officially expired. This agreement had previously capped Iran's nuclear activities and uranium stockpiles in exchange for sanctions relief from world powers. The expiration follows years of stalled negotiations to revive the deal after the United States withdrew in 2018, leading to renewed international sanctions and heightened geopolitical tensions.</p>

The article reports that groups like "UAW Labor for Palestine" are positioning their agenda, which includes calls to stop arming Israel, within the larger protest framework. This alignment is highlighted as a strategic shift, linking international conflicts to domestic political dissent in the United States.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has described the current high tariffs on Chinese goods as "not sustainable," even while defending them as a necessary response to Beijing's trade practices. His comments come as U.S. and Chinese officials prepare for a new round of trade talks next week in Malaysia, aimed at de-escalating the economic conflict. The negotiations seek to find a truce before a November 10th deadline, after which duties could be further increased. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study has shown that the Galleri blood test can accurately detect more than 50 different types of cancer, potentially revolutionizing early diagnosis. In a trial involving 25,000 adults, the test identified cancer in nearly one in 100 participants, with over half of the cases found at an early, more treatable stage. The test was particularly effective for cancers that currently have no screening programs, and it correctly identified the cancer's origin in most positive cases.</p>

          <p>Turkish Cypriots are heading to the polls to elect a new leader in what is being seen as a referendum on the future of the divided island.

The election's outcome will significantly impact the stalled peace negotiations and the community's relationship with both Turkey and the European Union.</p>

          <p>A 31-year-old woman from Newport, Charlotte Morjaria, discovered she had a large, cancerous kidney tumor after a minor accident during a holiday weekend at Butlin's.

          <p>Finland's President, Alexander Stubb, has stated that he believes Donald Trump is the "only one who can force" Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table to end the war in Ukraine. In an interview with the BBC, Stubb suggested that compelling Russia to negotiate requires "the stick" rather than "the carrot," a role he feels Trump can uniquely play. His comments provide a key European perspective on the diplomatic landscape as Trump engages in direct talks with both the Ukrainian and Russian leaders.</p>
