          <h2>BP Shares Surge as Activist Investor Elliott Builds Stake</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 04:49:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>BP shares experienced a significant jump after activist investor Elliott disclosed a stake exceeding 5% in the company. This move signals potential pressure on BP to reconsider its green strategy and refocus on its core oil and gas businesses, as Elliott was rumored to have acquired a stake back in February. BP had previously announced plans to increase fossil fuel investments to $10 billion through 2027, marking a shift from its earlier commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050. The change in strategy has led to reduced support for CEO Murray Auchincloss and outgoing Chair Helge Lund during the board re-election vote. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Negotiations are ongoing to resolve a strike by Birmingham bin workers, now in its seventh week, which has led to significant waste accumulation in the city. The strike, prompted by disputes over pay and jobs, resulted in a major incident declaration due to public health and environmental concerns. While the council claims to have removed 26,000 tonnes of rubbish and resumed regular collections, the Unite union seeks written confirmation of council promises. The government has urged both parties to negotiate in good faith and offered logistical support, although military intervention is deemed unnecessary.</p>

          <p>London talks aimed at securing a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia have been downgraded, with key US officials no longer participating. This comes amid speculation that Russia may be willing to halt its invasion along current front lines in exchange for concessions, including US recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has rejected recognizing Crimea as Russian territory. Meanwhile, Russia has reportedly broken its own temporary ceasefire for the Easter weekend, and attacks on civilian infrastructure continue.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced he will significantly reduce his involvement in the US Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) following a substantial drop in Tesla's profits and sales. Tesla reported a 20% decrease in car sales and a 70% profit decline, attributing some of the challenges to "changing political sentiment" and trade policies. Musk's political activities have faced criticism and boycotts, though he defends his work at Doge as critical.

          <p>The IMF and World Bank face uncertainty as President Trump reviews US-funded international organizations, potentially threatening US backing. Project 2025 proposes a US withdrawal from both institutions, labeling them "expensive middlemen."

          <p>A new report indicates that coral bleaching is affecting 84% of the world's coral reefs, the highest level ever recorded, primarily due to rising ocean temperatures caused by climate change. Scientists warn that this crisis, the fourth global bleaching event since 1998, is more intense than previous events, increasing the risk of disease and starvation for corals. Experts emphasize the need to reduce human emissions from fossil fuels to protect coral reefs and prevent their potential disappearance, which would have devastating consequences for biodiversity and human livelihoods.</p>

          <p>Increased regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. is raising concerns about the potential delisting of Chinese stocks. A White House memo calling for a review of U.S. investments in Chinese entities and renewed scrutiny of publicly traded Chinese companies has heightened these fears. The House Select Committee on China has also demanded investment banks withdraw from underwriting the Hong Kong IPO of a Chinese battery giant. The SEC is being urged to enforce existing rules and create new ones to address these concerns, potentially leading to faster delisting.</p>
