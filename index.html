          <p>Cisco announced fiscal fourth-quarter results that slightly surpassed analyst predictions for both earnings and revenue, with revenue growing 7.6% year-over-year to $14.67 billion. The company also issued an optimistic forecast for the upcoming fiscal year, projecting revenue between $59 billion and $60 billion, aligning with market expectations. A significant driver of this performance is the growing demand for AI infrastructure, with Cisco reporting $800 million in AI-related orders from web companies in the quarter alone. Despite the positive results and strong AI pipeline, the company's stock experienced a slight dip in after-hours trading. (not investment advice)</p>

The alleged incidents, which reportedly occurred within the hotel, have prompted significant local concern, as the location has been a site of anti-migrant protests. In response, the local MP has called for the hotel's immediate closure for community safety and has contacted the Home Office for reassurance on safeguarding measures. The Home Office stated it is changing laws to deny asylum to individuals convicted of sexual offenses and will pursue their deportation.</p>

The tree fell onto their car due to saturated ground, and a fourth flooding-related death was also confirmed in Hamilton County. The extreme weather prompted dozens of water rescues and over 100 evacuations in the region, with some areas receiving more than six inches of rain.

          <p>Air Canada has announced it will begin canceling flights starting Thursday in anticipation of a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants. The airline issued a lockout notice after the union provided a 72-hour strike notice, indicating a complete shutdown of operations is possible by the weekend if no agreement is reached. The main points of contention in the contract negotiations are wages and unpaid labor, with the union rejecting the airline's latest offer and a proposal for binding arbitration. Customers with canceled flights will be eligible for a full refund as the airline works to arrange alternative travel options.</p>

          <p>A 40-year-old New York man has been arrested and charged with cyberstalking for allegedly leaving a series of threatening and profane voicemails for the widow of Brian Thompson, the UnitedHealthcare CEO who was fatally shot in December. The messages, left just hours after Thompson's death, reportedly celebrated the killing and contained warnings of further violence against the family. Investigators traced the calls to the suspect's personal cellphone, and he now faces up to five years in prison if convicted. The case highlights the intense public anger directed at the health care industry following Thompson's high-profile murder.</p>

His lawyers claim he diverted to the island due to an in-flight emergency involving equipment failure and severe icing, and that he received permission to land from a Chilean official. The prolonged detention has reportedly caused a severe decline in the pilot's health, including significant weight loss and a heart condition.</p>

          <p>For individuals overwhelmed by debt, enrolling in a debt relief program can provide a structured path forward, but proper preparation is crucial for success. This article outlines four essential steps to take before committing to a program, starting with a comprehensive review of all debts, income, and expenses to understand the full financial picture. It is also vital to research and understand how different debt relief options, like settlement or consolidation, will impact personal finances, including credit scores and potential tax liabilities. Finally, creating a realistic monthly budget and pausing all new credit activity are critical for ensuring consistent payments and achieving long-term financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study predicts that global reindeer populations could face a substantial decline by the end of the century, with some herds, particularly the North American caribou, potentially shrinking by up to 80%. Researchers from the University of Adelaide and the University of Copenhagen used fossil records and computer models to analyze how reindeer have responded to past climate warming events. They concluded that future losses due to climate change are likely to be more severe than historical declines, which have already seen a two-thirds reduction in global populations over the last three decades. The decline could have cascading ecological effects, including reduced plant diversity and accelerated carbon release from Arctic soils.</p>

The complaint asserts that EWS was aware of these vulnerabilities, including a quick registration process and lack of verification, but did not enforce meaningful anti-fraud rules on its partner banks.

A recent jobs report showed a significant slowdown, prompting concerns about a potential economic downturn that a rate cut could help prevent. The decision is complicated by potential tariff-induced inflation, but recent figures have eased some of those fears, giving the Fed more room to act. The central bank also continues to face public pressure from President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly called for lower rates to boost the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has also launched a self-funded, fast-track review of evidence on the health threats of greenhouse gases to inform the EPA's decision. These actions come amid concerns over the administration deleting climate data from government websites and promoting unproven viewpoints on environmental issues.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, 82, has revealed that he was diagnosed with Stage 4 melanoma in 2010 and has since overcome the cancer. He credited his recovery to an experimental trial drug known as PD-1 therapy, which he described as a "miracle" treatment received at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Over the following decade, Jones underwent multiple surgeries on his lungs and lymph nodes but now reports that he is tumor-free. The first public mention of his diagnosis came in a new Netflix docuseries about the Cowboys, which prompted a follow-up interview where he shared more details about his health battle.</p>

          <p>Walmart announced it is expanding its 10% employee discount to cover nearly all grocery items, including milk, meat, and frozen foods, effective immediately. Previously, the discount on most food items was only available during the holiday season. The move, which affects approximately 1.6 million U.S. employees, comes as rising tariffs spark renewed concerns about inflation and higher consumer prices. In a memo to employees, the company stated the expansion was one of its most requested benefits. The expanded discount could also serve to boost Walmart's own sales and help with employee retention in a competitive labor market.</p>

          <p>A divided federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration is permitted to suspend or terminate billions of dollars in foreign aid that had been appropriated by Congress. The 2-1 decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a lower court's injunction that had previously forced the administration to release the funds. The majority opinion stated that the grant recipients challenging the freeze did not have the legal standing to bring their claims. The ruling impacts nearly $4 billion for global health programs and over $6 billion for HIV/AIDS programs, which President Trump had sought to freeze as part of his foreign policy agenda.</p>

          <p>A recent report from Intercontinental Exchange reveals that U.S. homeowners have reached a record $17.8 trillion in total home equity, with approximately 48 million mortgage holders possessing tappable funds. The average homeowner now holds around $213,000 in accessible equity, which can be borrowed through financial products like home equity loans or HELOCs. To calculate available equity, homeowners can subtract their current mortgage balance from their home's market value, with lenders typically allowing them to borrow up to 80% of that amount. Homeowners are cautioned to borrow responsibly as their property serves as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

At a 4.40% APY, a money market account would earn $2,200 in a year, while a high-yield savings account at 4.35% would earn $2,175.

The floodwaters have threatened homes, prompted evacuations, and led to the closure of the Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area. This has become a recurring and worsening problem due to climate change, with this year's flood surpassing the previous records set in 2023 and 2024, despite the installation of temporary flood barriers.</p>
