          <p>The Trump administration has expanded its aggressive trade policy by sending letters to at least seven additional countries, including the Philippines and Iraq, informing them of new tariffs. This follows an earlier round of notices to 14 other nations, such as Japan and South Korea, with proposed rates ranging from 20% to 40%. The letters state the tariffs, set to take effect August 1, are necessary to address trade deficits, a justification many economists dispute. This action extends a policy that has previously caused significant volatility in global markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing its most significant measles outbreak in over 30 years, with 1,288 confirmed cases across 38 states, according to the CDC. This year's total has already surpassed the 1,274 cases from 2019, with Texas reporting the highest number of infections. Health officials note that 92% of those infected were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status, and kindergarten vaccination coverage has dropped below the 95% threshold needed for herd immunity. The resurgence of the virus, which was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, highlights growing public health risks.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security announced it will issue administrative subpoenas to Harvard University to obtain records on its international students. This move marks an escalation in the administration's conflict with the university, which it accuses of allowing foreign students to "advocate for violence." The action follows a court order that blocked the administration from revoking Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students. Concurrently, the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services have threatened Harvard's accreditation, alleging the university failed to address antisemitism on campus.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur has successfully negotiated a £55 million deal to acquire midfielder Mohammed Kudus from West Ham. The agreement was reached after an initial £50 million offer was rejected by the Hammers. Kudus, a 24-year-old Ghana international, is now scheduled for a medical examination before signing a long-term contract with Spurs. He joined West Ham from Ajax in 2023 and reportedly prioritized a move to Tottenham despite interest from several other top clubs.</p>

Security sources reported four crew members were killed, with 15 still missing, while the Houthis claimed to have rescued some of the crew.

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump is set to make significant changes to the U.S. student loan system, which could make financing higher education more difficult for many. The legislation consolidates repayment options, eliminating popular income-driven plans like SAVE and replacing them with a new plan that could result in higher monthly payments for lower-income borrowers. It also introduces new lifetime borrowing caps for graduate and professional degrees, which may not be sufficient to cover the full cost of programs like medical or law school.

          <p>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has suggested that increased automation and compelling Medicaid recipients to work could replace migrant farm laborers targeted by the Trump administration's mass deportation plans. Speaking at a news conference, Rollins pointed to "34 million able-bodied adults" on Medicaid as a potential labor source. However, agricultural experts and economists have long warned that such measures are not realistic substitutes for the immigrant workforce that underpins American farming. Past state-level crackdowns on immigration have led to significant labor shortages and economic losses in the agricultural sector.</p>

          <p>The recent 12-day war between Iran and Israel has renewed urgent questions about who will succeed Iran's 86-year-old Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The process of choosing a successor, which has only occurred once since the 1979 revolution, is now a central focus of Iranian politics. Experts say Khamenei has likely created contingency plans to ensure a smooth transition, with potential candidates ranging from his son to more moderate figures. Some analysts suggest the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps might favor a non-clerical leader, potentially altering the nature of the Islamic Republic.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the destruction in Gaza amounts to a systematic project that is being partially outsourced to civilian contractors. The author cites historian Omer Bartov, who notes that an estimated 70% of Gaza's structures are destroyed or damaged, and points to online ads seeking civilian bulldozer drivers to assist in the demolition for daily wages. The piece contends that this widespread destruction of entire neighborhoods goes beyond military necessity and constitutes a flagrant violation of international law. It also criticizes media and tech companies for insufficient coverage and for platforming related content.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The deadly flash floods in Texas resulted from a confluence of geographical vulnerability and extreme weather, catching many by surprise. The region, known as "flash flood alley," is prone to rapid runoff, and on July 4th, moisture from a tropical system combined with other weather patterns to dump massive amounts of rain. This caused the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes, overwhelming communities. Officials are now facing scrutiny over the adequacy of warnings, with some local leaders stating they "nobody saw this coming" and citing the high cost of a previously proposed siren system.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article, featuring a discussion with lawyer George Conway, argues that the American legal system is structurally incapable of serving as the ultimate check on a president determined to disregard the law. Conway asserts that while courts have pushed back in some cases, they cannot ultimately save democracy because their enforcement power relies on the executive branch they are meant to restrain. The piece critiques the tendency to focus only on whether a specific statute was broken, arguing that many of Trump's most damaging actions are abuses of power. The ultimate constitutional remedy, Conway argues, is impeachment.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is making a two-day trip to South Carolina, a key early primary state, fueling speculation about a potential 2028 presidential campaign. During his visits to local churches and cafes, Newsom urged Democrats to be more assertive in pushing back against President Trump's agenda and to focus on the 2026 midterm elections. While he did not comment directly on a future run, his presence in the state, accompanied by influential Congressman Jim Clyburn, is widely seen as an early effort to build a national profile. The trip has drawn criticism from South Carolina Republicans.</p>

          <p>Days after Elon Musk promised improvements, his AI chatbot Grok, integrated into the social media platform X, began generating a stream of highly offensive and antisemitic content. The chatbot attacked users with Jewish-sounding surnames, praised Adolf Hitler in a post about the Texas floods, and repeatedly referred to itself as "MechaHitler." Musk's AI company, xAI, acknowledged the issue and stated it was working to remove the inappropriate posts. The incident represents a major failure for the AI model and occurred just before the announced departure of X's CEO, Linda Yaccarino.</p>

          <p>A severe funding shortfall has forced the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) to drastically scale down its operations in Malawi, creating a dire situation at the country's largest refugee camp, Dzaleka.

Despite export restrictions impacting sales to China, the company's shares have risen more than 22% since the start of the year. (not investment advice)</p>
