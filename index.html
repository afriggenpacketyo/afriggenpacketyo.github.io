          <p>An editorial in the People's Liberation Army Daily, the official newspaper of China's military, has asserted that eradicating corruption is essential for achieving victory in future wars. Following a recent Communist Party conclave that reaffirmed the anti-corruption campaign, the article stressed the importance of political loyalty and ideological indoctrination within the armed forces. The piece frames the ongoing drive against corruption as a critical component of the PLA's modernization and its goal of enhancing advanced combat capabilities, stating the army must not shelter corrupt individuals.</p>

          <p>An article excerpted from a book by Ray D. Madoff details the methods used by the ultra-wealthy to minimize their tax obligations, undermining the progressive intent of the U.S. income and estate tax systems. It explains how billionaires often avoid taxable income by taking minimal salaries and instead building wealth through untaxed stock appreciation, which they can borrow against for cash. The piece also describes how a well-funded campaign has effectively dismantled the estate tax through legal loopholes, contributing to growing wealth concentration and dynastic fortunes in America.</p>

          <p>Germany's Foreign Minister, Johann Wadephul, has postponed a planned diplomatic visit to China after Beijing only confirmed a single meeting with his counterpart, Wang Yi. A German Foreign Office spokesperson expressed regret over the development, which comes amid rising tensions over several issues, including Germany's stance on Taiwan and China's new export controls on rare-earth technology. This would have been the first visit by a minister from Chancellor Friedrich Merz's new government, highlighting the complex diplomatic relationship between the two economic powers.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced the immediate termination of trade talks with Canada, citing an advertisement sponsored by the province of Ontario that was critical of his tariff policies. The ad featured a 1987 speech by former President Ronald Reagan arguing against trade barriers, which Trump labeled as "FAKE" and "egregious" on social media. This move escalates trade tensions between the two nations, which have been strained by U.S. tariffs on Canadian imports like steel and automobiles, and complicates efforts by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney to negotiate relief.</p>

          <p>A senior UK national security official, Matthew Collins, revealed in a letter to MPs that he removed the word "enemy" when describing China in a witness statement for a major spying case. The change was made because the term did not align with the official government policy under the then-Conservative administration. This disclosure comes as the current Labour government faces accusations of weakening the case, which was recently dropped against two men. The letter suggests the key evidentiary issue predated the current government, shifting scrutiny back to the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James is scheduled for arraignment in a Virginia federal court on charges of bank fraud, to which she is expected to plead not guilty. The Justice Department indictment alleges she misrepresented the intended use of a home she purchased to secure a more favorable mortgage rate, treating it as an investment property rather than a second home. James and her legal team have called the charges baseless and politically motivated, suggesting they are an act of revenge by President Trump, whose administration appointed the prosecutor overseeing the case.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Mississippi has struck down a Biden-era regulation that extended federal anti-discrimination protections in healthcare to include gender identity. The ruling by Judge Louis Guirola Jr. stated that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) overstepped its authority by redefining "sex" under Title IX to encompass gender identity. The decision came in response to a lawsuit filed by a coalition of 15 Republican-led states, which argued the rule would unlawfully force states to cover certain gender-affirming treatments and intrude on their authority to regulate healthcare.</p>

          <p>German law enforcement is facing a significant challenge from the surge in synthetic drugs, including amphetamines and new psychoactive substances like ketamine and potent opioids. In 2024, police seized over 1,800 kilograms of these substances, more than triple the amount from the previous year, with officials warning about labs capable of producing tons of drugs in weeks. Federal Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt highlighted the dramatic rise in both cocaine and synthetic drug cases. The report also notes a growing online market for dangerous, untested "research chemicals" like nitazene opioids.</p>

          <p>Stephany Gauffeny, the widow of Miguel García-Hernández who was shot and killed outside a Dallas ICE facility in September, has shared her story of grief and hardship. García-Hernández, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, was in a government van awaiting intake when a gunman attacked the facility. Gauffeny gave birth to their third child just three days after her husband's death and now faces an uncertain future, including the potential loss of their recently purchased home. She believes rising anti-immigrant sentiment played a role in the tragedy that has devastated her family.</p>

          <p>An online fundraising campaign for Janice Johnston, a Republican member of the Georgia state election board, is raising ethical concerns due to its acceptance of anonymous donations. The campaign was established by another local election official with ties to the "election integrity" movement, who also has business before the state board. Critics argue this creates a significant conflict of interest, as individuals with cases pending before the board have publicly donated, potentially influencing future rulings. The funds are for Johnston's legal defense in a lawsuit accusing her of withholding public records.</p>

          <p>A review of the new film "Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere" argues that it reduces the creation of the seminal 1982 album "Nebraska" to a simplistic narrative of paternal conflict. The film, starring Jeremy Allen White, frames the album's dark, acoustic songs as a direct result of Springsteen processing trauma from his difficult relationship with his father. The critic contends that this autobiographical focus overlooks the album's broader engagement with American musical traditions and iconography, such as folk ballads and outlaw stories, ultimately underselling the scope of Springsteen's artistic achievement.</p>

          <p>The historic East Wing of the White House, first built in 1902, has been completely demolished to make way for a new $300 million ballroom championed by President Donald Trump. The rapid and largely unannounced demolition has raised legal and ethical questions, particularly as it occurred during a government shutdown when oversight commissions are closed. The project is reportedly being funded by private donations from individuals and major corporations, a model that critics argue creates potential conflicts of interest.

The result is a major blow to Labour, which finished a distant third, and a setback for Reform UK, which came in second despite a strong campaign. Plaid Cymru's success is attributed to positioning itself as the primary alternative for change and focusing on issues like funding and healthcare rather than Welsh independence. The outcome reshapes the political landscape in Wales ahead of the full Senedd election in May.</p>

Before these incidents, bears had already killed a record nine people in Japan this year.

          <p>An article examines Philip Pullman's "Book of Dust" trilogy, a companion to his controversial "His Dark Materials" series, in the context of modern book-banning debates. While the original series was frequently banned for its anti-religious themes, the new books explore the danger of ideas from a different angle, portraying a world where relativist philosophies cause people to become estranged from their souls. The analysis suggests Pullman believes some books can be dangerous, but the solution is not censorship, but rather countering harmful narratives with better, truer stories that value our material world and embodied experiences.</p>

The case sought to invalidate the party's 2023 congress, where a new leader was elected, by alleging procedural violations and vote-buying. CHP officials have maintained that the legal action was a politically motivated attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's government to undermine them using the judiciary.

          <p>While the U.S. economy has not yet suffered major damage from the ongoing government shutdown, some economists warn that a prolonged impasse could pose a significant risk. A lengthy shutdown could exhaust the savings of furloughed workers, reduce consumer spending, and create uncertainty due to the lack of federal economic data, potentially tipping the economy into a recession. Other experts downplay the threat, arguing the direct financial impact is relatively small. However, most agree that the shutdown acts as an additional headwind for an economy already facing challenges from inflation and a hiring slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>
