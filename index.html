          <p>A massive $100 billion investment by Nvidia into OpenAI has triggered a significant rally in semiconductor stocks worldwide. The deal, which involves OpenAI building systems requiring immense power and millions of Nvidia GPUs, boosted shares for related companies like TSMC in Taiwan and SK Hynix in South Korea. This development is seen by analysts as a strong indicator of the continued health and growth potential of the artificial intelligence sector, benefiting a wide range of suppliers in the ecosystem.

          <p>The Trump administration's proposal to impose a $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications is causing significant alarm within the American startup and venture capital communities. Founders and investors argue that such a high cost would disproportionately harm early-stage companies, which rely on skilled foreign workers to innovate and scale but lack the resources of larger corporations to absorb the fee. This policy could stifle recruitment, reduce venture capital investment in U.S. tech, and potentially encourage international talent to seek opportunities in other countries.

The production stoppage, costing the company an estimated £50 million per week, has raised serious concerns about the financial stability of its extensive supply chain.

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to deliver a major speech at the United Nations General Assembly, focusing on American strength and his vision for global institutions.

Trump is also set to hold bilateral meetings with several world leaders, where he is expected to reiterate his administration's positions on these critical conflicts.</p>

          <p>Provisional results from Guinea's constitutional referendum show that over 90% of voters have approved a new constitution. The vote was called by military leader General Mamady Doumbouya, who seized power in a 2021 coup. The new constitution is controversial as it would allow military members to run for office and extend presidential terms from five to seven years. The country's main opposition leaders called for a boycott of the vote, leading to a nearly non-existent "no" campaign amid a broader crackdown on political dissent.</p>

          <p>Algerian writer Kamel Daoud, now living under police protection in France, is facing threats for his new novel "Houris," which explores the massacres of the Algerian civil war in the 1990s. The book, which won France's prestigious Prix Goncourt, has been banned in Algeria, where discussion of the war is forbidden by a "national reconciliation" law. Daoud has been targeted with international arrest warrants by the Algerian regime and accusations of Islamophobia for his feminist perspective and depiction of the conflict's impact on women.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle, currently a major storm in the Atlantic, is forecast to weaken as it travels east but could still impact the UK's weather this weekend. While computer models disagree on its exact path, there is a possibility that the remnants of the hurricane will bring extremely wet and windy conditions to parts of Europe, potentially including Great Britain. This comes after an already soggy September in the UK, with some areas having already received double their average monthly rainfall, although a period of high pressure is expected to bring drier weather beforehand.</p>
