          <p>President Donald Trump has stated his intention to personally join police and military forces in patrolling Washington, D.C., citing what he describes as a crime emergency in the nation's capital. This move follows his recent mobilization of the National Guard to assist local police in addressing the declared crime surge. The announcement comes shortly after Vice President JD Vance and other administration officials were met with protests during a visit with National Guard members at Union Station, highlighting the tense political climate surrounding the federal presence. The article notes this is a developing story.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice will investigate Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook based on a criminal referral from a Trump administration housing official. The referral, initiated by FHFA Director Bill Pulte, alleges potential mortgage fraud, which Cook has publicly denied while stating she is gathering facts to address any legitimate questions. This action occurs amidst significant public pressure from President Trump for Cook's resignation, part of a broader criticism of the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies and its leadership. The letter from the DOJ also urged her removal, a power reserved for the president.</p>

The Kansas City Police Department reported that two other bullets also struck the facility and that the case is being investigated as an aggravated assault.

          <p>A Memphis jury has found Hernandez Govan not guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy in the 2021 killing of rapper Young Dolph. Prosecutors had alleged that Govan organized the fatal shooting at a local bakery, but the jury was not convinced by the evidence, which included testimony from one of the admitted shooters. Govan's defense questioned the police investigation and argued that cellphone communications did not directly incriminate their client. The acquittal marks a significant turn in a high-profile case that has highlighted rivalries within the Memphis rap scene.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's third-largest steelworks, Speciality Steels UK, has been placed under government control after a court ordered its liquidation due to hundreds of millions of pounds in debt. This move creates uncertainty for nearly 1,500 workers in Rotherham and Sheffield, though the government has committed to covering wages while a new buyer is sought. The company, part of Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty Steel empire, was deemed "hopelessly insolvent" following the 2021 collapse of its primary lender, Greensill Capital, which destabilized its finances and led to this intervention.</p>

          <p>A New York appellate court has thrown out the approximately $527 million financial penalty against President Trump and his co-defendants in his civil fraud case, ruling the fine was "excessive" and violated the Eighth Amendment.

New York Attorney General Letitia James has announced her office will appeal the decision to the state's highest court, emphasizing the ruling still found that the president violated the law.</p>

          <p>Leading House Democrats Jamie Raskin and Frank Pallone are investigating the $8 billion merger between Paramount and Skydance Media, questioning whether the companies conceded to improper demands from President Trump to secure regulatory approval. The probe focuses on a $16 million settlement Paramount paid to end Trump's lawsuit against CBS News, which the lawmakers suggest could be an "illegal bribe" in exchange for the FCC's blessing of the deal. The representatives have requested internal communications involving Trump, the White House, and the FCC to determine if corruption influenced the merger's approval.</p>

This marks the third price hike for the service in three years, following similar increases by competitors like Netflix and Peacock as the industry faces pressure to improve profitability. The annual subscription price and the cost of Apple One bundles, which include Apple TV+, will remain unchanged. The move comes amid reports that the streaming service, while popular, continues to operate at a significant financial loss for the company.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is actively recruiting its civilian employees to volunteer for deployments supporting the mass deportation operations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). An internal email and job posting call for staff to join a "volunteer force" to assist ICE and Customs and Border Protection with duties like data entry and logistics. This initiative stems from a June memorandum authorizing civilian details to the Department of Homeland Security to help fulfill the administration's immigration enforcement priorities. The move aligns with a broader push to expand ICE's personnel and infrastructure across the country.</p>

          <p>This article challenges the growing revisionist narrative that pandemic-era restrictions like lockdowns and school closures were known to be ineffective and did more harm than good. It argues that this view misrepresents the pre-pandemic scientific consensus and misinterprets data, such as Sweden's mortality rates, which improved largely due to a successful vaccine rollout. While acknowledging that some measures, particularly school closures, lasted too long, the author contends that dismissing all non-pharmaceutical interventions as useless is a dangerous overcorrection that could leave society unprepared for future, potentially deadlier, pandemics.</p>

          <p>The Mayan, a beloved downtown Los Angeles theater, is permanently closing after 35 years, marking the end of an era for the venue and its signature show, Lucha VaVoom. The unique spectacle, which combines Mexican professional wrestling with burlesque, will hold its final performance at the Mayan before seeking a new home. The venue's president cited five years of unrelenting adversity as the reason for the closure. For over two decades, the Mayan has been the home for Lucha VaVoom's extravagant and absurd showcases, creating a deep connection between the performers and the historic location.</p>

Unlike savings accounts with variable rates, CDs lock in a rate for the entire term, providing predictable growth for savers who do not need immediate access to their funds.

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. increased by 2% in July, contrary to analyst expectations of a decline, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.01 million units. The rise is attributed to a temporary dip in mortgage rates during May and June when these sales contracts were likely signed. Housing inventory also grew by 15.7% year-over-year, reaching its highest level since May 2020, which is helping to ease pressure on prices. The median home price saw a minimal 0.2% annual increase, suggesting the market may be approaching an inflection point. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This photo essay delves into the varied and complex lives of parents after their children have left home, a phase commonly known as the "empty nest." Through intimate portraits and interviews with 14 individuals and couples in Los Angeles County, the project reveals that this transition is not a singular experience of loss. For some, it is a period of rediscovery and freedom, while for others it brings loneliness or is complicated by children who return home. The stories highlight that the term "empty" often fails to capture the rich emotional landscape of grief, relief, and reinvention that defines this stage of life.</p>

The prosecution described the service as a "cult," where Brain exploited his power, leading to the movement's collapse in 1995 amid the initial allegations.

These lessons include having faith in the future, embracing discomfort as a catalyst for growth, and seeking deeper spiritual happiness over fleeting physical pleasures. The teachings also emphasize that true well-being comes from making others happy and adhering to timeless virtues rather than chasing novel trends. The author notes that these principles are consistent with findings from social science on post-traumatic growth and the psychological benefits of altruism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new philanthropic trend, termed "moral offsetting," suggests that individuals who feel guilty about eating meat can donate to anti-factory farming charities as an alternative to changing their diet. This concept, likened to carbon offsets, was popularized by a recent successful fundraiser that raised over $2 million for the cause. Proponents argue it's a pragmatic way to fund a resource-poor movement, given that few people are willing to go vegan. However, critics worry it may absolve consumers of personal responsibility and reinforce the low value placed on the lives of farmed animals.</p>
