          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have placed pitcher Tyler Glasnow on the injured list due to shoulder inflammation, raising concerns about his health and the team's pitching rotation. Glasnow, who had previously expressed optimism about his new mechanics, experienced a "grabbing" sensation in his shoulder during his last start. The team is unsure about the timeline for his return and is reevaluating his delivery to prevent further injuries. This setback adds to the Dodgers' pitching challenges, with several other key players also sidelined with injuries.</p>

This proposal aims to reduce sugar content in these beverages and tackle obesity. The government is also consulting on reducing the maximum sugar content allowed in drinks before they are subject to the levy. The exemption for milk-based drinks was initially included due to concerns about calcium consumption, but the government now believes the harms from excess sugar outweigh the health benefits.</p>
