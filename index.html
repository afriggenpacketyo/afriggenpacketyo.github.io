            <p>Liverpool has secured a Champions League spot and needs six more points to clinch the Premier League title, with Arsenal close behind. England is guaranteed five Champions League slots due to UEFA coefficients, and winners of the Champions League and Europa League also gain automatic entry. The sixth-placed Premier League team and the FA Cup winners will qualify for the Europa League, while the Carabao Cup winner gets a Conference League spot, potentially reverting to the league. Southampton is already relegated from the Premier League, with Leicester and Wolves at risk of relegation as well.</p>

            <p>Patrick Crusius, the gunman responsible for the 2019 El Paso Walmart shooting that killed 23 people, will plead guilty to capital murder charges, receiving a life sentence without parole. This plea deal avoids the death penalty on state charges, following his prior sentencing to 90 consecutive life sentences in federal court for hate crime and weapons charges. The attack targeted Hispanic shoppers, with Crusius expressing racist views in an online manifesto, and the plea aims to bring closure to the victims' families after years of legal proceedings.</p>

            <p>The snail slime beauty boom raises ethical questions about the treatment of snails, as the industry assures consumers that the snails are well-treated, even when stimulated to secrete slime through methods that can be stressful. Despite industry assurances, some studies reveal potentially harmful extraction methods, including electrical stimulation and force, leading to calls for more ethical practices. As the market for snail beauty products is projected to reach $3.4 billion by 2034, animal welfare organizations are trying to raise awareness about the potential cruelty involved in the process.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's demands for Harvard University to reorganize its governance and hire faculty to address a perceived lack of viewpoint diversity is criticized as political bullying. The article argues that imposing political authority over academic life and introducing affirmative action for conservatives undermines the principles of scholarly objectivity and freedom of expression. It suggests that fostering genuine diversity of opinion requires encouraging intellectual engagement and the capacity to consider multiple perspectives, rather than mandating political balance through state intervention.</p>

            <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has asserted that the government will strengthen its environmental agenda and has accused those who oppose the move to net zero emissions of spreading "nonsense and lies". He argued that transitioning to clean energy will enhance social justice and national security, referencing the energy market disruptions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Miliband criticized opponents, including some Conservatives and Reform UK members, for allegedly prioritizing ideological agendas over addressing climate change and energy insecurity.</p>
