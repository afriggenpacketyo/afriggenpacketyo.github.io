          <p>This New York Times article analyzes President Putin's efforts to negotiate a peace deal in Ukraine while maintaining a hard-line stance, which has faced resistance from Ukraine, the EU, and initially the US. While President Trump expressed support for direct peace talks, he emphasized that economic rapprochement with Russia would only occur after peace is established in Ukraine, potentially delaying Russia's goals of Western sanction relief and foreign investment. The article suggests Putin believes time is on his side, maintaining oil prices and avoiding a financial crisis despite a slowing economy, which allows Russia to continue its military efforts in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Taku Eto resigned as Japan's farm minister after admitting he doesn't buy rice due to receiving it from supporters, sparking public anger amid soaring rice prices. Prime Minister Ishiba appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as his replacement, a move that comes before a House of Councillors election this summer and follows public support for Ishiba's Cabinet plummeting to its lowest level since he took office. Eto's comments came shortly after the Agriculture Ministry decided to release additional rice from emergency stockpiles in an attempt to bring down the price of rice, which has doubled from a year earlier.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has implemented temporary flight restrictions at Newark Liberty International Airport due to recent technology outages, staffing shortages among air traffic controllers, and ongoing runway construction.

United Airlines, the airport's largest operator, supports the restrictions, having already reduced its schedule.

          <p>Senator Marsha Blackburn introduced the Ban Birth Tourism Act to prevent foreign nationals from using tourist visas to give birth in the United States for the purpose of obtaining automatic citizenship for their children. The bill seeks to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act, declaring such individuals inadmissible, while protecting legitimate medical travelers. Blackburn argues that birth tourism exploits immigration laws and allows foreign nationals, including those from adversarial nations, to essentially buy American citizenship. The push aligns with the Trump administration's focus on restoring immigration integrity and ending automatic citizenship for children of illegal immigrants and tourists.</p>

          <p>A new report by ICF predicts a significant increase in electricity demand in the United States, potentially rising by 78% by 2050, which could strain grid reliability and affordability. The report cites rising temperatures, emerging technologies, and cryptocurrency mining as key drivers of this surge. Retail electricity costs are also projected to double by 2050. Grid operators are sounding alarms about meeting peak demand during elevated summer temperatures, and experts forecast a 6% jump in electricity costs for 2025, averaging $784 per household during the summer period.</p>

Recommendations include safety checks in halls, discouraging tributes at suicide sites, and better support for struggling students. Families should be more involved after a student's death. The review examined 169 cases and found many incidents occurred in university housing. A legal duty of care for universities was considered but faced challenges.</p>

          <p>Japan's export growth slowed for the second month in a row due to U.S. tariffs imposed by President Trump. Exports grew by 2%, in line with estimates, but imports shrank by 2.2%. Japan's GDP contracted in the first quarter, partly due to slowing exports. The country faces tariffs on auto, steel, and aluminum exports to the U.S. The trade deficit narrowed, but exports to China and the U.S. declined.</p>

The Trump administration announced plans to penalize those living in the U.S. illegally under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, a law that has rarely been enforced. She is a mother of three U.S. citizen children who would be qualifying relatives as they would suffer extreme and exceptionally unusual hardships if she were deported.</p>
