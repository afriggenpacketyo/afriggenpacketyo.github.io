          <p>An office cleaner, Sebije Nelovic, has shared her harrowing experience of coming face-to-face with the gunman during the recent mass shooting in a Midtown Manhattan high-rise. Nelovic, 65, was working on the 33rd floor when she heard gunshots and was confronted by the shooter, who pointed an AR-15-style rifle at her. She identified herself as a cleaner and managed to escape, hiding in a locked closet for hours while the attack continued. The gunman, who killed four people before taking his own life, may have been targeting the NFL headquarters but went to the wrong floor. This personal account provides a direct perspective on the terror inside the building during the tragic event.</p>

          <p>In a landmark federal trial, plaintiffs are seeking $345 million from Tesla over a 2019 crash in Florida involving its Autopilot system. The driver, George McGee, was using Enhanced Autopilot when he became distracted and accelerated through an intersection, fatally striking 22-year-old Naibel Benavides and severely injuring her boyfriend. The plaintiffs argue that Tesla overstated the capabilities of its automated driving system, leading to driver over-reliance and creating a dangerous defect. Tesla's defense counters that the driver was at fault and that the company provides clear instructions on the system's limitations. The verdict will be a crucial test of Tesla's liability in incidents involving its driver-assistance technology.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order adjusting 'reciprocal' tariffs on numerous countries, with new rates ranging from 10% to 41%. A significant provision in the order is a new 40% tariff on all goods determined to have been transshipped to circumvent existing duties. Countries not specifically listed in the order will face a default additional duty of 10%. The directive also confirms an increase in tariffs on Canadian exports to 35%, excluding goods covered by the USMCA trade pact. These modified rates are set to take effect seven days after the order's issuance, marking a significant development in the administration's ongoing trade policy adjustments.

          <p>In a highly unusual move, two senior U.S. officials, special envoy Steve Witkoff and Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, are scheduled to visit Gaza to inspect a food distribution site. The visit reflects growing American concern over the severe humanitarian crisis, which aid workers have described as a 'politically manmade famine.' President Trump has expressed frustration over aid distribution, blaming Hamas for intercepting supplies, though U.S. analysis has not found evidence of systemic theft. This diplomatic mission occurs amid increasing international pressure on Israel to allow more aid into the territory and follows discussions between Witkoff and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about reaching a truce.</p>

          <p>Despite Amazon reporting better-than-expected second-quarter revenue and earnings, its stock fell after the company issued mixed third-quarter guidance. Investors expressed concern that growth in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) division was not as robust as that of its cloud rivals. However, this article argues the sell-off presents a buying opportunity, as the core drivers of the business, AWS and advertising revenue, remain strong and beat expectations. The analysis emphasizes that management often provides conservative guidance and that the long-term thesis for the company's growth and margin expansion is unchanged, reiterating a buy rating for the stock.

          <p>In a dramatic and rare event during the MLB trade deadline, Tampa Bay Rays infielder Jose Caballero was traded to the rival New York Yankees while the two teams were playing against each other. The news broke during a rain delay in the game, which the Yankees ultimately won. Following the announcement, cameras captured an emotional Caballero hugging his former Rays teammates in the dugout, with some appearing visibly stunned by the sudden move. Caballero is a significant acquisition for the Yankees, as he is currently tied for the MLB lead in stolen bases. The trade was one of several moves the Yankees made to bolster their roster before the deadline.</p>

          <p>The White House has unveiled plans for a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a project long desired by President Donald Trump. The construction, estimated to cost $200 million, will be privately funded by President Trump and other anonymous donors, with work scheduled to begin in September. The new facility will be built alongside the East Wing and is designed to host large formal functions, such as state dinners, eliminating the need for temporary tents on the White House grounds. The current East Room has a much smaller capacity, and the administration states the new ballroom will be an 'exquisite addition' for future administrations to enjoy.</p>

          <p>A trend of teenagers using caffeine pouches, which deliver a rapid stimulant hit when placed in the mouth, is causing concern among health experts. These small, discreet pouches can contain as much caffeine as two cups of coffee, and influencers on social media are promoting them to students and gym-goers. Experts worry that young people have a lower tolerance for caffeine and could easily consume dangerous amounts, leading to side effects like rapid heart rate and anxiety. The article also highlights the risk of these pouches normalizing stimulant use and potentially acting as a gateway to other products like nicotine pouches, urging caution and awareness of total caffeine intake.</p>

          <p>Guangzhou and Shenzhen, two key cities that have long powered economic growth in China's Guangdong province, are reporting underperforming GDP figures. This simultaneous slowdown is attributed to a combination of weakening global demand for exports and insufficient domestic consumption to compensate. Analysts note that Shenzhen, in particular, is facing significant headwinds, with fixed-asset investment and real estate development dropping sharply, reflecting a decline in investor confidence. While the city's high-tech sector has grown, its overall trade and export figures have fallen, signaling potential challenges for these traditionally robust economic engines.

A student's eligibility will be determined by their parents' occupations when they were 14. Successful interns will be prioritized for the Fast Stream graduate program, the primary entry route into the civil service.

Under the plan, the legislature would create new maps, which would then be presented to voters in a November special election.

          <p>After an 18-month endeavor to forge a career in American football, Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit has announced he is leaving the NFL to return to his original sport. The 24-year-old had spells with the Kansas City Chiefs and the Jacksonville Jaguars but never played in a regular-season game. In a social media post, Rees-Zammit described his time in the NFL as a 'great experience' but stated it was time to come home and do what he does best.

          <p>After a period of global financial uncertainty, President Trump is claiming victory with a series of new trade deals and unilaterally imposed tariffs. However, this analysis suggests the apparent success may come at a high price. While the most dire recession warnings have been avoided, the new baseline for tariffs on goods sold to the U.S. is now significantly higher, potentially squeezing household incomes and reducing global demand. The article argues that Trump's aggressive tactics could also damage long-term alliances, prompting traditional partners to seek new economic connections that bypass the U.S., potentially undermining America's central role in the global economy.

          <p>The Colombian government has reported a significant setback in its environmental efforts, with deforestation increasing by 43% in 2024 compared to the previous year. The Amazon rainforest region was the most severely impacted, accounting for over 65% of the total 113,608 hectares of forest destroyed. This sharp rise marks a reversal of the positive trend seen in 2023, which had the lowest deforestation level in over two decades. Authorities attribute the increase to factors such as land-grabbing for cattle ranching, illegal construction, the expansion of illicit coca cultivation, and wildfires intensified by drought, highlighting the persistent challenges in protecting the nation's vital ecosystems.</p>

However, she also noted that the current trade program is projected to decrease the U.S. trade deficit with China this year.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve extending its pause on interest rate cuts, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) face a strategic decision. This article suggests that the current environment, with CD rates still attractively high, presents an ideal opportunity to renew or open a new CD account. While rate cuts are inevitable in the future, the current pause provides a window to lock in favorable rates, potentially for a long term, before banks begin to lower them in anticipation of future Fed action. Savers are advised to act promptly as their CDs mature to avoid automatic rollovers into potentially lower-rate accounts and to shop around for the best available offers. (not investment advice)</p>

This article advises borrowers to take proactive steps rather than waiting for external economic changes to provide relief. It suggests borrowers should assess whether a minor rate cut would have made a significant difference and focus on creating a personal debt reduction plan, such as the debt snowball or avalanche method. For those needing more assistance, it recommends carefully researching and considering professional debt relief services, which can offer structured programs to help regain financial independence while rates remain elevated.</p>

While overall sales grew 13% and the advertising business showed strong performance, revenue growth in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud unit trailed that of rivals Microsoft and Google.

This article outlines five essential questions to ask before hiring such a service to avoid potential harm. Consumers should inquire about all fees and when they are collected, as legitimate companies cannot charge until a debt is settled. It is also important to verify the company's licensing and track record, understand the specific strategy they propose for your situation, and get a realistic timeline for the process.

          <p>President Trump's plan to revive the presidential fitness test brings back a program with Cold War origins. Initiated by President Eisenhower in 1956, the test was created out of concern that American children were less physically fit than their European counterparts, which was viewed as a national security issue. The test, which typically included exercises like a one-mile run and pull-ups, aimed to assess various aspects of physical fitness. However, despite its long history, there is little evidence it made children healthier. In fact, recent studies show that child health metrics in the U.S. have worsened and now lag significantly behind those in Europe.</p>

The administration's use of tariffs against Brazil over the prosecution of former President Bolsonaro and threats against Canada for recognizing a Palestinian state are cited as examples. These actions use U.S. economic power to achieve non-economic goals that benefit Trump's allies rather than the American economy. The analysis contends that this approach is legally questionable, diplomatically damaging, and ultimately betrays the non-interventionist pact Trump made with his voters, who now face higher consumer prices.
