          <p>Brazilian table tennis star Hugo Calderano will miss a major tournament in Las Vegas due to visa complications stemming from a past trip to Cuba. The 2025 World Cup gold medalist was informed he was no longer eligible for the U.S. visa waiver program available to Portuguese passport holders because he had competed in Cuba in 2023. Despite mobilizing his team to secure an emergency visa, there was insufficient time before the event began. This situation highlights the complex geopolitical hurdles athletes can face, impacting their careers and participation in key international competitions.</p>

          <p>An amateur baseball player for the Duluth Huskies made a highly unusual play by intentionally fielding a ground ball while he was a baserunner to prevent a potential double play. The umpires on the field allowed the play, ruling it a fielder's choice that kept the bases loaded. However, baseball rules experts later clarified that the play was illegal interference, and both the runner and the batter should have been called out. The quick-thinking but ultimately incorrect maneuver did not end up affecting the game's outcome.</p>

          <p>Two American aid workers with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation were injured during a grenade attack at a food distribution site in southern Gaza. The foundation claimed, without providing evidence, that Hamas was responsible for the attack. This incident occurred amidst a backdrop of continued violence, with Israeli airstrikes killing 14 people and desperate Palestinians being killed while trying to access food. The ongoing bloodshed complicates U.S.-led efforts to broker a ceasefire, which have recently shown some signs of potential progress.</p>

          <p>This excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, "Mark Twain," recounts the author's 1882 journey back to the Mississippi River to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi." Traveling incognito, Twain observed the changes to the river towns and landscape he had once known intimately as a steamboat pilot, a profession he cherished for its independence. The passage highlights Twain's nostalgic longing for his youth and the profound sense of freedom he associated with his time on the river, a period he considered the happiest of his life.</p>

          <p>In accordance with his own instructions, Mark Twain's full autobiography has been published 100 years after his death, revealing his unfiltered thoughts on politics, society, and personal matters. The work was dictated by Twain over four years and is intentionally non-linear, which he saw as a way to speak freely without the constraints of public opinion or the fear of hurting living individuals. Curators describe it as a highly unconventional and modern-feeling memoir, and its century-long embargo has been hailed as a brilliant, self-devised marketing strategy.</p>

While the wealthiest pay an average federal income tax rate around 16%, most of their wealth comes from unrealized capital gains on investments, which are not taxed until sold. This enables strategies like "buy-borrow-die," where they live off tax-free loans against their assets, a deferral option unavailable to middle-class workers whose wages are taxed immediately.

          <p>The U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) is facing sharp criticism for circulating an email that misleadingly claims a new spending bill signed by President Trump eliminates federal income taxes on benefits for most recipients. Former SSA officials and Democratic lawmakers have called the message a "lie" and an unconscionable politicization of a historically neutral agency. They clarify the bill provides a temporary, means-tested tax deduction, not a full tax elimination, and have condemned the email as partisan propaganda. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One year after Labour's 2024 election victory, a focus group of voters who switched to the party expressed feelings of disappointment and frustration. Many participants felt that the government had failed to deliver on key promises, particularly regarding immigration, with some feeling they had been "lied to." The recent parliamentary chaos and policy U-turns have reinforced a perception that the government lacks a clear direction, leading some of these crucial voters to consider supporting the rival Reform UK party in the future.</p>

          <p>Reform UK Member of Parliament James McMurdock has voluntarily given up the party whip after a newspaper report raised questions about COVID-19 business loans he received. The Sunday Times alleged that two of his companies, which obtained a total of £70,000 in Bounce Back loans, may not have been eligible based on their turnover. McMurdock denies any wrongdoing but stated he requested the temporary suspension to protect the party while it conducts an internal investigation into the matter.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent threats against political rivals have intensified concerns among democracy advocates, who see them as a direct assault on free speech and constitutional norms. In a single week, Trump suggested punitive actions against figures like Elon Musk and New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, including deportation and arrest. Critics argue that regardless of their legal feasibility, the threats themselves are a weaponization of state power designed to intimidate and silence opposition, thereby eroding the foundations of a free society.</p>

          <p>The widespread adoption of digital payment systems has given rise to "tipflation," a phenomenon where customers are prompted to tip more frequently and at higher, pre-set percentages. This trend, which accelerated during the pandemic, is causing confusion and social pressure, as opting out often requires an awkward extra step in front of service staff. While beneficial for workers' incomes, experts note that this guilt-driven tipping can irritate customers and negatively impact their perception of a business.</p>

Experts theorize that Pyongyang will interpret the strikes as proof that a nuclear deterrent is the only reliable guarantee of survival against an unpredictable United States. This perception is likely to diminish any remaining prospects for denuclearization talks and may push North Korea to further invest in mobile, second-strike capabilities to ensure its security.</p>

          <p>A so-called "cortisol cocktail" has become a viral trend on TikTok, with proponents claiming the drink can lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol. The beverage typically contains ingredients like coconut water, citrus juice, magnesium, and sea salt. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence that these ingredients can meaningfully impact cortisol levels. While the drink is likely harmless for most and can help with hydration, doctors recommend proven stress-reduction methods like quality sleep, exercise, and therapy.</p>
