          <p>In Inner Mongolia, Yimin open-pit coal mine has implemented a fleet of 100 photovoltaic-battery-powered, self-driving trucks to transport coal and other materials. This initiative addresses a shortage of drivers and dangerous working conditions, which previously led to high attrition rates. The move is part of China's broader effort to digitally transform its coal industry and upgrade traditional industries with advanced technologies. The Yimin mine director, Shu Yinqiu, noted that truck drivers faced exhausting workloads leading to health issues, which the autonomous vehicles aim to alleviate by creating intelligent coal mines.</p>

          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has saved over $5 million annually by identifying and cutting thousands of unused software licenses across various federal agencies. The IRS, for instance, was paying for 3,000 software licenses but only using 25, leading DOGE to cut 99% of the licenses. The Department of Labor and the Securities and Exchange Commission also saw significant reductions in unused licenses. These audits have been ongoing since February, and the savings translate to about $1,087 per taxpayer, with Elon Musk stating that savings will continue to build. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump announced a surprise doubling of tariffs on imported steel to 50% during a rally celebrating a "partnership" deal between US Steel and Nippon Steel. The announcement, made without further detail, is set to take effect next week and is likely to create fresh economic turmoil. The move was cheered by steelworkers in Pennsylvania, but the increase is expected to have widespread economic repercussions.
