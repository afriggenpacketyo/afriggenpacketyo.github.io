          <p>Climate activists from the Futuro Vegetal group threw red and black paint on Barcelona's iconic Sagrada Familia basilica to protest government inaction on devastating summer forest fires. The group highlighted the link between livestock farming and wildfires, citing government statistics, as Spain grapples with one of its worst environmental catastrophes in recent memory. This act of protest led to the arrest of two activists and is part of a series of similar demonstrations staged by the group across Spain to draw attention to the climate emergency, which has been exacerbated by a major European heatwave.</p>

          <p>Musician John Fogerty has released a new album, "Legacy," featuring re-recordings of his classic Creedence Clearwater Revival hits like "Proud Mary" and "Bad Moon Rising." After losing control of his songwriting catalog following the band's breakup in the 1970s, Fogerty recently regained the rights and embarked on this project with his sons, who are part of his touring band. He reflects on the legal and emotional battles over his music, a struggle famously mirrored by artists like Taylor Swift, and expresses the profound personal victory of finally owning and reinterpreting the songs that defined his career.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, a student explains the decision to reject an offer from Yale University in favor of attending a small Bible college. The author argues that elite institutions like Yale have shifted from promoting intellectual rigor to enforcing ideological conformity, stifling dissenting opinions and unpopular views. By choosing a Bible college, the student sought an education focused on character, faith, and wrestling with eternal questions, which is presented as a more demanding and sacred challenge. The author contends this path offered greater freedom to think and believe without fear of ideological policing, trading prestige for personal conviction and spiritual formation.</p>

          <p>German authorities have issued an arrest warrant for Marla-Svenja Liebich, a far-right extremist who failed to report to prison to begin an 18-month sentence for incitement and defamation. Previously known as Sven Liebich, the neo-Nazi leader legally changed gender under Germany's new Self-Determination Act and requested to serve time in a women's facility. The case has sparked a political debate, with critics alleging Liebich is abusing the law to mock the government, while others caution against using one individual's actions to undermine rights for the broader transgender community.</p>

          <p>Ten years after then-Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous declaration "wir schaffen das" ("we can do it") opened Germany's borders to refugees, the nation is assessing the long-term impacts of its 2015 migration policy. While many refugees have successfully integrated into the workforce, challenges remain, including higher unemployment rates among migrants and rising social tensions.

          <p>Neurosurgeon Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," delves into the complexities of chronic pain, which affects about 20% of Americans. The article highlights new research suggesting that the brain, not just the site of injury, is often the source of persistent pain, as it can memorize and replay pain signals. It features the story of a musician with a rare pain syndrome who found relief through a groundbreaking clinical trial involving deep brain stimulation. This experimental treatment successfully mapped his pain signals in the brain and used electrical impulses to interrupt them before they reached conscious awareness.</p>

          <p>Colleagues are remembering veteran CBS News Radio White House correspondent Mark Knoller, who passed away this week after a 32-year career with the network. Knoller was revered in Washington as the unofficial record-keeper of presidential statistics, meticulously logging every public action and utterance of multiple presidents. His detailed archives, which included data like the number of speeches given or basketball games played by a president, often served as a resource for the White House itself. Friends and former colleagues like Scott Pelley and Norah O'Donnell remember him not only for his encyclopedic knowledge but also for his generosity and dedication to journalism.</p>

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore is engaged in a public dispute with President Donald Trump regarding crime in Baltimore, stating he has no interest in fighting the president but will fight for his communities. The feud escalated after Trump called Baltimore a "hellhole" and threatened to send in the National Guard, an offer Moore described as "performative." While acknowledging the city's challenges, Moore highlighted recent progress in reducing crime and criticized the president for offering arrogant criticism instead of substantive federal support for local law enforcement and other community-focused initiatives.</p>

This move, which echoes Donald Trump's "drill, baby, drill" approach, has been criticized by opponents as "environmental vandalism" that would accelerate the climate crisis without lowering consumer energy bills, while also reversing progress on clean energy initiatives.</p>

The Israeli military acknowledged it had precisely struck a Houthi military target in the Sanaa area.

          <p>In response to widespread anti-government protests across Indonesia, President Prabowo Subianto has announced that political parties have agreed to scale back certain state-funded perks for politicians. The demonstrations, which have turned violent in several cities, were partly fueled by public anger over a new monthly allowance for lawmakers that is nearly ten times the minimum wage in Jakarta. While the government hopes the concessions will quell unrest, student leaders have called the move insufficient, demanding that deeper systemic issues such as low wages, corruption, and heavy-handed police tactics be addressed.</p>

The article outlines six "magic phrases" designed to calm a child's nervous system and encourage listening without resorting to power struggles. Phrases like "I believe you" and "Let's figure this out together" validate a child's feelings and involve them in problem-solving. This approach aims to shift the dynamic from a parent issuing commands to one of building an alliance, fostering accountability and trust rather than fear-based compliance.</p>

However, a cold case review by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation found inconsistencies between Pusser's account and the physical evidence, including a likely self-inflicted wound on Pusser and signs Pauline was shot outside the car.

          <p>President Donald Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is part of a broader effort to exert political control over the central bank, an institution long considered independent of politics. Critics argue that politicizing the Fed could undermine the American financial system by eroding the credibility it has built over decades. A politically influenced Fed might prioritize short-term political goals, like lowering interest rates to manage federal debt, over long-term economic stability, potentially leading to hyperinflation and instability similar to that seen in countries where dictators control monetary policy.

          <p>A decade ago, the declining German town of Altena volunteered to accept more migrants than required, hoping to revitalize its community and economy. While the initiative brought new life, filling empty housing and schools, it was not a simple solution, as many newcomers eventually moved to larger cities with more opportunities. The town now faces challenges such as rising welfare costs and growing support for the anti-immigration AfD party, reflecting broader national frustrations. Altena's story illustrates the complex reality of integration, showing both the benefits of welcoming refugees and the persistent social and economic hurdles involved.</p>

          <p>The recent release of Ghislaine Maxwell's interview transcripts by the Justice Department has been framed as an act of transparency, but critics point to unasked follow-up questions as a sign of reluctance to pursue difficult truths. During the interview, Maxwell hinted that some of Jeffrey Epstein's associates were serving in Donald Trump's cabinet, but the interviewer did not press her for names. This, along with the fact that attorneys for over 50 Epstein survivors say they were not contacted by the DOJ, has led to accusations that the investigation is ignoring victims and avoiding potentially damaging revelations about powerful individuals.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History highlights the little-known story of how surfing was introduced to the U.S. mainland in 1885. Three teenage Hawaiian princes, studying at a military school in California, fashioned surfboards from local redwood and demonstrated the then-Hawaiian royal sport to locals at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River. This act of "surf diplomacy" planted the seeds for the sport's popularity in America, which would later be globally popularized by Duke Kahanamoku. The exhibit features replicas of their large, heavy boards, illustrating the origins of a now-beloved coastal pastime.</p>

          <p>A trend of taxing the real estate of the wealthy is spreading across U.S. states, with new levies on high-value second homes in places like Rhode Island and Montana. Rhode Island's new surcharge, nicknamed the "Taylor Swift Tax," targets non-primary residences valued over $1 million, significantly increasing property tax bills for affluent summer residents. Proponents see it as a way to fund tight state budgets and address housing inequality, but critics and real estate brokers argue it unfairly penalizes seasonal homeowners who contribute heavily to local economies while using few public services.

          <p>As part of a broader initiative to combat plastic pollution, the Australian state of South Australia is banning single-use, fish-shaped soy sauce containers. The iconic plastic fish, a staple in many Asian takeaway restaurants, will be prohibited from sale or distribution starting Monday. Although made of recyclable plastic, their small size makes them difficult for recycling machinery to process properly. This ban builds on previous legislation targeting other single-use plastics and is part of the government's effort to reduce pollution and protect marine life, as officials warn the flow of plastic into the ocean is set to triple by 2040 without action.</p>

          <p>A Federal Reserve report indicates that the median retirement savings for American households aged 55 to 64 is approximately $185,000, a sum considered insufficient for a comfortable retirement. This data underscores a significant savings gap, with an AARP survey revealing that one in five Americans over 50 have no retirement savings at all. The article suggests several strategies to bolster savings later in life, such as consulting financial advisors, considering alternative investments, and utilizing micro-investing apps or passive income streams to secure one's financial future.

          <p>Former officials and labor advocates warn that the Trump administration's actions have hobbled the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the primary U.S. agency protecting workers' rights. Since taking office, President Trump has fired key officials, including the general counsel and the chair, leaving the board without a quorum for much of his term and rendering it unable to issue decisions. This has empowered corporations to challenge the agency's constitutionality and stall unfair labor practice cases indefinitely. Critics fear these moves threaten to roll back worker protections to pre-1935 levels and elevate corporate interests over the rights of working families.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has vowed to "fix" the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), raising concerns among experts that his actions could undermine the vaccine industry. The VICP was created in the 1980s to shield manufacturers from extensive litigation, stabilizing a fragile market. Experts fear that dismantling or radically altering the program could expose companies to new legal risks, potentially causing them to exit the market and leading to vaccine shortages. This move is seen by critics as part of Kennedy's long-standing anti-vaccine activism, which could disrupt public health infrastructure.</p>

The challenge has been intensified by a season-ending injury to star left tackle Rashawn Slater, placing Herbert's protection in the hands of a rookie. The team plans to support Herbert with a more physical running game, a key component of the offensive strategy under coordinator Greg Roman.</p>
