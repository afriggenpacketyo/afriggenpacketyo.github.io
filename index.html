          <p>The European Commission has initiated an antitrust investigation into German software company SAP over concerns regarding its software support services. The probe will examine whether SAP has unfairly limited competition in the maintenance and support market for its on-premises business management software. SAP has stated its belief that its practices comply with EU regulations but is cooperating with the investigation. The company, one of Europe's most valuable, does not expect the inquiry to have a significant financial impact, though its share price saw a minor decline following the announcement.</p>

          <p>The estate of Ta'Kiya Young, a pregnant Black woman fatally shot by an Ohio police officer in 2023, has filed a federal lawsuit against the police chief and township. The suit alleges that Officer Connor M. Grubb, who is already facing murder charges, was improperly trained and supervised, leading to a reckless escalation of the situation over a shoplifting suspicion. Young was 21 years old and pregnant with her third child when she was shot in her car in a grocery store parking lot. The lawsuit claims a history of unaddressed complaints against the officer.</p>

          <p>The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has described the 39% tariff rate imposed by the U.S. as a "major challenge" that is expected to dampen the country's economic activity. Following a failed attempt to secure a trade deal, SNB Chairman Martin Schlegel noted the tariffs will particularly impact exporters in the machinery and watchmaking industries. Despite these pressures, the central bank held interest rates at 0% and does not currently forecast a recession for 2025 or 2026. However, it has downgraded its growth expectation for 2026 to just under 1% due to the tariffs and related uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A shooting at a Dallas Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility resulted in the death of one detainee and critical injuries to two others. The suspected gunman, identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, reportedly fired from a rooftop before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Authorities are investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence, noting that an unspent bullet casing found at the scene was engraved with the message "ANTI-ICE." The FBI director described the event as an ideologically motivated attack against law enforcement.</p>

          <p>During an address at the United Nations General Assembly, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asserted that international laws and institutions have proven too weak to stop Russian aggression. He argued that only the direct support of "friends and weapons" can effectively protect nations from authoritarian ambitions like those of Vladimir Putin. Zelenskyy warned that Russia's war could expand further, making it cheaper for the world to help stop the conflict now rather than face a wider arms race later. He expressed deep dissatisfaction with the global system's inability to halt bloodshed, citing ongoing crises beyond Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Danish officials have described a series of unexplained drone sightings over multiple airports as a "hybrid attack" intended to create fear and discord. The incidents, which prompted the temporary closure of Aalborg and Copenhagen airports, are being attributed to a "professional actor," though no direct link to Russia has been officially established. Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen stated the systematic nature of the operation points away from amateur activity. The government is now planning to acquire new detection capabilities and introduce legislation allowing infrastructure owners to neutralize threatening drones.</p>

Burnham, who has twice run for the Labour leadership unsuccessfully, emphasized the need for a "proper plan for the country" and offered to support Starmer in developing new policies.

          <p>In a landmark ruling, a Spanish court has convicted a man for killing a puppy he co-owned with his partner, applying a gender violence law to a case of animal abuse for the first time. The court in Gran Canaria determined the man intentionally threw the four-month-old puppy off a cliff to inflict psychological harm on his partner, classifying it as an act of "vicarious violence." This legal concept typically refers to harming a child to hurt the mother. The ruling highlights Spain's pioneering approach to combating gender-based violence by recognizing an animal as an instrument of psychological abuse.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive survey by the Office for Students (OfS), England's higher education regulator, has revealed that thousands of university students report being victims of sexual misconduct. The findings indicate that 14% of respondents have experienced sexual violence, including sexual assault and unwanted touching, while one in four reported sexual harassment. The data shows that women, disabled students, and LGBT individuals are disproportionately affected.

However, AI is capturing a share of these activities, with a notable percentage of students using it to write entire assignments.

A key risk identified is the conflict between President Trump and the Federal Reserve over interest rates.

The author contends that by blocking access, Israel can more easily dismiss local reports as biased or controlled by Hamas, a narrative often repeated by Israeli officials. If foreign journalists were present, the author claims, they would witness the realities of the humanitarian crisis and counter Israeli claims about aid distribution. This restriction on press freedom allows a single, controlling narrative to dominate.</p>

          <p>A long-debated plan to install permanent public restrooms at Runyon Canyon Park, a popular Los Angeles hiking destination, is facing renewed opposition from local residents. A group called the Runyon Canyon Guardians is raising concerns about the project's nearly $1 million price tag and potential negative impacts, such as attracting homeless individuals and increasing fire risk. While city officials and park supporters argue that restrooms are necessary for a park that receives an estimated 2 million visitors annually, some residents fear the change will spoil the area's natural character. The project is scheduled for completion by next summer.</p>

          <p>Millions of California residents will see a credit on their October electricity bills as part of the state's biannual California Climate Credit program. The refund is funded by the state's cap-and-invest program, which requires large polluters to pay for their greenhouse gas emissions. The credit amount varies by utility provider, with customers of PG&E, Southern California Edison, and SDG&E receiving between $56 and $82. The credit is applied automatically to residential and small-business customer bills. Due to a recent extension of the program, these refunds are expected to increase in the coming years.</p>

          <p>Fox News host Jesse Watters is facing criticism for comments made on the talk show "The Five," where he suggested that the United Nations headquarters should be bombed or demolished. His remarks were a reaction to perceived sabotage of President Trump's visit to the UN, which was marred by a malfunctioning escalator and teleprompter. While Watters framed his comments as a joke, they are being condemned as dangerous rhetoric in a climate of heightened political violence. The article contrasts the lack of regulatory response to Watters with the recent controversy surrounding Jimmy Kimmel's show being temporarily pulled for political commentary.</p>

          <p>The total amount of debt owed by customers to energy suppliers in Great Britain has climbed to a new record of £4.4 billion, according to the regulator Ofgem. This represents an increase of over £750 million from the previous year, with more than one million households having no formal arrangement to repay what they owe. The sharp rise in debt is a lingering effect of the recent energy price crisis, which pushed many households into financial hardship. Ofgem is now considering new measures to address the unsustainable debt, including a potential fund to help write off or match customer repayments.</p>

          <p>A Paris court has found former French President Nicolas Sarkozy guilty of criminal conspiracy related to accepting illicit funds from the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi for his 2007 presidential campaign. The 70-year-old was acquitted of other charges, including passive corruption and illegal campaign financing. The judge ruled that Sarkozy had allowed aides to seek financial support from Libyan officials, though there was insufficient evidence he was the direct beneficiary of the illegal financing. This conviction is the latest in a series of legal troubles for Sarkozy since he left office in 2012.</p>

          <p>A political analysis piece argues that Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham's recent interviews are a provocative and overt signal of his leadership ambitions, creating a challenge for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. By publicly confirming that MPs have approached him and by outlining a distinct policy prospectus that challenges the government's fiscal caution, Burnham is positioning himself as an alternative. The article compares the situation to Boris Johnson's maneuvering while he was Mayor of London. Although Burnham's path back to Westminster and to the leadership is complex, his actions are seen as a serious development for the current leadership.</p>

The proposed game, potentially for the 2026-27 season, would mark a significant effort to grow the sport's profile in the United States, which is set to host the Rugby World Cup in 2031. The plan is linked to the league's title sponsor, Gallagher, a Chicago-based company that is also a partner of the Cubs.

          <p>The Trump administration has stated it will actively work to prevent FIFA from banning Israel's national soccer team from international competitions, including the 2026 World Cup. This intervention comes after United Nations advisory experts called on football's governing bodies to suspend Israeli teams over the war in Gaza. The U.S. State Department confirmed its position to Sky News, vowing to "fully stop any effort" to ban the Israeli team. The situation places FIFA in a difficult position, as it faces pressure from both human rights advocates and powerful political allies like the United States.</p>

          <p>A report from S&P Global Ratings warns that China's banking sector could be facing its "Japanification moment," characterized by a long period of low economic growth and weak profitability. This condition mirrors Japan's economic stagnation following its asset bubble burst in the 1990s. The report notes that Beijing's efforts to stimulate the economy by cutting prime loan rates to historic lows are squeezing bank profitability. Unlike other banking systems, Chinese lenders may have fewer options to diversify revenue, making them more reliant on reducing credit losses to remain profitable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is reportedly considering providing financial support to suppliers of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) after a major cyber-attack forced the carmaker to halt production. The attack shut down JLR's IT networks, and its factories are not expected to resume operations until at least October, costing the company an estimated £50 million per week. There are growing fears that smaller firms in the supply chain, which rely heavily on JLR's business, could face bankruptcy without assistance. One option being explored is for the government to purchase component parts to maintain cash flow for these suppliers.</p>

NORAD stated that such Russian military activity in the international airspace of the ADIZ is common and not considered a direct threat.
