        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France's political crisis is deepening as key allies of President Emmanuel Macron, including former prime ministers, publicly criticize his leadership and decisions. Gabriel Attal, once a protégé, expressed a lack of understanding of the president's choices, while Edouard Philippe called for an early presidential election to resolve the deadlock. The situation is further complicated by suggestions to suspend Macron's controversial pension reform, a move that could appease opponents but would signify a major political defeat and undermine his legacy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a slight drop in interest rates, overall mortgage application volume in the U.S. has declined, indicating continued weakness in the housing market. A notable trend has emerged where buyers and refinancers are increasingly choosing adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) to secure lower initial interest rates. This shift towards riskier loan products, where rates can increase significantly after a fixed period, highlights the financial pressures potential homeowners face in the current economic climate. The share of ARM applications rose to 9.5% last week, driven by a significant rate differential compared to 30-year fixed loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has affirmed that there will be no relaxation of visa rules for Indian workers or students, a statement made during a major trade delegation visit to India. The visit, aimed at promoting a recently signed UK-India trade agreement, seeks to boost investment and economic growth by making certain exports cheaper between the two nations. Despite the economic focus and calls from some sectors, Starmer emphasized that visas were not part of the trade negotiations and that his government remains focused on its policy of reducing overall immigration levels into the UK.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla, though weakening, continues as a powerful Category 2 storm off the Pacific coast of Mexico, with maximum sustained winds of 100 miles per hour. The National Hurricane Center has issued a tropical storm watch for parts of Baja California Sur, as the storm is expected to move parallel to the coast. While Priscilla is not forecast to make landfall, it is generating large, life-threatening swells, surf, and rip currents for southwestern Mexico and the Baja California peninsula.

          <p>The Israeli military has intercepted another flotilla of nine boats carrying activists and aid supplies attempting to breach the naval blockade of Gaza. The Israeli Foreign Ministry stated the vessels and their 145 passengers were transferred to an Israeli port and will be deported, calling the effort a "futile attempt." Flotilla organizers claimed the boats were carrying over $110,000 in medical and nutritional aid for Gaza's hospitals. This event follows a similar interception days earlier, highlighting ongoing tensions and international efforts to challenge the blockade.</p>

          <p>A driver in south Wales who led police on a 130mph chase and struck a road worker, resulting in the victim's leg being amputated, was apprehended after his cover-up was exposed by a neighbor's Ring doorbell camera. Anthony Tregonning initially reported his modified Mitsubishi Evo stolen and attempted to blame his ex-partner for the hit-and-run incident. However, doorbell footage showed him leaving his home in the vehicle shortly before the crash, leading to his arrest and subsequent conviction for causing serious injury by dangerous driving.</p>

          <p>A trend known as "locking in" is gaining popularity among Gen Z on platforms like TikTok, where young people commit to periods of intense focus on personal goals, often related to fitness, finance, or skill-building. This movement is seen as a reaction to the distractions of digital life and the economic anxieties facing their generation, including a competitive job market and the rise of AI. While it echoes millennial hustle culture, "locking in" is more focused on self-improvement rather than corporate career advancement. Critics note the performative aspect of the trend, which often involves documenting the process on the very social media platforms it aims to escape.</p>

The roles most exposed are white-collar positions in fields like technology and finance, where AI can replicate cognitive reasoning skills. In contrast, jobs requiring physical labor or high levels of human interaction, such as nursing and construction, are considered more insulated from disruption. Experts note that while AI will likely augment many roles by handling routine tasks, its full impact on the labor market remains largely speculative.</p>

Critics argue that labels such as "veggie burger" are clear and help consumers navigate choices, and that the ban stifles innovation in the growing plant-based market.

The witness, law professor Daniel Richman, reportedly told investigators that Comey never authorized him to leak information to the press anonymously. This testimony creates what prosecutors described as "likely insurmountable problems" for proving Comey knowingly lied. Despite an internal memo recommending against charges, a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney proceeded with the indictment, which Comey's defense argues is politically motivated.</p>

The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association argued that the measures are excessive and will negatively affect carmakers, who source about 90% of their steel within the EU.

Despite months of requests, prosecutors could not obtain witness statements from the government that met this standard, leading to the collapse of the trial.

The author contends that conversations about "curing" autism effectively debate the existence of autistic people and ignore their valuable contributions to society.

          <p>According to Bloomberg, Portuguese football superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has become the first billionaire in the history of the sport. The financial media firm's Billionaires Index now values the 40-year-old's net worth at $1.4 billion. This valuation is a comprehensive measure of his career earnings, extensive investment portfolio, and numerous high-value endorsement deals. The report details that Ronaldo earned over $550 million in salary alone between 2002 and 2023, supplemented by lucrative long-term sponsorships, including a deal with Nike worth nearly $18 million annually.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has urged Europe to bolster its defenses to counter the growing threat of "hybrid warfare." In a speech to the European Parliament, she cited a series of escalating incidents, including cyberattacks, undersea cable damage, and air space incursions by Russia, as part of a deliberate campaign to destabilize the bloc. Von der Leyen stressed that these are not random events but a targeted "grey zone campaign" that requires a unified and deterrent response from the EU. The statement comes as EU leaders prepare to discuss a roadmap for fending off Russian threats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Preorders play a crucial role in the success of a new book, serving as a key indicator for the publishing industry. High preorder numbers signal strong consumer interest, influencing booksellers' decisions on how many copies to stock and whether to feature the book prominently in stores or online. These early sales are also aggregated and counted on the first day of release, significantly increasing the likelihood of a book debuting on a bestseller list. This initial momentum can create a snowball effect, generating further publicity and sales that are vital for an author's success.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is facing federal charges of making false statements and obstruction of justice related to his 2020 testimony before Congress. The indictment, which came shortly after President Trump publicly urged the attorney general to take action, centers on Comey's statements about his handling of investigations into Hillary Clinton and Russian election interference. A key point of contention is whether he authorized leaks to the media, a claim his former deputy, Andrew McCabe, has reportedly made. Comey maintains his innocence in what has become a highly politicized legal battle.</p>

          <p>California gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter nearly walked out of a CBS News interview after becoming frustrated with a line of questioning about appealing to Republican voters. In the newly released footage, Porter challenges the premise that she would need the 40% of California voters who supported Donald Trump to win the election. When the journalist pressed the point, Porter accused her of being "unnecessarily argumentative" and attempted to remove her microphone. After a brief, tense exchange, the interview continued, but the clip has since gone viral, sparking debate about politicians' interactions with the press.</p>

          <p>Ethan Mollick, a leading expert on AI from the Wharton School, has cautioned against trusting definitive predictions about artificial intelligence's impact on the job market, bluntly stating, "no one knows anything." Speaking at a CNBC summit, he noted that even top AI research labs are uncertain about the technology's ultimate use cases and effects. Mollick advised business leaders to encourage widespread, hands-on experimentation with AI tools like ChatGPT across their organizations rather than waiting for clear answers. He stressed that leadership must engage directly with the technology to understand its potential, as waiting for IT departments or task forces to lead will result in missed opportunities.</p>

          <p>A senior Russian lawmaker, Andrei Kartapolov, has warned that Russia will destroy any Tomahawk cruise missiles and their launchers if the United States provides them to Ukraine. He stated that Moscow's response would be "tough" and "asymmetrical," and that Russia would find ways to "hurt" Washington. The threat comes after President Trump indicated he has nearly decided on whether to supply the long-range missiles. Kartapolov claimed Russia is familiar with the missiles from its operations in Syria and would use its own drones and missiles to neutralize the threat, characterizing any such supply as a serious escalatory step.</p>
