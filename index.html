            <p>Ecuador is holding a runoff election between President Daniel Noboa, a pro-Trump conservative, and Luisa González, a leftist aligned with Nicolás Maduro. Security concerns dominate voters' minds as Ecuador grapples with Latin America's highest murder rate. Noboa declared an internal armed conflict in 2024, ordering military operations against transnational organized crime, while González advocates for a softer approach, potentially negotiating with drug cartels. Experts warn that negotiating with criminal gangs could strengthen them, potentially leading Ecuador to become a narco-state.</p>

            <p>Dozens of civilians, including children and aid workers, have been killed in attacks on famine-hit camps for displaced people in the Darfur region of Sudan.

            <p>The US government quietly exempted smartphones from a 125% tariff on goods from China, marking a significant retreat in the ongoing trade war. This decision avoids a potentially massive price hike on iPhones, most of which are manufactured in China. Apple CEO Tim Cook is seen as a key figure who could potentially mediate between the US and China due to his deep connections in both economies. However, existing tariffs on China related to fentanyl remain in place, potentially impacting other products.</p>

            <p>A retrial has begun in Sarah Palin's defamation case against The New York Times, stemming from a 2017 editorial that linked her to a 2011 shooting. The initial trial ended with a jury verdict against Palin, but a judge's premature ruling led to an appeal and retrial. The case revolves around First Amendment protections for the press and whether the Times acted with malice. Palin is not seeking monetary damages, making the stakes primarily about legal precedent.</p>

            <p>Comedian Stewart Lee reflects on the relevance of Sam Peckinpah's 'Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid' in the context of the Trump era. Lee draws parallels between the film's themes of freedom under attack from big business and the current political climate. He argues that the film's depiction of nakedly transactional politics and the struggle against avaricious authoritarians resonates with contemporary events. Lee also discusses the challenges of keeping his stand-up show relevant as world events rapidly evolve.</p>

            <p>The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act (SAVE Act) is under scrutiny for its potential impact on married women's voting rights, particularly those who have changed their last names. The bill requires proof of U.S. citizenship for voter registration, potentially disenfranchising millions of women whose birth certificates no longer match their current names. Legal experts are divided on the extent of the impact, with some arguing that states can mitigate the issue by accepting secondary documents, while others worry about inconsistent policies across states.</p>

            <p>The article describes the dire situation in Gaza as a 'killing field' where Palestinians are being starved and subjected to ongoing atrocities. It highlights the use of disease and starvation as weapons of war, with Israel cutting off supplies and destroying infrastructure. The author condemns the lack of international action and the suppression of free speech on the issue. The author is no longer begging people to care about Palestinians and is writing this not because they hope to change any minds, but because the only power they have – the only power that many of us have – is to continually raise their voices and say that we do not consent to this.</p>

            <p>China's science fiction industry is experiencing rapid growth, driven by popular works like Liu Cixin's 'The Three-Body Problem' and government support for 'quality' growth. The industry generated nearly $15 billion in revenue in 2024, a significant increase from previous years. This growth reflects a growing interest in science fiction among Chinese audiences and the potential for the industry to contribute to China's economic development. The government has supported this growth.</p>

            <p>President Trump's attacks on law firms are creating a climate of fear that could deter them from taking on pro bono cases that are politically sensitive or challenge the administration's policies. Civil rights organizations report that some firms have declined to provide assistance due to concerns about political ramifications. This could lead to fewer challenges to potentially unconstitutional government actions. Some firms are fighting back, but the overall impact on pro bono work remains a concern.</p>
