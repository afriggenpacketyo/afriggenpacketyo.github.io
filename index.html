          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell expressed skepticism about the recent changes to Formula 1's swearing rules, noting a lack of communication from senior FIA officials and labeling the situation "a bit suspect." Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton echoed this sentiment, calling the situation "ridiculous" and advocating for necessary changes. Russell also endorsed rally legend Carlos Sainz Sr's potential bid for FIA president, believing his combined motorsport knowledge would benefit the sport. He dismissed conflict of interest concerns due to Sainz's son being a driver, emphasizing the technical people's role in rule-making, while McLaren's Oscar Piastri supported the changes, highlighting the FIA's increased control and fairness regarding abusing officials.</p>

          <p>Walmart cautioned that even with reduced tariffs on Chinese goods, the company may have to raise prices on some products. CEO Doug McMillon stated that tariffs create cost pressures, particularly on goods from China, impacting categories like electronics and toys. While Walmart aims to control costs and avoid passing them onto consumers, CFO John David Rainey warned that a return to higher tariffs could significantly affect the company's financials. Economist Tuan Nguyen noted that consumers are already reducing spending due to tariffs, and further price increases could put additional pressure on demand.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding the Trump administration's attempt to limit birthright citizenship, focusing on whether lower court judges should be able to block presidential orders nationwide. Justices expressed concerns about the administration's policy, which contradicts the 14th Amendment, and questioned the fairness of nationwide injunctions. Justice Kagan raised concerns about the practicality of requiring individuals to file separate lawsuits and the potential for citizenship rules to vary by state. The administration argues that universal injunctions prevent the executive branch from performing its constitutional functions, while critics fear limiting judges' power would force people to file thousands of individual lawsuits.</p>

          <p>Despite temporarily pausing export restrictions on 28 American companies following a trade agreement, China continues to block exports of seven rare earth metals crucial to U.S. industries. These metals, including Samarium and Yttrium, are vital for defense, energy, and automotive sectors. While China removed some companies from its export control list, it emphasized the need for comprehensive government control of strategic minerals for national security. China views rare earth elements as leverage in trade negotiations with the U.S., hinting at their importance through state-linked media.</p>

          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, has cautioned investors about imminent price increases on various items due to tariffs, despite a temporary reduction in duties on Chinese imports. The retail giant is attempting to navigate the situation, but the speed and magnitude of price increases are unprecedented. While Walmart will absorb some of the tariff costs, consumers will likely see increases by the end of May and more in June. CEO Doug McMillon noted that tariffs on goods from countries like Costa Rica and Columbia, including bananas, avocados, coffee, and roses, are also contributing to the price pressures.</p>

Doctors at Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia created a personalized infusion to fix his specific mutation, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency. The treatment has implications for thousands of other uncommon genetic diseases, offering a new path for developing personalized treatments without years of expensive development and testing. The treatment involves pinpoint targeting using base editing and CRISPR technology to correct the incorrect DNA letter.</p>

Aid agencies have warned of an impending starvation crisis in Gaza, as Israel has blocked food, medicine, and humanitarian relief from entering the territory since March.
