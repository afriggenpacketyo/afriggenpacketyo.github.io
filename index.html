          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is visiting Washington to meet with President Trump, aiming to restart stalled trade talks and find common ground on economic and security matters. Facing significant domestic pressure to secure a deal and alleviate punishing U.S. tariffs on key sectors like steel and lumber, Carney's government has recently made several concessions. While no major breakthroughs are anticipated from this working visit, the direct engagement is seen as a crucial step to regain the president's attention as a review of the USMCA trade agreement approaches.</p>

          <p>A REACH medical helicopter crashed directly onto Highway 50 in Sacramento, leaving the three crew members aboard—a pilot, a nurse, and a paramedic—with critical injuries. Fortunately, no vehicles on the busy freeway were involved in the incident, and there were no patients on the helicopter at the time of the crash. In a notable act of heroism, a fire captain and several bystanders worked together to lift the aircraft wreckage to free one of the crew members who was trapped underneath. The National Transportation Safety Board has initiated an investigation into the cause.</p>

          <p>China has successfully launched the world's first commercial underwater data center off the coast of Hainan province, a project designed to significantly reduce energy consumption. The 1,300-tonne data cabin, submerged 35 meters deep, utilizes the surrounding seawater for natural cooling, which lowers operational costs compared to traditional land-based facilities. This initial phase is part of a larger provincial plan to build a subsea data center with 100 cabins, positioning it as a key component of Hainan's strategy to develop new technologies for the blue economy.</p>

Raducanu appeared to be struggling with the hot and humid conditions, looking fatigued before calling for a medical timeout in the second set. After having her blood pressure and temperature checked by the trainer, she made the decision to withdraw from the contest. The retirement is a setback for Raducanu, who was hoping for a strong performance to improve her seeding prospects for the upcoming Australian Open.</p>

          <p>European stock markets experienced a slight downturn, heavily influenced by the political crisis unfolding in France following the surprise resignation of Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu. France's CAC 40 index saw notable declines, particularly affecting major banks, as investors reacted negatively to the heightened government instability. This situation adds to broader market concerns, which were also impacted by a disappointing data release on German factory orders, signaling potential economic headwinds for the region.

          <h2>Surveys Reveal Deepening Distrust and Lack of Empathy Between Israelis and Palestinians</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent polling data highlights a significant decline in mutual trust and empathy between Israelis and Palestinians, raising concerns about the long-term prospects for reconciliation after the current war. One survey from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem found that a majority of Israeli respondents believe there are no innocent people in Gaza, a sentiment that conflict resolution experts say reflects a dangerous level of dehumanization. While a potential U.S.-led peace plan offers a framework for a ceasefire, experts emphasize that rebuilding trust would be a generational challenge requiring strong leadership and a credible peace process.</p>

          <p>Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick is standing by comments in which he described the Handsworth area of Birmingham as one of the "worst-integrated places" he had visited, stating he did not see "another white face" during his time there. The remarks, made in a leaked recording, drew sharp criticism from Labour and Handsworth's MP for reducing people to their skin color and promoting a divisive narrative. Despite the backlash, Jenrick maintains he will not shy away from discussing the issue of "parallel communities," arguing that frank conversation is necessary for national unity.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called on students to avoid participating in pro-Palestinian protests scheduled for the second anniversary of the October 7th Hamas attack on Israel.

          <p>France is facing renewed political turmoil after Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu resigned just 27 days into his tenure, stating he could not form a stable government amid partisan deadlock. President Emmanuel Macron, who now faces the challenge of appointing a sixth prime minister in under two years, has granted Lecornu a 48-hour extension for last-ditch negotiations. The crisis stems from the fragmented parliament resulting from last year's snap election, which has made it impossible for Macron's minority governments to pass key legislation, including the national budget, without broad, and thus far unobtainable, cross-party support.</p>

The SDF accused government forces of targeting residential Kurdish neighborhoods with heavy weapons, leading to civilian casualties. The fighting erupts amid stalled progress on integrating the SDF into the national military and widespread criticism that minority groups like the Kurds were excluded from recent parliamentary elections.

Furthermore, the plan's requirement for Hamas to disarm, the future governance of Gaza, and the timeline for a full Israeli military withdrawal are all significant unresolved issues.

This move is seen as a strategic repositioning by political parties ahead of the 2027 presidential election, where President Macron cannot run again.

However, the bank anticipates this growth momentum may slow to 4.2% in 2026 as stimulus effects fade and persistent domestic challenges, such as the real estate slump and weak consumer spending, continue to weigh on the economy.

          <p>Dr. Neville Lawrence, the father of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, insists that one of his son's convicted killers, David Norris, must identify the other individuals involved in the 1993 racist attack before being considered for release. Norris, who is scheduled for a public Parole Board hearing, recently admitted his presence at the scene after decades of denial, though he claims he did not deliver the fatal stab wound. Dr. Lawrence stated that for Norris to be deemed safe for release, he must provide the names of the other killers, who have never been brought to justice.</p>

          <p>British newspaper front pages are divided between the planned pro-Palestine rallies at UK universities on the anniversary of the Hamas attacks and tributes to the late author Dame Jilly Cooper. Several papers focus on the controversy surrounding the university protests, noting that organizers are proceeding despite calls from government officials to postpone them. Other prominent stories include a report on the government being "blindsided" by the collapse of a Chinese spying case and concerns from nurses' leaders that new rules on foreign staff could trigger a crisis in the NHS. Dame Jilly Cooper's passing is widely covered with affectionate headlines.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers staged a crucial seventh-inning rally to secure a 4-3 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies, taking a 2-0 lead in the National League Division Series. After being shut down for most of the game by Phillies starter Jesús Luzardo, who had retired 17 consecutive batters, the Dodgers' offense came alive with a series of smart at-bats and aggressive baserunning. The four-run inning, capped by key two-out RBI singles from Will Smith and Shohei Ohtani, silenced the Philadelphia crowd and pushed the Phillies to the brink of elimination.</p>

          <p>Chi-Chi's, the Minnesota-founded Mexican restaurant chain that closed its U.S. locations two decades ago, has officially made its return with a new restaurant in St. Louis Park. The reopening was highly anticipated, with reservations for the first day being fully booked and dedicated fans traveling from as far as Ohio to be among the first customers. The revival was made possible through an agreement between the founder's son and Hormel Foods, which has owned the Chi-Chi's trademark since 1987, allowing for the brand's return to physical restaurant locations.</p>

Citing the direct financial impact on her own adult children and constituents, Greene stated on social media that she would not toe the party line on this issue. Her position aligns with a key Democratic demand during the current government shutdown and adds a prominent MAGA voice to a small but growing group of Republicans concerned about the impending premium increases.</p>

This significant reduction in migration flows is attributed to the Trump administration's stringent immigration policies, which include shutting down the asylum system, increasing deportations, and ending the practice of releasing migrants into the U.S. pending their court cases.</p>
