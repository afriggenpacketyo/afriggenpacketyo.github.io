          <p>The British and Irish Lions delivered a commanding performance, defeating the Australia and New Zealand Invitational XV with a decisive 48-0 score in Adelaide. Winger Duhan van der Merwe was a standout player, achieving a hat-trick as the team scored a total of eight tries in their final match before the first Test against the Wallabies. The victory was somewhat marred by injuries, with Garry Ringrose sustaining a suspected head injury and Luke Cowan Dickie being stretchered off the field. The match showcased the strength of the Lions' Scottish contingent, who were responsible for the first six tries.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 08:05:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering a significant policy reversal by authorizing new funding for Ukraine's defense, a move interpreted as a signal to Russia amid its intensified attacks. This potential shift follows Trump's previous criticisms of U.S. aid levels and a recent pause on some arms shipments. According to diplomatic sources, the funding could utilize leftover presidential drawdown authority or seized Russian assets, though no official confirmation has been issued. The consideration reflects the administration's fluctuating and often unpredictable approach to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and its relations with NATO allies.</p>

          <p>A new biography, "Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television," reveals that the 'I Love Lucy' star sought help for his severe alcoholism in his final years, prompted by his son, Desi Jr. Grappling with grief and isolation, Arnaz entered a rehabilitation program in 1985, a decision his daughter Lucie Arnaz called the proudest moment of her life. The book explores how the pressures of his career and past trauma contributed to his addiction, which strained his famous marriage to Lucille Ball. Although he successfully achieved sobriety, Arnaz was diagnosed with lung cancer shortly after and passed away in 1986.</p>

          <p>A review of the book "2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America" delves into its analysis of a turbulent and consequential election. The book, written by journalists Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager, and Isaac Arnsdorf, is praised for being deeply sourced, capturing the political dynamics and delusions of the Trump, Biden, and Harris campaigns. It explores a series of "what-if" scenarios, such as Joe Biden not running for re-election or Donald Trump not facing indictment, to argue the outcome was not predetermined. The review highlights the book's chronicle of how institutional failures and public frustration contributed to the political landscape.</p>

          <p>Josh Earnest, who served as White House press secretary under President Obama, recently described the day after the 2016 election as his most challenging on the job. Speaking at a journalism conference, he recalled the difficult task of reconciling the administration's dire warnings about a Trump presidency with the constitutional duty of a peaceful transfer of power. Earnest provided a firsthand account of the visibly demoralized and emotional atmosphere among White House staff. He shared a poignant moment when President Obama gathered the staff in the Oval Office to deliver an impromptu speech urging unity and patriotism.</p>

          <p>Scientists express growing concern that political and regulatory actions against mRNA Covid-19 vaccines could stall vital cancer research. Groundbreaking therapeutic mRNA vaccines, which have shown promise in treating difficult cancers like pancreatic and melanoma, risk being caught in the backlash. The Trump administration has implemented research cuts and ended funding for some mRNA projects, while some new federal vaccine advisers have voiced skepticism about the technology. Researchers warn that this uncertainty could discourage new projects and derail the significant progress made in personalized cancer treatments.</p>

          <p>This article argues that modern society increasingly restricts children's natural inclination for free, unstructured physical activity, to their detriment. The author contends that fears of injury and social pressures for sedentary behavior are depriving kids of crucial developmental benefits, including better physical health, cognitive skills, and mental well-being. Citing movement experts, the piece suggests that such 'wild' play builds a robust 'movement vocabulary,' which can prevent injuries later in life. It advocates for parents to create more opportunities for free-form physical exploration, like wrestling or balancing games, to foster resilience and skill.</p>

          <p>In Florida, many immigrants are altering their driving behaviors due to fears of being targeted by law enforcement following new state policies. To avoid attracting attention during traffic stops, they are adopting unwritten rules such as not playing Spanish-language music, removing foreign flags from cars, and avoiding work vans or uniforms. This climate of fear is causing significant disruption, with some workers reportedly too scared to drive to their jobs, impacting local businesses like construction.

This move has drawn sharp criticism from opposition parties and the SPD, who accuse the conservatives of deliberately undermining the nation's highest court and democratic institutions.

          <p>In her new book "Rich Girl Nation," author Katie Gatti Tassin argues that beauty expenses represent a significant and often overlooked financial hurdle for women. She describes the recurring costs for hair, nails, and skincare as a "hot girl hamster wheel," an insidious force driven by an industry that profits from insecurities. Tassin asserts that while spending on appearance can feel rational due to "pretty privilege," it is ultimately an investment in a depreciating asset. She advocates for a "hot girl detox," urging women to evaluate their spending and redirect the saved money toward debt repayment, savings, or investments.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold approximately $36.4 million worth of the company's stock, part of a pre-arranged plan to sell up to six million shares this year. The sale comes as Huang's personal net worth has skyrocketed to $143 billion, placing him nearly on par with Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett. This financial success mirrors that of his company, which recently became the first to surpass a $4 trillion market capitalization, driven by the explosive demand for its AI chips. Despite the sale, Huang continues to hold over 858 million shares of Nvidia both directly and indirectly.</p>

          <p>Small businesses along Malibu's Pacific Coast Highway are still grappling with the economic fallout six months after the devastating Palisades fire. Though many were not destroyed, extensive road closures isolated them from customers for months, and business remains significantly below normal levels even during the peak summer season. Eateries, surf shops, and souvenir stores report sales are down by 25-30% compared to last year, as the community slowly rebuilds and tourists gradually return. Business owners express cautious hope for a return to normalcy but face an ongoing struggle for viability in the fire's aftermath.</p>

The installations, placed along the garden's pathways and in its galleries, blend art with scientific data to highlight these disparities.

          <p>This commentary addresses the recent culture war backlash against the new "Superman" film, arguing that accusations of it being "superwoke" are overblown. The author points out that Superman, an alien from Krypton raised on Earth, has fundamentally always been an immigrant story, a concept rooted in the character's creation by children of Jewish immigrants. The piece suggests that the film's focus on kindness and the hero's choice to protect humanity, shaped by his all-American upbringing in Kansas, reinforces themes of assimilation and opportunity rather than radical politics. The controversy is framed as a misinterpretation of the character's core identity.</p>

          <p>Recent federal immigration raids in Los Angeles are having an unintended consequence: a surge in abandoned and surrendered pets. Animal rescue organizations report that as people are deported or flee, their dogs and cats are being left behind in empty apartments or dropped at already overcrowded shelters. This influx of animals is straining a system already at capacity, increasing the risk of euthanasia for many. Furthermore, some pet owners are forgoing necessary veterinary care for their animals out of fear of being arrested if they venture outside, creating what advocates call collateral damage to the area's pets.</p>
