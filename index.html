          <p>A tragic shooting at Annunciation Church, which houses a school in Minneapolis, resulted in the deaths of two children, aged eight and ten, and injuries to seventeen others, including fourteen children and three elderly parishioners. The attacker, 23-year-old Robin Westman, died by suicide at the scene, having fired dozens of shots through windows using multiple firearms. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics, with a manifesto from the suspect found. This article highlights the profound trauma experienced by the community, as officials note all injured victims are expected to survive, underscoring the devastating impact of such an event.</p>

          <p>The recent news of Taylor Swift's engagement has ignited a public conversation about the phenomenon of parasocial relationships, where fans develop strong, one-sided emotional connections with celebrities. This article delves into how the increased accessibility of stars' private lives through social media fosters an illusion of intimacy, making fans feel personally invested in their idols' milestones. Psychologists characterize these as "my friend who doesn't know me" relationships, providing a sense of community, especially online. However, experts emphasize that while these connections can offer distraction, they lack the reciprocal nature essential for genuine human connection and cannot replace real-life friendships.</p>

          <p>The value of small parcels shipped from China to the UK under an import tax exemption more than doubled last year, reaching £3bn, largely driven by e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu. This article reports that the UK government is now reviewing the £135 customs duty exemption, facing pressure from domestic businesses and industry groups who argue it undercuts High Street retailers and exposes consumers to potentially unsafe goods. While some warn that removing the exemption could disproportionately affect lower-income consumers, the Treasury's review is ongoing. The US has already ended its similar "de minimis" exemption, and the EU plans to introduce a flat fee.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has issued a stark warning, asserting that Donald Trump is gravely serious about seeking an unconstitutional third term as president, urging Americans to recognize his disregard for democratic norms. Newsom, a potential presidential contender, recounted a private Oval Office meeting where Trump allegedly pointed to a portrait of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the only president to serve more than two terms, and discussed a third term. This article highlights Newsom's combative stance, including his online trolling of Trump, and his efforts to challenge Republican redistricting. The governor implored the public to take Trump's statements seriously, viewing them as a threat to the nation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's foreign ministry spokesman, Guo Jiakun, issued a stern warning against external interference in the China-South Korea relationship, asserting that their ties are founded on mutual interests and are not aimed at any third party. This diplomatic statement comes in the wake of South Korean President Lee Jae-myung's recent comments suggesting Seoul must rebalance its relationship with Beijing amid escalating US-China competition. Lee indicated that South Korea can no longer maintain its historical approach of economic cooperation with China and security reliance on the US, signaling a strategic alignment with America's fundamental policy stance.

          <p>Wuliangye Yibin, China's second-largest liquor distiller, has reported its slowest earnings growth in a decade, with first-half revenue rising 4.2% and net profit increasing 2.3%. This article attributes the decline to the intensified anti-corruption campaign, which has curbed ostentatious spending, and a broader economic slowdown affecting the baijiu sector. Peers like Kweichow Moutai and Jiugui Liquor also experienced their slowest growth or significant profit plunges. The report from Guosen Securities further indicates that policy factors led to a sharp reduction in baijiu consumption in the second quarter, impacting sales of mainstream products.

This article details that a police raid on the villa found German documents but not the painting, which is now missing.

          <p>The 70th anniversary of Emmett Till's death is being commemorated with a train ride from Chicago to Mississippi, retracing his fateful 1955 journey. This article highlights the participation of Till's cousin, Rev. Wheeler Parker Jr., the last surviving eyewitness to his kidnapping, and other key figures.

The fires have also released a record 17.68 million tonnes of CO2 in Spain, exacerbating climate change in a vicious cycle.
