        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million lawsuit against Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and Lively's publicist, Leslie Sloane. Baldoni accused them of civil extortion and defamation after Lively alleged sexual harassment and retaliation against him, accusations which Baldoni denied. A similar defamation lawsuit against The New York Times was also dismissed, though Baldoni and his company can amend some claims by June 23. Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a victory, calling Baldoni's lawsuit a sham, while representatives for Baldoni did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved Merck's Enflonsia, a shot to protect infants from RSV, setting up competition with Sanofi and AstraZeneca's Beyfortus. Merck plans to begin taking orders in July and deliver shipments before the RSV season starts, offering doctors another option to combat the virus, which causes significant infant mortality and hospitalizations. Enflonsia can be administered regardless of infant weight, potentially simplifying dosing compared to Beyfortus. Sanofi plans to increase Beyfortus supply after shortages last year, and the CDC will soon provide recommendations for RSV shots and other immunizations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he would support the arrest of California Governor Gavin Newsom for allegedly obstructing federal immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. This comment came shortly before Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta announced they would sue Trump for deploying National Guard troops to address protests over those enforcement actions. The lawsuit argues Trump's action is unconstitutional and exceeds his authority, as it occurred without Newsom's consent or input. Newsom responded to Trump's statement by calling it an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>The clean energy transition is heavily reliant on critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, and copper, essential for technologies such as solar panels, batteries, and electric motors. Demand for these minerals is expected to increase significantly by 2040, potentially leading to supply chain vulnerabilities. The US is a major consumer but not a significant producer of these minerals, prompting efforts to increase domestic production and secure international supplies. Scientists are also exploring alternative materials to reduce reliance on these critical elements.</p>

          <p>UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned of the dangers of letting the ocean floor become a "wild west" due to deep-sea mining, during the UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France. The conference aimed to ratify the High Seas Treaty, allowing countries to establish protected marine areas in international waters. While French President Emmanuel Macron is advocating for a moratorium on deep-sea mining, the US, China, and Russia are keen to exploit the potential mineral wealth on the ocean floor.

This affordability crisis is driven by a lack of housing supply and rising interest rates, with most Americans unable to afford homes on the market. While new home construction has decreased, there is a silver lining as some homeowners are willing to cut prices in high-cost markets. Housing inventory is starting to build in cities like San Diego, San Jose, and Washington, D.C.</p>

Brooks broke into Perks's home armed with a crowbar, petrol, matches, and a knife, intending to set the house on fire. The attack stemmed from disciplinary proceedings against Brooks, where Perks was a witness, and the judge noted Brooks's lack of remorse and fixation on his employment difficulties.</p>

          <p>The decision by President Trump to federalize the California National Guard to address protests against immigration enforcement is a concerning use of military power domestically. Legal experts argue that the protests do not meet the conditions required for federalizing the National Guard under existing statutes. The move raises concerns about the president's willingness to use the military against demonstrators and undermines the norms that have historically restrained presidents from deploying federal troops in domestic situations without a governor's request.</p>

          <p>China's dominance in the production of samarium, a rare earth metal, poses a threat to Western militaries. The United States and its allies rely on samarium to rebuild inventories of fighter jets, missiles, and other military hardware. China's control over the entire world's supply of this critical mineral raises concerns about potential supply chain vulnerabilities and national security.</p>

          <p>Russia launched its largest drone and missile assault of the war on Ukraine, deploying nearly 500 weapons. The attack surpassed a record set just days earlier, as Russia attempts to overwhelm Ukraine's air defenses. Ukrainian forces managed to shoot down the majority of the incoming drones and missiles, mitigating some of the damage.</p>

The US delegation, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, is meeting with Chinese representatives to address key issues such as rare earth exports and access to US technology.

          <h2>Low Voter Turnout Derails Italy Referendum on Citizenship</h2>

          <p>A referendum in Italy aimed at expediting citizenship for immigrants and strengthening labor rights failed due to low voter turnout, following calls for a boycott from Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and right-wing parties. The referendum sought to reduce the naturalization period from 10 to 5 years, benefiting second-generation Italians born to non-EU citizens. Despite support from economists who viewed the change as a potential solution to Italy's demographic challenges, voter participation fell far short of the required 50%.</p>
