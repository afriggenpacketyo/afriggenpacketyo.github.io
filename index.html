        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major technology companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Apple are striking unprecedented deals with the Trump administration to mitigate the impact of tariffs. Nvidia and AMD agreed to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of their China revenues for advanced chip sales, while Apple committed to a $600 billion U.S. investment. Analysts view these as efforts by Big Tech to secure relief from financial burdens, as tariff costs have significantly impacted profits. The arrangements raise concerns among investors about policy stability and the potential for arbitrary government intervention in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average two-year mortgage rate in the UK has fallen to 4.99%, marking the first time it has dipped below 5% since Liz Truss's mini-budget in September 2022. This drop is seen as a "symbolic turning point" for homebuyers, driven by aggressive competition among lenders and Bank of England rate cuts. While affordability is gradually improving, rates remain higher than pre-mini-budget levels, and economists anticipate the base rate will hold steady for longer despite recent cuts. Hundreds of thousands of borrowers are expected to remortgage this year, facing a still-competitive market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to announce this year's Kennedy Center honorees, marking a significant visit after his administration's efforts to reshape the cultural institution. Following accusations of the center being "woke" and scrutiny of its finances, Trump replaced Biden-appointed board members with his allies, and the new board subsequently installed Trump as chairman. This move is part of a broader initiative to "bring the Kennedy Center back to the absolute TOP LEVEL of luxury, glamour, and entertainment," with discussions even including renaming the opera house after Melania Trump.</p>

Florida panthers, the only mountain lion subspecies in the eastern U.S., have a population estimated between 120 and 230 adults.

Key mistakes include changing jobs before loan approval, opening new credit lines, and skipping mortgage preapproval, all of which can jeopardize loan terms. Experts emphasize that Fed rate cuts don't automatically guarantee lower mortgage payments, as market factors like the 10-year Treasury yield and increased demand can influence outcomes. Instead, prospective buyers should focus on strengthening their financial position by boosting credit scores, saving for larger down payments, and shopping around for the best rates.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 09:14:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that microplastics, tiny plastic fragments pervasive in the environment, are being absorbed by plants and can disrupt photosynthesis, the fundamental process for plant growth and oxygen production. A study indicates this could reduce photosynthesis by up to 12%, potentially leading to significant drops in seafood and staple crop yields, threatening food security for millions. Experts emphasize the urgent need for more data, particularly from the Global South, and call for reduced plastic production and better regulation to mitigate this growing environmental and food security concern.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California is engaged in a legal battle with the federal government over President Trump's deployment of thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, which the state argues was illegal and caused "anxiety and fear." California claims the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits military involvement in domestic law enforcement, alleging troops provided armed security, set roadblocks, and detained civilians. The Justice Department maintains the deployment was legal, intended to protect federal property and personnel. This trial underscores a broader debate about presidential authority in deploying military forces domestically.</p>

          <p>Nearly one in five student loan borrowers aged 50 and older are seriously delinquent on their payments, a significant increase from 2019, as the Trump administration resumes collection activities. Many older Americans struggle due to borrowing for their children's education or re-entering school later in life without expected career gains. While Social Security benefit garnishments are paused, wage garnishments are anticipated. Experts advise exploring income-driven repayment plans and temporary forbearances to avoid severe consequences like default, emphasizing the need for sustainable payment solutions.

          <p>Thailand's military is expanding its influence following recent border clashes with Cambodia, raising concerns about a potential return to junta rule. The conflict has weakened the civilian government, with Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra suspended and accusations of treason against her party. Analysts note the military's increased control over defense policy and its high public trust compared to the government. Despite a ceasefire mediated by Malaysia and a warning from U.S. President Trump, the political instability and military resurgence make another coup "unlikely but never off the table."</p>

          <p>India's Supreme Court has ordered authorities in Delhi to remove all stray dogs from residential streets within two months, citing an increase in dog bites and rabies cases. This directive, however, has sparked anger among animal rights activists, who argue it is impractical, inhumane, and contradicts established animal birth control rules. With an estimated 800,000 to 1 million stray dogs in Delhi and limited shelter capacity, activists advocate for sterilization, vaccination, and proper waste management as more effective and humane solutions. The Chief Justice has indicated he will review the controversial order.</p>

          <p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has referred himself to the Environment Agency for an "administrative oversight" after fishing without a rod license with U.S. Vice President JD Vance at Chevening House.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indicated a shift in Gaza ceasefire efforts towards a comprehensive deal to release all remaining hostages, moving away from a previously discussed phased release. This comes as intense Israeli strikes continue in Gaza, with the Hamas-run health ministry reporting significant Palestinian fatalities, including children. While mediators like Egypt and Qatar are reportedly preparing a new framework for a full hostage release in exchange for an end to the war, achieving this quickly remains challenging given Israel's demands for Hamas to surrender control of Gaza.</p>
