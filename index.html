          <p>A Trump administration special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is scheduled to meet with Israeli and Qatari officials in Rome to further negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza. The talks are part of a significant U.S. effort to end the nearly two-year conflict. According to reports, if substantial progress is achieved, Witkoff may travel to Doha to finalize the agreement. The proposed deal is centered around a 60-day ceasefire that includes a phased hostage release and could pave the way for an expansion of the Abraham Accords.</p>

          <p>During the initial six months of the second Trump administration, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is on course to carry out the most deportations since 2014. Internal government data reveals nearly 150,000 deportations, projecting an annual total over 300,000, though this figure remains below the administration's goal of one million. The agency has received a substantial funding increase and has broadened its enforcement mandate, resulting in a notable rise in arrests and detentions amid ongoing public debate over immigration policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Real estate experts express skepticism that eliminating the capital gains tax on home sales, a proposal floated by President Trump, would resolve the nation's housing affordability issues. While the National Association of Realtors suggests the change could incentivize more homeowners, especially downsizing retirees, to sell and thereby boost housing inventory, some analysts disagree. They argue the tax primarily impacts high-end homeowners and that broader economic confidence, rather than this specific tax policy, is the more critical driver for the housing market's stability.

          <p>The Ukrainian government is encountering significant public and international criticism after President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a law that curtails the independence of two key anti-corruption bodies. The new legislation places the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap) under the control of the presidentially-appointed prosecutor general. This move has triggered street protests and expressions of concern from Western allies, who view the fight against corruption as essential for Ukraine's potential EU integration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered a method to render mosquitoes highly resistant to spreading malaria by making a single genetic tweak. Using gene-editing technology, scientists altered one amino acid in a mosquito's genome, which significantly disrupted the malaria parasite's ability to travel to the insect's salivary glands. This change, which could potentially be spread through a wild mosquito population using a gene drive, offers a promising new strategy in the fight against a disease that infects over 260 million people annually, though the technology remains controversial.</p>

          <p>California's Attorney General, Rob Bonta, has announced he will seek a court order to place Los Angeles County's juvenile halls under state control through a receivership. This drastic measure follows years of the county's failure to implement court-ordered reforms in facilities plagued by riots, drug overdoses, allegations of abuse, and the death of a teenager. Bonta stated that this is a last resort to ensure the safety and well-being of the youth in custody, citing a lack of meaningful progress from the L.A. County Probation Department.</p>

          <p>Police in Hemet, California, have arrested a 73-year-old convicted felon for allegedly impersonating a law enforcement officer.

A search revealed he was armed with stun guns, a baton, and pepper spray, all of which he is prohibited from possessing due to his felony status, leading to his arrest on several misdemeanor charges.</p>

Although no one was injured, officials emphasized the significant danger posed, as one device contained explosive material far exceeding legal limits for consumer fireworks.

While the company surpassed second-quarter earnings estimates, Ilan suggested that some of this strength might have been due to customers pulling demand forward to build inventory ahead of potential tariff impacts.

In a study on mice, an experimental mRNA vaccine, designed to stimulate a general immune response rather than target specific cancer cells, significantly boosted the effectiveness of common immunotherapy drugs. The vaccine works by making tumors more vulnerable to attack from the immune system. If these promising results can be replicated in humans, it could lead to an off-the-shelf vaccine applicable to a wide range of cancer patients.</p>

The text strongly advises against paying only the minimum, as high interest rates cause debt to grow significantly over time.
