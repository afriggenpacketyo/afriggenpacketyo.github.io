          <p>The UK government established a confidential Afghan Response Route in April 2024 following a significant data breach. In February 2022, a Ministry of Defence official inadvertently leaked a dataset containing the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for relocation after the Taliban takeover. The breach was discovered in August 2023 when some details were posted on Facebook. The existence of the new, secret scheme was protected by a court injunction but has now been made public following a High Court ruling.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter results that surpassed analyst expectations, largely due to robust performance in its fixed income trading and investment banking divisions. The bank's earnings were $5.24 a share on $45.68 billion in revenue, beating estimates despite a 17% drop in net income compared to the previous year, which was inflated by a gain on Visa shares. CEO Jamie Dimon highlighted the U.S. economy's resilience but also reiterated warnings about risks from trade policy, geopolitical conflicts, and high fiscal deficits. The report indicates the bank successfully navigated market turbulence during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

The toddler's mother, Shannon Ives, was also found guilty of causing or allowing the death of a child and child cruelty. During the seven-week trial, prosecutors presented evidence including a distressing 999 call and CCTV footage showing Ethan struggling and repeatedly falling. The case highlights a tragic instance of fatal child abuse within a family.</p>

          <p>Intense storms on Monday night triggered flash flood warnings across the New York City metropolitan area, causing significant disruptions and damage. Heavy rainfall led to severe flooding of subway stations, roads, and highways, prompting New Jersey's governor to declare a state of emergency. Commuter services like the MTA subway and Metro-North Railroad experienced major delays, with officials urging people to postpone travel. The rapid flooding resulted in numerous 911 calls and vehicle rescues, particularly in New Jersey and New York's Westchester County.</p>

          <h2>Pastor Argues Against Churches Endorsing Political Candidates Following IRS Rule Change</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 07:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A pastor and divinity school professor argues that despite a recent IRS rule change allowing political endorsements, houses of worship should refrain from this practice. While acknowledging the historical necessity for churches, particularly in the Black church tradition, to address political issues of justice, the author distinguishes this from endorsing specific candidates. Endorsing candidates is seen as potentially destructive, risking the creation of deeper political divisions within congregations and reducing the church's role to a political tool. The piece advocates for maintaining the church's focus on moral guidance over partisan politics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a personal essay, a writer reflects on their experience growing up in the Southern Baptist tradition and later leaving a conservative Anglican church. The departure was driven by the realization that they could not reconcile their identity as a lesbian with the church's exclusionary theology regarding same-sex relationships. The author describes the agonizing choice between their community and their personal integrity, ultimately finding a deeper faith after leaving. The essay argues that for many LGBTQ Christians, affirming their identity is a sincere religious conviction, not a capitulation to secular culture.</p>

          <p>An exploration team has discovered the wreck of the Japanese destroyer Teruzuki, which was sunk by U.S. torpedo boats during the Battle of Guadalcanal in 1942. The warship was found by the Ocean Exploration Trust over 2,600 feet below the surface near the Solomon Islands, remarkably with unused depth charges still on its stern. The discovery provides the first visual record of the ship since it sank, as no historical images of the Teruzuki exist. The find disproves a long-held theory that explosions from its own depth charges sealed its fate.</p>

Analysts suggest that at this price point, Tesla will compete in the premium segment against brands like BMW rather than the mass market.
