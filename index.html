          <p>Asia-Pacific markets largely rose on Friday, as investors keenly anticipated U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the annual economic symposium for insights into future interest rate decisions. South Korea's Kospi and Japan's Topix posted gains, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 saw a decline after crossing the 9,000 mark the previous day. The article notes that U.S. stocks fell for a fifth consecutive day, with the S&P 500 sliding, and Fed funds futures indicate a nearly 74% likelihood of a rate cut in September. This global market focus on U.S. monetary policy highlights the interconnectedness of economies and the significant influence of central bank guidance on investor sentiment and regional performance.

          <p>European stocks, led by London's FTSE 100, saw further declines as traders analyzed the recently released specifics of the EU-U.S. trade deal. The agreement caps tariffs on EU pharmaceuticals exported to the U.S. at 15%, a reduction from previously threatened higher rates. However, automotive stocks fell due to the conditional nature of their tariff reductions, requiring Brussels to lower its own industrial duties first. Separately, a revised reading indicated Germany's economy contracted more sharply than initially estimated in the second quarter, adding to market caution.

          <p>President Donald Trump has agreed to cap tariffs on EU pharmaceutical and semiconductor imports at 15%, a significant reduction from his previous threats of up to 250%. This detail emerged from the in-depth release of the US-EU trade deal, initially announced last month. The agreement also links reduced tariffs on European car exports to the EU removing duties on all US industrial goods, a move requiring new legislation. While welcomed by industries like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, sectors such as wine and spirits expressed disappointment at their exclusion from tariff exemptions.

This address is expected to offer crucial indications about the future direction of the US economy and the Fed's monetary policy plans for the coming months. Despite Trump's repeated calls for cuts, the Fed has maintained rates, but traders now see a significant chance of a reduction in September, the first in nine months.

          <p>Nvidia has reportedly instructed component suppliers to cease production of its China-specific H20 general processing units, following a Chinese government directive to local tech firms to halt purchases. Beijing cited alleged security concerns, including potential tracking technology or 'backdoors,' leading to the production halt by companies like Amkor Technology and Samsung. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang confirmed ongoing discussions with Chinese authorities, stating the company assured them such backdoors do not exist. This situation highlights the complex challenges Nvidia faces navigating escalating trade tensions and national security scrutiny between the U.S. and China, impacting its lucrative market access.</p>

          <p>India's Supreme Court has revised an earlier order regarding stray dogs in New Delhi, now mandating that captured animals be sterilized and immunized before release, except for rabid or aggressive cases. The court also prohibited public feeding of stray dogs, directing civic bodies to establish designated feeding zones in municipal wards and warning of legal action for non-compliance. This modification follows widespread protests from animal rights activists against the initial order for mass removals. The court aims to frame a nationwide policy, addressing both public safety concerns regarding dog bite incidents and promoting more humane animal welfare practices across the country.</p>

While Erin is not forecast for a direct U.S. landfall, dangerous storm surge and life-threatening surf conditions have prompted evacuations in parts of the Outer Banks, with some homes on the verge of collapse.

This figure, which excludes fresh food, marks the lowest since March, primarily due to easing rice prices after months of significant increases that had surged past 100%. The Bank of Japan closely monitors inflation, and this persistent above-target reading could influence future monetary policy decisions, with some analysts suggesting a rate hike in September or October.

          <p>Controversial former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been acquitted by a Bangkok court of charges of insulting the monarchy, which could have resulted in a 15-year jail sentence. The charges stemmed from a 2015 interview where he commented on the 2014 military coup, alleging palace involvement. Critics argue Thailand's lese majeste law is often used to target political opponents, and the court's literal interpretation of the law, noting he didn't name specific individuals, led to the rare acquittal. This verdict offers relief to the Shinawatra family, whose political influence faces ongoing challenges amidst a shifting political landscape in Thailand.</p>

          <p>Erik Menendez was denied parole by California officials after spending decades in prison for the 1989 murders of his parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez. The parole panel cited his 'behavior in prison,' including multiple policy violations since 2013 such as drug smuggling and misuse of computers, as the primary reason for the denial. Despite family support and claims of self-defense due to alleged sexual assault, the panel determined he still posed an unreasonable risk to public safety. Menendez will be eligible for another parole hearing in three years, as the case continues to draw public fascination and legal scrutiny.</p>
