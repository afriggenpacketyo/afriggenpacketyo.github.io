          <p>A year after significant electoral losses and leadership instability, the Scottish National Party (SNP) is demonstrating a political resurgence under leader John Swinney. Polling suggests the party has stabilized and could be heading towards a majority in the next Holyrood election, partly due to the fragmentation of support among rival parties like Labour and the Conservatives. This potential majority is central to the SNP's strategy for demanding another independence referendum, citing the precedent set in 2011. The party's resilience is bolstered by the nearly 50/50 split on the constitutional question within Scotland.</p>

          <p>As Beijing prepares its 15th five-year plan, the focus is shifting to its implications for industrial collaboration with Taiwan, particularly in high-tech sectors. A recent delegation of Taiwanese executives, including from major firms like Delta Electronics, visited a mainland Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer to explore potential partnerships. This highlights an evolution in the cross-strait economic relationship, where Taiwanese companies are increasingly becoming key suppliers of specialized components for leading mainland industries. The new plan is expected to further shape these evolving economic and industrial dynamics between the two.</p>

          <p>A husband and wife from Middletown, Rhode Island, were killed when their single-engine plane crashed on Route 195 in Dartmouth, Massachusetts. The aircraft, a Socata TBM-700, had just taken off from New Bedford Regional Airport when it went down, bursting into flames on the highway median. A woman driving on the highway sustained non-life-threatening injuries after her car was struck by a piece of the aircraft. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the crash, with poor weather from a nor'easter being a potential factor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Northern Ireland's manager, Michael O'Neill, expressed frustration with the match officials after his team's 1-0 loss to Germany in a World Cup qualifier. He criticized referee Jesus Gil Manzano as "over fussy" and questioned the decision to add only two minutes of injury time despite numerous substitutions and stoppages. O'Neill lamented that a "freak goal" from Nick Woltemade, which deflected off his shoulder, was the deciding factor in the match. The defeat leaves Northern Ireland in a challenging position in their qualifying group, needing a positive result against Slovakia.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace face significant premium increases if federal subsidies are not renewed. These tax credits, expanded during the pandemic, are set to expire at the end of the year, creating anxiety for families who could see their monthly costs rise by hundreds of dollars. The issue has become a central point of contention in government spending negotiations, with Democrats insisting on their renewal. Experts warn that failure to extend the subsidies could lead to millions losing coverage, with Republican-led states that did not expand Medicaid potentially being the hardest hit.</p>

          <p>Several prominent U.S. news outlets, including The Washington Post and The New York Times, have refused to sign a new Pentagon policy that restricts their reporting activities. The directive, issued by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, requires journalists to pledge not to obtain unauthorized material and limits their access unless officially escorted. Media organizations argue these rules are an unconstitutional constraint on freedom of the press and are designed to stifle reporting on the military. The Pentagon has defended the policy as necessary for national security, while critics view it as an act of intimidation against the press.</p>

Tuchel emphasized that talent alone is not enough at the elite level and that Rashford must regularly reach his personal best. The manager's comments serve as both a note of caution and encouragement for the 27-year-old player to maximize his career opportunities.</p>

          <p>A contributor argues that President Trump's executive order on "Countering Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence" creates a dangerous precedent for repressing free expression. The article suggests the order, which builds on a previous designation of antifa as a terrorist group, could be used to weaponize federal law enforcement against political opponents in Democratic-led cities. This could involve using Joint Terrorism Task Forces to investigate protest organizers and chill lawful dissent under the guise of national security. The author warns this path risks militarizing the domestic landscape and eroding constitutional protections for speech and assembly.</p>

This move comes as the overall forecast for seasonal retail hiring is expected to be at its lowest since 2009, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

The key to its authentic taste lies in specific Venezuelan peppers, such as ají dulce, which are not commonly available in the U.S. and are now being grown locally by a Maryland farmer specifically for the restaurant. Chefs at the establishment note that the distinct aroma and fruitiness of these peppers are essential to their dishes. The restaurant aims to provide a cultural experience that seduces diners with a combination of flavors they have likely never encountered before.</p>

          <h2>Stock Market Recovers as President Trump Adopts Softer Stance on China Tariffs</h2>

          <p>U.S. stocks rebounded on Monday, recovering from a sharp plunge at the end of the previous week. The market's recovery was driven by President Trump's more conciliatory tone regarding trade tensions with China, after he had announced a significant new tariff on Chinese imports. On Sunday, the president suggested on social media that a resolution was possible, easing investor fears of an escalating trade war. This shift in sentiment allowed markets to regain some stability ahead of the upcoming earnings season, which is expected to be the next major focus for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Big Ten conference has fined the University of Southern California (USC) $5,000 for violating its rules on pregame availability reports. During a game against Michigan, USC coach Lincoln Riley played running back Bryan Jackson, who had been listed as "out" due to a turf toe injury. The decision was made mid-game after two other running backs suffered serious injuries, a situation Riley described as a "near catastrophe" and a "wellness issue." Despite USC claiming they communicated with the league office, the conference imposed the fine to enforce the accuracy of injury reports.</p>

JPL Director Dave Gallagher stated that the action is essential for creating a leaner infrastructure and ensuring the lab's future competitiveness in the evolving space ecosystem. Managed by Caltech, JPL is a key research and development center for NASA, and the layoffs are intended to help it better focus on its core technical capabilities.</p>

          <p>Donna Adelson, the matriarch of a wealthy South Florida family, has been found guilty of first-degree murder, conspiracy, and solicitation in the 2014 killing of her former son-in-law, Daniel Markel. Markel, a Florida State University law professor, was in a bitter custody dispute with Adelson's daughter at the time of his death. Prosecutors successfully argued that Adelson orchestrated the murder-for-hire plot after Markel prevented his ex-wife from moving their children closer to her family. She is the fifth person to be convicted in connection with the case, which has drawn attention for over a decade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. supply chain is bracing for new financial pressures as the government imposes additional tariffs on Chinese-made port machinery, including various types of cranes and terminal tractors. These new fees, which can raise the total tariff rate to as high as 270%, are set to go into effect just ahead of new port fees on freight vessels. The American Association of Port Authorities expressed concern that these taxes will challenge the industry's ability to finance necessary equipment for expansion and resilience. The measures are part of a broader trade conflict, with experts warning they will make U.S. imports more expensive and exports less competitive. (not investment advice)</p>
