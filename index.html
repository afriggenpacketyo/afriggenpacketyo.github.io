          <p>IBM announced first-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analysts' forecasts, although the stock experienced a slight dip in extended trading. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.60 against an expected $1.40, and revenue of $14.54 billion, slightly above the $14.4 billion expectation. IBM maintained its full-year outlook, projecting $13.5 billion in free cash flow and 5% revenue growth, with CEO Arvind Krishna expressing optimism about long-term technology growth opportunities. The company also highlighted its acquisition of HashiCorp and plans to acquire DataStax, reflecting its continued investment in cloud software and data storage solutions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of a dozen states has initiated legal action against President Donald Trump and his administration, challenging the legality of newly imposed tariffs on foreign imports. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade, argues that the president lacks the authority to arbitrarily impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The states contend that these tariffs disrupt the constitutional order and harm the American economy, as they shift the power to levy taxes from Congress to the executive branch. The attorneys general involved assert that these tariffs will ultimately burden consumers in their respective states.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, has consumed 12,500 acres and is approximately 40% contained, prompting a state of emergency declaration and evacuations for around 5,000 residents. The Jones Road Wildfire, which started in the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area, has threatened over 1,300 homes and resulted in power outages for 25,000 customers. While no single-family homes were damaged, one business was destroyed, and officials are investigating the cause of the fire, which is expected to be the largest in New Jersey in 20 years. Fire officials point to ongoing dry conditions and expect the fire to continue burning until significant precipitation arrives.</p>

          <p>Chipotle Mexican Grill reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue, marking the first decline in same-store sales since 2020, attributed to a slowdown in consumer spending and adverse weather conditions. The company's same-store sales fell by 0.4%, falling short of projections, and restaurant transactions decreased by 2.3%. Consequently, Chipotle has lowered its full-year same-store sales growth outlook to low single digits. CEO Scott Boatwright remains confident in the company's plan to return to positive transaction growth in the second half of the year through investments in its people, culinary offerings, and innovation.

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for his refusal to recognize Russian control of Crimea, claiming it harms peace negotiations. This follows Vice President JD Vance outlining a U.S. proposal that would involve freezing territorial lines and potentially require both Ukraine and Russia to cede territory. Zelenskyy immediately rejected the idea as unconstitutional, leading to a clash of words and highlighting the often fractious relationship between the two leaders. The U.S. is intensifying its efforts to broker a deal to end the Ukraine war, but success remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the retrofitting of a room near the Pentagon press briefing room into a makeup studio, raising eyebrows amidst administration cost-cutting efforts. The project, estimated to cost several thousand dollars, was initiated following suggestions from a former Fox News producer. Hegseth, formerly a Fox News co-host, reportedly does his own makeup for television appearances. While the Defense Department claims the renovated green room will be available to senior leaders, Hegseth has been using the press room for TV appearances, including one where he addressed the controversy surrounding his sharing of sensitive military strike details in a Signal group chat.</p>

          <p>YouTube is celebrating its 20th anniversary, marking two decades since the first video was uploaded, and is on track to become the largest media company by revenue in 2025, potentially surpassing Disney. Analysts estimate YouTube's value between $475 billion and $550 billion, driven by its creator community and subscription services like Premium, Music, and TV. YouTube's growth is also bolstered by its integration within Google's ecosystem, providing valuable user data for targeted advertising. As Google faces increased competition in search from AI chatbots, YouTube remains a critical growth driver, contributing significantly to Alphabet's total revenue.</p>

India's foreign secretary stated the treaty will remain suspended until Pakistan ceases its support for cross-border terrorism.

          <p>Harvey Weinstein's sexual assault retrial has commenced in New York, with prosecutors accusing the former film producer of using his power to abuse three women. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyer sought to cast doubt on the women's claims and credibility. He is accused of sexually abusing a former television production assistant, an aspiring actress, and a model. The retrial is centered on two women who brought allegations against Weinstein for his 2020 trial, and now includes allegations from a former Polish model and actress who has accused Weinstein of sexual assault when she was 16.</p>
