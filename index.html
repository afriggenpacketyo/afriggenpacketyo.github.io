          <p>The UK government has announced new powers for police to impose restrictions on recurring protests by considering their cumulative impact on communities. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood clarified this is about placing conditions, not an outright ban, aiming to balance the right to protest with public safety and residents' quality of life. The move follows recent large-scale demonstrations and an attack on a synagogue, which have heightened concerns about community relations and stretched police resources across the country.</p>

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has urged calm following multiple drone sightings over airports and military sites, stating they have not posed a concrete threat so far. He emphasized that while drone defense is improving, the military cannot be responsible for downing drones everywhere, highlighting the need for state and federal police to build their capabilities. The discussion comes as Munich Airport experienced significant disruptions and Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt proposes a joint drone defense unit to counter potential provocations.</p>

The eastern Ilam district was hit particularly hard, where multiple villages were swept away and a single family of six was killed when their home was buried. Rescue and relief efforts are being severely hampered by the continuous rainfall and blocked roads, which have also disrupted domestic flights and cut off major highways.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a major overnight assault on Ukraine, killing at least five people and causing significant damage to infrastructure, particularly in the western city of Lviv and Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reported that over 50 missiles and hundreds of drones were used, leading to widespread power outages and prompting him to call for enhanced air defense capabilities. In response to the proximity of the attacks, neighboring NATO member Poland scrambled its fighter jets to secure its airspace.</p>

          <p>Syria is holding its first parliamentary elections since the fall of Bashar Assad's regime, though the process is not a popular vote. Instead, two-thirds of the 210-seat assembly are being chosen by electoral colleges, with the remaining third appointed by the interim president, a system authorities say is necessary due to widespread displacement. The elections are being closely watched as an indicator of the interim government's commitment to inclusivity, though concerns remain about the postponement of voting in Kurdish and Druze-majority areas.</p>

          <p>Despite recent record sales, the U.S. electric vehicle market is lagging significantly behind global counterparts like China and Europe, where EVs constitute a much larger share of new car sales. Analysts attribute this gap to weaker government incentives, higher average costs for EVs, and policy uncertainty, particularly with the recent expiration of a key $7,500 tax credit. Automakers like Ford and GM now anticipate a sharp decline in demand, raising concerns about the competitiveness of the U.S. auto industry in the global transition to electric mobility.
