          <p>Three miners have been safely rescued in northern British Columbia after being trapped underground for two days following a mine collapse. The men, contractors at the Newmont-operated Red Chris mine, were reported to be in good health and spirits after sheltering in a refuge chamber with supplies. The chamber was sealed off by a large debris pile from two separate cave-ins, prompting a complex rescue operation to clear the access tunnel. A full investigation into the incident will be conducted, and production at the copper and gold mine remains suspended.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 05:39:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are observing a rise in sinkhole occurrences globally, linking the phenomenon to climate change-induced extreme weather. Sinkholes form when water erodes underground soil and soluble bedrock, a process exacerbated by cycles of drought and intense rainfall, which weaken the ground. Populated areas in karst terrains like Florida, Turkey, and parts of China are particularly vulnerable, with human activities like excessive groundwater pumping intensifying the risk. Experts are using technology to detect underground voids and implementing engineering solutions and water management strategies to mitigate the danger to lives and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The United States and Mexico have signed a new agreement to address the decades-old crisis of sewage from the Tijuana River polluting Southern California beaches. The accord establishes a timetable for Mexico to complete its $93 million allocation for infrastructure projects through 2027 to stop the flow of billions of gallons of raw sewage and toxic chemicals. The pollution has caused persistent beach closures and health issues for residents and Navy SEALs. U.S. officials praised the new Mexican administration's commitment to resolving the environmental and national security issue that previous efforts failed to fix.</p>

          <p>Doctors and aid organizations in Gaza are reporting a catastrophic hunger crisis, with widespread and severe malnutrition, especially among children. According to the Hamas-run Health Ministry, dozens have died from hunger, with children comprising the majority of victims. Aid groups like MSF and MercyCorps describe a desperate situation where families go days without food and cases of severe acute malnutrition have tripled in weeks. While Israel and the U.S. attribute the shortages to Hamas, humanitarian groups are issuing stark warnings of mass starvation if a dramatic increase in aid does not occur immediately.</p>

          <p>Three Venezuelan men, deported from the U.S. to El Salvador's CECOT prison, have alleged they endured severe physical and psychological abuse while detained. The men, who deny being members of the Tren de Aragua gang, were deported under the Alien Enemies Act invoked by the Trump administration. They described being beaten, humiliated, and held in overcrowded cells by prison officers who told them they were in "real hell." The Department of Homeland Security stated the men were sent to CECOT so they no longer pose a threat, but did not comment on the abuse allegations.</p>

The piece further argues that issues like high poverty rates, a projected budget deficit, and regulatory burdens are driving residents and businesses out of the state.

Simultaneously, the administration has rolled back regulations that would have removed medical debt from consumer credit reports, leaving patients vulnerable to damaged credit scores.

          <p>A provision in a new U.S. tax law is causing significant concern within the professional poker and gambling community.

This means a gambler who breaks even over a year could still owe taxes on 10 percent of their total winnings, a situation critics call illogical.

          <p>Chinese toymaker Pop Mart, known for its globally popular Labubu dolls, is strategically pivoting towards becoming a major international brand. The company's founder and CEO, Wang Ning, stated that the goal has evolved from being "China's Disney" to becoming "the world's Pop Mart." This reflects a broader trend of Chinese consumer companies exporting their brands, not just their products. Driven by the viral success of Labubu, Pop Mart's overseas revenue has soared, and the company expects its international sales to surpass domestic sales this year, with North America becoming a key market.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and India have signed what leaders are calling a "historic" free trade agreement, which is projected to boost their annual bilateral trade by over $34 billion in the long term. The deal will slash tariffs on a wide range of goods, including British scotch and automobiles, and Indian textiles and jewelry. Specifically, tariffs on 92% of U.K. goods exported to India will be reduced or removed, while 99% of Indian goods shipped to Britain will become tariff-exempt. The agreement marks a strategic win for both nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Resident doctors in England have commenced a five-day strike, marking the twelfth walkout in their ongoing pay dispute with the government. The British Medical Association (BMA) argues that doctors' pay has effectively fallen by a fifth since 2008 when accounting for inflation. Health Secretary Wes Streeting has vowed to keep disruption to a minimum by having senior doctors cover shifts and ordering hospitals not to cancel treatments except in emergencies. However, the BMA warns this approach risks stretching staff too thinly and could compromise patient safety.</p>

          <p>Despite the growing popularity of women's professional cycling, a significant financial gap persists compared to the men's sport. At the Tour de France, for example, the male winner receives €500,000 in prize money, while the female winner gets only €50,000. This disparity extends to salaries, with top male cyclists earning millions more than their female counterparts. While the director of the Tour de France Femmes points to progress, such as a longer race and higher TV ratings, top riders and advocates argue that much more needs to be done to achieve financial equality.</p>

Their model focuses on nurturing local talent from a young age and selling promising players to bigger clubs, which provides their primary source of income.

Starmer has reiterated his support for a two-state solution and called statehood a right, but maintains that the timing of recognition should be reserved for when it can have the greatest impact on achieving peace.</p>

          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has lowered its full-year financial guidance after reporting a 29% drop in second-quarter operating profit. The company attributed the poor performance to the disruptive impact of U.S. tariffs, which cost it 1.3 billion euros in the first half of the year, along with significant restructuring provisions. VW now expects its operating return on sales to be between 4% and 5%, down from a previous forecast of 5.5% to 6.5%.
