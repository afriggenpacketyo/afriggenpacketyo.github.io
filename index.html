          <p>Following four days of deadly border clashes that have killed at least 34 people and displaced over 168,000, the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia are set to meet in Malaysia. The talks, facilitated by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, aim to negotiate a ceasefire and a peaceful resolution to the long-standing dispute. This diplomatic effort was spurred by pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who threatened to halt trade agreements if hostilities continued. Despite the agreement to meet, fighting has persisted along the contested border, with both nations blaming each other for the continued violence.</p>

          <p>After years of crises, aerospace giant Boeing is showing signs of a turnaround under the leadership of CEO Kelly Ortberg, who was brought out of retirement to helm the company. The manufacturer's aircraft production and deliveries have increased, and Wall Street analysts anticipate it will halve its quarterly losses and potentially post its first annual profit since 2018 next year. Despite ongoing challenges, including FAA production caps and delays on new models, Ortberg's hands-on approach has been praised by airline executives for improving quality and delivery consistency.

          <p>An American Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 aborted its takeoff at Denver International Airport due to a "possible landing gear incident," leading to an emergency evacuation via slides. One person was transported to the hospital with a minor injury, while all other customers and crew deplaned safely. Passengers reported severe shaking and tilting before the plane braked hard. The aircraft has been taken out of service for inspection by maintenance teams. This marks the second notable incident involving a major U.S. airline in a short period.</p>

          <p>A high-level European Union delegation, including President Ursula von der Leyen, has traveled to Scotland for critical trade talks with U.S. President Donald Trump at his Turnberry resort. The meeting aims to avert a potential trade war, as Trump has threatened to impose 30% tariffs on all EU imports if a deal is not reached by his August 1st deadline. While hopes are rising for a framework agreement, Trump has stated the chances remain "50/50." A potential deal could center on a baseline tariff of 15% on EU goods, a compromise to restore stability for global investors and key European industries.</p>

          <p>In Bogotá, Colombia, a persistent scam known as "pinchallantas" involves vandals on motorcycles intentionally puncturing car tires with sharp objects. These saboteurs then direct the stranded drivers to nearby mechanics who are allegedly complicit in the scheme. The mechanics are accused of creating additional holes in the tires to inflate repair costs, sometimes charging prices equivalent to a new set of tires. Despite being a long-standing issue, a recent surge in complaints has prompted city officials and police to crack down on the practice by targeting suspect repair shops.</p>

          <p>According to a column by former player Matt Dawson, the British and Irish Lions rugby team needs to achieve a 3-0 series whitewash against Australia to be remembered as a truly legendary squad. While winning the series is a special achievement, Dawson contends that the current Australian team's relative weakness provides a unique opportunity for a historic clean sweep. He contrasts this with his own 1997 series-winning team, which celebrated heavily after going 2-0 up and lacked the same focus for the final match. The current team's public ambition for a 3-0 victory sets a higher bar for their legacy.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee is using a new political tactic, erecting billboards near struggling rural hospitals in red states with messages like, “If this hospital closes, blame Trump.” The campaign aims to highlight the impact of the Trump administration's One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which cut over $1 trillion from Medicaid. Critics argue these cuts disproportionately harm rural healthcare facilities, which have already seen over 150 closures since 2010. While the OBBBA includes a $50 billion "rural health transformation fund," Democrats contend it is insufficient and functions as a political "slush fund."</p>

          <p>A political essay posits that the concept of socialism, once considered a defunct ideology in the U.S., is experiencing a revival, partly in reaction to Donald Trump's presidency. The article argues that Trump's economic policies, seen as favoring cronies, and the broader economic shocks of recent years have fueled public dissatisfaction with capitalism. This has created an opening for politicians like Bernie Sanders and others who champion socialist ideas. The essay contends that to counter this trend, proponents of market economics must address the system's flaws and cleanse it of the corruption that has discredited it.</p>

          <p>An essay explores the cultural impact of the near-disappearance of comprehensive event listings from publications like The New York Times, The New Yorker, and The Village Voice. The author argues that these listings were once vital for cultural discovery, guiding audiences to a wide array of artistic performances and helping launch the careers of emerging artists. The shift to an internet-driven media landscape, which favors covering what is already popular, has created a feedback loop that narrows cultural exposure and leaves subcultures struggling. This loss of curated discovery makes it harder for audiences to find new experiences.</p>

This means customers' tips are not just a gratuity for good service but are essential for workers to reach the standard minimum wage.

          <p>In the jungles of northern Guatemala, conservation groups have set up large tubs of water to help wildlife cope with abnormal heat and drought, which have caused natural water sources to dry up. Motion-activated cameras placed nearby have captured incredible footage of a diverse array of animals, including rarely seen jaguars and tapirs, using these artificial watering holes. The project not only provides vital relief for the animals but also offers researchers valuable insights into their behavior. The initiative serves as a simple yet effective example of how humans can help wildlife adapt to climate change.</p>

          <p>A community organizer in Augusta, Georgia, has spent six years trying to open a freestanding birth center to provide more options in a region considered a maternal healthcare desert. Despite community support and successfully lobbying for a change in state law, the effort has been stalled by a lack of cooperation from local hospitals. Proponents argue that birth centers, staffed primarily by midwives, offer a safe, home-like alternative for low-risk pregnancies and are desperately needed in a state with high maternal mortality rates. Opponents cite concerns over lost revenue and potential malpractice liability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists are observing an increase in the formation of sinkholes globally and are linking the phenomenon to climate change. Sinkholes form when water erodes underlying bedrock, and this process is being accelerated by more frequent and intense weather events. Periods of drought lower the water table, weakening subterranean support, which can then collapse under the weight of sudden, heavy rainfall. Regions with soluble bedrock like limestone, such as Florida, parts of Turkey, and the Brazilian Amazon, are particularly vulnerable. Experts are using new technologies to detect risks and mitigate the danger.</p>

          <p>While playing golf at his resort in Scotland, U.S. President Donald Trump commented on the likelihood of securing a new trade agreement with the European Union, stating the chances were "50-50." His remarks came just before a scheduled meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to discuss the contentious trade relationship. The talks are crucial as they precede an August 1st deadline, after which Trump has threatened to increase tariffs on most EU goods to 30%. The meeting is being closely watched as a key moment to potentially de-escalate trade tensions between the two economic powers.</p>

          <p>With skin cancer cases on the rise, health experts are emphasizing the critical importance of using sunscreen for protection against harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Sunscreens work by using either organic (carbon-based) molecules to absorb UV rays or mineral (zinc or titanium oxide) particles to physically block them. While concerns have been raised about certain chemicals being absorbed into the bloodstream, scientists stress that the protective benefits far outweigh the potential risks. Experts warn against homemade or "natural" alternatives like tallow, as they offer negligible protection, and advise against mixing different sunscreen products.</p>

The pause, scheduled from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., is intended to allow for the safe passage of aid convoys.

The authors assert that history shows science has always been entangled with politics, citing how 19th-century biology was used to justify white supremacy and how modern evolutionary theories can reflect capitalist assumptions. They contend that denying this political nature leaves science vulnerable to bad-faith attacks and allows it to be used to harm marginalized groups.
