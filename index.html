          <p>Several European companies are reconsidering their travel policies for employees visiting the U.S., prompted by stricter immigration checks and increased reports of detentions. While some firms report no changes to their travel plans, others in politically sensitive fields are issuing new guidance, such as advising employees to use wiped electronic devices or enter the U.S. via Canada. Business travel is a significant revenue source for the U.S. economy, generating billions in spending and tax revenue while supporting millions of jobs. Concerns about U.S. policies are expected to reduce business travel volume and overall optimism in the sector, with international tourism also potentially impacted due to negative perceptions of trade and immigration policy. The article highlights rising anxiety among international travelers due to increased visa scrutiny and potential incidents at the border, leading some to adopt enhanced security protocols for U.S. travel.</p>

          <p>The United States has presented Iran with a proposal for a nuclear deal aimed at curbing Tehran's nuclear ambitions, confirmed by both the White House and Iranian officials. This follows a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indicating that Iran has increased its production of enriched uranium, nearing weapons-grade levels. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that it is in Tehran's "best interest to accept" the deal, while Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi noted the proposal would be appropriately addressed. The IAEA report highlighted Iran's possession of over 400kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity, raising concerns about potential proliferation implications; Israel has deemed the report a clear warning sign that Iran is determined to complete its nuclear weapons program.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), is preparing for a leadership election in September, aiming to regain power after being on the political sidelines for years. However, the KMT faces an immediate threat: a mass-recall campaign orchestrated by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which could jeopardize its legislative majority. Analysts suggest that failure to address the recall challenge could disrupt the leadership transition and fracture the party. KMT chairman Eric Chu Li-luan has indicated his intention to step down after his term, suggesting Taichung mayor Lu Shiow-yen as a potential successor, with the party chair race set to be announced in July.</p>

          <p>A confidential report by the United Nations nuclear watchdog indicates that Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, prompting calls for Tehran to cooperate with the agency's probe. The report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reveals that Iran has amassed 900.8 pounds of uranium enriched up to 60%, a significant increase since February. The IAEA has raised concerns, noting that Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state producing such material, which has potential proliferation implications. In response, the U.S. has sent a detailed proposal to Iran, urging them to accept it, while Israel has warned that Iran is determined to complete its nuclear weapons program.</p>

          <p>A viral TikTok trend suggests that a "McMigraine Meal" consisting of full-fat coke and salty fries can alleviate migraine symptoms, but experts caution against relying on it as a cure. While some individuals find that the caffeine and sugar in coke or the salt in fries can provide temporary relief, migraines are complex neurological conditions that cannot be cured by fast food. Experts warn that excessive caffeine intake can actually trigger migraines, and fast food often contains unhealthy ingredients. Neurologists recommend lifestyle changes and medical treatments for managing migraines, advising against solely depending on social media hacks.</p>

          <p>Opinion columnist Ross Douthat argues that Donald Trump's political resilience is partly due to his willingness to swerve, backpedal, and contradict himself, a strategy encapsulated by the Wall Street acronym "TACO" (Trump Always Chickens Out). This perceived flexibility reassures swing voters that any extreme positions are provisional and subject to change. Douthat suggests that Trump's recent shifts on China tariffs, his distancing from Elon Musk, and his complaints about Vladimir Putin have helped improve his poll numbers. He argues that voters appreciate Trump's pressure on institutions they distrust, but also expect him to accept counterpressure and retreat when necessary.</p>

The film, set in 1932 Clarksdale, tells the story of twin brothers returning home after World War One, blending elements of musicals, horror, and period drama. Coogler conducted extensive research in Clarksdale, and locals appreciate his respectful portrayal of their history and culture. The film's success has prompted Coogler to bring the film to Clarksdale for free screenings, addressing the town's lack of a movie theater since 2003, and residents hope the spotlight will boost tourism and understanding of the town's rich blues music heritage.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to invest £1.5 billion in six new munitions and explosives factories as part of its strategic defense review, aiming to bolster its war readiness. This initiative will support the production of up to 7,000 long-range weapons and create approximately 1,800 new jobs. The move comes in response to the war in Ukraine, which has exposed deficiencies in the West's weapons and munitions production capabilities. The government aims to establish an "always on" munitions production capacity that can be quickly scaled up, with overall munitions spending expected to reach £6 billion during this parliament.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's administration has taken several actions against Harvard University, including threatening to redirect research funding and instructing federal agencies to review contracts, which could have lasting repercussions on American higher education. These measures are seen as an attack on one of America's most prestigious institutions, with students expressing concerns about the future. Some believe Trump's actions are part of a broader effort to reshape universities in a more conservative image. Harvard has responded by using the courts to resist Trump's pressure, with a federal judge suspending the administration's attempts to prohibit foreign students from receiving visas.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has cautioned that "tough choices" are unavoidable as the UK government finalizes its spending plans, highlighting the need for difficult decisions across various sectors. The level of funding allocated to the NHS will significantly impact whether cuts are made to other unprotected areas such as schools and the criminal justice system. While spending increased sharply in 2024 for several key areas, the government's commitments mean that it will no longer increase year on year, creating challenges for departments. The IFS suggests that a "huge amount depends on the generosity" of cash handed to the NHS and defense, potentially leading to real-terms cuts for other departments.</p>

Disposable vapes have been identified as a key factor in the rise of youth vaping, with millions of vapes being thrown away annually. While vaping is considered less harmful than smoking, the long-term risks are still unknown, and health experts emphasize the need for further regulation to address youth vaping.</p>

Quantum communication relies on quantum physics-based cryptography to encode data, theoretically making it unhackable, however, realistic QKD devices can be vulnerable to side-channel attacks that rely on flaws in experimental implementation.</p>

          <p>The White House has withdrawn the nomination of Jared Isaacman, President Trump's pick to lead NASA, days before a Senate confirmation vote. White House spokeswoman Elizabeth Huston stated that the next NASA administrator must align with President Trump's America First agenda. The decision comes as a surprise, as Isaacman's nomination had advanced through the Senate's Commerce Committee, and a replacement announcement is expected soon. Elon Musk expressed his support for Isaacman, describing him as competent and good-hearted.</p>
