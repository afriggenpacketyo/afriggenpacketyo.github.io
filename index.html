          <p>A federal judge ruled that Mahmoud Khalil's deportation case will stay in New Jersey, rejecting the government's attempt to move it to Louisiana.  This decision is significant because it prevents the case from potentially going before a more conservative appeals court. Khalil's wife and lawyers celebrated the ruling, emphasizing the importance of upholding his rights as a legal resident. The case highlights concerns about the Trump administration's actions against student activists.</p>

          <p>Democrats in the Senate are attempting to block President Trump's tariffs on Canada by challenging the national emergency declaration used to justify them.  Senator Tim Kaine calls the emergency a "made-up emergency."  The effort comes as Trump is set to announce further tariffs on Wednesday.  The outcome of the Senate vote remains uncertain, with a handful of Republican votes needed to succeed. The vote could be delayed by a filibuster.</p>

          <p>A Capitol Hill hearing investigating alleged government censorship under President Biden was criticized by a disinformation expert as based on a “fiction.”  Nina Jankowicz, head of the American Sunlight Project, argued that the hearing ignores the Trump administration's far more extensive attacks on free speech.  The hearing highlighted the deep partisan divide on the issue of online censorship and disinformation.  The event coincided with the Trump administration's dismantling of safeguards against foreign influence and propaganda.</p>
