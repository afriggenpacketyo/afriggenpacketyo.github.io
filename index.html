          <h2>BOJ Cuts Economic and Inflation Outlook Amid Tariff Concerns, Holds Rate Steady</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has revised its economic and inflation projections downward for the current fiscal year, citing concerns over the impact of U.S. tariffs on the Japanese economy. The central bank now expects the economy to grow by 0.5 percent, a decrease from its previous projection of 1.1 percent, and core consumer prices are projected to rise 2.2 percent, down from 2.4 percent. Despite these adjustments, the BOJ has maintained its benchmark interest rate at around 0.5 percent, marking the second consecutive meeting with no change, and anticipates inflation to range between 1.5 and 2.5 percent between fiscal years 2025 and 2027.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several European auto giants, including Stellantis and Mercedes, have suspended or cut their full-year financial guidance due to uncertainties caused by President Trump's trade tariffs. These corporate updates followed Trump's imposition of a 25% tariff on automotive imports into the U.S. While Trump later signed an executive order to prevent additional duties from stacking, analysts caution that the volatile nature of these tariffs will likely deter long-term corporate investment decisions. Volkswagen, however, maintained its guidance but expects results to be at the lower end of forecasts, while Volvo Cars ditched its guidance for both 2025 and 2026, citing tariff pressure.</p>

George's progress has seen his estimated transfer value increase significantly. He trained with a personal coach and played against men in nine-a-side matches to raise his game, developing a fearless mentality which helped him succeed.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Israeli reservists, including former Mossad head Danny Yatom, have signed letters urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to end the war in Gaza and prioritize a hostage deal with Hamas. These reservists feel the war's continuation undermines its stated goals and endangers the remaining hostages, while Netanyahu is perceived as prioritizing his own interests over national concerns. Reports suggest that reserve attendance has dropped significantly, signaling a looming crisis for the military and reflecting growing public support for a ceasefire and hostage release deal.</p>

          <p>The United States military, while possessing advanced equipment, lacks the quantity of personnel and materiel needed for a major war, according to Mackenzie Eaglen and Brady Africk. They argue that America's armed forces are equipped only for short, high-intensity conflicts, while modern warfare requires both advanced systems and sheer volume of munitions. The authors suggest Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth should prioritize resources that strengthen combat power, including active service members, ammunition, new ships, and aircraft, in order to effectively address threats from China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and terror groups.</p>

          <p>A recent poll by the Asian American Foundation reveals that one in four non-Asian Americans consider Chinese-Americans a potential threat, particularly regarding national security. Additionally, four in ten fear that Asian-Americans have greater allegiance to their countries of origin than to the United States. These findings highlight concerns about the ability of Asian-Americans to assimilate amid rising social tensions and plummeting US-China relations, underscoring a disconnect between how Asian-Americans are perceived and their lived experiences.</p>

          <p>Kamala Harris made her return to the public stage by criticizing President Trump's trade policies, labeling his tariff war as the "greatest man-made economic crisis in modern presidential history." Speaking at an event for Emerge America, she argued that Trump's tariffs hurt workers and families, paralyze businesses, and invite a recession. Harris also touched on Trump's immigration policies, asserting that it is unacceptable to detain or disappear American citizens without due process, and called on Americans to stand together against these actions.</p>

Examples include increased scrutiny at border crossings, aggressive questioning by government agents, and attacks on universities and news organizations. Some immigrants, however, argue that Trump is not the one exhibiting authoritarian behavior, citing censorship and pressure on social media companies during the COVID-19 pandemic under the previous administration.</p>

          <p>A California Assembly committee has amended a proposed bill to end solar credits for rooftop solar system owners, narrowing its impact to only those who sell their homes. The original bill, AB 942, sought to limit the program's benefits to 10 years, but the committee removed that provision following opposition from rooftop solar owners and concerns about potential legal challenges. Despite the amendment, some opponents still believe the measure will reduce the value of their homes, while supporters argue that the credits are raising electric bills for those without solar panels.</p>

          <p>Japan's central bank has maintained its policy rate at 0.5% for the second consecutive meeting, amidst concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs are weighing on the country's economic outlook. The move comes at a time of global trade tensions as the U.S. pressures countries to sign business deals under threats of "reciprocal" tariffs. The central bank highlighted that it will continue to raise its policy rate "if our economic and price forecasts are realised," while also flagging that Japan's growth is likely to moderate due to a slowdown in other economies and a decline in domestic corporate profits.</p>

          <p>Ray Dalio recently warned of a breakdown in the global order and the end of America's dominant economic role, but Elon Musk challenged his claim that the U.S. remains the world's largest consumer.

This pushback underscores a debate on whether the U.S. is still the primary global consumer, with potential implications for global economic leverage and the risks of US economic policies.</p>
