          <p>Mobile advertising company AppLovin saw its shares fall sharply after reports emerged of an SEC investigation into its data-collection practices. The probe is reportedly in response to a whistleblower complaint and several short-seller reports alleging the company violated agreements on targeted advertising. AppLovin, which has experienced significant stock growth due to its AI-powered ad technology, stated it regularly engages with regulators and would disclose any material developments publicly. The investigation follows multiple critical reports from short-seller firms like Muddy Waters and Fuzzy Panda Research.</p>

          <p>The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to prevent the planned deployment of National Guard troops. The lawsuit argues that the federalization of troops is unconstitutional and an unlawful military occupation intended to sow chaos. Governor JB Pritzker and Attorney General Kwame Raoul condemned the move as a political power grab, vowing to resist what they termed an "invasion." The legal action seeks a temporary restraining order, citing potential for increased unrest and damage to the state's economy.</p>

          <p>The ongoing federal government shutdown has prompted a bizarre rhetorical battle between Democrats and Republicans, who are using crude, "deep-fried" memes and AI-generated videos to blame each other. This article from The Atlantic critiques the trend, noting that both sides are engaging in petty, often nonsensical social media antics instead of governing. While the Trump administration uses memes to mock Democrats, Democrats have responded with their own juvenile content, such as videos of political opponents with Minion filters. This online conflict unfolds as hundreds of thousands of federal employees go without pay.</p>

          <p>The Associated Press is publicly correcting President Trump's false characterization of their legal battle concerning White House access. Trump claimed the AP sued and lost, but the news organization actually won its case, though the ruling's enforcement is delayed pending an appeal. The dispute began when the White House blocked AP access to certain events after the news service declined to adopt Trump's executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico. A federal judge, a Trump appointee, ruled that the White House could not deny access as a form of punishment for the AP's reporting.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is beginning a new term that will feature several significant cases defining the limits of President Trump's executive authority. Key issues on the docket include the president's power to remove members of independent agencies, his attempt to fire a Federal Reserve Board governor, and the legality of his unilaterally imposed tariffs. The court will also likely review challenges to Trump's attempts to deploy the National Guard to U.S. cities against the will of local officials.

This article compares the earnings of a $10,000 deposit in a certificate of deposit (CD) versus a high-yield savings account over various time frames. While a high-yield savings account may currently offer a slightly higher rate, its variable nature means returns will likely decrease with future Fed cuts. In contrast, a CD locks in a fixed rate, guaranteeing a specific return, which could prove more advantageous in a declining rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the federal government shutdown continues, an upcoming military payday on October 15 is being viewed as a critical deadline that could pressure Washington to reach a compromise. Analysts suggest that the political cost of failing to pay 1.3 million active-duty service members may be too high for either party to bear. While both sides have remained entrenched in their positions, the prospect of withholding pay from the armed forces could serve as a "forcing event" for a temporary funding bill. If this deadline passes without a resolution, it could signal an even more prolonged stalemate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Weather Service has upgraded a tornado that struck Enderlin, North Dakota, in June to an EF-5, the highest possible rating. With estimated wind speeds over 210 mph, it is the first EF-5 tornado to hit the United States in 12 years. The powerful twister killed three people and carved a 12-mile path of destruction, destroying a farm, tipping over train cars, and throwing a tanker car nearly 500 feet. The last confirmed EF-5 tornado occurred in Moore, Oklahoma, in 2013, making this a rare and exceptionally violent weather event.</p>

          <p>A 31-year-old mother in Brazoria County, Texas, is facing murder and aggravated assault charges after she allegedly shot her four children, killing two of them.

The mother reportedly called 911 herself after the shooting, and a weapon was recovered at the scene inside a vehicle. The sheriff stated that it is impossible to make sense of such a senseless tragedy and that they will seek justice for the children.</p>

          <p>An exclusive report from Reuters indicates that Bill Pulte, the Trump-appointed director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, circumvented standard ethics procedures when making criminal referrals. Pulte directly asked the Justice Department to investigate political opponents like Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook and New York AG Letitia James, bypassing his agency's own inspector general. This move, which took officials by surprise, is seen by legal experts as a potential violation of impartiality regulations designed to prevent the abuse of power for partisan purposes.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For seniors considering a reverse mortgage to supplement their retirement income, understanding the equity requirements is crucial. Most lenders offering a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), the most common type, require homeowners to have at least 50% to 60% equity in their property. The amount an individual can borrow is not the full equity amount but is instead determined by factors including the borrower's age, current interest rates, and FHA lending limits. If a homeowner falls short of the required equity, options include paying down the existing mortgage or waiting for the home's value to appreciate. (not investment advice)</p>

Maxwell was found guilty in 2021 for her role in recruiting and grooming underage girls for abuse by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. Her legal team expressed disappointment but stated they would continue to explore other legal options, while the White House reiterated that no pardon is being discussed.</p>

The British Medical Association (BMA) union highlights a significant mismatch, with 30,000 candidates competing for only 10,000 available jobs this year. The union argues that poor workforce planning has led to an expansion of medical school spots without a corresponding increase in necessary NHS training posts. This mandate for industrial action adds pressure on the government, which is already in talks with the BMA over pay and working conditions.</p>
