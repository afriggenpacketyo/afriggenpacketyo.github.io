He appeared in court via live stream and is being held on a $10 million bond. Soliman also faces federal hate crime charges in a separate federal court case, and three victims remain hospitalized.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Justice is investigating a fatal shooting by Los Angeles Police Department officers, as the man killed was allegedly holding a gun. Officers responded to a reported shooting in Koreatown and encountered Ronald Gainer Jr., who exited an apartment holding a handgun, according to the LAPD. The officers shot Gainer, who retreated into the apartment and later died at a hospital. The state's investigation is required under Assembly Bill 1506, which mandates probes into police shootings of unarmed individuals, but the LAPD says Gainer was armed.</p>

The news comes as Redstone navigates a turbulent sales process for Paramount, including a government review of the Skydance Media sale complicated by President Trump's lawsuit against CBS. Redstone has sought to settle the lawsuit, which alleges deceptive editing of a ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, but the situation has caused unrest within the company.</p>

The proclamation also directs the secretary of state to consider revoking the visas of foreign students already in the U.S. to study at Harvard.</p>

          <p>The Labour government plans to mandate solar panel installation on most new build homes in England, according to Energy Secretary Ed Miliband. Developers will be required to add panels unless the buildings fall under certain exemptions such as being covered by shade. The regulations will be included in the Future Homes Standard, detailing a wider plan for improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. The move aims to save the typical household ¬£500 a year on energy bills, though the Home Builders Federation cautioned against burdensome paperwork that could harm efforts to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029.</p>

Musk's press secretary downplayed the allegations, attributing them to Musk's unhappiness with the "One Big Beautiful Bill" legislation.
