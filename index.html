          <p>NPR invited readers to share their most memorable moments with their mothers, receiving nearly 500 submissions from diverse backgrounds. Many stories highlighted life lessons taught by moms, including one from Michael Sweet, who recalled his mother teaching him about racial equality at age 4. Other memories included heartwarming moments like Bobbi Jo Dziuk singing lullabies to her mother in a hotel and Lora Hinkson reminiscing about her mom's sweet bread. The submissions underscored the lasting impact of mothers' advice, actions, and love, even after they are gone, as seen in the story of Bob Simons, who honors his mother's memory each year on his birthday, the day she passed away.</p>

          <p>Mathematicians from Fudan University and UCLA have solved the 65-year-old Kervaire invariant problem, a longstanding puzzle in the mathematical community. This breakthrough was achieved through major computational methods. The Kervaire invariant is a function that measures whether a smooth framed manifold can be converted into a sphere through surgery. The solution proves that manifolds of Kervaire invariant one exist in dimension 126.</p>

He advocates for embracing the analog, reaching out to unexpected allies, and creating useful stories outside approved systems.

          <p>Federal employee unions are facing increasing challenges under the Trump administration, which is attempting to limit their bargaining power and reduce the federal workforce. Anthony Lee, president of NTEU Chapter 282, says the administration has ignored the union's collective bargaining agreement and ended telework agreements without consultation. Trump's executive order ending collective bargaining rights for many federal workers is being challenged in court, but it raises concerns about the ability of civil servants to push back against political pressure. The article explores the historical context of federal employee unions and their role in ensuring government efficiency and accountability.</p>

          <p>The 1st District Court of Appeal has rejected Donna Adelson's attempt to remove Leon Circuit Judge Stephen Everett from her trial for the 2014 murder of Dan Markel.

The elimination of the de minimis provision, which allowed companies like Shein and Temu to evade tariffs, could level the playing field for small brands, but the benefits are overshadowed by the increased costs due to tariffs.

          <h2>A Psychiatrist's Gift for Mothers: Cut Yourself Some Slack</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dr. Mathilde Ross argues that mothers should cut themselves some slack and stop striving for perfection, as being flawed is an essential part of the job. She critiques the tendency of psychiatrists to blame mothers for their children's problems and emphasizes the importance of acknowledging the credit mothers deserve. Ross encourages mothers to embrace their imperfections and recognize that their role is to guide their children, not to meet their every need perfectly.</p>

          <p>The average 30-year US mortgage rate has remained stable at 6.76%, close to its highest levels this year but still below the 7.09% average from a year ago. Meanwhile, rates for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages have decreased slightly to 5.89%. Mortgage rates are influenced by factors such as global demand for US Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve policy, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. High mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a subdued spring home-buying season.</p>
