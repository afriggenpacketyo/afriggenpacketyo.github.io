          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the FDA announced plans to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the US food supply by the end of next year, contingent on cooperation from major food companies. The FDA aims to revoke authorization for Citrus Red No. 2 and Orange B, and work with the food industry to eliminate six other dyes commonly found in cereals, snacks, and yogurts. While the FDA claims studies link these dyes to health conditions, scientists caution the evidence is not definitive. The International Association of Color Manufacturers has questioned the proposed timeline, while the Consumer Brands Association indicated its members would cooperate with the administration.

The Financial Times notes pressure on Kyiv to concede territory so Trump can claim victory, while also reporting gold prices surged to $3,500 per ounce due to Trump's attacks on the Federal Reserve chair. The Guardian covers the IMF's verdict on Trump's tariffs, stating they have unleashed a "major negative shock" into the world economy, leading to cut forecasts for US, UK, and global growth.

          <p>China has sent a letter to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba urging coordinated action against U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies, as trade tensions escalate between the world's two largest economies. Japan is considering expanding tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice as part of negotiations over higher levies imposed by Washington. Prime Minister Ishiba announced the government will help reduce gasoline prices and energy costs for households as part of inflation relief steps, with measures to reduce the price of gasoline and diesel fuel by 10 yen per liter, and that of kerosene and heavy oil by 5 yen, from May 22.</p>

          <p>Bill Owens, executive producer of "60 Minutes," announced his departure from CBS News, stating he would not be allowed to run the show as he always had. This comes as President Trump is suing the network for $20 billion, alleging that "60 Minutes" intentionally misled the public in editing an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. CBS News has refuted Mr. Trump's claims, explaining that the interview edits were done to be clear, accurate and on point. Owens has worked at CBS News for nearly four decades, holding various roles including senior producer at the White House and "CBS Evening News."</p>

Justices questioned the school board's decision to end opt-outs, with some expressing surprise that the county was unwilling to accommodate religious objections.

          <p>A team of Democratic lawmakers visited Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk, two foreign students detained by ICE in Louisiana for participating in pro-Palestinian protests. The lawmakers accused the Trump administration of attempting to deport the students for exercising free speech and circumscribing their constitutional rights. The group expressed concerns about the students' health and conditions in the detention facilities.
