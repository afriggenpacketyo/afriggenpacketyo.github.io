          <p>Former Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams won a libel case against the BBC regarding a 2016 news story. The story included an anonymous allegation that Adams sanctioned the 2006 murder of Denis Donaldson, a British agent. Adams has consistently denied any involvement in Donaldson's murder. The court's decision supports Adams's claim that the BBC's broadcast and online article defamed him, thereby vindicating his reputation.</p>

Tamaulipas state prosecutors stated that the musicians were kidnapped while traveling to a hired venue and nine suspects believed to be part of the Gulf Cartel have been arrested. Relatives reported receiving ransom demands, and protesters blocked an international bridge connecting Reynosa and Pharr, Texas, in response to the disappearances.

          <p>The main suspect in the murder of Olorato Mongale, a South African university student, was killed in a police shootout after being found hiding at a residential complex in Amanzimtoti. Police had linked the suspect to Mongale's death, whose body was discovered in Johannesburg shortly after she was reported missing following a date. At the time of his death, the suspect had 28 ID cards and a dozen mobile phones in his possession, according to the police commissioner. Ms. Mongale's death has ignited discussions about violence against women in South Africa, which has one of the world's highest rates of femicide and gender-based violence.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has concluded his tenure as a "special government employee," and US President Donald Trump announced an Oval Office press event to bid the Tesla billionaire farewell. Musk claimed his cost-cutting measures at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) saved taxpayers $160 billion (€141 billion), although the sum has been questioned. Democrats have argued that Elon Musk and DOGE lack the authority to make such spending cuts.

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to halt a US court ruling that declared its sweeping tariffs illegal, arguing they “exceed any authority granted to the president.” An appeals court temporarily paused the decision pending an appeal hearing. The court's initial ruling stated that Trump’s tariff orders exceeded presidential authority to regulate importation by means of tariffs. Tariffs typically require congressional approval, which Trump bypassed by claiming trade deficits constitute a national emergency. The administration is expected to appeal to the Supreme Court if necessary.</p>

A stronger euro would bring benefits to Europe, including lower borrowing costs and protection from sanctions. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece emphasizes the complex interplay of genetics, environment, and learning in shaping animal behaviors, suggesting that behaviors grow up in bodies under environmental experiences and explicit learning.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's time in the Trump administration is ending after 129 days marked by significant spending cuts and considerable controversy. Musk, working with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), claims to have saved $175 billion through various measures, though the accuracy of these figures has been debated. His tenure saw blurred lines between business and politics, as his companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, have government contracts.

          <p>President Trump and his envoy, Steve Witkoff, are under scrutiny for potential conflicts of interest arising from their cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial, and its ties to foreign governments. Abu Dhabi's investment in World Liberty Financial has raised concerns about potential violations of the US Constitution's emoluments clause, which prohibits federal officers from accepting payments from foreign governments. Witkoff's role as a special envoy while also profiting from the crypto venture has drawn criticism from ethics officials and Democratic senators. The White House maintains there are no conflicts of interest.</p>

The deal, which allows U.S. Steel's headquarters to remain in Pennsylvania, is characterized by Trump as an investment and partial ownership controlled by the United States. This follows Trump's earlier opposition to Nippon's acquisition bid, which was blocked by former President Joe Biden on national security grounds. The agreement includes provisions for an American CEO, a U.S.-majority board, and a golden share requiring U.S. government approval of board members to ensure production levels.</p>

Higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz warns that such extended repayment terms could lead to "indentured servitude."

          <p>A new COVID subvariant, NB.1.8.1, has been detected in California, raising concerns about a potential summer wave. The Trump administration is making changes that could limit vaccine access, such as rescinding recommendations for pregnant women and healthy children and no longer routinely approving annual vaccinations for those under 65. Experts worry this could lead to insurance companies not covering COVID shots, making them more expensive. While the new subvariant doesn't appear to cause more severe illness, it is more transmissible.</p>

          <p>China has agreed to begin procedures to resume imports of Japanese seafood, which had been banned following the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant. Chinese authorities are expected to issue a public notice easing the ban and open registration for Japanese facilities. The two nations have agreed on technical requirements for the resumption of seafood exports. This move is seen as a potential sign of improving ties between China and Japan amid trade tensions with the United States.</p>
