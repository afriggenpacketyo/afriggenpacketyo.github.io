          <p>President Trump is considering attack plans to disable Iran's nuclear site at Fordo, believing it necessary due to the risk of rapid weapons production, according to CBS News sources. While Trump approved attack plans, he hasn't made a final decision, holding off in case Tehran abandons its nuclear program. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that Trump will decide within two weeks, considering potential negotiations with Iran. Meanwhile, the U.K. is actively seeking a diplomatic resolution, and intelligence reports suggest Iran is close to possessing nuclear weapons, though the intelligence community hasn't confirmed weaponization efforts. </p>

Mark Dubowitz of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies likened the success to the Six-Day War, noting the dominance over the Iranian military and destruction of key assets. Hila Hadad-Hamelnik, a strategist at Mind Israel, emphasized the importance of rapidly neutralizing missile launchers, a doctrine adapted from experiences in Gaza.

          <p>Tariffs are driving up the cost of materials used in home renovation projects, leading homeowners to reconsider their plans. According to the National Association of Home Builders, these tariffs can add around $10,000 to a typical renovation project. Builder David Perotti advises pre-ordering materials, opting for paint jobs instead of new appliances, and budgeting an additional 30% for tariff-related costs. He also suggests prioritizing exterior repairs to prevent further degradation of the home. (not investment advice)</p>

The ban, passed by the Senedd, will make it an offense to supply wet wipes containing plastic to customers, with exemptions for medical-grade wipes and business-to-business transactions. Deputy First Minister Huw Irranca-Davies said the move aims to encourage a shift toward reusable and non-plastic products.

          <p>President Trump is facing mounting pressure both domestically and internationally as he weighs options regarding military action against Iran. Republicans are divided between hawkish members pushing for aggressive action and those calling for restraint. Democrats in Congress are raising concerns over Trump's war power authority. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is urging Trump to join the conflict, while Iran and its allies are warning against U.S. involvement. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the U.S. military is prepared to carry out any decision Trump makes. </p>

          <p>President Trump has extended the deadline for TikTok's sale in the U.S. for another 90 days, marking the third delay in enforcing the law requiring the app to be sold by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. Lawmakers have raised national security concerns, which TikTok denies. Trump, who vowed to save TikTok, signed an executive order delaying the law's enforcement, and TikTok expressed gratitude for his support. The extension allows continued negotiations for a deal to ensure data safety for U.S. users. </p>

Hegseth has continued to espouse anti-DEI talking points, claiming without evidence that these policies put military service members in harm’s way.

Orban announced in February that the march would not take place this year, citing a law restricting gatherings that violate child protection laws on public promotion of homosexuality.

The president announced that he signed an executive order pushing back the deadline for enforcing a law passed by Congress until mid-September. The extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure. Congress passed the law last year with bipartisan support giving ByteDance until Jan. 19 to fully sever ties with TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.</p>
