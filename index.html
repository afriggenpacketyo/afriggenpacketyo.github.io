        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukrainian and Russian delegations are scheduled to meet in Istanbul for another round of U.S.-brokered peace talks aimed at ending the three-year conflict. The talks occur after Ukraine launched drone attacks on strategic bomber bases inside Russia, which Moscow framed as a terrorist attack. Ukraine seeks a full ceasefire, prisoner release, and the return of abducted children, while Russia demands annexation of Ukrainian regions and a block on NATO accession. Despite previous failed attempts and ongoing tensions, both sides are engaging in renewed diplomatic efforts. The article highlights the continued need for pressure on Russia to return to reality through sanctions, military force, and diplomacy, but also indicates that the Trump administration may be losing patience with the situation. Optimism is tempered by the recent attacks and unresolved maximalist war goals from the Kremlin.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to announce the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) to modernize flight paths, many of which were established 70 years ago. The redesign aims to expedite flights, reduce delays, and decrease aviation's impact on climate change. These changes could allow planes to ascend more quickly during takeoff and descend more smoothly. The government plans for UKADS to be fully operational by the end of the year, marking the largest redesign of UK airspace since the 1950s. A community aviation group has warned that the plans could result in new flight paths over previously unaffected residential areas.</p>

The suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is an Egyptian national whose visa expired in February 2023.

He allegedly uploaded the personal information and headshot of a 30-year-old man to X, formerly Twitter, and extorted the money from him at a Tokyo restaurant in October of the previous year.

          <p>Princess Catherine Duleep Singh, a British-born Sikh princess, defied social norms by living openly in a same-sex relationship in early 1900s Germany and using her privilege to help Jewish families escape Nazism. Despite the danger she faced as a brown-skinned and gay woman during the rise of Hitler, she refused to leave Germany and instead provided financial support, letters of recommendation, and immigration guarantees to help Jewish individuals and families relocate to Britain. She hosted refugees at her home in Buckinghamshire and advocated for those interned as "enemy aliens". Her efforts, largely unacknowledged during her lifetime, are now being recognized, with a Kensington Palace exhibition planned to highlight her and her sisters' acts of resistance.</p>

          <p>The US defense sector's dependence on China for critical minerals used in advanced weapon systems is creating growing concerns about military readiness and supply chain security. China dominates the global supply of rare earths and most other critical minerals, and has leveraged this dominance in trade negotiations and by imposing export restrictions. Beijing has imposed controls on gallium, germanium, and antimony exports to the US, affecting American military end users. The US must find alternative sources to reduce its vulnerability, though the timeline to create a fully independent supply chain could take many years.</p>

The ministry also accused the U.S. of deploying offensive weaponry in the South China Sea and inciting conflict in the Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. has vowed to bolster its defenses overseas to counter threats from China, particularly toward Taiwan, while insisting that allies in the Indo-Pacific contribute more to their own defense.</p>

The position is primarily ceremonial, involving organizing plenary sessions. Baerbock's nomination has faced some criticism, as Germany had initially planned to nominate diplomat Helga Schmid for the role. Baerbock's tenure as foreign minister was marked by outspokenness on human rights and democratic freedoms, but also by challenging international crises and a high travel rate, but she showed herself a strong supporter of sending military supplies to Ukraine.</p>

The article outlines the Trump administration's efforts, including high-level meetings and proposed ceasefires, but notes significant obstacles such as territorial disputes and conflicting demands. While some progress has been made, such as securing ceasefires for infrastructure and Black Sea navigation, major disagreements persist, with Russia preferring a battlefield victory over serious peace talks.</p>

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a nationalist backed by U.S. President Donald Trump, has won the Polish presidency in a tight run-off race, posing challenges for the country's pro-EU government. Nawrocki secured 50.89% of the votes against Rafał Trzaskowski's 49.11%. His victory raises questions about Poland's future alignment with Brussels and Kyiv, as he is expected to take a more critical stance toward Ukraine. The head of state's role in Poland is overshadowed by that of parliament, but the president retains a critical veto over legislation. The EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she's "confident that the EU will continue its very good cooperation with Poland."</p>

          <p>In Counselor, New Mexico, schoolchildren are experiencing health issues like headaches and vomiting due to pollution from nearby oil and gas operations. Lybrook Elementary School, located in the San Juan Basin, is frequently affected by the smell of "rotten egg with propane" from natural gas wells. An analysis of state and federal data found 694 oil and gas wells within a mile of a school in the state, potentially exposing around 29,500 students to noxious emissions. Research indicates that air pollution from fossil fuels can directly harm student learning, even when socioeconomic factors are considered. Local officials are skeptical of the alarm over the wells, and some defend the industry's economic benefits.</p>

          <p>USC's aggressive strategy backfired in a 14-1 loss to Oregon State in the Corvallis Regional final, forcing a winner-take-all Game 7. The Trojans' early attempts to score were thwarted, and Oregon State capitalized with four bunts that led to four runs. Despite loading the bases in the fifth inning, USC failed to score, while Oregon State continued to pile on runs. USC finished the night with 16 strikeouts, and will have a chance for redemption in Monday's rematch. The winner of Monday's game will advance to face Florida State in the Super Regional.</p>

          <p>Conservative Karol Nawrocki won Poland's weekend presidential runoff election with 50.89% of the vote, narrowly defeating liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski. The outcome suggests Poland can be expected to take a more populist and nationalist path under its new leader, who was backed by President Trump. Most day-to-day power in the Polish political system rests with a prime minister, who is chosen by the parliament, but the president's role is not merely ceremonial. Incoming president Nawrocki has most recently been the head of the Institute of National Remembrance, which embraces nationalist historical narratives.</p>

The dispute centers on how best to balance the demands of the tech and creative sectors, specifically regarding AI developers' access to copyrighted material. Ministers back AI developers having access to all content unless individual owners choose to opt out, while many members of the House of Lords think AI firms should disclose which copyrighted material they use to train their tools, with a view to licensing it.

Researchers collected samples from Southeast Asian populations covering six countries, five prominent language families and 30 ethnic languages.
