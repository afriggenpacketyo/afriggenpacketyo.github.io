          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, alleging it systematically violates the Second Amendment by imposing excessive delays on concealed carry permit applications. The complaint states that thousands of applications have been pending for months or even years, far beyond the 90-day response time required by California law. This action, described as the DOJ's first-ever affirmative lawsuit supporting gun owners' rights, seeks to end what it calls an egregious pattern of obstruction by the sheriff's office.</p>

          <p>An internal email from the U.S. Department of Energy has reportedly directed employees in its renewable energy office to avoid using terms like “climate change,” “emissions,” and “decarbonization.” This move is seen as part of a broader Trump administration effort to control language around environmental issues and align official communications with its policy priorities. While the agency's press secretary has denied any formal directive, the instruction follows recent actions by the Energy Secretary to criticize climate policy and cancel funding for renewable projects.</p>

          <p>With a government shutdown imminent, Senate leaders from both parties publicly blamed each other for the funding impasse. Majority Leader John Thune argued that Republicans have offered a clean, nonpartisan funding extension, which Democrats are blocking for partisan reasons related to healthcare priorities. In response, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer contended the Republican bill is "extremely partisan" and was drafted without any bipartisan negotiation, criticizing the GOP for refusing to address Medicaid cuts and expiring Obamacare subsidies. The stalemate continues as President Trump's statements on the likelihood of a shutdown appeared to waver.</p>

          <p>In a key speech, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer aimed to solidify his position against the political challenge posed by Nigel Farage and the Reform UK party. The address was seen as a response to internal critics within the Labour party who question his ability to effectively counter Farage's populist appeal. Starmer sought to frame the political landscape as a clear choice between Reform and all other parties, positioning himself as the leader to spearhead that opposition. The performance comes at a critical time, with upcoming local elections potentially determining his future leadership.</p>

          <p>Conductor Gustavo Dudamel has launched his 17th and final season as the music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, an event that also precedes his upcoming takeover of the New York Philharmonic. The opening concert at Walt Disney Concert Hall featured the premiere of Ellen Reid’s “Earth Between Oceans,” a piece jointly commissioned by both orchestras. The performance also included a powerful rendition of Richard Strauss’ “Alpine Symphony,” showcasing the orchestra's dynamic sound.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "7-year rule" for credit card debt primarily dictates that most negative information, such as late payments and charge-offs, must be removed from a consumer's credit report after seven years from the first delinquency. This rule, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, helps improve credit scores over time but does not erase the debt itself. Additionally, state statutes of limitations, often around seven years, can prevent creditors from suing for old debts, though collectors may still attempt to contact individuals for payment.

          <p>Quantum computing startup PsiQuantum has broken ground on a new facility in Chicago's Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park, backed by a recent $1 billion funding round. The site will serve as an anchor for the park and will initially house a large-scale quantum test system for evaluation by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). PsiQuantum is developing a photonic-based quantum computer, aiming to build the nation's first million-qubit, fault-tolerant machine. The project is expected to establish Illinois as a major hub for quantum technology and innovation.</p>

          <p>The recent Asia Cup cricket final between India and Pakistan was marked by heightened political tensions, moving beyond typical sporting rivalry. The Indian team reportedly refused to shake hands with Pakistani players and declined to accept the trophy from Pakistan's Interior Minister, who also heads the country's cricket board. Following India's victory, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi linked the win to a recent military operation against Pakistan, drawing a sharp rebuke. The events signal a breakdown of "cricket diplomacy," which has historically been used to ease tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>In an advice column, writer James Parker responds to a reader who has lost the creative "fire" for writing weekly odes about local food and drink. Parker shares his own experience of losing his passion for the form after publishing a book on the topic, a concept he calls "the odeness." He advises the reader that the creative spark can return, suggesting they broaden their subject matter to more abstract concepts like moods or ideas. He concludes that creative pieces don't always need to be rapturous or jolly, but simply need to be true to the form.</p>

          <p>Federal health officials have issued an alert for specific pre-cooked pasta meals sold at Walmart and Trader Joe's due to potential listeria contamination. The products, Marketside Linguine with Beef Meatballs and Trader Joe's Cajun-style Chicken Fettuccine, may be connected to a nationwide listeria outbreak that has sickened at least 20 people and caused four deaths. The contamination is believed to stem from the pasta ingredient, supplied by Nate's Fine Foods. Consumers are urged to discard the products and clean any surfaces they may have touched to prevent further illness.</p>

          <p>A new Hulu documentary, "Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery," revisits the all-female touring music festival of the late 1990s, co-founded by Sarah McLachlan. The film serves as a corrective to the caricatures that have since overshadowed the event's significance, highlighting its role in challenging a male-dominated music industry that often refused to play female artists back-to-back. The documentary explores how Lilith Fair created a rare sense of community, safety, and collective power for both the artists and the audience. It reflects on what has been lost in the decades since, as that sense of shared purpose has become less common.</p>
