          <h2>UK Automotive Production Falls to Lowest Level Since 1953</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 03:26:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK car and van manufacturing in the first half of the year has reached its lowest point since 1953, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) attributes the decline to factors like the closure of a major van plant and uncertainty over US tariffs, which have since been reduced. While production of electric vehicles has slightly increased, the industry faces significant challenges in meeting future government targets, with experts calling for new manufacturers to enter the UK market. The SMMT also expressed concern over the lack of clarity regarding new electric vehicle grants, which could impact sales.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla has announced it is developing a more affordable car model and seeking approval for its self-driving software in Europe to combat declining sales and profits. The company reported a 12% drop in revenue and a 16% fall in profits, citing challenges like reduced US tax credits and increased competition from Chinese automakers. CEO Elon Musk emphasized that gaining approval for the company's autonomous driving technology in Europe is crucial for future growth. The firm's performance has also been impacted by Musk's political activities, which have reportedly damaged the brand's reputation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank reported a second-quarter net profit of 1.485 billion euros, surpassing analyst forecasts and signaling it is on track to meet its annual targets. The positive results came despite challenges, including a stronger euro and mixed performance in its investment banking division, where origination and advisory revenue fell significantly. The bank's leadership expressed confidence in its momentum and cost discipline, although they noted a slowdown in corporate loan growth. The report highlights the broader challenges European banks face with lower interest rates and uncertainty from potential US trade tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi canceled her scheduled appearance at CPAC's Summit Against Human Trafficking due to a torn cornea. Her absence was announced at the event, where a statement was read on her behalf expressing her regret for missing the summit on a critical issue. The cancellation occurs amidst scrutiny over the Trump administration's handling of documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. President Trump has recently defended Bondi's work while criticizing ongoing focus on the Epstein matter, which he has labeled a "Democrat playbook."</p>

          <h2>China Faces Oversupply of Waste Incinerators Amid Shortage of Trash</h2>

          <p>China is experiencing an unusual oversupply problem in its waste-to-energy sector, with a surplus of incineration plants and not enough municipal solid waste to burn. Despite a 10% increase in waste generation since 2019, incineration capacity has more than doubled, leaving an estimated 40% of it idle. Experts attribute the slowdown in waste growth to factors like the economic downturn and slowing urbanization. This situation highlights a significant miscalculation in infrastructure planning, creating inefficiency in a sector intended to manage the nation's waste.</p>

          <p>Mario Guevara, a journalist from El Salvador who founded the Spanish-language outlet MG News, reports feeling "emotionally shattered" after being detained by ICE for over a month in Georgia.

The Department of Homeland Security stated he was arrested for obstruction and is in the country illegally, though his lawyer notes he has a work permit and a path to citizenship. Guevara, who has suspended his reporting, feels he is being used as an example to deter others from scrutinizing the agency.</p>

The proposal is supported by conservative politicians who advocate for stronger deportation measures for those with criminal convictions or rejected asylum claims.

          <h2>Federal Appeals Court Upholds Block on Trump's Order to End Birthright Citizenship</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that former President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship is unconstitutional, upholding a nationwide block on its enforcement. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court's decision, stating the order's attempt to deny citizenship to many people born in the U.S. violates the 14th Amendment. The amendment's Citizenship Clause grants citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States. The 2-1 ruling marks a significant legal setback for the policy, bringing the issue closer to a potential Supreme Court review.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing crisis in student mental health is raising questions about the extent of a university's responsibility for student well-being. While the number of students reporting mental health conditions has nearly quadrupled in a decade, many feel that university services are inadequate or difficult to navigate. Academics often serve as the first point of contact but lack the training to handle complex mental health issues, leading to a system where students can "slip through the gaps." This article explores the debate over whether universities should have a formal duty of care, a move opposed by some who argue it places unrealistic expectations on educational institutions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a highly unusual move, U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve, intensifying his public pressure campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell. The visit marks the first time in nearly two decades that a sitting president has made an official trip to the central bank, challenging the long-standing tradition of its political independence. Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates and has even suggested he might fire the chairman. The visit is seen as a symbolic act, bringing his criticism directly to the institution he has frequently targeted. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A senior Department of Justice official is scheduled to meet with Ghislaine Maxwell, a long-time associate of Jeffrey Epstein, at the federal prison where she is serving her sentence. The meeting with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche follows a directive from President Trump to release all credible evidence related to the case. Maxwell's attorney has confirmed discussions about the visit, stating that she will "always testify truthfully." The development comes as the House Oversight Committee also issued a subpoena for Maxwell to be deposed at the prison in August.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Frustrated by local opposition and restrictive zoning, a growing number of U.S. states are enacting laws to compel cities and counties to allow for more affordable housing. Utah, for example, has strengthened its mandate requiring municipalities to create denser, more affordable housing options, backing it with both incentives and penalties. However, these top-down measures face significant pushback from local governments, who cite concerns about overcrowding, strained infrastructure, and the loss of local control. The trend highlights the national crisis in housing affordability, which is pricing many middle-class families out of their hometowns.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has agreed to a $200 million settlement with the federal government to resolve investigations into alleged anti-discrimination law violations. The agreement restores hundreds of millions in federal research grants that were withheld by the Trump administration amid accusations the university failed to address antisemitism. As part of the deal, Columbia will codify reforms, including a ban on face masks at protests, and follow laws prohibiting the consideration of race in admissions. While the university does not admit wrongdoing, its acting president stated the settlement was a necessary step to move forward.</p>

          <p>A large-scale study published in The Lancet suggests that walking 7,000 steps per day is a more realistic and evidence-based target for health benefits than the commonly cited 10,000 steps. The research found that achieving this number of steps was linked to a substantially reduced risk of major health issues like dementia, heart disease, and cancer. The 10,000-step goal originated from a 1960s marketing campaign in Japan, not scientific research. Researchers believe that promoting a 7,000-step target could encourage more people to engage in daily physical activity to improve their long-term health.</p>

          <p>A Venezuelan man, Arturo Suarez, has described enduring constant physical and psychological abuse after the Trump administration sent him and over 250 other Venezuelans to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. Suarez, who had no criminal record, was detained in the U.S. and accused of being a gang member before being flown to the notorious CECOT prison. He was recently released as part of a prisoner swap and recounts being beaten, humiliated, and told he would only leave the prison dead. His ordeal highlights a controversial U.S. immigration policy that outsourced the detention of migrants to a third country.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed U.S. border officials to give unaccompanied migrant teenagers the option to voluntarily return to their home countries, a significant shift in immigration policy. Previously, a 2008 anti-trafficking law required that all unaccompanied minors from non-contiguous countries be transferred to government-run shelters overseen by HHS. Now, teens aged 14 and older will be offered a choice between prompt self-deportation or being sent to the shelter system. The Department of Homeland Security stated the change was enabled by new authorities in a recent spending law.</p>

          <p>The UK's Environment Agency (EA) has canceled thousands of scheduled water tests for river and lake pollution over the last three months due to significant staff shortages. Internal documents reveal that tests for inorganic pollutants like nitrates and phosphates, which can indicate sewage or agricultural runoff, were paused. The EA confirmed that its main laboratory is operating below capacity, affecting monitoring programs for protected areas like the River Wye. Campaigners and former employees express alarm, stating that routine testing is essential for tracking water health and identifying pollution problems quickly.</p>
