          <p>Spain's women's national football team is set to face England in the Euro 2025 final, marking a significant turnaround from their 2023 World Cup victory. That win was overshadowed by a scandal where the football federation president, Luis Rubiales, kissed player Jenni Hermoso without consent, leading to protests and his conviction for sexual assault. The team has since undergone profound changes within the federation, creating a more professional and supportive environment that players say allows them to focus solely on football. This final offers the team a chance to celebrate a major victory without the cloud of controversy that marred their previous triumph.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Welsh women's rugby team achieved its first win under new head coach Sean Lynn by defeating Australia in Brisbane. This victory provides a crucial morale boost for the team just four weeks before the Rugby World Cup, especially after a winless Six Nations campaign earlier in the year. Despite an early lead by Australia and a weather delay, Wales surged ahead with two tries from Nel Metcalfe. Although the Wallaroos narrowed the gap, a strong defensive performance in the second half secured the win for Wales. The two sides are scheduled for a final warm-up rematch in Sydney.</p>

          <h2>Luxury Market Recovery Faces Challenges from Currency Fluctuations and Shifting Consumer Behavior</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 02:08:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recovery of the luxury goods market is encountering several obstacles, including currency volatility and changing consumer habits, leading to mixed sales results for major brands. A key issue is the weakness of the Japanese yen, which, after boosting tourist spending in 2024, is now causing a sharp sales decline for companies like Richemont and Burberry. Conversely, many firms are seeing a surprising sales spike in the U.S., though it's unclear if this is due to consumers buying ahead of potential tariffs. To offset these pressures, brands like Moncler and Brunello Cucinelli are planning price increases, while the market sees a divergence in product performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's arrival in Scotland to open a new golf course has reignited long-standing local opposition and sparked planned protests. Residents and activists in Aberdeenshire recall the contentious development of his first resort, which they argue destroyed an ecologically rare site and failed to deliver on promised economic benefits. Opponents, including those whose homes were threatened by the development, criticize the visit as a publicity stunt and question the public expense for securing a private trip. Protests are also planned on the west coast near his Turnberry resort, reflecting broader discontent with his political actions and a sense of solidarity against what some view as a transnational struggle.</p>

          <p>China is bolstering its relationship with African nations by offering expanded duty-free access for taxable products to 53 countries, a move seen as a significant diplomatic gain. This policy contrasts sharply with recent U.S. actions, which include threats of aid cuts, visa restrictions, and the imposition of higher tariffs on imports from several African nations. Observers note that these divergent approaches are likely to enhance Beijing's standing as a more reliable and beneficial partner in the eyes of many African governments. The development challenges the long-held U.S. belief that its humanitarian aid would secure unwavering political goodwill on the continent.</p>

          <p>Voters in Taiwan are deciding the fate of 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT) in a large-scale recall election that could alter the legislative power balance. The recall effort was initiated by citizens angry over the KMT-led opposition bloc's actions, which include blocking key legislation like the defense budget and passing reforms seen as favoring mainland China. Proponents of the recall are concerned about Taiwan's democratic integrity and its ability to counter threats from Beijing. The outcome is critical, as the ruling Democratic Progressive Party could regain a legislative majority if enough KMT members are ousted and subsequent by-elections are won.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered numerous cases where dopamine agonist drugs, prescribed for conditions like Parkinson's disease, have caused severe and life-altering side effects, including hypersexuality, compulsive gambling, and sexually coercive behavior. The report details the story of a man whose medication, Ropinirole, led him to spy on his wife and develop a pornography addiction, ultimately destroying his family. Despite the drug manufacturer GSK knowing about links to "deviant" sexual behavior since 2003, warnings on patient leaflets remain vague. Critics, including a UK health committee official, are calling for stronger warnings, as the current language fails to convey the devastating potential impact on patients and their families.</p>

          <p>A Pennsylvania family has filed a lawsuit against two funeral homes for allegedly giving them their deceased son's brain in an unlabeled cardboard box that subsequently leaked in their car. The parents, Lawrence and Abbey Butler, received the box of their son's belongings after his remains were shipped from Georgia to Pennsylvania. Days later, a foul-smelling fluid, later identified as brain matter, leaked from the box, causing immense emotional distress. The lawsuit accuses both funeral homes of negligent mishandling of human remains and inflicting emotional distress, stating there was no excuse for shipping biohazardous material in such a manner. The family is seeking compensation and answers.</p>

          <h2>California Regulators Clarify Tesla's Robotaxi Service Must Have Human Drivers</h2>

          <p>Despite Tesla CEO Elon Musk's plans to expand the company's robotaxi service, California regulators have stated that the service cannot operate without a human driver in the state. The California Public Utilities Commission clarified that while Tesla has a permit to run a private car service for "friends and family," it does not authorize the transport of passengers in autonomous vehicles on public roads. This means any service must function like a traditional taxi or limousine with a human in control, not as a true robotaxi. The clarification comes as the California DMV is separately accusing Tesla of misleading consumers about the capabilities of its "Full Self-Driving" technology.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight from Burbank to Las Vegas executed a dramatic dive shortly after takeoff to avoid a potential mid-air collision, resulting in injuries to two flight attendants. Passengers described a terrifying experience, likening it to a freefall, with some being thrown from their seats. The Boeing 737 received alerts about a nearby Hawker Hunter jet, prompting the pilot to take evasive action. The flight was able to continue to its destination and land safely. The Federal Aviation Administration is now investigating the incident, which adds to growing concerns about aviation safety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Inter Miami's owner, Jorge Mas, has publicly condemned Major League Soccer's decision to suspend star player Lionel Messi for one game. The suspension was imposed because Messi, along with teammate Jordi Alba, skipped the MLS All-Star game, citing the need for rest. According to a long-standing league rule, players who decline an All-Star invitation without league approval are ineligible for their club's next match. Mas called the punishment "draconian" and stated that the players did not understand why missing an exhibition game would lead to a suspension. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged it was a difficult decision and said the league would reevaluate the policy.</p>

          <p>Disgraced former U.S. Congressman George Santos has surrendered to a federal correctional facility in New Jersey to begin serving his 87-month prison sentence. Santos was convicted of wire fraud and identity theft charges after it was revealed he fabricated large parts of his personal and professional background to defraud voters and donors. Prosecutors stated he "made a mockery of our election system" by using campaign funds for personal enrichment, including luxury goods and Botox treatments. After his sentencing, Santos publicly appealed to President Trump for a chance to prove he is more than his mistakes, though the White House has not commented on any potential clemency request.</p>

          <p>A Leicester salon owner is preparing for a crucial hearing in her lengthy and costly trademark dispute with the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal. Rebecca Dowdeswell, owner of a salon named "nkd," is fighting L'Oréal's opposition to her renewing the business's trademark. The French firm, which owns the "Naked" line of products under its Urban Decay brand, argues that the "nkd" name could cause consumer confusion. After a delay due to a high caseload at the UK's Intellectual Property Office, a hearing date has been set, and Dowdeswell, who has spent over £30,000 on the case, says she is ready to continue her fight against the corporate giant.</p>

          <p>Despite official promises that 18-year-old conscripts would not be sent to fight, a BBC investigation has identified at least 245 Russian soldiers of that age who have been killed in Ukraine. New rules allow young men to sign professional army contracts immediately after finishing school, bypassing mandatory service. Attracted by large cash bonuses and a patriotic education system that promotes military enlistment, these teenagers are voluntarily joining the conflict. The report highlights the stories of several young men who enlisted shortly after their 18th birthdays and were killed within weeks of reaching the front lines, revealing a tragic pipeline from the classroom to the battlefield.</p>

          <h2>UK's Warm and Sunny Weather Leads to Boom for Some Insect Species in 2025</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 20:53:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's record-breaking warm and sunny spring has resulted in a noticeable boom for certain insect populations, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The favorable weather led to an abundance of aphids, a primary food source for ladybirds, and prompted unusually early sightings for numerous butterfly species, a stark contrast to the record low numbers of the previous year. While these species thrive in the heat, experts express concern that the relative lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year by drying out wetland habitats. The trend is seen as part of a larger pattern of more erratic "boom and bust" cycles for wildlife due to climate change.</p>
