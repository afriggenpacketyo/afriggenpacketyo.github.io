            <h2>US Treasury Market Experiencing Sell-Off Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>

            <p>The U.S. Treasury market saw an unusual sell-off as investors moved away from the safe haven asset, contributing to market volatility caused by President Trump's tariff policies. The yield on the 10-year Treasury soared to its highest level since February, raising questions about who was selling and why. China and Japan's life insurers have been cited as potential large-scale sellers of US debt, though the economic implications of such actions are debated. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Treasury yields rose on Tuesday, continuing a sell-off as investors move away from U.S. government debt, reversing a brief pullback. The development follows a week of volatility in the bond market, which saw a significant surge in the 10-year Treasury yield.

Ukraine has expressed optimism that lower oil prices will reduce Russia's ability to fund its war efforts.

            <p>A third federal judge has temporarily blocked some deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, issuing a temporary order barring the Trump administration from removing noncitizens located in Colorado who are subject to the AEA Proclamation. The order will remain in effect for two weeks, and a hearing is set for April 21 to consider extending it. This decision follows similar rulings by judges in New York and Texas, creating a patchwork of district-level protections. </p>

            <p>China has reportedly ordered its airlines to cease further deliveries of Boeing jets as part of its ongoing trade war with the U.S. The Chinese government has also asked carriers to stop purchases of aircraft-related equipment and parts from American companies. This restriction marks a significant blow for Boeing and other manufacturers amid escalating trade tensions. The move could affect deliveries of Boeing 737 Max jets to Chinese airlines.</p>

            <p>Shares of LVMH experienced a significant drop after reporting a decline in first-quarter sales, attributed to weaker demand in the U.S. and China and the potential impact of tariffs. The results pulled down the wider luxury sector, and LVMH briefly lost its position as the world's largest luxury firm to HermÃ¨s. Analysts cited trade tensions and economic uncertainty as factors weighing on the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

While an extension provides more time to file, it does not extend the payment deadline, and penalties may apply for late payments. The IRS offers various methods for filing an extension, including online payment systems and Form 4868. </p>

            <p>Public schools are increasingly using the "success sequence" theory, which posits that poverty can be avoided by following a specific order of choices: finishing school, getting a job, and then marrying before having children. Critics argue that the evidence is weak and confuses correlation with causation. They claim it deflects attention from systemic issues that contribute to poverty. The theory remains popular across political lines, but implementation in schools is debated.</p>
