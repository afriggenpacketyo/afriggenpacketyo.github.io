          <h2>Luxury Group Kering Reports Significant Sales Decline Driven by 25% Plunge at Gucci</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kering, the parent company of Gucci, reported a 15% drop in second-quarter sales, falling short of analyst expectations. The decline was largely driven by a significant 25% plunge in sales at its flagship brand, Gucci, which constitutes nearly half of the group's revenue. The luxury conglomerate is facing challenges across all markets, particularly in China and the United States, amidst an uncertain geopolitical and economic climate. Kering's leadership acknowledged the disappointing results but emphasized ongoing strategic efforts to revitalize its brands and achieve long-term growth.</p>

          <p>The largest rail workers' union in the U.S., SMART Transportation Division, has stated its intention to oppose the proposed $85 billion merger between Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern. The union cited major concerns over Union Pacific's labor practices and a "troubling safety record," alleging the company prioritizes profits over worker and public safety. In contrast, the union noted that Norfolk Southern has adopted more progressive labor policies in recent years. The SMART-TD plans to present its case to the Surface Transportation Board, which must approve any potential merger.</p>

          <p>A new tax law, the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," has reinstated three key provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, providing a significant financial windfall for large technology firms. The law brings back immediate expensing for R&D, 100% bonus depreciation for capital expenditures, and a more flexible interest deductibility limit. These changes are expected to unlock billions in free cash flow for companies like Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft, supporting their massive investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. While not changing fundamental earnings, the law accelerates deductions and provides greater policy certainty for long-term planning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI has introduced "study mode," a new feature within ChatGPT designed to assist students with their learning process rather than providing direct answers. The tool aims to address concerns about academic cheating by prompting users with guiding questions and encouraging them to work through problems step-by-step. Developed in collaboration with educators and students, study mode is intended to improve critical thinking and academic performance. The feature is being rolled out to all ChatGPT users and will be available in the university-focused ChatGPT Edu platform in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>In his "Dear James" advice column, James Parker addresses a reader who rarely thinks about the past and wonders if they are missing a fundamental human experience. The reader clarifies they don't avoid memories but tend to worry about the future rather than ruminate on past events. Parker, who describes himself as someone who holds onto old grievances, reassures the reader that their ability to let go of the past is a "superpower." He humorously suggests they use this gift to absolve others who are bogged down by guilt and regret, effectively freeing them from their own pasts.</p>

The USDA claims the data is needed to combat fraud, but critics point to the administration's history of using similar justifications to obtain data for immigration enforcement.

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit against an Ulster County, New York, clerk for refusing to enforce a Texas court's judgment against a New York doctor.

The New York clerk cited the state's "shield law," which protects abortion providers from out-of-state prosecutions. This legal action marks a significant escalation in the conflict between states with opposing abortion laws and is widely expected to eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

Polling suggests this shift is driven by a perception that Trump is not fulfilling his campaign promises and concerns over his economic policies.

          <p>The Royal Collection Trust has received an insurance payment of £3.02 million following the theft of two historic items from a Paris museum last year. The items, two ornate 18th-century snuff boxes, were on loan to the Cognacq-Jay Museum for an exhibition when they were stolen in a daylight raid. The trust's annual report revealed the payout figure, stating the funds will be used for the "enhancement of the collection." The report also highlighted record visitor numbers at Buckingham Palace, contributing to a profitable year for the charity that manages the Royal Collection's artifacts.</p>

          <p>A German court has convicted three men for the 2022 theft of a priceless collection of 483 ancient Celtic gold coins from a museum in Manching, Bavaria. The defendants received prison sentences of up to 11 years for the audacious nine-minute heist, during which they disabled local communication networks before breaking in. The treasure, which dates to around 100 B.C., is considered the largest Celtic gold trove found in the 20th century. Most of the coins remain missing, and authorities fear they were melted down, a fate one expert called "the worst option."</p>

          <p>As reports from Gaza indicate a rising death toll from malnutrition, medical experts are detailing the devastating physiological process of starvation. The body first depletes its carbohydrate and fat stores before beginning to break down its own muscle and organ proteins for energy. This final phase leads to severe muscle wasting, a weakened immune system, and ultimately organ failure, with death often caused by infection or cardiac arrest. Children, pregnant people, and the elderly are particularly vulnerable, suffering long-term consequences like stunted growth and developmental delays even if they survive this catastrophic state.</p>

          <p>Grammy-winning American singer Ciara has officially become a citizen of Benin, utilizing a new law that offers nationality to the descendants of Africans taken during the transatlantic slave trade. The West African nation enacted the "My Afro Origins Law" to strengthen ties with the African diaspora and promote cultural tourism. At a ceremony in Cotonou, Ciara expressed her honor at receiving citizenship. Benin's initiative follows similar programs in other countries, acknowledging the historical injustice of slavery and extending a symbolic hand to those whose roots were severed.</p>

          <p>A painting by surrealist master Salvador Dali, which was bought for only £150 at a house clearance in Cambridge, is now expected to sell for up to £30,000 at auction. An art dealer who purchased the piece discovered it was an authenticated original titled "Vecchio Sultano," part of a series illustrating "The Arabian Nights." The work had previously been attributed to Dali at a Sotheby's sale in the 1990s but its attribution was later lost, making this a significant rediscovery. The painting has been re-authenticated by a Dali expert ahead of its sale in October.</p>

As part of the settlement, UCLA is prohibited for 15 years from allowing the exclusion of Jewish individuals from campus areas.

The company also saw a sequential slowdown in branded checkout volumes, an increase in operating expenses, and a significant drop in adjusted free cash flow. While PayPal raised its full-year earnings forecast, the weak spots fueled concerns about the company's core profitability and efficiency. (not investment advice)</p>

Zoo officials defended the decision, stating that the baboon troop had grown too large for its enclosure, leading to increased conflict and injuries among the animals. They claimed that efforts to transfer the baboons to other zoos and use contraception had failed, leaving them with no other option. Animal rights organizations have condemned the culling as a result of "irresponsible and unsustainable breeding policies" and are threatening legal action against the zoo.</p>

          <p>Union Pacific has proposed an $85 billion acquisition of Norfolk Southern, a deal that would create the first single-line transcontinental railroad in the United States. The merger aims to connect Union Pacific's extensive western network with Norfolk Southern's system in the eastern U.S., which the companies argue will streamline deliveries and improve service. The landmark proposal will face intense scrutiny from the Surface Transportation Board, which has set a high bar for rail consolidation following service disruptions from past mergers. If approved, the deal could trigger further consolidation among remaining major railroads.</p>
