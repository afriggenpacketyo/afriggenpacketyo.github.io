          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 20:38:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration imposed significant sanctions on Russia's two largest crude companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, causing oil prices to jump approximately 3%. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced these measures, emphasizing the need for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and criticizing Moscow's lack of commitment to peace. These sanctions, a notable policy shift for Trump, are designed to curtail the Kremlin's revenue for its war efforts and were influenced by a recently canceled meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin. The move also aims to pressure countries like India, a major purchaser, to cease buying Russian oil, indicating a broader strategy to impact Russia's global economic standing.</p>

          <p>US forces carried out a strike on a suspected drug-carrying vessel in the Pacific Ocean, resulting in the deaths of two individuals, as confirmed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. This marks the eighth such US strike since September, and the first in the Pacific, with President Trump asserting legal authority for these operations and considering expanding targets on land. The administration justifies these actions as counter-narcotics measures against drug-trafficking organizations, which have been designated as terrorist groups. The operation has heightened tensions with regional governments like Colombia, whose president Trump has criticized, and has involved a significant deployment of US troops and military assets.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to demolish the entire East Wing of the White House, potentially this weekend, as part of a controversial $300 million project to add a ballroom. The cost has escalated from an initial $200 million, with funding reportedly sourced from private donors. This extensive demolition, which also includes modernizing the bunker and movie theater, has sparked significant pushback from historic preservation groups, who fear the large addition will overshadow the White House's historic integrity. The project highlights President Trump's continued efforts to modify the complex, generating polarized reactions among the public and political figures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump and his legal team are seeking an unprecedented $230 million settlement from the Justice Department for two federal damage claims. These claims relate to the FBI and special counsel investigations into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election and the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case. The request presents a significant conflict of interest, as key Justice Department officials, including the Deputy Attorney General, previously defended Trump in these very cases. Legal experts have expressed strong skepticism regarding the sum and the ethical implications, calling for recusals. If approved, the compensation would be paid by American taxpayers, sparking considerable public debate.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, has formed over the Caribbean and is projected to bring substantial rainfall, 5 to 10 inches, to the southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern Jamaica. While its exact trajectory remains uncertain, with a possibility of strengthening into a hurricane by Friday, the storm is not expected to significantly impact the mainland United States. Forecasters have issued warnings for potential flash flooding and landslides in the affected Caribbean islands. The slow-moving storm's unpredictable path necessitates continued monitoring and preparedness from regional authorities and residents.</p>

          <p>An Australian Member of Parliament used parliamentary privilege to publicly name a man, previously known as Mercury, as a key person of interest in the 1970 disappearance of three-year-old Cheryl Grimmer. This action bypasses legal protections on his identity. The man was charged with abduction and murder in 2017 after an old confession surfaced, but the case was dropped due to inadmissible evidence. Cheryl's family, who were present for the naming, has relentlessly campaigned for a new inquiry into the cold case. The incident highlights the ongoing anguish for the family and the legal complexities surrounding the unsolved disappearance.</p>

          <p>A family of three was dramatically rescued by the Coast Guard off Cape Cod after their 30-foot pleasure boat caught fire, forcing them to swim to a small island.

This critical action led to their successful rescue by a Coast Guard helicopter, transporting them to an area hospital. While one family member was in critical condition, the others were stable.

          <p>A new report by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) asserts that support for children with special educational needs (SEND) in England is fundamentally flawed, advocating for more comprehensive, easily accessible support in mainstream schools. The report highlights that the current system often forces families into lengthy assessment processes for Education Health and Care Plans (EHCPs), which have more than doubled since 2016. This article features the experiences of students like Evie, who spent three years without education due to a lack of suitable specialist placements. The Department for Education acknowledges the "vicious cycle" and plans reforms for 2026.</p>

The article highlights that China's automotive sector last contracted in 2020.
