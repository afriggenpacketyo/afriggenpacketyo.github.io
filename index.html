          <p>A violent incident in Lexington, Kentucky, resulted in the deaths of two women and injuries to three other people, including a state trooper. The event began when the suspect shot the trooper during a traffic stop near Blue Grass airport before carjacking a vehicle. The suspect then fled to a nearby Baptist church, where he opened fire on parishioners before being shot and killed by responding police officers. Authorities have indicated that the suspect may have had a connection to individuals at the church, and an investigation is currently underway.</p>

          <p>In a new discussion series, leading China experts Professor Li Cheng and Andrew Browne examine the current state and future trajectory of U.S.-China relations. The dialogue addresses the complexities of the relationship between the world's two largest economies, particularly in light of growing trade frictions and the potential policies of a second Donald Trump administration. The experts provide their assessments on the health of bilateral ties following a tumultuous period of tariffs and trade negotiations. Their conversation aims to shed light on how this critical global relationship might evolve in the coming years.</p>

          <p>A fast-moving wildfire has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge on the park's North Rim, forcing an evacuation and closure of the area for the season. The Bravo Dragon fire, which originated from a lightning strike, also consumed the visitor center, a gas station, and other park infrastructure. While no injuries have been reported, the destruction of the iconic lodge, originally built in the 1920s, represents a significant loss of cultural heritage. The fire also caused a release of chlorine gas from a water treatment plant, prompting further evacuations of emergency personnel from the inner canyon.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's security agency, the SBU, announced it has killed two suspected Russian agents allegedly responsible for the assassination of a senior Ukrainian officer in Kyiv. The officer, Colonel Ivan Voronych, was killed in a daylight attack, and the SBU stated the suspects were eliminated after resisting arrest. This event is part of an ongoing shadow war of targeted killings between the two nations since Russia's full-scale invasion. The article notes that Moscow has previously accused Kyiv of similar high-profile assassinations, while Ukrainian officials have at times claimed responsibility for attacks on Russian military figures and collaborators.</p>

          <p>A new Senate Homeland Security Committee report has identified a "cascade of preventable failures" by the U.S. Secret Service leading up to the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania. The report highlights significant communication gaps and organizational mistakes, such as a countersniper team having an obstructed view of the shooter's location. It also alleges that the agency denied resource requests for Trump's security detail and that former Director Kimberly Cheatle provided false testimony to Congress. The Secret Service has stated it is implementing reforms to address the identified failures, including disciplining six employees involved.</p>

          <p>In an address to the CNBC Investing Club, Jim Cramer advised investors to separate their personal political feelings from their financial decisions, particularly regarding the Trump administration. He posits that despite widespread personal dislike for the president, the market has remained resilient, driven by individual investors and pro-business policies. Cramer suggests that factors like deregulation, a favorable environment for corporate mergers, and the deflationary impact of artificial intelligence are creating a bullish market. He argues these elements may outweigh the inflationary pressures of tariffs, creating opportunities for investors regardless of their political leanings. (not investment advice)</p>

The album follows a period of personal and professional upheaval for the artist, and its sound is characterized by murky production and spacey, chillwave-inspired grooves. This release is seen as a continuation of Bieber's periodic shifts away from mainstream pop towards more personal, R&B-focused work, similar to his past albums "Journals" and "Changes."

          <p>A child being treated at Liverpool's Alder Hey Children's Hospital has died after contracting measles, a highly contagious virus. The hospital has seen a surge in seriously unwell children with measles, having treated 17 cases since June, and warned that uptake of the MMR vaccine has fallen in the region. Health officials attribute the rise in cases, with 500 in England this year, to lower vaccination rates. They are urging parents to ensure their children are vaccinated, emphasizing that measles can lead to serious illness, hospitalization, and, in rare cases, death, especially for infants and those with weakened immune systems.</p>

          <p>Muhammadu Buhari, the former president and one-time military ruler of Nigeria, has died at the age of 82 in a London hospital following a prolonged, undisclosed illness. A towering and often polarizing figure, Buhari first led Nigeria as a military dictator in the 1980s before returning to power as a democratically elected president from 2015 to 2023. His presidency was marked by huge public expectations to tackle corruption and insecurity, but ultimately saw significant economic decline and a spread of violence across the country. He retained a loyal following, particularly in Nigeria's north, for his austere public image.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators, led by Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal, is advancing a sanctions bill described as a "sledgehammer" to pressure Russia to end its war in Ukraine. The legislation would grant the president authority to impose massive tariffs on countries like China, India, and Brazil that support Russia's economy by purchasing its goods. The move comes as President Trump expresses growing frustration with Vladimir Putin's refusal to de-escalate the conflict. Senator Graham indicated a "turning point" is coming, suggesting the door for diplomacy is closing and a more aggressive economic strategy is imminent.</p>

          <p>An old fortune cookie factory in Denver, dating back to the 1940s, has been repurposed into a unique, privately-funded art gallery that is free to the public. Founder Amanda Precourt purchased the dilapidated building nearly a decade ago and, after an eight-year transformation, opened the Cookie Factory in May. The mission behind the space is to provide a place for community gathering and healing through art, a cause personal to the founder. The inaugural exhibition features nature-based work by artist Sam Falls and is part of a long-term vision to offer a rotating selection of artists to the city.</p>

All parties are reportedly working to complete the signing within the next 24 hours, which would allow Gyokeres to join the team for its pre-season tour in Asia later this week.</p>

          <p>Following the deadly floods in Texas, Senator Maria Cantwell has emphasized that improving the nation's weather warning systems is a "national responsibility." The Washington Democrat, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, stated the federal government must invest in better science and technology to provide more advanced warnings for extreme weather events like floods, tornadoes, and fires. She plans to send President Trump bipartisan recommendations to upgrade infrastructure, including Doppler radar and ocean buoys. Cantwell warned that proposed budget cuts and privatization efforts could undermine the crucial scientific mission of agencies like NOAA.</p>

          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett confirmed that the Trump administration is looking into whether it has the authority to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. While stating the president does not currently want to fire Powell, Hassett added that it could be done "if there's cause." The comments come as the administration escalates its criticism of Powell, recently targeting a $2.5 billion renovation project at the Fed's headquarters, which they claim is mismanaged. This suggests the White House may be laying the groundwork to find a cause to remove Powell before his term expires next spring.</p>

          <p>Tom Homan, President Trump's "border czar," has become a prominent defender of the administration's mass deportation policies, engaging in heated public exchanges and media appearances. At a recent conference, he aggressively confronted a heckler, while on Sunday news programs he walked back previous comments that seemed to confirm racial profiling by ICE agents. Homan admitted that U.S. citizens have been caught up in raids as "collateral arrests" but stressed that physical appearance cannot be the sole factor for detention. His heightened public role comes amid growing controversy over the administration's immigration tactics.</p>
