          <p>The Trump administration has formally petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a lower court's decision that deemed many of the president's tariffs illegal. The administration is urging a swift review, arguing the ruling undermines sensitive diplomatic negotiations and creates significant legal uncertainty over the president's authority to impose such taxes. This legal challenge follows an appellate court decision which stated that setting tariffs is a core power of Congress, not the executive branch.</p>

          <p>A recently released survey indicates that the Chinese public's view on the U.S.-China rivalry is more nuanced than commonly perceived in America. A plurality of respondents expressed a preference for a shared global leadership role rather than seeking to displace the United States as the sole superpower. However, the survey's authors caution that the findings might be influenced by self-censorship among participants, suggesting a complex and possibly cautious public opinion within China.</p>

It argues that President Trump's "America First" tariff policies may inadvertently accelerate this shift by pushing countries like Russia and India closer to China. Furthermore, these same tariff policies are now facing significant legal challenges within the U.S. court system.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova has advanced to the US Open semifinals after a stunning 6-4, 6-3 victory over second seed Iga Swiatek.

Anisimova credited her changed mindset and fearless play for the victory, which she described as the most meaningful of her career.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News poll reveals that a majority of Americans continue to have a negative perception of the U.S. economy, with economic ratings declining slightly over the past month. The most commonly chosen words to describe the economy were "uncertain" and "struggling," with two-thirds of respondents stating that prices are still rising. This widespread concern about inflation is a key driver of the persistent economic pessimism across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

A recent lethal strike against a suspected smuggling boat in the Caribbean exemplifies this shift, which expands the military's mission into crime-fighting. This blurring of lines departs from a long-standing American principle of separating military and police functions, raising legal and ethical questions.</p>
