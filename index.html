          <p>The U.S. has imposed new tariffs on India, but New Delhi is not rushing to secure a trade deal. India is protecting its agricultural sector, a crucial voting bloc, and views its exports to the U.S. as a relatively small part of its economy. Analysts suggest the U.S. has a strategic interest in not alienating India, seeing it as a key partner in the Indo-Pacific and a potential manufacturing alternative to China. India's position within the BRICS bloc also provides it with diplomatic flexibility in negotiations with Washington.</p>

          <p>Ford has revised its forecast for the financial impact of U.S. tariffs, now expecting them to cost the company around $2 billion in the current year. The automotive giant attributes the increased cost to prolonged duties on imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as tariffs on steel and aluminum. This announcement highlights the significant effect of the administration's trade policies on major American corporations, even those with substantial domestic manufacturing. Ford is actively communicating with the White House to negotiate for lower tariffs on vehicle parts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and South Korea have reached a trade deal, setting a 15% tariff on South Korean exports, including cars, down from a threatened 25%. As part of the agreement, South Korea will facilitate a $350 billion investment into U.S. industries, though interpretations of how this fund will be managed differ between the two nations. The deal also includes a South Korean commitment to purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy products. While Seoul successfully protected its sensitive agricultural markets, the new blanket tariff negates some benefits of the existing U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics reported a significant drop in its second-quarter operating profit, which fell by more than half compared to the previous year, missing analyst expectations. The decline was primarily driven by a staggering 93.8% plunge in profits from its crucial memory chip division, attributed to inventory adjustments and costs from export restrictions. Despite the downturn, the company expressed optimism for a gradual recovery in the second half of the year, fueled by demand in AI and robotics. The report highlights the intense competition and challenges Samsung faces in the global semiconductor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A radar-related issue with the UK's National Air Traffic Services (NATS) caused widespread flight disruptions, leading to over 150 cancellations and grounding thousands more flights.

Ryanair called for the resignation of the NATS CEO, citing a similar major outage two years ago and accusing the service of incompetence.

This divergence highlights a growing international frustration with the lack of a clear U.S. plan for Gaza's future beyond the current conflict.

The average U.S. tariff rate has surged to its highest level since 1934, tripling the government's monthly tariff revenue. However, the policies have also led to a widening of the U.S. trade deficit, as companies stockpiled imports to avoid the taxes. While Chinese exports to the U.S. have declined, some economists are now seeing the first signs of these tariffs translating into higher consumer prices for certain imported goods, such as appliances and electronics.

          <p>Triggered by events like the recent 8.8-magnitude earthquake off Russia, tsunamis are powerful series of ocean waves with specific geological origins. They are typically generated by large, shallow underwater earthquakes that cause vertical movement of the seafloor, displacing massive volumes of water. While difficult to precisely forecast, scientists use tide gauges and deep-ocean sensors to track these waves, which can travel at jet-plane speeds in deep water before slowing and growing in height near the coast. Experts advise that upon receiving a warning, people should immediately move to higher ground.</p>

          <p>A research expedition using a human-occupied submersible has discovered and filmed what they describe as "thriving communities" of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the northwest Pacific Ocean. The team observed vast beds of clams, tube worms, and bacterial mats, challenging previous assumptions about the limits of life in such extreme, high-pressure environments. These ecosystems are not powered by sunlight but by chemicals like hydrogen sulfide and methane seeping from the Earth's crust. The findings suggest such "chemosynthetic" communities may be widespread in the planet's deepest regions.</p>

          <p>James Craig, a Colorado dentist, has been sentenced to life in prison without parole after being convicted of murdering his wife, Angela. The jury found him guilty of poisoning her protein shakes with arsenic and later administering a fatal dose of cyanide while she was hospitalized. Prosecutors argued that Craig, who had conducted internet searches on undetectable poisons, was motivated by a desire to end his marriage without a costly divorce. During the sentencing, the couple's children gave emotional statements about the betrayal by their father.</p>

          <p>A growing number of scientists are challenging the popular narrative that screen time is inherently damaging to children's brains, arguing that the scientific evidence is often flawed or inconclusive. Psychologists point out that much of the research relies on unreliable self-reporting and fails to distinguish between different types of screen use. While some studies link high social media use to depression, others have found little to no connection between screen time and poor mental well-being. This article explores the ongoing scientific debate, highlighting the complexity of the issue and the lack of clear, evidence-based guidance for parents.</p>

          <p>Researchers using high-resolution, near-infrared photography have uncovered stunning new details of tattoos on a 2,500-year-old female "ice mummy" from the Pazyryk culture of Siberia. The images reveal intricate and sophisticated designs of mythical creatures and animals, including leopards and a stag, that were previously not visible to the naked eye. The quality of the work suggests the Pazyryk people were highly skilled artists, likely using stencils and multi-pointed tools. The findings provide a vivid glimpse into the warrior culture and artistic practices of these ancient nomadic people.</p>

French government ministers have condemned the "excessive and brutal" use of force by Spanish police, who handcuffed the group's female counsellor. The situation was inflamed when a Spanish minister referred to the youths as "Israeli brats" in a since-deleted social media post. While the airline cited "disruptive behaviour," passenger accounts differ, and the group's lawyer has suggested antisemitism was a factor, a claim the airline and police deny.</p>

The decision was sharply condemned by Israel, which called it a "reward for Hamas" that undermines ceasefire efforts.

          <p>NBA player Marcus Morris Sr. has been released from a Florida jail after being arrested over the weekend on felony fraud charges from Nevada. The charges stemmed from two outstanding casino markers, each for over $100,000. Morris was held without bail pending extradition, but a judge indicated he would be released if the warrants were dismissed upon full repayment of the debts. In an Instagram post following his release, Morris stated the "money paid back and lesson learned," but objected to being characterized as a fraud, attributing the issue to a delay in repayment.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has initiated a large-scale recruiting campaign to hire thousands of new deportation officers, investigators, and lawyers. The agency is using patriotic appeals and offering signing bonuses of up to $50,000 to attract applicants. This expansion is funded by a recent congressional allocation of $76.5 billion to ICE over five years to support the Trump administration's goal of one million annual deportations. The rapid hiring push has raised concerns among former officials about potentially lowered standards and the challenges of managing such a swift expansion of enforcement personnel.</p>
