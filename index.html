          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has stated that the Tories must offer hope and focus on fixing problems rather than becoming a "repository of disenchantment." In an interview, she acknowledged the rising threat from Reform UK but expressed confidence in her leadership, citing Argentine President Javier Milei as a "template" for her approach to governance. Badenoch emphasized the need for the party to be resilient and to utilize its "heavy hitters" to regain public trust and electoral ground.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank announced second-quarter net profits of €1.485 billion, surpassing analyst expectations despite challenges from a strengthening euro and mixed results in its investment banking division. The bank affirmed it is on track to meet its full-year targets, citing disciplined cost management and business momentum. While fixed income and currency trading saw an 11% revenue increase, the origination and advisory unit declined by 29% due to market uncertainty and postponed transactions.

          <h2>Major Study Suggests 7,000 Daily Steps Is a Sufficient Target for Significant Health Benefits</h2>

          <p>A large-scale study published in The Lancet suggests that walking 7,000 steps per day is linked to a significantly reduced risk of major health issues like dementia, heart disease, and cancer. This finding presents a more achievable goal for many people than the commonly cited but less evidence-based target of 10,000 steps. Researchers believe that promoting a 7,000-step goal could encourage more people to track their activity and make practical improvements to their health, with benefits leveling off for most conditions beyond this number.</p>

          <p>A Venezuelan man, Arturo Suarez, has spoken out after being released from a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, where he was sent by the Trump administration despite having no criminal record. Suarez, one of over 250 Venezuelan men detained under the policy, described enduring constant physical and psychological abuse during his four months at the CECOT prison. He was arrested in the U.S. and accused of being a gang member, a claim he denies, stating he was targeted simply for being Venezuelan.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed U.S. border officials to offer migrant teenagers aged 14 and older the option to voluntarily return to their home countries. This upends a long-standing policy, based on a 2008 anti-trafficking law, that required unaccompanied minors from non-contiguous countries to be transferred to government shelters. Under the new directive, teens who decline the self-deportation option will still be sent to the shelter system, but the change marks a significant shift in U.S. immigration procedure for unaccompanied children.</p>

          <p>The BBC has learned that thousands of water tests designed to detect harmful pollution in England's rivers, lakes, and estuaries have been cancelled over the last three months due to staff shortages at the Environment Agency (EA). Internal documents reveal plans for extensive cuts to monitoring, with the EA confirming 10,000 tests were missed from May to July. Campaigners and former employees express alarm, stating that routine testing for pollutants like nitrates and phosphates is crucial for tracking river health and identifying problems quickly.</p>

          <p>During a summit in Beijing marking 50 years of diplomatic ties, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told Chinese President Xi Jinping that EU-China relations have reached an "inflection point." She highlighted the need to rebalance the relationship, pointing to the EU's historic €306 billion trade deficit with China last year. While President Xi called for deepened trust and cooperation in a turbulent world, the talks were set against a backdrop of significant disagreements over trade, market access, and industrial subsidies.</p>

          <p>A rare, vibrant purple sea snail, Janthina janthina, has been spotted on a La Jolla beach, a discovery that researchers at Scripps Institution of Oceanography find astonishing. These pelagic snails, which float on the open ocean using a self-secreted bubble raft, are typically found in warmer tropical waters. Their appearance, the first confirmed sighting by Scripps in a decade, coincides with unusually warm offshore water and raises questions among scientists about the potential connection to climate change and its effects on marine life distribution.</p>

          <p>A new UK law under the Online Safety Act, effective Friday, mandates that all websites operating in the country with pornographic content must implement robust age verification for their users. Regulator Ofcom has outlined several acceptable methods, including credit card checks and photo ID matching, with non-compliant sites facing massive fines. The move aims to prevent children from accessing explicit material, but it raises concerns about user privacy, data security, and the potential for circumvention using tools like VPNs.</p>
