          <p>This article explores the potential monthly payouts from a $750,000 annuity, emphasizing that the exact amount depends on factors like age, gender, and whether it's a single or joint life annuity. It provides a breakdown of estimated monthly payments for different age groups (60, 65, 70, 75, and 80) and genders, based on data from Annuity.org. The article also discusses the benefits and trade-offs of annuities, noting their guaranteed income and predictability but also the potential drawbacks of limited liquidity and tax implications. It concludes that while annuities can provide financial security, they should be considered as part of a broader retirement strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

The article highlights the shift in European sentiment towards taking a more proactive role in ensuring Ukraine's security.

          <p>Approximately 20,000 residents were evacuated from Cologne's city center as German authorities worked to defuse three unexploded World War II bombs. The operation faced delays due to a resident's refusal to evacuate, but eventually proceeded with the removal of two 200-pound bombs and one 100-pound bomb, all of US origin. The evacuated area included the old part of the city, numerous hotels, bridges, the town hall, and care homes, but excluded the Cologne Cathedral. Bomb defusals are common in Cologne, which was heavily targeted during WWII, including a major British Royal Air Force raid in 1942.</p>

The FBI believes the bombing was a premeditated act of terrorism, as Bartkus expressed opposition to bringing people into the world against their will.

          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that President Donald Trump's proposed tax bill would increase the national debt by $2.4 trillion over the next decade. The House-passed bill would decrease federal revenues by $3.7 trillion and lower spending by $1.3 trillion, according to the CBO analysis. The bill is expected to undergo further revisions in the Senate, where it faces opposition from deficit hawks concerned about its potential to significantly increase the national debt. Senator Ron Johnson and Elon Musk have voiced strong criticism of the bill, calling it "grotesque" and a "disgusting abomination."</p>

The order, responding to a request from a media coalition including CBS News, makes seven records available to the public, with some redactions to protect classified or sensitive information. The Justice Department had opposed the release, citing concerns about discovery materials and national security, but the judge found these arguments unconvincing. The Trump administration has acknowledged Abrego Garcia's deportation was a mistake, as he had been granted legal status preventing his removal to El Salvador due to potential persecution by local gangs.</p>

          <p>Dana Chandler was sentenced to life in prison for the 2002 murders of her ex-husband and his girlfriend, receiving two consecutive life terms with no parole eligibility for 50 years. This sentencing follows Chandler's third trial, with a previous conviction overturned due to prosecutorial misconduct. The case involved the shooting deaths of Mike Sisco and Karen Harkness, with police suspecting Chandler due to a history of harassment. Chandler maintained her innocence throughout the trials, but her children testified against her, believing she was responsible for the murders.</p>
