          <p>At the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping held several key bilateral meetings to bolster regional influence. He and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi committed to improving relations, viewing each other as partners rather than rivals. Xi also elevated ties with Armenia to a "strategic partnership" and reinforced a strong cooperative relationship with Azerbaijan, emphasizing economic projects like the Belt and Road Initiative and supporting these nations' engagement with the SCO.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch announced a significant shift in climate policy, pledging to remove all net-zero requirements for oil and gas companies in the North Sea if her party is elected. The plan aims to maximize fossil fuel extraction, a stark contrast to the current Labour government's commitment to ban new exploration licenses. This move, which echoes Donald Trump's "drill, baby, drill" approach, has been labeled as reckless by environmental groups who argue it will accelerate the climate crisis without lowering energy bills.</p>

Schröder reported hearing "monkey noises" as his team left the court at halftime, later stating that "racism simply does not belong in this sport." Following an investigation, the world basketball governing body, FIBA, identified the responsible spectator and banned them from all future games of the tournament, an action supported by both the German and Lithuanian basketball federations.</p>

Neighbors recalled Westman as a recent arrival who kept to themself, unaware of the arsenal being amassed inside the rental property. A search warrant confirmed that police seized tactical gear and documents from the home, providing a chilling glimpse into the preparations made just before the tragic shooting that claimed the lives of two children.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has reported the first fatal case of whooping cough this year, involving a baby whose mother had not been vaccinated during pregnancy. This tragic event highlights government warnings about declining vaccine uptake and rising hesitancy, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Health officials emphasize that vaccination during pregnancy is crucial for protecting newborns in their first weeks of life, as infants do not receive their first jab until they are eight weeks old.</p>

          <p>An unprecedented global demand for matcha, fueled by its reputation as a superfood and its popularity on social media, has created a supply crisis in its home country of Japan. The surge has led to record-high auction prices for tencha, the tea leaves used to make matcha, with prices jumping 170% in one year. Retailers in Tokyo are now rationing supplies and reporting difficulty stocking the green powder, as both international buyers and a tourism boom strain the nation's production capacity.</p>

          <p>As a new school year begins, UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is warning parents about the critical importance of attendance, particularly in the first week. New data reveals that over half of the students who missed school during the initial week of the 2024 term later became persistently absent, compared to only 14% of those with full attendance. This highlights the post-pandemic challenge of high absence rates, which officials warn could jeopardize the future prospects of a generation of students.</p>

          <p>Lucy Guo, recently named Forbes' youngest self-made female billionaire, says her entrepreneurial journey began on the elementary school playground. Motivated by her frugal immigrant parents' emphasis on the value of money, she started by trading and selling Pokémon cards and colored pencils. This early drive evolved into online ventures and eventually led her to drop out of college to co-found the AI data company Scale AI, which was recently acquired by Meta for a valuation of $25 billion.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Reform-led council in Nottinghamshire, UK, is importing Donald Trump's anti-press tactics by banning journalists from a local newspaper. The author suggests this is part of a broader hard-right strategy to bypass traditional media, avoid scrutiny, and frame journalists as an establishment foil to rally supporters. While this tactic has been effective for Trump, the article questions if it will succeed in the UK, where voters may still value government competence and accountability.</p>

          <p>UCLA's football season began with a disappointing 43-10 defeat at the hands of Utah, exposing significant weaknesses on both sides of the ball. The defense struggled to contain Utah's quarterback, missing numerous tackles and allowing 14 of 17 third-down conversions. Offensively, new quarterback Nico Iamaleava had few moments of success, as the team's running game was ineffective and the unit failed to sustain drives, leading to a lopsided loss in coach DeShaun Foster's season opener.</p>

A decade after Germany opened its borders to hundreds of thousands of people fleeing conflict, the nation is taking stock of the policy's impact. While data shows significant success in employment and integration for many who arrived, Germany continues to grapple with the long-term social and political consequences of that decision.</p>

          <p>Recent medical research is shifting the understanding of chronic pain, identifying the brain as a primary source of the affliction that affects millions. According to Dr. Sanjay Gupta, the brain's neural pathways can generate and sustain pain signals independently of physical injury. This insight is paving the way for revolutionary treatments, including targeted surgeries, designed to interrupt these signals and offer new hope for individuals who have lived with debilitating, long-term pain.</p>

This creative experiment aims to reduce human-wolf conflicts and offers a potential high-tech tool for coexistence as wolf populations recover in the U.S. West.</p>

The tariffs, a response to India's purchase of Russian oil, are pushing New Delhi to seek stronger trade relationships elsewhere. This meeting with President Xi Jinping could repair strained relations and represents a strategic move for both nations to counter U.S. economic pressure and reshape global trade dynamics.</p>
