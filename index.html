          <p>Teenager Oscar Black, 15, from Lurgan, Northern Ireland, has made history by becoming the youngest swimmer to complete a solo North Channel crossing to Scotland. He covered 46km in 16 hours and 38 minutes, enduring strong currents and approximately 20 jellyfish stings across his body. Despite moments of contemplating why he was undertaking the challenge, Oscar described it as more of a mental than physical test, ultimately finding it "all worth it." His support swimmer, Jessica Robson, swam alongside him at critical junctures, even guiding him back on course when he went the wrong way, making his record-breaking achievement possible.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla shares experienced a significant decline of over 7% in premarket trading after CEO Elon Musk announced his intention to form a new political party, the "America Party." This move has made investors nervous, with analysts like Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities stating it is the "opposite direction" shareholders desire for Tesla during this crucial period. Musk's past political involvement has been a point of contention, and his re-entry into the political arena exacerbates investor exhaustion. The company is also contending with a 14% year-on-year decline in car deliveries and increasing competition, particularly in China. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents bereavement leave for miscarriages occurring before 24 weeks of pregnancy. This significant change will provide a legal right to at least one week off work, addressing a long-standing gap where only sick leave was an option. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner emphasized the importance of allowing individuals time to grieve without pressure to return to work prematurely. Campaigners, including musician Myleene Klass, praised the move as a crucial step towards recognizing early pregnancy loss as a genuine bereavement, helping to break a societal taboo.</p>

          <p>European stocks' early 2025 outperformance against Wall Street has concluded, with the STOXX 600 now slightly trailing the S&P 500. This shift is attributed to factors like trade negotiations and robust US corporate earnings, particularly in the tech sector. Despite this, the euro has seen a significant 14% gain against the dollar year-to-date, indicating continued European strength in currency markets. Investors are weighing stretched US valuations against improving European earnings, suggesting a more reasonable valuation in Europe as its earnings per share begin to grow again.

However, the bloc faces challenges, with some member states and political groupings pushing back against ambitious emissions targets, citing economic burdens.

          <p>Erin Patterson, an Australian woman, has been found guilty of three counts of murder and one count of attempted murder in the high-profile "mushroom murder" trial. The jury determined she deliberately poisoned her lunch guests with death cap mushrooms hidden in a Beef Wellington. Her former parents-in-law, Don and Gail Patterson, and Gail’s sister Heather Wilkinson died, while Heather’s husband Ian survived. The prosecution argued Patterson had "calculated deceptions" and acquired the toxic fungi, rejecting her defense that it was a "terrible accident" and proving her criminal responsibility beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

          <p>A 14-member team of UK engineers has arrived in Thiruvananthapuram, India, to assess and repair a state-of-the-art British F-35B fighter jet that has been stranded at the airport for over three weeks. The $110 million stealth jet was diverted due to bad weather during a sortie and subsequently reported a technical snag, preventing its return to the HMS Prince of Wales carrier. Its prolonged presence has sparked public curiosity and jokes, with experts noting that if repairs are unsuccessful, the aircraft may need to be dismantled and transported by a larger cargo plane such as a C-17 Globemaster.</p>

          <p>The United States has lifted a ban on selling American jet engine parts and technology to Chinese buyers, a move expected to significantly boost production of China's home-grown C919 aircraft. This bilateral agreement allows the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) to import crucial components from a GE-invested joint venture. Analysts suggest this access is vital for Comac to fulfill existing orders and expand into foreign markets, though they caution that previous restrictions might still encourage Beijing to accelerate its development of indigenous aviation technology.

          <p>A federal bench trial has begun in Boston challenging the Trump administration's policy of arresting and deporting faculty and students involved in pro-Palestinian demonstrations. University associations argue the policy violates First Amendment rights and the Administrative Procedure Act, causing noncitizen students and faculty to self-censor. The government contends no such formal policy exists and that First Amendment protections differ in immigration contexts. The lawsuit highlights cases like Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Ozturk, who faced detention after their activism, underscoring concerns about immigration enforcement being used to suppress political speech.</p>

          <p>French police are increasingly employing aggressive tactics, including slashing inflatable boats, to deter migrants attempting to cross the English Channel to the UK. Videos show officers deflating vessels, sometimes pitching people into the surf, in a bid to prevent clandestine crossings. Despite these efforts, and a potential loosening of rules allowing police to intervene in deeper waters, migrants remain determined, citing the Channel as just another hardship in their arduous journeys. Over 20,000 people have made the crossing in the first half of this year, a 50% increase from 2024, highlighting the ongoing challenge.</p>

Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas on a US-sponsored 60-day ceasefire and hostage release proposal have resumed in Qatar, though key differences persist, particularly Hamas's demand for a permanent end to the war. The meeting also follows a US-Israeli offensive against Iranian nuclear sites, which analysts suggest may have created more favorable conditions for a peace agreement.

Her protest aims to pressure Buckinghamshire Council to divest its pension fund and banking from fossil fuel investments, which she believes contribute to climate destruction. A judge has granted a Final Charging Order on her property, allowing the council to potentially force a sale to recover the owed amount. McCarthy, who has incurable cancer, views her action as a matter of conscience for future generations and argues the process was aggressive and unfair.</p>

          <p>Global birth rates are reaching historic lows, with women worldwide having fewer than half as many children as in the 1960s, a trend significantly impacting the U.S. This shift is largely driven by increased economic independence and freedom for women, leading to different choices about parenthood. While some see environmental benefits, economists express concern over potential depopulation, workforce shortages, and the viability of social safety nets like Social Security. The article highlights a growing debate between those advocating for pronatalist policies and those who view such measures as harmful to women's reproductive rights and autonomy.</p>

          <p>Europe's housing crisis, characterized by soaring rents and unattainable homeownership, is becoming a significant political threat, fueling far-right movements and deepening inequality. The financial sector, particularly institutional investors, has increasingly dominated housing markets since 2008, viewing residential property as a lucrative asset class. This corporate capture drives up prices through practices like "renoviction" and under-maintenance, as their fiduciary duty is to maximize returns, not ensure affordability. Despite calls for reform and public protests, the immense power of real estate capital continues to undermine residents' security and access to adequate housing. (not investment advice)</p>
