          <p>The White House Office of Management and Budget has issued a memo directing federal agencies to prepare for potential mass firings if Congress fails to pass a funding deal. The directive targets agencies whose funding expires on October 1st and are not aligned with presidential priorities, escalating pressure on lawmakers. Unlike previous shutdowns where employees were furloughed, this memo suggests permanent reductions-in-force, a move Democrats have condemned as an intimidation tactic. The political standoff continues as the shutdown deadline approaches.</p>

          <p>With credit card debt rising for many Americans, this article explores the viability of debt relief options this fall. Despite a recent Federal Reserve rate cut, credit card APRs are expected to remain high, making it difficult for borrowers to reduce their balances. The article suggests that waiting for rates to drop is an ineffective strategy and highlights how daily compounding interest exacerbates the problem. It outlines various relief strategies, from debt consolidation to debt management plans, urging borrowers to assess their specific financial situations and take proactive steps.

          <p>A new report from The Wall Street Journal details the Trump administration's chaotic handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files, describing a series of "unforced errors" and high-level panic. The report claims President Trump was worried friends might be named in the documents and that the files could have been doctored to harm him. Tensions reportedly flared between Attorney General Pam Bondi and other officials, culminating in a controversial memo dropped over the July 4th weekend that aimed to close the case. The White House has dismissed the report as a "dead story."</p>

          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, is receiving pushback from many Labour MPs following suggestions he might challenge Prime Minister Keir Starmer for the party leadership. While Burnham claims some MPs have urged him to stand and has been critical of the government's direction, a BBC survey of Labour MPs reveals little appetite for a leadership change. Many view his maneuvering as self-indulgent and unhelpful, urging him to focus on his mayoral duties. This internal friction comes as Starmer's government faces other challenges, including recent high-profile resignations.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has halted certain cloud and AI services for Unit 8200, a division of the Israeli Ministry of Defense, after an internal investigation. The move follows a report by The Guardian alleging the unit built a system to track Palestinians' phone calls using Microsoft's Azure platform. The company's president, Brad Smith, stated that their review found evidence supporting the report's claims. This decision comes amid pressure from Microsoft employees protesting the use of their company's technology in the Gaza conflict and just after a UN commission accused Israel of genocide.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has issued a stark warning that senior Russian officials and sites within Russia could become military targets if the war does not end. Speaking in an interview with Axios, he noted that range restrictions on weapons supplied by allies have been lifted and that Ukraine possesses drones capable of traveling up to 3,000 kilometers. While threatening strategic sites, Zelenskyy insisted that Ukraine would not target civilians, contrasting his country's approach with Russia's attacks on civilian infrastructure. The comments signal a potential escalation in Ukraine's military strategy.</p>

          <p>Amazon has agreed to a $2.5 billion settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to resolve allegations that it tricked millions of customers into signing up for its Prime membership and made cancellation difficult. The settlement includes a $1 billion civil penalty and $1.5 billion for customer refunds. The FTC accused Amazon of using manipulative user-interface designs, known as "subscription traps," to enroll consumers without their full consent. As part of the deal, Amazon must also simplify its cancellation process and make subscription terms clearer to customers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the value of purchasing long-term care insurance, especially as the costs for services like nursing homes and in-home health aides continue to rise faster than inflation. With the median annual cost of a private nursing home room exceeding $120,000, many retirees' savings are at risk. The article clarifies that Medicare offers very limited coverage for long-term custodial care, creating a significant financial gap for the 70% of seniors expected to need it. It advises that securing a policy while younger and healthier is more cost-effective and increases the likelihood of being approved for coverage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to announce plans for a compulsory, UK-wide digital identity scheme, which the government believes will help combat illegal working and modernize access to state services. The proposal will be subject to a consultation to address its practical implementation, including how it will accommodate individuals without smartphones or passports. The idea marks a significant shift, as a previous Labour government's attempt to introduce ID cards was defeated. The plan is already facing criticism from opposition parties over concerns about civil liberties and government overreach.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled a £5 billion investment program called "Pride in Place" aimed at revitalizing 339 communities across the country. The funding is intended for local projects such as improving high streets, parks, and public spaces, with spending decisions to be made with community input. Additionally, the program will empower councils to block the opening of "unwanted" shops like betting and vape stores and acquire derelict properties for redevelopment. The initiative is seen as an effort by the Labour government to address concerns about local decline and bolster community pride.</p>

          <p>Denmark is grappling with how to respond after a series of drone sightings over multiple airports and military bases exposed vulnerabilities in its national security. The incidents, which occurred across the Jutland peninsula, forced airports to temporarily close and were spotted over sensitive military sites. Danish officials have described the events as a "systematic" and "hybrid attack" by a "professional actor," though they have not officially blamed Russia. The events have triggered a debate within the NATO member state about its defense readiness and how to counter such threats without endangering civilians.</p>

          <p>A branch of the National Archives has acknowledged it improperly released the mostly unredacted military service record of Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor. The file, containing her Social Security number, home addresses, and performance evaluations, was sent to a Republican operative allied with her opponent, Jack Ciattarelli. The National Personnel Records Center admitted a technician failed to follow standard procedures for a Freedom of Information Act request. The breach occurred as Sherrill's military record is being scrutinized during the campaign.</p>

These "Section 232" probes by the Department of Commerce could pave the way for new tariffs aimed at boosting domestic production of goods deemed critical. The move expands the administration's use of national security justifications for trade protectionism, which has previously been applied to steel, aluminum, and automobiles. The investigations could raise costs for U.S. manufacturers, hospitals, and consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Another deadly prison riot in Ecuador has resulted in the deaths of at least 10 inmates, with some being decapitated, in a facility in the coastal city of Esmeraldas. The violence is attributed to clashes between rival drug gangs, a recurring issue that has led to the massacre of around 500 prisoners since 2021. This incident occurred just days after a separate riot killed 13 inmates and a guard. Ecuador's prison system is notoriously violent and overcrowded, serving as a battleground for gangs linked to international cartels vying for control of drug trafficking routes.</p>

          <p>A cyber-criminal gang claims to have stolen highly sensitive personal data, including names, addresses, and pictures, of approximately 8,000 children from the Kido nursery chain. The hackers are using the stolen information to demand a ransom from the company, which operates nurseries in the UK, US, and India. The group has reportedly contacted some parents directly as part of its extortion tactics and has posted a sample of the data on the darknet. Cyber-security experts have condemned the targeting of young children as a particularly egregious and appalling act.</p>
