          <p>A historic funicular railway in Lisbon, Portugal, derailed and crashed, resulting in at least three deaths and twenty injuries. The incident, involving the well-known Gloria Funicular, occurred when a cable reportedly snapped, causing the car to lose control and collide with a building. Emergency services responded to the scene where several people were initially trapped, with two in serious condition. The Gloria Funicular, a major tourist attraction, has been in operation since 1885 and represents a significant part of the city's heritage.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt exceeding $1.21 trillion, consumers are increasingly turning to AI-powered tools for debt negotiation. These platforms offer automated services to lower interest rates or settle balances, often at a lower cost than traditional debt relief companies. While benefits include speed and convenience, potential downsides involve limited flexibility for complex cases, the risk of scams, and a lack of regulatory oversight. For individuals with significant or complicated debt, the human expertise and legal protections of established debt relief firms may still be the more prudent option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sports broadcaster and cervical cancer survivor Erin Andrews is promoting a new campaign called "Check for Cancer" to encourage routine screenings. Andrews shares her personal story of receiving a "shocking" diagnosis in 2017 despite having no symptoms, crediting a regular check-up with saving her life. In partnership with Aflac, the campaign aims to increase U.S. screening rates by 10% over the next decade, especially as cancer rates are rising among younger Americans. She emphasizes that early detection was crucial in her case, allowing for successful treatment after two surgeries.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated his administration is considering deploying National Guard troops to New Orleans, noting that Louisiana's Republican Governor, Jeff Landry, would welcome the assistance. This contrasts with the opposition from Democratic governors in other states like Illinois, where Trump has also suggested deploying troops to address crime. The president's comments highlight a shifting stance, suggesting he would wait for a governor's request while also maintaining he has the authority to act unilaterally. The discussion comes amid legal challenges to the president's use of military forces for domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Jasveen Sangha, dubbed the "Ketamine Queen," has pleaded guilty to five federal charges, including one count of distributing ketamine that resulted in the death of actor Matthew Perry. The plea agreement acknowledges her role in supplying the drugs that caused Perry's fatal overdose in October 2023. Sangha faces a maximum sentence of 65 years in prison, with four other individuals, including two physicians and Perry's assistant, also facing charges in the case.

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's young daughter, Kim Ju Ae, made her first known trip abroad, accompanying her father to Beijing for WWII commemoration events. Her prominent appearance is interpreted by analysts as a potential signal of her role in future succession plans, following a tradition where heirs are introduced to Chinese leadership. While her age and gender present challenges in the patriarchal North Korean society, her increasing presence at major events suggests she is being positioned for a significant future role. The visit also served as a political victory for Kim, reinforcing his alliance with China.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued an injunction preventing the Trump administration from using the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan nationals alleged to be part of a criminal gang. The court rejected the administration's claim that the gang's presence constituted a "predatory incursion," a condition required to invoke the wartime statute. Legal advocates praised the ruling as a victory for the rule of law and a check on executive power, marking the first federal appeals court decision on the matter. The law was last used during World War II for internment.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes whether a $25,000 deposit earns more in a certificate of deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account. While high-yield savings accounts currently offer slightly higher rates, their variable nature means returns could decrease with anticipated Fed rate cuts. In contrast, CDs offer a fixed rate, guaranteeing the return over the term. Calculations show that for most short-term periods, a high-yield savings account might earn slightly more, but the difference is minimal, making the guaranteed rate of a CD a potentially more secure choice for savers in a cooling rate environment.

Fox News dismissed the claims as an excuse for Newsmax's "competitive failures."

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, long-term studies of survivors reveal that many experienced "post-traumatic growth," a psychological phenomenon where individuals report positive personal changes following a traumatic event. Researchers found that despite suffering from high rates of PTSD and depression, a majority of survivors also reported feeling stronger, having a greater appreciation for life, and being more open to new possibilities. Factors that supported this growth included strong social support networks and a sense of self-efficacy. These findings offer important lessons for helping communities recover from future disasters.</p>

Mortgage rates are influenced by, but not directly tied to, the Fed's policy, and lenders often adjust their rates in anticipation of market changes. Historical precedent shows that rates can decline in the lead-up to a formal Fed announcement as the likelihood of a cut increases. Factors like the 10-year Treasury yield also play a significant role, meaning borrowers may see relief sooner than the Fed's meeting date. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared that Russia is prepared to achieve all its objectives in Ukraine through military means if a diplomatic agreement is not reached. Speaking in China, Putin mentioned seeing "a certain light at the end of the tunnel" for a potential deal but reiterated demands that Ukraine abandon NATO aspirations and that Russia would not relinquish seized territories. His comments come as Western allies, including the UK, reaffirm their commitment to providing military and economic support to Ukraine to strengthen its position in any potential negotiations.</p>

          <p>On his first public engagement of the autumn, King Charles shared a lighthearted moment with patients at a Birmingham hospital, joking about the challenges of getting older. When an 85-year-old patient said she was "wearing out," the King replied that he was discovering that "bits don't work so well when you get past 70." The visit, to officially open the Midland Metropolitan University Hospital, had been postponed from March due to the King's cancer treatment. He also spoke with a prostate cancer patient, empathizing with treatment delays and encouraging men to get checked.</p>

          <p>The massive illegal sports streaming site Streameast has been dismantled following an operation in Egypt by local law enforcement and the global anti-piracy group Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE). The network, which had over 1.6 billion visits in the last year, offered pirated access to major sporting events worldwide. Two men were arrested in the operation, which also uncovered a shell company allegedly used to launder millions in advertising revenue. The shutdown is being hailed as a major victory for sports leagues and entertainment companies in the fight against digital piracy.</p>

          <p>Despite CEO Tim Cook's successful efforts to navigate trade tensions and secure exemptions, analysts predict Apple may still raise the price of its upcoming iPhone 17 models. While the company has largely avoided the most severe tariffs by shifting supply chains and investing in U.S. manufacturing, it has still incurred hundreds of millions in tariff-related costs. Rising component prices could lead Apple to pass these costs to consumers. Potential price hikes could be subtle, such as eliminating lower-storage entry-level models to push customers toward more expensive options. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision in the landmark antitrust case permits the lucrative payments, estimated at $20 billion annually to Apple, to continue, though it bars exclusivity preconditions. This outcome not only secures a major revenue stream for Apple's Services division but also sets a precedent allowing Apple to forge similar paid partnerships with AI companies for services like its Siri assistant, potentially unlocking billions more in future revenue.

          <p>The number of federal student loan borrowers using forbearance to pause their payments has surged, rising from 2.9 million in 2024 to 10.3 million in the third quarter of 2025. This sharp increase is partly attributed to the repeal of the Biden administration's SAVE repayment plan; millions enrolled in that plan were placed in a forbearance that remains available, though now with accruing interest. The data suggests many borrowers are struggling financially, as deferments for economic hardship and unemployment have also risen. Experts warn that pausing payments can be costly as interest continues to accumulate.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive analysis of two decades of satellite data shows that humanity is rapidly depleting underground water reserves, causing vast areas of the planet to dry out. The study identifies immense "mega-drying" regions, driven by climate change and the over-pumping of groundwater from aquifers. Nearly three-fourths of the world's population live in countries that are losing water, with these losses now contributing more to sea-level rise than melting glaciers. Scientists warn this trend is leading to widespread aridification and threatens global food production, economic stability, and could fuel future conflicts.</p>

The author suggests both Farage and his American critics were using the hearing to score political points for their respective domestic audiences.
