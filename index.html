          <p>OpenAI has announced the launch of its new AI-powered web browser, ChatGPT Atlas, directly challenging Google's long-standing dominance in the search and browser market. Initially available for Apple's macOS, the company plans to expand access to Windows, iOS, and Android platforms in the near future. CEO Sam Altman described Atlas as a browser built around ChatGPT, enabling users to have conversational interactions with web pages. This move intensifies the competition in the AI space, pitting OpenAI's growing user base against Google's established Chrome browser, which has been integrating its own Gemini AI technology.</p>

          <p>Parisian prosecutors have valued the crown jewels stolen from the Louvre museum at approximately $102 million, excluding their immense historical significance. The investigation now involves around 100 investigators, with concerns that the gems might be disassembled and sold on the black market, destroying their heritage. Despite the high-profile nature of the heist, which involved thieves using a lift to access a window, France's culture minister has asserted that the museum's security systems functioned properly during the incident, though an administrative inquiry has been launched to ensure transparency.</p>

          <p>The forthcoming September consumer price index report is facing significant skepticism from some financial market observers due to the ongoing government shutdown. Concerns are being raised about the integrity and completeness of the data, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics is operating with reduced staff and has faced criticism over its collection methods. While economists anticipate a modest inflation rate, investors are cautious about the reliability of the figures, which are critical for Federal Reserve policy decisions. This report is one of the few economic data releases not suspended during the shutdown. (not investment advice)</p>

The new addition is intended to host large events and state visits for up to 999 guests and will feature bulletproof glass windows. The President assured that the new structure will pay respect to the existing historic building and will not directly interfere with it, despite the visible demolition work.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice is appealing a lower court's ruling that blocked the detention and removal of activist Mahmoud Khalil, arguing the decision was "fundamentally flawed." A DOJ lawyer contended that the district court lacked jurisdiction and that Khalil's case should have been handled exclusively by immigration courts. Khalil, a lawful permanent resident and a leader in campus protests against Israel, was deemed removable by the Trump administration over speech it considered a threat to national security. A federal judge had previously halted the deportation, citing violations of Khalil's First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has put forward a proposal to soften its landmark anti-deforestation law, which was designed to ban imports of products linked to deforestation, such as coffee, soy, and palm oil. The proposed changes, which still need approval, come after facing opposition from major trading partners who cited increased costs and paperwork for businesses. Key adjustments include moving the compliance deadline for large companies to the end of 2025 and limiting the requirement for deforestation statements to importers, rather than all entities in the supply chain, easing the burden on many businesses.</p>

          <p>The priceless crown jewels stolen from the Louvre were not privately insured, as French law prohibits national museums from insuring state property unless it is being loaned out. This means neither the museum nor the government will receive an insurance payout to cover the estimated $102 million loss from the recent heist. The responsibility for state-owned collections rests solely with the state itself, a policy that differs from private museums. This revelation adds a new dimension to the financial and cultural loss, as experts believe the jewels are unlikely to be recovered intact.</p>

GM now projects full-year adjusted earnings between $12 billion and $13 billion, signaling strong performance heading into the end of the year. However, the results were tempered by a $1.6 billion charge related to its pullback in electric vehicle production, which cut its net income by more than half compared to the previous year.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting its benchmark interest rate, financial advisors are recommending strategies for investors to adapt their portfolios. Some experts suggest locking in intermediate-range U.S. Treasury bonds to capture current higher yields while managing risk in a relatively strong but uncertain economy. For equities, maintaining a well-diversified portfolio across various asset classes is emphasized over chasing high-performing sectors, ensuring investors are positioned for unpredictable market shifts.

          <p>Dario Amodei, CEO of AI startup Anthropic, has publicly disputed claims from Trump administration AI czar David Sacks that his company promotes a "woke" agenda and engages in regulatory capture. Amodei stated that Anthropic is aligned with the administration on key AI policy goals, including maintaining America's lead in AI development and ensuring the technology benefits all citizens. The disagreement arose after Sacks criticized Anthropic for supporting a California AI safety bill and opposing a federal suspension of state-level AI laws, accusing the company of fear-mongering to stifle competition.</p>

          <p>In the wake of a high-profile jewel heist, France's culture minister and the Louvre museum have denied that security measures failed. Minister Rachida Dati asserted that the security apparatus "worked," despite thieves successfully stealing eight priceless pieces valued at an estimated $102 million. The museum also defended its display cases, stating they were a significant security upgrade over previous equipment. The statements come amid growing scrutiny of security at French cultural institutions and fears that the stolen historical gems could be quickly broken down and sold.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced that university tuition fees and maintenance loans will increase annually in line with inflation, beginning in 2026. This policy change, part of a new white paper on education, aims to address the financial difficulties faced by many universities after a decade of fee freezes. The plan also introduces new vocational qualifications called V-levels to simplify the post-GCSE education landscape. However, the move has been criticized by the University and College Union, which argues it reinforces a flawed funding model and increases student debt.</p>

          <p>The Dutch economy minister has engaged in discussions with his Chinese counterpart to resolve a standoff over the chipmaker Nexperia, but a solution remains elusive. The Dutch government seized control of the company from its Chinese owner, Wingtech, citing national security, prompting China to block exports of Nexperia's finished products. This has alarmed Germany's auto industry, which relies heavily on these chips and now warns of potential production stoppages if the supply interruption is not resolved quickly, adding to global trade tensions affecting European manufacturers.</p>

          <p>Recent economic analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis indicates that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are contributing to inflation, particularly for imported goods like furniture, electronics, and auto parts. The research found that companies passed approximately 35% of tariff costs on to consumers between May and July, with levies adding a measurable 0.5 percentage points to a key inflation gauge. While some businesses have absorbed the costs for now, economists expect prices to continue evolving as companies adjust to the new trade landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

While using hyperscalers like AWS and Microsoft Azure offers economic and security benefits, regulators and experts are increasingly concerned that this concentration stifles competition and creates single points of failure that can have widespread economic consequences.</p>

The agreement, signed with the British foreign minister, will allow for the transfer of Sandiford, now in her late 60s and seriously ill, back to the U.K. Sandiford was arrested in Bali in 2012 with cocaine valued at over $2 million, but she claimed she was coerced by a syndicate that threatened her son. This repatriation is part of a recent trend by Indonesia to release several high-profile foreign detainees.</p>
