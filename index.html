          <p>Elon Musk refuted a New York Times report alleging frequent ketamine use during the 2024 campaign, calling it false reporting and referencing the Times' past Russiagate coverage. This denial followed the Times' report citing unnamed sources claiming Musk used ketamine as often as once a day, affecting his bladder, and also used ecstasy and magic mushrooms at times. Musk stated he tried prescription ketamine a few years ago but hasn't taken it since. The article also details Musk's role in the Trump administration as overseer of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he aimed to cut federal spending, but also notes some errors in DOGE's calculations and criticisms of his approach. (not investment advice) The author's tone is neutral, providing a factual account of the events and statements. </p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a commercial truck carrying them overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. The incident prompted authorities to close the road and advise the public to avoid the area, especially those allergic to bee stings. Beekeepers worked to recover the hives and save as many bees as possible, with the goal of re-hiving them and reuniting them with their queen. The road was closed for about 24 hours during the rescue operation, and officials corrected the initial estimate of 250 million bees escaping, citing a beekeeper's assistance in providing a more accurate count.</p>

          <p>Eric Spofford, the former CEO of Granite Recovery Centers, was arrested for allegedly orchestrating a conspiracy to stalk journalists at New Hampshire Public Radio (NHPR). This action was reportedly in retaliation for an investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against him during his tenure as CEO. Spofford allegedly hired Eric Labarge to vandalize the journalists' homes, who in turn hired others to carry out the harassment campaign. The Department of Justice said Spofford devised the plan to harass the journalist, the journalist's immediate family members, as well as a senior editor in response and retaliation for the station's reporting.</p>

Attendees voiced concerns over proposed cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, leading to heated exchanges and shouts from the crowd. Ernst defended the bill, arguing that ineligible recipients would be removed from these programs, which led to a contentious exchange after someone shouted, "People are going to die." The proposed GOP budget package aims to provide tax cuts for the wealthy while slashing funding for social programs, facing pushback in the Senate due to concerns about its impact on the national debt and various fees.</p>

Recent surveys indicate that nearly half of Bulgarians oppose joining the eurozone, with disinformation campaigns stoking fears of economic hardship.
