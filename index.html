          <p>Former Las Vegas Raiders coach Jon Gruden has publicly stated his hope to return to coaching in the NFL. While visiting the Detroit Lions' training camp, he mentioned his desire for "one more shot" and that he is actively working towards a comeback.

          <p>Hurricane Iona has been upgraded to a Category 3 storm, with maximum sustained winds reaching 115 mph in the central Pacific Ocean. Located approximately 790 miles south-southeast of Honolulu, the hurricane does not currently pose a direct threat to the Hawaiian Islands, and no coastal warnings are in effect. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center anticipate the storm will continue moving westward and may strengthen further before beginning to weaken by Wednesday. This marks the first named storm of the season in the central Pacific.</p>

          <p>Procter & Gamble reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations. However, the company issued a cautious outlook for fiscal year 2026, forecasting a potential $1 billion negative impact on earnings due to tariffs, unfavorable commodity costs, and other economic headwinds. This guidance projects a 6% drag on core earnings per share growth.

          <p>A significant policy conflict is emerging within the Trump administration between the Department of Health and Human Services, led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and the Environmental Protection Agency. Kennedy's "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) movement aims to reduce public exposure to toxins like pesticides and "forever chemicals." However, the EPA, under administrator Lee Zeldin, has been actively dismantling regulations on these same substances. This article explores the contradiction, noting that Kennedy's supporters are growing impatient as his public health goals are directly undermined by the administration's broader deregulatory agenda.</p>

          <p>A Chinese state media report has indicated that a unit of the People's Liberation Army Air Force flew J-20 stealth fighters through the Tsushima Strait. This narrow and heavily monitored waterway separates Japan and South Korea. The transit of China's most advanced combat aircraft through this strategic chokepoint has not been publicly confirmed or reported by either Japanese or South Korean officials. The broadcast footage accompanying the report left little doubt that the J-20 aircraft was involved in the operation.</p>

          <p>North Korea has stated that the United States should abandon its long-standing demand for complete denuclearization if it wishes to resume diplomatic talks. In a statement attributed to Kim Yo Jong, the sister of leader Kim Jong Un, she asserted that while the personal relationship between her brother and President Trump is "not bad," Pyongyang will not consider giving up its nuclear arsenal. This position signals a hardening stance as the Trump administration expresses interest in restarting negotiations, suggesting that future talks would have to accept North Korea's status as a nuclear power.</p>

          <p>President Trump concluded a five-day trip to Scotland by officiating the opening of a new golf course bearing his name in Balmedie. The visit, which also included meetings with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and an agreement on a U.S.-EU trade framework, was largely focused on promoting his family's properties and playing golf. The new course, designed by his son Eric, is the third Trump-owned golf property in Scotland. The trip has been viewed by critics as another instance of the president using his office to promote his personal business brand.</p>

          <p>Economic experts are warning that President Trump's upcoming blanket tariffs, set to begin on August 1, could result in higher prices for certain imported foods. An analysis from the Tax Foundation notes that while the goal is to boost demand for American products, many items like Brazilian coffee or bananas are not produced domestically in sufficient quantities. U.S. consumers will likely bear the cost of these taxes on imports. The analysis identified several key food categories that could see significant price increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration's termination of federally funded medical research grants focused on LGBTQ+ health is a dangerous and scientifically unsound decision. The author notes that over $5.5 billion in funding for studies on issues from cancer to Alzheimer's in LGBTQ+ populations has been cut, with the justification that the research is "unscientific." The piece contends that excluding specific populations from research weakens evidence-based care for everyone and repeats historical mistakes that led to significant health disparities for other marginalized groups.</p>

          <p>Amid a growing shortage of skilled watch repair technicians in the U.S., Rolex has opened a new, free 18-month watchmaking school in Dallas. The program is designed to train students specifically to service Rolex timepieces, addressing a workforce crisis that has seen the number of watch and clock repairers decline significantly. This initiative comes as interest in mechanical watches is resurgent, yet only a few independent watchmaking schools remain in the country. Graduates of the Rolex program are in high demand, with most of the first class having already secured jobs.</p>

          <p>A political battle over congressional maps is brewing between California and Texas, potentially altering the balance of power in the U.S. House. After President Trump urged Texas to redraw its districts to favor Republicans, California Governor Gavin Newsom has threatened to retaliate by changing California's maps to create more Democratic seats. This move would require suspending the state's independent redistricting commission, a reform passed by voters in 2010 to prevent partisan gerrymandering. The high-stakes standoff highlights how the fight for congressional control is extending to the typically once-a-decade process of drawing district lines.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the political failure of Canada's consumer carbon pricing scheme, which was recently scrapped by the new Liberal government after a successful "axe the tax" campaign by conservatives. Former minister Catherine McKenna, an architect of the policy, reflects on the challenges, including the difficulty of communicating that the revenue was returned to citizens via rebates, making it revenue-neutral. The case highlights the political difficulty of implementing "stick"-based climate policies that directly affect consumer prices, even when designed to be equitable. It serves as a cautionary tale for governments.</p>
