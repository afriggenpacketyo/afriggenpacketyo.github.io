          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-29 21:54:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's official Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) registered at 49.8 in September, narrowly missing the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. While this marks the sixth consecutive month of contraction, the figure was stronger than August's reading and beat economists' expectations. The data suggests that Beijing's efforts to curb industrial overcapacity may be having a modest effect amid weak domestic demand and trade tensions. However, a private survey from RatingDog showed a more optimistic manufacturing PMI of 51.2, indicating expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Zijin Gold, the international mining unit of China's Zijin Mining, surged over 60% during their trading debut in Hong Kong. The company successfully raised approximately $3.2 billion, marking the world's second-largest initial public offering of the year. This strong performance comes as gold prices reach record highs, driven by global economic uncertainty and expectations of interest rate cuts. The successful listing contributes to a significant resurgence in Hong Kong's IPO market, which has seen a nearly 700% year-on-year increase in funds raised. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that establishing the United Nations' primary Asia headquarters in Hong Kong would benefit both the organization and China's global governance ambitions. The author suggests that despite having major hubs in Africa and Europe, the UN lacks a significant presence in Asia, which holds 60% of the world's population. Hong Kong's unique position with its common law system, use of English, and low corporate taxes makes it an ideal gateway to bring the world to China. This move could reinforce Beijing's leadership role and leverage the city's international engagement strengths.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has arrested Rigoberto Albizar-Martinez, a 58-year-old Cuban national residing in Tampa, for allegedly threatening to bomb the office of Rep.

A Department of Homeland Security official stated that the arrest is part of a broader effort to remove serious criminal offenders from the country.

          <p>The Taliban government has implemented a total internet blackout across Afghanistan, severing fibre-optic connections and disrupting mobile and satellite services. Internet watchdog Netblocks confirmed the nationwide shutdown, which the Taliban stated is intended to prevent "immorality" and will last until further notice. The move has isolated the country, with international news agencies losing contact with their Kabul offices and flights being disrupted. This action follows weeks of deteriorating internet access and represents a significant escalation of the Taliban's restrictions on communication and information since they seized power in 2021.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary suspension of the Trump administration's plan to eliminate 532 jobs at the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees Voice of America (VOA). The ruling by U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth prevents the job cuts from taking effect, preserving the agency's staffing levels until a final decision is made. The judge cited the administration's "concerning disrespect" for previous court orders aimed at restoring VOA's operations to its congressionally mandated levels.

However, significant challenges remain, including its distance from the city center and the lack of a direct metro link between the two airports, which could complicate passenger transfers. While the airport will alleviate immediate traffic issues, experts note that regulatory changes are also needed to achieve true international hub status.</p>

Sanford killed four people and injured eight others after driving his vehicle into the church and opening fire with an assault rifle. A White House official, citing the FBI, stated that Sanford "hated people of the Mormon faith." A local politician who had recently met Sanford confirmed his animosity toward the church, which he said stemmed from a past relationship with a member in Utah.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that Donald Trump's campaign of vengeance against his perceived enemies is proving to be a shortsighted strategy that may be backfiring. The article argues that his overt attempts to censor figures like Jimmy Kimmel and prosecute former FBI Director James Comey have inadvertently boosted their popularity and credibility. While the presidency offers powerful tools for intimidation, Trump's actions face resistance from corporate interests, the legal system, and public opinion. The author concludes that Trump's effort to turn his countercultural movement into a tool for state-sponsored submission is a frightening but likely unattainable ambition.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has reiterated his threat to levy a 100% tariff on all movies not made in the U.S., asserting that the American film industry has been "stolen" by other countries. He claimed the measure would solve a long-standing problem and particularly benefit California's economy. The threat has raised concerns in countries like Canada, whose film industry is deeply integrated with Hollywood productions, with officials warning it would drive up costs and jeopardize thousands of jobs. Investment analysts have questioned the feasibility of such a tariff, noting the complexities of defining a non-American film.</p>

          <p>The family of Cheryl Grimmer, a three-year-old who vanished from an Australian beach in 1970, has expressed frustration after a four-year police review of the case yielded no new leads. They are particularly critical of the New South Wales Police for failing to formally interview three potential eyewitnesses who came forward after a BBC podcast about the case aired. One witness claimed to have seen a teenage boy carrying a small child from the beach area on the day Cheryl disappeared. A retired detective who previously worked on the case called the failure to follow up on this credible testimony "sloppy police work."</p>

          <p>A detailed analysis of the new Gaza peace plan presented by President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu highlights the immense challenges to its implementation. While the plan includes provisions for hostage release, a staged Israeli withdrawal, and a temporary international governing body, it hinges on Hamas agreeing to disarm and renounce power, which is highly unlikely. Experts suggest Netanyahu may be backing the plan with the expectation that Hamas will reject it, thereby giving Israel justification to continue its military campaign with U.S. support. The plan's success ultimately depends on sustained diplomatic pressure from all sides.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors that a potential U.S. government shutdown is unlikely to have a major negative effect on the stock market, based on historical performance during previous shutdowns. He distinguished a shutdown from a more serious debt ceiling default, noting that the U.S. can still pay its bondholders. Cramer's primary concern is that a shutdown would delay the release of key economic data, which could complicate the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rate cuts. While acknowledging the financial harm to furloughed federal workers, he concluded that a data delay is not a sufficient reason for market panic. (not investment advice)</p>

Instead of focusing on volume, the ministry is prioritizing industrial optimization and value-added output. The initiative also calls for increased exploration for key resources like copper, lithium, and rare earths, as well as enhanced recycling from used batteries and solar panels.

The stated purpose is for Hegseth, a former TV host, to lecture the officers on the "warrior ethos," but the unusual and costly gathering has fueled speculation. Critics suggest it may be a "loyalty check" or a public display of authority from a secretary with limited military credibility.

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is exploring the concept of a stealthy, flying-wing "arsenal plane" designed to carry dozens of air-to-air missiles into combat. This aircraft would support crewed fighters like the F-22 and F-35 by providing a massive increase in available firepower, addressing a key limitation of current stealth jets. The concept is being studied as part of planning for a potential high-intensity conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific region. While a version of the B-21 Raider bomber could fill this role, the Air Force is also considering other, potentially more cost-effective platforms to achieve "affordable mass" in the air.</p>
