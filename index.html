          <p>The Port of Los Angeles processed a record-breaking number of containers in July, a surge attributed to companies frontloading imports to get ahead of tariff deadlines. This historic volume, the highest in the port's 117-year history, has since been followed by a slowdown in shipping activity. The decline in freight rates and reduced volumes signal a potential cooling in consumer demand and impact revenues for trucking and rail companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new forecast from the Senior Citizens League estimates that Social Security beneficiaries could receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026. This projection, based on recent inflation data, would be a slight increase from the 2.5% boost received in 2025. The official COLA is determined by the Social Security Administration in the fall, and some economists express concern that this adjustment may not be sufficient if inflation rises later in the year.

While both offer high, variable interest rates and greater flexibility than CDs, calculations show that a money market account could currently yield slightly more over time.

          <p>A new analysis of an ancient Incan khipu, a knotted cord record-keeping device, challenges the long-held belief that they were created exclusively by the ruling class. Researchers studied a khipu made of human hair and determined from its composition that its creator likely had a diet of a commoner, not an elite. This discovery suggests that literacy and record-keeping may have been more widespread throughout the Inca Empire than previously understood.</p>

Kohberger is housed in a secure unit with limited contact with other prisoners, but the taunts are allegedly yelled through cell vents.</p>

          <p>Premier League chief executive Richard Masters has stated there are no current plans to play official league matches outside of England. This comes as Spain's La Liga and Italy's Serie A are seeking permission to stage games in the United States and Australia. Masters noted that the league had considered an extra "39th game" abroad over a decade ago but that the idea is "not anywhere near my in-tray" at present, as the league has found other ways to grow internationally.</p>

          <p>For individuals struggling with high-interest credit card debt, negotiating directly with creditors is a potential alternative to hiring a debt relief company. However, this DIY approach requires significant preparation, persistence, and an understanding of debt collection laws to be successful. Consumers should also be aware of potential pitfalls, such as negative impacts on their credit score and possible tax consequences if a portion of the debt is forgiven, which can make professional assistance a safer option for some.</p>

          <p>The BBC has issued an apology after a contributor on its Radio 4 "Thought for the Day" segment accused shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick of "xenophobia." The contributor, Dr. Krish Kandiah, was referencing a newspaper article in which Jenrick expressed concern about his children living near certain migrants. The BBC stated that while the segment's theme was appropriate, some of the language used "went beyond that," and the episode was temporarily removed from its online service for editing.</p>

          <p>The political landscape shaped by Donald Trump is causing environmental groups to rethink their strategies and approaches. Historically, environmental protection saw bipartisan support, with Republican President Richard Nixon establishing the Environmental Protection Agency. However, the modern political climate has shifted this dynamic, forcing advocates to adapt their tactics to navigate a more polarized and business-focused environment in order to advance their conservation and anti-pollution goals.</p>

This trend coincides with the Trump administration resuming collection activities that were paused during the pandemic. Experts suggest the debt often stems from loans taken out for children's education or for returning to school later in life, and falling behind poses a significant financial risk for those approaching retirement.
