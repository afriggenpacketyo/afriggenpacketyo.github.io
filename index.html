          <p>Three federal prosecutors resigned after alleging they were pressured to admit wrongdoing to return to their jobs following the dismissal of the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The prosecutors, Celia Cohen, Andrew Rohrbach, and Derek Wikstrom, stated they would not falsely confess wrongdoing. The Justice Department ordered the case dropped due to Adams' potential assistance with the Trump administration's immigration agenda, leading to resignations and accusations of a 'quid pro quo'. Ultimately, the case was dismissed, with the judge noting no improper motives from the original prosecutors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA announced it will phase out Yellow 5 and other synthetic food dyes by the end of next year, prompted by concerns about their impact on children's behavior. This move follows growing pressure from health advocates and state-level bans, with Secretary of Health RFK Jr. calling sugar 'poison' and advocating for better food labeling. The FDA aims for a voluntary phase-out by food companies, who have expressed concerns about differing state laws, with Commissioner Marty Makary suggesting natural dyes as alternatives. While this is a major step, challenges remain in addressing other unhealthy ingredients like excess sugar and sodium.</p>

Daybell, representing herself, maintained her brother acted in self-defense, while the prosecution presented evidence of 'twisted' religious beliefs as motivation.

Despite this, Trump stated he intends to be 'very nice' to China and work together with President Xi Jinping.

Disputes range from prioritizing the fight against Trump's policies versus wooing disillusioned voters, to disagreements on generational leadership. Some Democrats, like Al Gore, are vocal about resisting Trump's actions, while others focus on winning back voters, potentially alienating their base. The infighting highlights a party in transition, searching for a new direction and a leader to unite its disparate factions.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a plan to restructure the State Department, potentially eliminating numerous offices and hundreds of positions. Rubio stated the department is 'bloated, bureaucratic' and driven by 'radical political ideology'. The plan aims to streamline the department and reduce its workforce, with proposed cuts impacting offices focused on energy resources, conflict stabilization, religious freedoms, women's issues, and global criminal justice. The restructuring comes amid broader cuts across the federal government and pressure to reduce the State Department's budget.</p>

He also suggests that the odds of all negative factors aligning are low, offering a reason for optimism. (not investment advice)</p>

Investors are urging Musk to dedicate more time to Tesla, citing concerns that his involvement with DOGE has alienated consumers and negatively impacted the company's performance. Musk announced plans to scale back his DOGE involvement, but will still spend one to two days a week on government issues. Analysts note that Tesla's stock price has fallen significantly, and the company faces increasing competition and tariff-related challenges.</p>

However, the International Monetary Fund cited the escalating trade war and 'high levels of policy uncertainty' as factors contributing to a reduced U.S. economic growth forecast.
