        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a tense Oval Office meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, President Trump claimed a "genocide" against white farmers was occurring in South Africa, a claim disputed by Ramaphosa, major South African political parties, and a South African court which ruled such claims as "not real". While farm murders are a problem in South Africa, with a high overall murder rate, statistics do not indicate these murders are race-driven, and South African crime statistics do not differentiate between the races of victims. The White House released a statement doubling down on the unfounded claims of genocide, pointing to articles from conservative media outlets as evidence. Trump's administration has also fast-tracked applications for Afrikaner refugees under an executive order addressing alleged actions against them.</p>

          <p>Digital physical therapy startup Hinge Health priced its IPO at $32 per share, the high end of its expected range, raising $273 million. The company, founded in 2014, will trade on the NYSE under the ticker "HNGE" and is valued at approximately $2.6 billion, down from its $6.2 billion private market valuation in 2021. Hinge Health uses software to remotely treat musculoskeletal injuries and chronic pain, reporting a 50% revenue increase in the first quarter, reaching $123.8 million, and a net income of $17.1 million, reversing a previous loss. This IPO is significant for the digital health sector, which has struggled since the post-COVID slowdown, and signals a potential resurgence in tech IPO activity.</p>

          <p>In a 4-4 ruling, the Supreme Court blocked Oklahoma from establishing the nation's first religious charter school funded by taxpayer dollars. Justice Amy Coney Barrett did not participate in the decision, resulting in the deadlock.

          <p>The House of Representatives passed a tax bill that includes raising the cap on the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000, up from the current $10,000 limit established by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This provision, effective in 2025, phases out for incomes over $500,000 and increases annually by 1% from 2026 through 2033. The revised text also reduces itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket. However, the House proposal faces potential challenges in the Senate, where its passage is uncertain due to possible opposition.</p>

          <p>A new tax bill includes a provision for "Trump Accounts," offering a tax incentive for early savings, similar to a 529 college savings plan. Earnings in these accounts grow tax-deferred, and qualified withdrawals are taxed at the long-term capital-gains rate. While similar to custodial brokerage accounts (UTMA/UGMA), Trump Accounts avoid the "kiddie tax" on investment income. Experts suggest that 529 plans remain superior for higher education savings due to federal tax-free growth and the ability to roll unused funds into a Roth IRA, providing more flexibility and higher contribution limits. </p>

          <p>Republican-backed legislation in the House does not include President Trump's suggestion to eliminate income taxes on Social Security benefits due to reconciliation process limitations. Instead, the bill proposes an extra $4,000 deduction for filers aged 65 and older, called an "enhanced deduction for seniors," available to both itemizers and those taking the standard deduction. This deduction is effective from 2025 but expires in 2029, with a full deduction for single filers earning $75,000 or less and married couples below $150,000, phased out above those amounts. Experts warn that eliminating taxes on Social Security could weaken the program's long-term stability, potentially leading to earlier depletion of trust funds and automatic benefit cuts.</p>

Investors on Wall Street reacted negatively, with major indexes falling due to concerns about increased federal deficits and weaker long-term fiscal health.

Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick criticized the plans as a "get out of jail free card for dangerous criminals."

          <p>A recent pause on the steepest tariffs on Chinese goods has led importers to increase orders from Asia, but not enough to eliminate the risk of retail shortages, according to a CNBC Supply Chain Survey. While the tariff reduction has provided some relief, retailers still face high import taxes, leading to fewer product selections and potentially higher prices for consumers. The survey indicates that most respondents are not seeing a full restart in holiday orders, and many remain concerned about available ocean freight space. Logistics executives anticipate a short-lived container increase but not a sustained surge, with expectations for a freight recession spread out over time. </p>

          <p>Emory Healthcare's Emory Hillandale Hospital will become the first U.S. hospital to operate using Apple products, including iPads, iPhones, Apple Watches, iMacs, and Mac minis, integrating with Epic Systems software. Emory executives cited user-friendliness, reduced IT support, cybersecurity advantages, and long-lasting hardware and battery life as reasons for the switch. The health system will closely monitor the devices to ensure they improve the quality of care. This decision was partially inspired by a major CrowdStrike outage that affected Emory last July, prompting the health system to seek more reliable alternatives.</p>

These claims have been amplified by Trump supporters, but facts show that the crosses were part of a temporary memorial for a murdered couple, and while South Africa has a high murder rate, there is no evidence of a "white genocide."</p>

          <p>Seniors face a complex decision on whether to invest in gold due to its high price, with potential benefits including portfolio protection during inflation and economic uncertainty. While gold can offer stability, it doesn't generate income like dividends or interest, which may not suit seniors needing regular cash flow. Alternative, lower-cost options include fractional gold investing and gold ETFs, allowing investment without owning physical gold. Experts recommend a small portfolio allocation of 4% to 9% to add protection during inflationary periods, emphasizing that gold should act as a diversifier and stabilizer rather than a core holding.

          <p>As Canada navigates a political transition and trade tensions with the U.S., Alberta is laying the groundwork for a referendum on seceding from Canada. The province, often called “Canada’s Texas,” seeks to renegotiate its relationship with the federal government, primarily to unshackle its oil industry from climate regulations. Premier Danielle Smith introduced a bill making it easier for citizens to trigger a referendum, while some Albertans express interest in joining the United States. The potential referendum is angering Indigenous people and creating challenges for Prime Minister Mark Carney.</p>
