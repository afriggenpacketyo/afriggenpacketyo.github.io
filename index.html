          <h2>Trump Plans Visit to Federal Reserve, Increasing Pressure on Chairman Powell</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 23:17:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant departure from presidential norms, Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve, marking the first such visit by a U.S. president in nearly two decades. This move is widely seen as an escalation of his public pressure campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell, whom Trump has consistently criticized for not lowering interest rates. By taking his grievances directly to the central bank's headquarters, the visit challenges the long-standing tradition of respecting the Federal Reserve's political independence, a cornerstone of its function in managing the nation's economy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has directed U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to offer unaccompanied migrant teenagers aged 14 and older the option to voluntarily return to their home countries. This policy, previously limited to minors from Mexico and Canada, alters the standard procedure of transferring them to Health and Human Services shelters. The change is enabled by new authorities in a recent spending law. While officials state this prioritizes returning children to their guardians, it upends long-standing protections for minors from noncontiguous countries designed to prevent trafficking and ensure their safety.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders met with Chinese officials in Beijing to mark the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties, even as relations are strained by significant disagreements. The EU has raised concerns over unfair market access, Chinese industrial subsidies, and its control over rare earth minerals. Despite these frictions and President Xi Jinping's absence from the initial summit plans, both sides are engaging in talks described by Brussels as a chance for frank discussion. Beijing, contending with an aggressive U.S. trade strategy, has positioned the relationship at a pivotal juncture, emphasizing partnership over rivalry.</p>

          <p>Columbia University will pay a $200 million settlement to the federal government to resolve investigations into alleged anti-discrimination law violations, specifically concerning antisemitism on campus. In return, the Trump administration will restore $400 million in federal research grants that had been withheld. While not admitting wrongdoing, Columbia acknowledged that reform was needed and has codified changes, including new protest rules and a ban on identity-concealing masks. President Trump praised the agreement, stating it also commits the university to ending DEI policies and admitting students based solely on merit.</p>

          <p>A rare violet sea snail, Janthina janthina, was discovered on a La Jolla Shores beach, a species not typically seen in the area for a decade. These pelagic snails, known for their striking purple shells and bubble rafts for flotation, usually inhabit warmer subtropical waters. An oceanography student from Scripps Institute of Oceanography found the specimens on a day when ocean temperatures were notably high. While a direct link to climate change is not confirmed, researchers suggest the sighting could be an indicator of warming offshore waters and are encouraging the public to report any further discoveries.</p>

          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the influential and unpredictable frontman of Black Sabbath, has died at the age of 76. This article reflects on his legacy, detailing how he and his bandmates from working-class Birmingham reacted against the "hippy-dippy" music of the late 1960s to invent heavy metal. Inspired by horror films, the band adopted the name Black Sabbath and developed a dark, powerful sound defined by Tony Iommi's detuned guitar riffs, a style born from a factory accident. Their music, though initially dismissed by critics, resonated with millions and established a genre that influenced countless rock bands for decades.</p>

The growth, which surpassed economists' expectations, was primarily driven by a strong 4.2% increase in exports, particularly in semiconductors and petroleum products. This export surge was partly fueled by firms expediting shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments.

          <h2>Trump Signs Executive Orders to Promote AI Dominance and Target 'Woke' Models</h2>

          <p>President Trump signed three executive orders as part of a new "AI Action Plan" aimed at cementing U.S. global dominance in artificial intelligence. One controversial order targets what the White House calls "woke Marxist lunacy," requiring AI companies with federal funding to maintain politically neutral models free from ideologies like DEI. Other orders focus on expediting permits for data center construction and promoting the export of American AI. The broader plan emphasizes deregulation to remove "red tape," a move that critics argue prioritizes corporate interests over public safety and environmental protection.</p>

          <p>The United States has finalized new trade agreements with Indonesia and the Philippines, a strategic move analysts believe is designed to indirectly counter China's influence. Under the deals, imports from the two Southeast Asian nations will face a 19% tariff, while U.S. exports to them will be duty-free. The policy aims to reshape regional supply chains and provide access to critical resources like rare earth minerals. However, some experts note that Chinese companies are already a step ahead, having increasingly localized their production within these countries, making them less reliant on simple transshipments.</p>

          <p>A vegetation fire, dubbed the Euclid fire, broke out in Chino Hills, California, and quickly grew to 120 acres, forcing the closure of the 71 Freeway in both directions. The blaze was reported in the afternoon near the freeway and Euclid Avenue and jumped across the highway as it spread. Firefighters worked to establish a perimeter to contain the fire, which was pushing towards the Prado Dam area. As of early evening, the fire's forward spread had been stopped and no evacuation orders had been issued, though Cal Fire had initially estimated it could grow to 500 acres.</p>

          <p>A new study from Common Sense Media has found that a majority of teenagers are using AI companions, with many interacting with them daily for advice, problem-solving, and emotional support. While some teens use chatbots for mundane questions, a significant number report having conversations that are as or more satisfying than talking with human friends. Researchers and teens themselves express concern that this trend could redefine human relationships, hinder the development of real-world social skills, and exacerbate youth loneliness. Experts worry that relying on AI that constantly validates users may leave them unprepared for genuine social interactions.</p>

          <p>Six months into President Trump's second term, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is on track for its highest number of annual deportations in over a decade. Internal figures show nearly 150,000 deportations in the first half of the year, projecting a total over 300,000, the most since the Obama administration in 2014. This increase reflects the administration's aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration, though the number still falls far short of the one million annual deportations targeted by some officials.

          <p>While the U.S. housing market is still favoring sellers, there are early signs of a shift that may provide some relief for homebuyers. According to real estate company Redfin, the number of sellers nationally exceeded buyers in May at the highest rate since 2013, indicating rising inventory. However, home prices continue to hit record highs, driven by a lack of incentive for current homeowners with low interest rates to sell. Experts advise prospective buyers to consider homes that have been on the market longer or to look for properties that need work in desirable neighborhoods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of the Trump administration's new "AI Action Plan" reveals a strategy heavily focused on deregulation and deference to the private sector to achieve U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence. The plan, shaped by input from major tech firms like OpenAI and Google, proposes stripping away environmental and state-level regulations to accelerate the construction of data centers and energy infrastructure. It also promotes a "try-first" culture for AI adoption across government and industry, including the military. This approach bets heavily on Silicon Valley to drive innovation, potentially at the cost of public oversight and risk management.</p>
