          <p>President Trump met with Republican members of the Senate Finance Committee to rally support for the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which includes extending the 2017 tax cuts and increasing spending on military and border security. The bill faces opposition from some Republican senators concerned about its potential to increase the deficit by $2.4 trillion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Trump is attempting to sway senators who have expressed doubts, while Elon Musk has publicly criticized the bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination." Lawmakers aim to send the bill to Trump by the Fourth of July. </p>

          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that President Trump's proposed budget bill would increase the national deficit by $2.4 trillion over the next decade and leave 10.9 million more Americans without health insurance by 2034.

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to require American medical schools to include nutrition courses in their curriculum or risk losing federal funding. Kennedy argues that aspiring physicians are primarily taught to treat illnesses with drugs rather than focusing on preventative care through nutrition. Some nutrition experts have expressed optimism about the proposal, citing the need for doctors to address diet-driven conditions like obesity and diabetes. However, some medical schools claim they already offer sufficient nutrition education, but a 2015 study indicated that medical students spend an average of only 19 hours on required nutrition education during their four years of school. </p>

No other country will provide a harbor to these loyal allies of America, who risked everything for the war effort, but now the family has no prospect of escaping the trap they’re in. Saman's story is a part of the suffering caused by the regime and the author argues that the pain in Saman’s fingers might seem too trivial to mention, but sometimes one small drama can illuminate a large evil. The author then discusses Elon Musk and J. D. Vance's indifference to the ordeal of Saman and her family, arguing that their philosophies require so much inventing of perverse principles to reach a cruel end that the pain of others begins to seem like the first priority rather than the inadvertent result. </p>
