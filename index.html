        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has issued a formal apology for the widespread fraud and human rights abuses within the country's past foreign adoption programs. This comes after a truth commission's report found the government responsible for allowing programs that falsified records and separated children from their birth families, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, as a method to reduce welfare costs. The official acknowledgment coincides with South Korea's ratification of the Hague Adoption Convention, aimed at better safeguarding future international adoptions.</p>

          <p>PIMCO President Christian Stracke has highlighted growing risks in the corporate direct lending market, noting an increase in borrowers deferring interest payments. He contrasted this with the healthier state of asset-based financing, such as mortgages and auto loans, where consumer balance sheets remain strong. Stracke explained that while private debt offers easier renegotiation terms for struggling corporate borrowers, it comes at a higher cost compared to more liquid public markets, creating a difficult trade-off for companies.

          <p>Donald Trump Jr. has dismissed concerns that his crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, presents a conflict of interest with his father's administration. Speaking at a conference in Singapore, he called the idea that investors could gain favor with President Trump by using the platform "complete nonsense." The company, which launched a dollar-pegged stablecoin called USD1, has financial ties to a Trump-affiliated firm, prompting calls from Democratic lawmakers for an investigation into what they label an "unprecedented conflict" that could influence crypto policy.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to increase the time refugees must wait before applying for permanent settlement, extending the current five-year period. Additionally, a route that allowed refugees to automatically bring close relatives to the UK will be permanently scrapped. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that settlement will now have to be "earned" by contributing to the country, aligning the rules for refugees with those for other migrants. Critics, including the Refugee Council, argue these changes will not deter arrivals but may push more people toward smugglers.</p>

          <p>Dozens of hand-sewn American flags intended for Donald Trump's recent state visit to the UK had to be replaced at an estimated public cost of £52,800. A government supplier claimed the US embassy objected to the standard shade of red, requesting a brighter "cherry red" instead. This resulted in the Stars and Stripes having a more vibrant red than the adjacent Union flags. The incident highlights the meticulous, and costly, diplomatic preparations undertaken to accommodate the US President during his unprecedented second state visit to the United Kingdom.</p>

          <p>BYD, China's leading electric vehicle manufacturer, recorded its first year-on-year sales decline of 2025, with September deliveries falling nearly 6% to 393,060 units. This drop reinforces concerns about a market slowdown and follows reports that the company cut its annual sales target amid intense domestic price competition. In contrast, several smaller EV startups, including Leapmotor and Xpeng, reported record-high monthly deliveries, buoyed by new, cheaper models and government incentives. Despite the decline, BYD continues to dominate the market, accounting for over half of all EV sales in September. (not investment advice)</p>

Pfister warned that as a non-NATO member, Switzerland is vulnerable to threats like cyber attacks and drone incursions, making reliable cooperation with other armed forces essential for national security.

          <p>The industrial town of Vithalapur in India's Gujarat state is transforming to cater to a growing population of Japanese automotive engineers and managers. Driven by investment from companies like Honda and Suzuki, local hotels now offer Japanese cuisine, signage, and amenities like high-tech toilets to provide a sense of home. This cultural adaptation is crucial in a state known for its strict vegetarianism and alcohol prohibition, which initially posed significant challenges for the expatriates. The town's development reflects a broader trend of increased foreign manufacturing investment in India.</p>

          <p>The US federal government shutdown poses an immediate threat to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which serves nearly 7 million people. Unlike programs like Social Security, WIC's funding could be exhausted within weeks, potentially forcing states to either cover the costs or turn away eligible families, including nearly half of all infants born in the country. While the larger SNAP food aid program is funded for October, food banks are bracing for increased demand from those affected by the shutdown.</p>

The flight data gathered during the test, which reached an altitude of 1,200 meters, will be used to verify the airship's performance in low-altitude scenarios and adapt it for a wider range of applications. According to state media, the tests are a crucial step toward deploying the airship for missions including emergency rescue, aerial surveillance, and other specialized flight support operations in the future.</p>

According to state media, security forces opened fire in self-defense after a group of people armed with knives allegedly attempted to storm and set fire to a police station. The demonstrations, organized by youth networks on social media, began with demands for better education and healthcare, criticizing the government for prioritizing spending on the 2030 World Cup over essential public services amid high youth unemployment.</p>

          <p>An explosion in the boiler room of a 20-story public housing building in the Bronx, New York, caused a partial collapse of the structure on Wednesday morning. The blast, which occurred as the heating system was being activated for the season, tore away an entire corner of the building, sending a ventilation shaft and debris crashing to the ground. Miraculously, no injuries were reported among the residents of the Mitchel Houses complex. Officials have evacuated 38 apartments as a precaution while engineers conduct inspections to ensure the building's structural integrity.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's net worth has surpassed $500 billion, making him the first person to ever reach this milestone, according to the Forbes billionaires index. The increase was driven by a recovery in Tesla's stock price and rising valuations for his other ventures, including the AI startup xAI and rocket company SpaceX. Despite a slow start to the year for Tesla, investor confidence grew as Musk refocused on his businesses, boosting his wealth which is heavily tied to his significant stake in the electric vehicle company.

          <p>The US government and law enforcement agencies have condemned mobile apps that allow users to track the locations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, claiming they endanger officers. However, legal experts suggest that banning these US-based apps would be difficult due to First Amendment protections, comparing them to publicly accessible police radio scanners. Despite criticism and accusations that the apps facilitate attacks, developers argue they are a tool to keep communities safe, and the information could be shared on other platforms even if the apps were banned.</p>
