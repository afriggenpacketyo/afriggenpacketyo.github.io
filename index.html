          <p>David Marcus argues that President Trump's border security measures have significantly reduced illegal immigration and the flow of fentanyl, thereby saving American lives. He contrasts the current border situation with the previous administration, noting a drastic decrease in illegal migrant releases and border encounters. Marcus claims that Trump's policies have effectively closed the border and ended the catch-and-release system, leading to fewer overdose deaths. While acknowledging the reliance of some industries on illegal labor, he asserts that the ongoing deportations deter illegal immigration.

The cyclist is alleged to have recorded and transmitted coordinates of sensitive military and nuclear sites. The arrest reportedly occurred in the northwestern province of Markazi, near the Arak nuclear facility, and the individual has since been held in Tehran's Evin prison, known for housing foreign and political prisoners.

          <p>Despite publicly opposing Israel's attacks on Iran, Jordan shot down Iranian missiles and drones crossing its airspace, and Saudi Arabia likely allowed Israel to use its airspace for defense.

Saudi Arabia's actions reflect a delicate balancing act, as it depends on the US for security while also navigating domestic tensions stemming from historical antipathy towards Israel among its population.

          <p>As Israel's attacks on Iran continue, speculation rises about the possibility of regime change in Tehran, but historical examples suggest such interventions often lead to disastrous consequences. Foreign-imposed regime change violates international law, lacks democratic legitimacy, and can result in power vacuums, violence, and instability, as seen in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya. Experts doubt the feasibility of externally driven regime change in Iran, emphasizing the need for ground forces and local support, neither of which are currently present.

          <p>As a heatwave approaches, experts say that US sunscreens are often less effective than those available in other countries, particularly in protecting against UVA rays. Regulatory differences are cited as a primary reason, with the FDA's lengthy approval process hindering the introduction of new UV-filtering ingredients. While American sunscreens are effective at blocking UVB rays, they often lag behind in UVA protection compared to products in Europe and South Korea. A bipartisan bill in Congress aims to modernize sunscreen regulations, but dermatologists still stress the importance of wearing sunscreen properly.

          <p>Easy returns on Amazon create significant problems for small businesses due to rising returns fraud, leading to customers receiving used products and some sellers exiting the Fulfillment by Amazon program. In response, Amazon introduced a new fee for items exceeding certain return rate thresholds, which has led to a decrease in return rates but also potentially to rising prices. Some sellers have implemented measures like installing camera systems to track returns and filing appeals against fraudulent claims. One founder left FBA after a customer received a product with someone else's bodily fluids inside, prioritizing customer safety over profit. (not investment advice)</p>
