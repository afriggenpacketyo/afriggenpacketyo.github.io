          <h2>Increased Government Spending on Pay and Benefits Drives Borrowing Higher</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official figures indicate that UK government borrowing exceeded expectations due to increased spending on pay and benefits, with borrowing reaching £151.9bn in the year to March, a £20.7bn increase from the previous year. This is significantly higher than the official forecast of £137.3bn. The figures are released as Chancellor Rachel Reeves prepares for IMF and World Bank meetings amidst ongoing trade tensions with the US, including tariffs that have led the IMF to downgrade the UK's economic growth forecast. Economists suggest that spending cuts and tax rises may be necessary to meet borrowing rules. Optimism score: 60</p>

          <p>A recent report indicates that coral bleaching is affecting 84% of the world's coral reefs, marking the highest level ever recorded, as oceans warm due to human-induced climate change. The current crisis is more intense than the 2014-17 event, with scientists attributing the widespread bleaching to rising ocean temperatures caused by the burning of fossil fuels. Scientists warn that at 1.5C of warming, 70% to 90% of coral reefs could disappear, and at 2 C, almost all corals would vanish, impacting human livelihoods and biodiversity. The best solution is to reduce human emissions by reducing the burning of fossil fuels. Optimism score: 10</p>
