            <h2>Coroner Calls for Mandatory Eye Tests for Older Drivers After Fatal Accidents</h2>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A coroner's inquest into the deaths of four individuals killed by drivers with impaired vision has led to a call for stricter eyesight regulations for motorists. The coroner, Dr. James Adeley, has labeled the current self-reporting system as "ineffective and unsafe", noting that the UK is among the few European countries without mandatory visual checks for drivers. The inquests revealed that the drivers involved in the fatal incidents had significant vision problems that were either undeclared or ignored, highlighting a critical flaw in the licensing process. Dr. Adeley's report urges the Transport Secretary to take immediate action to prevent future deaths, emphasizing the need for compulsory eye tests, especially for older drivers, to ensure road safety.</p>

            <p>US Senator Chris Van Hollen met with Kilmar Ábrego García, a Maryland resident mistakenly deported to El Salvador, despite a federal judge's order for his return. The meeting occurred amidst a legal dispute between the Trump administration and the courts over the deportation, with the White House accusing Ábrego García of gang affiliation, which his lawyer denies. El Salvador's President Bukele stated that Ábrego García would remain in the country's custody. Van Hollen's visit aimed to secure Ábrego García's release and followed a court ruling against the Trump administration, potentially leading to depositions of government officials regarding the deportation.</p>

            <p>Former US President Donald Trump indicated that Buckingham Palace is planning a second state visit to the UK for him in September, following an invitation from King Charles. This would be Trump's second state visit, a rare honor typically not extended to second-term presidents, who are usually invited for less formal meetings. The King's invitation included a proposal to discuss the visit's details in Scotland, where Trump has business interests and family ties. However, due to ongoing renovations at Buckingham Palace, any visit would likely be hosted at Windsor Castle.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is focusing on Panama and Greenland to revitalize the Monroe Doctrine, aiming to exclude outside powers, particularly China, from the Western Hemisphere. This strategy involves securing vital trade and military logistics routes like the Panama Canal and establishing forward bases in strategic locations such as Greenland. The administration views these efforts as crucial for protecting the U.S. and its neighbors from China's growing military and economic influence. The focus on forward bases is seen as a way to defend the homeland and secure shipping lanes critical for global trade and military logistics.</p>

            <p>Climate change is not merely a problem of physics but a crisis of justice, shaped by inequality and colonial structures, argues a climate scientist. Extreme weather events disproportionately affect vulnerable populations due to factors like poverty, lack of infrastructure, and historical injustices. The focus on climate change as a physical problem often conceals the social and political factors that exacerbate its impact, diverting attention from poor local decision-making and planning. Addressing climate change requires transforming social structures and power dynamics, not just energy sources, to address the root causes of inequality and injustice.</p>

            <p>Mexico's governing party, Morena, has achieved significant electoral success by focusing on socioeconomic justice and inequality, offering lessons for the global left. Led by Andrés Manuel López Obrador and now Claudia Sheinbaum, Morena has implemented policies such as doubling the minimum wage and expanding social programs. However, the party has also adopted some right-leaning positions, including fiscal austerity, cracking down on migrants, and avoiding stances on gay marriage and abortion. While Morena's success stems from addressing inequality, its model also involves elements of populism and compromises that may not align with all progressive values.</p>

            <p>This week was dominated by news surrounding President Trump's administration, including the ongoing controversy over the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador and the implications of Trump's tariffs on the economy. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that the tariffs are likely to lead to higher prices, creating a dilemma for the Fed. Additionally, concerns were raised about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s views on vaccines and autism as he assumes the role of Health and Human Services Secretary. The week also saw escalating tensions between the administration and the courts over deportation policies.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is significantly reducing the scope of the State Department's annual reports on international human rights, removing critiques of abuses such as harsh prison conditions, government corruption, and restrictions on political participation. The revised reports will no longer condemn governments for denying freedom of movement, peaceful assembly, or holding political prisoners without due process. These changes aim to align the reports with current U.S. policy and recent executive orders, but human rights defenders argue that they represent an American retreat from its role as a global human rights watchdog. Categories like violence against LGBTQ people, restrictions to internet freedom, and gender-based violence will also be removed.</p>

However, concerns are growing about the future of democracy and the role of Islam in the new regime. While many exiles have returned to help rebuild the country, questions remain about the concentration of power and the inclusion of diverse political and social forces.

            <p>The NHL's current playoff format, implemented in 2014, is facing criticism for creating predictable matchups and diminishing the excitement of the postseason. The format, which prioritizes divisional rivalries, has led to recurring first-round series, such as the LA Kings facing the Edmonton Oilers for the fourth consecutive year. Some suggest that a change to the regular-season points system could help alleviate the issue by incentivizing teams to win more games in regulation and shifting the overall standings. Despite the criticism, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman has defended the current format.</p>

            <p>This article discusses the prevalence of gambling companies as shirt sponsors in the Premier League and the reasons behind it. Globalisation and advances in technology have played a role in shifting the dynamic of modern sponsorships, with companies aiming for wider influence rather than just cash from fans. Companies in countries with booming economies in the early 90s that have now weakened, such as Japan, have become less common shirt sponsors, while newer money in modern financial strongholds such as the Middle East is being spent on sponsorship deals.</p>

            <p>Asian-Pacific markets traded mixed amid thin trading due to Good Friday holidays, with Japan's Nikkei 225 rising after the country's inflation grew 3.6% year-on-year in March. South Korea's Kospi also saw gains, while China's CSI traded flat. South Korean and Japanese shipping stocks rose after the U.S. imposed fees on ships built in China.

            <p>The earthquake in Myanmar last month may have disrupted production of critical minerals that are normally sold to China. The 7.7-magnitude quake could have damaged mining equipment, affected mine safety, and blocked transport routes in Myanmar, which is China’s largest foreign supplier of rare earth elements. China imported 44,000 tonnes of rare earth elements from Myanmar last year, which accounted for 57 per cent of its total imports, according to Zhang’s calculations.</p>

Trump said the administration is looking at the tax-exempt status of Harvard, environmental groups, and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). The Trump administration has issued orders against the law firms that had cases or attorneys perceived to be against him, and it has made demands of the universities over their rules around campus activism.</p>

            <p>China missed several key targets from its 10-year plan to become self-sufficient in technology, while fostering unhealthy industrial competition which worsened global trade tensions, the European Chamber of Commerce in China said in a report this week. When Beijing released its "Made in China 2025" plan in 2015, it was met with significant international criticism for promoting Chinese business at the expense of their foreign counterparts. Since releasing the plan, China has exceeded its targets on achieving domestic dominance in autos, but the country has not yet reached its targets in aerospace, high-end robots and the growth rate of manufacturing value-added, the business chamber said, citing its research and discussions with members.</p>

            <p>America’s only rare earths mine has experienced increased interest from anxious companies after China responded to President Donald Trump’s tariffs by limiting exports of those minerals. The trade war between the world's two biggest economies could lead to a critical shortage of rare earth elements if China maintains its export controls long-term or expands them to seek an advantage in any trade negotiations. The California mine can’t meet all of the U.S. demand for rare earths, which is why Trump is trying to clear the way for new mines.</p>
