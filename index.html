        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has cautioned Elon Musk that funding Democratic candidates against Republicans who supported Trump's tax bill could lead to "serious consequences." This warning follows Musk's criticism of Trump's tax bill, which Musk called an "abomination," and suggestions that Musk might support Democratic opponents of Republicans who backed the bill. The two had previously been close allies, with Musk serving as a special advisor on cost-cutting initiatives until recently, but their relationship has deteriorated amidst social media arguments, including Musk's now-deleted allegations about Trump's involvement in the Jeffrey Epstein case. Trump dismissed Musk's claims as "old news" and stated he has no intention of speaking to Musk. Optimism that the relationship can be repaired is low, as both figures have publicly traded barbs.</p>

Martin Jarmond, UCLA's athletic director, discussed the department's operations in the new college sports world created by the House settlement agreement with the NCAA. Payments will rise each year as part of the 10-year settlement agreement, and UCLA will reevaluate this arrangement in a year to ensure it was best serving the school’s athletes.</p>

          <p>Opposition activists from Kenya allege they were detained and tortured in Tanzania, raising concerns about cross-border human rights solidarity. Kenyan President William Ruto's gesture of asking for forgiveness from Tanzania followed the imprisonment and alleged torture of Kenyan activist Boniface Mwangi and Ugandan activist Agather Atuhaire, who were supporting Tanzanian opposition leader Tundu Lissu. The Tanzanian government denies the accusations of torture. The situation highlights tensions within the East African Community regarding political opposition and human rights.</p>
