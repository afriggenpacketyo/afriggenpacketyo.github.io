          <p>Philadelphia Eagles players, including Jordan Mailata and A.J. Brown, have downplayed the importance of the 'tush push' play as the NFL considers a ban. The play has become the Eagles' calling card, but players suggest they can adapt if it's outlawed. Coach Nick Sirianni stated he is aware of the vote and will adjust accordingly. Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie has previously described the tush push as a "precision play" and credited quarterback Jalen Hurts for its success.</p>

          <p>A federal judge expressed concern that the Trump administration may have violated a court order by deporting migrants to South Sudan, a country facing conflict and instability. Judge Brian Murphy stated he may hold officials in contempt if they violated his order, which requires migrants to have due process before deportation to countries other than their own. The judge ordered the administration to maintain custody of the migrants, including individuals from Myanmar and Vietnam, and ensure their return if the deportation is found unlawful. The judge acknowledged the Department of Homeland Security could keep the migrants on the tarmac or even turn the plane around to comply with the order.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio faced strong criticism from his former Senate Democratic colleagues during a hearing on the State Department budget, where they accused him of betraying his principles by supporting President Trump's policies, including cuts to foreign aid. Rubio defended the administration's approach, asserting that the U.S. would continue foreign aid work deemed vital to its interests and that the cuts did not create an opening for China. He contested claims that the cuts to foreign aid created an opening for Beijing, and stated the U.S. would still provide more foreign aid than the next ten countries combined. The contentious hearing highlighted deep divisions over the administration's foreign policy direction.</p>

          <p>Japan's export growth has slowed for the second consecutive month, impacted by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. The country's exports of transport equipment to the U.S. fell by 4.1%, with automobiles being Japan's top export. The slowdown is expected to negatively impact Japan's GDP growth in the second quarter, leading analysts to anticipate a delay in the central bank's next interest rate hike. Despite ongoing trade talks, a full return to pre-Trump trade terms appears unlikely, posing challenges for Japanese manufacturers. (not investment advice)</p>

This approach could confine Russia to economic challenges, limiting access to Western sanctions relief and foreign investment.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans for the "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, aiming to expand the country's air defense system by the end of his term. The project, a priority since Trump took office, seeks to protect against foreign attacks, similar to Israelâ€™s Iron Dome. While Trump estimates the cost at $175 billion, the Congressional Budget Office projects a higher figure. The Golden Dome is intended to intercept missiles launched from anywhere, including space, but experts cite logistical and financial hurdles. (not investment advice)</p>
