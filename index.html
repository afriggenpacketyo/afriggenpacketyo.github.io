          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its diabetes drug, Mounjaro, demonstrated significant health benefits in a large-scale, five-year clinical trial. The study compared Mounjaro to Trulicity, an older drug, showing it reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events and offered superior kidney protection and a lower rate of death from any cause. While the results did not exceed some analyst expectations for superiority, the company believes the data solidifies Mounjaro's position as a first-choice treatment for Type 2 diabetes patients, particularly those with cardiovascular disease. The findings are expected to be submitted to regulators, potentially expanding insurance coverage by 2026.</p>

          <p>CVS Health reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street estimates, leading the company to raise its adjusted profit outlook for the fiscal year. The positive results were driven by strong performance in its retail pharmacy segment and improvements within its Aetna insurance unit, which has been managing increased medical costs. CEO David Joyner highlighted investments in pharmacy technology and a new prescription pricing model as key factors in the company's success. Despite these strengths, the health services segment saw a decline, and the company is continuing a multi-year cost-cutting plan (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A new report has found that the UK's National Health Service (NHS) failed to listen to a mother's concerns before the death of her five-year-old son, Yusuf Nazir, from a lung infection. The boy was sent home from a hospital emergency department and died eight days later. The investigation identified 13 missed opportunities to escalate his care, highlighting a systemic failure to prioritize parental insight over clinical metrics. Yusuf's family is demanding a full inquest and accountability, while the Health Secretary acknowledged the tragic failings and called for the implementation of the report's recommendations to prevent future incidents.</p>

          <p>Following a series of deadly Russian airstrikes on civilian targets that killed at least eight people, including a child, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has issued some of his strongest calls to action yet. Speaking in Helsinki, he urged the international community to confiscate, not just freeze, Russian assets to fund peace and reconstruction efforts. Zelenskyy also suggested that a change of regime in Moscow is necessary to ensure long-term stability, arguing that the current Russian leadership is "mentally stuck in another century." The attacks, involving rockets and drones, were described as "showcase killings" by the Ukrainian government.</p>

The recognition is contingent upon the Palestinian Authority implementing democratic reforms and holding elections without the participation of Hamas. The move, prompted by the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza and expanding Israeli settlements, was criticized by Israel as a "reward for Hamas." This decision marks a departure from Canada's long-standing policy of linking statehood to a negotiated peace process.</p>

          <p>Over 50 Palestinians were killed and more than 400 were injured after Israeli forces reportedly fired on crowds gathered for food aid near the Zikim crossing in northern Gaza. According to Gaza's Civil Defence agency and hospital officials, the incident occurred as people waited for aid lorries amid a severe, man-made famine. The Israeli military stated its troops fired "warning shots" in response to a perceived threat but was not aware of casualties from its fire. The event highlights the desperate humanitarian situation and the dangers surrounding aid distribution in the war-torn territory.</p>

          <p>An Indian court has acquitted Pragya Singh Thakur, a Hindu nationalist nun and former member of parliament, along with six other individuals, in a deadly 2008 bombing case. The attack, which occurred near a mosque in Malegaon, killed six people and injured over 100. The judge ruled that the prosecution failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove the charges of terrorism and criminal conspiracy, despite arguments that Thakur's motorcycle was used to carry the explosives.

          <p>A significant shift in public opinion shows that Democratic voters are increasingly sympathetic towards Palestinians, creating a major disconnect with the party's establishment, which has largely maintained strong support for Israel. Recent polling indicates 60 percent of Democrats sympathize more with Palestinians, a dramatic reversal from just a few years ago. Despite this grassroots change, driven by Israel's actions in Gaza, Democratic leaders in Congress have continued to approve military aid and have been slow to criticize Israeli policy. This gap is attributed to the powerful influence of pro-Israel lobbying groups like AIPAC and long-standing political inertia within the party.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a series of new tariffs on goods from key trading partners, arguing they protect American jobs and manufacturing by reducing the U.S. trade deficit. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, which can lead to higher prices for consumers as companies pass on the costs. The administration has used these taxes as a negotiating tool to secure more favorable trade deals, such as recent agreements with the UK and the EU. However, the policy has created volatility in the global economy and faces legal challenges in U.S. courts (not investment advice).</p>

Overall, ICE arrests have increased by 120% compared to the same period last year under the previous administration.

          <p>The new sequel to "The Naked Gun" is being hailed as a successful career move for star Liam Neeson, allowing him to pivot from a string of repetitive action roles to self-aware comedy. In the film, Neeson plays Frank Drebin Jr., son of the original character immortalized by Leslie Nielsen, and successfully captures the deadpan, slapstick spirit of the franchise. Directed by Akiva Schaffer, the movie cleverly updates the classic formula of visual gags, wordplay, and pratfalls for a modern audience while avoiding punching down. The review praises the film for its smart humor and Neeson's surprisingly daffy and reinvigorated performance.</p>

          <h2>'Japanese Walking' Fitness Trend Goes Viral, but Health Experts Urge Caution</h2>

          <p>A fitness trend known as "Japanese walking," which involves alternating between fast and slow-paced walking for 30 minutes, has gained massive popularity on social media platforms like TikTok. The routine is based on a 2007 Japanese study suggesting that high-intensity interval walking can improve blood pressure and aerobic capacity more efficiently than a continuous stroll. While the trend's accessibility is praised for encouraging movement, health experts are skeptical, pointing to flaws in the original study and the lack of robust evidence to support its superior benefits. They caution against over-hyping the trend and advise consulting a doctor before starting any new vigorous exercise routine.</p>

          <h2>Contributor Argues Trump's Plan to Withhold Appropriated Funds is Illegal and Irresponsible</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece argues that the Trump administration's plans to withhold or "rescind" funds already appropriated by Congress is both illegal and irresponsible. The author contends that this move sidesteps Congress and echoes the actions of President Nixon, which were unanimously found unlawful by the Supreme Court. The piece highlights that these cuts, such as those to foreign aid and public broadcasting, have severe real-world consequences and do little to address the massive deficit created by tax cuts. The author calls for a return to good-faith negotiations on spending rather than what they describe as capricious and chaotic impoundments.</p>

          <p>Authorities and family members are continuing their search for Whisper Owen and her 8-month-old baby, Sandra McCarty, who disappeared more than two weeks ago after a doctor's appointment in Fresno, California. Owen was driving home to Sacramento in her silver Chevrolet Trailblazer, which was last detected by a license plate reader in Atwater. Her family is deeply concerned, noting that Owen has other children and would not have run off, and they fear she may have experienced a medical emergency while driving. The Fresno Police Department is leading the investigation but has reported no new developments or evidence of foul play.</p>

          <p>In a significant break from the Republican party line, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has publicly used the word "genocide" to describe Israel's actions and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Her comments, made on social media, acknowledged the horror of the October 7th attacks but equated it with the "starvation happening in Gaza," where dozens of children have died from malnutrition. This shift in rhetoric from a prominent MAGA figure coincides with growing global outrage over the famine. Greene's statement deviates sharply from her party's traditional unconditional support for Israel and her own past criticisms of pro-Palestinian lawmakers.</p>

          <p>After a recent deadly shooting, the gunman's claim that he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) due to playing high school football has intensified questions about the sport's risks for young athletes. While CTE can only be diagnosed post-mortem, experts confirm that the risk is correlated with the number of seasons played, and it is possible for high school players to develop the disease. The incident highlights the ongoing debate over youth tackle football, with states like California implementing rules to limit full-contact practices. Researchers stress the need for more study on the long-term neurological impacts of head injuries on the millions of non-professional players.</p>

          <p>The number of new homes completed in England declined by 8% in the first year of the new Labour government, continuing a downward trend from the previous administration. Data from Energy Performance Certificates shows 201,000 new homes were registered in the year to June 2025. However, there are signs of a potential future rebound, as planning applications for new homes outside London rose by 49% in the first half of the year. The government stated it inherited a deep housing crisis but remains committed to its target of building 1.5 million homes over the next five years.</p>

          <p>Florida is scheduled to execute Edward Zakrzewski, a man convicted of the 1994 machete slayings of his wife and two young children, marking a new state record for the most executions in a single year. This will be the ninth execution in Florida in 2025, surpassing the previous high of eight in 2014, with two more scheduled for August. Opponents of the execution have highlighted Zakrzewski's military service and the non-unanimous 7-5 jury recommendation for his death sentence, which would not be permissible under current Florida law. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected his final appeal for a stay.</p>

          <p>Shares of Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer, fell by as much as 11% after the company reported a surprising 1.9% decline in second-quarter volumes. The drop was significantly worse than analysts had forecast and was primarily driven by weak performance in China and Brazil. Despite the falling volumes, the maker of Budweiser and Corona saw its operating profit and revenue increase, as consumers paid higher prices for its beer products. The results highlight a divergence in the beverage sector and weigh on the company's otherwise strong stock performance this year (not investment advice).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of 43 peers, including some of the UK's most distinguished lawyers, has warned the government that unilaterally recognizing a Palestinian state could violate international law. In a letter to the attorney general, they argue that Palestine does not meet the established legal criteria for statehood under the 1933 Montevideo Convention, citing a lack of defined borders and a single effective government. This intervention follows Prime Minister Keir Starmer's announcement that the UK would move toward recognition unless Israel meets several conditions, a policy that has already drawn significant political and international criticism.</p>
