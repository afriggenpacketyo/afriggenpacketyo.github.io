          <p>China's Commerce Ministry conveyed that it is evaluating the United States' offer regarding tariff negotiations, while emphasizing the need for the U.S. to demonstrate sincerity and avoid unilateral actions. The ministry stated that any dialogue would be futile if the U.S. does not rectify its unilateral tariff measures, which have damaged mutual trust. High tariffs have been imposed by both countries, with the US levying up to 145% on Chinese products and China retaliating with 125% tariffs on imports from the US. The ministry insisted that coercion and blackmail tactics would not work, as China vows to never kneel down to tariff pressure.</p>

Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that these laws are ideologically motivated and impede the production of affordable, reliable energy.

          <p>Amazon reported slower revenue growth in its North American retail business, contributing to overall financial results that indicate the slowest sales growth since the pandemic's peak. The company's first-quarter sales increased by 9% to $155.7 billion, with profits up 64% to $17.1 billion. Amazon anticipates sales of $159 billion to $164 billion for the current quarter, with operating profits potentially shrinking to $13 billion. CEO Andy Jassy noted that the company is focused on managing prices in response to tariff and trade policies, purchasing extra inventory, and assisting sellers on Amazon's marketplace.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court to allow the removal of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan immigrants. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem terminated an 18-month extension granted by the Biden administration, leading to a lawsuit alleging procedural violations and racial bias. A federal judge blocked the administration's efforts, citing irreparable harm to affected individuals and the U.S. economy. The administration argues that the law creating TPS bars judicial review of executive branch decisions regarding the program.</p>
