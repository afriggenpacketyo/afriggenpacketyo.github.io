          <p>The consumer price index increased by 0.1% in May, bringing the annual inflation rate to 2.4%, which is below economists' expectations. Core CPI, excluding food and energy, also came in lower than forecast, raising concerns among Federal Reserve officials about the impact of tariffs on inflation. Weakness in energy and services prices offset some increases, while vehicle and apparel prices declined, despite expectations of tariff-related increases. This report comes as the Trump administration continues trade negotiations and has imposed tariffs on U.S. imports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Florida man, Eugene Strickland, is suing Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, claiming he sustained "permanent catastrophic injuries" on a water park slide at Blizzard Beach in 2021. Strickland alleges he was dislodged from his inner tube on the Downhill Double Dipper due to the ride's speed, resulting in serious bodily injury, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life. He claims Disney failed to warn him of dangerous conditions on the ride, and is seeking $50,000 in damages and a jury trial.

          <p>A 21-year-old Austrian man opened fire at a secondary school in Graz, Austria, killing nine students and one teacher before taking his own life. Twelve others were injured in the attack, which is the deadliest mass shooting in Austria's recent history, prompting the country to declare three days of mourning. Police are investigating the shooter's motive, and have found a "farewell letter" and a non-functional pipe bomb at his home. The shooter was a former student who did not graduate from the school and legally owned the weapons used in the attack.</p>

          <p>The author discusses the stark contrast between the AI concerns in the Bay Area and Washington, D.C., focusing on the potential for AI-driven job losses and the implications of the budget reconciliation bill. The bill's proposed moratorium on state-level AI regulation and cuts to clean energy subsidies are criticized for potentially exacerbating AI's negative impacts. The addition of work requirements to programs like Medicaid and food stamps is seen as cruel in a world where AI could automate a significant share of human labor. The author calls for more attention to the societal implications of AI.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk expressed regret for some of his social media posts about President Trump, following a public dispute over the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." The feud had dissolved a close partnership that propelled Musk to spearhead the budget-slashing Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk's opposition to the bill, which he claimed "undermines" the work of DOGE and increases the U.S. budget deficit, sparked the conflict. Trump had previously indicated that there would be consequences for Musk if he supported Democratic candidates challenging the bill.</p>

          <p>North Korea refused to accept a letter from U.S. President Trump to leader Kim Jong Un, according to a report citing a high-level source. Trump drafted the letter to Kim with the aim of resuming bilateral talks, which have been suspended for over five years. The United States attempted to deliver the letter multiple times through North Korean diplomats stationed at the U.N. headquarters in New York, but they "bluntly" refused. The timing of the attempted delivery remains unclear, highlighting ongoing tensions between the two nations.</p>

Zuckerberg is frustrated with Meta's position in AI compared to rivals like OpenAI and is looking to Wang to improve the company's execution. As part of the deal, Meta will take a 49% stake in Scale AI, and Wang will help lead a new AI research lab at Meta. The move reflects Zuckerberg's belief that a prominent outsider is needed to enhance Meta's AI capabilities and address increasing competition from China.</p>

The South Korean military said the halt is aimed at helping "restore trust in inter-Korean relations and achieving peace on the Korean Peninsula."

The article suggests that the current interest in this music may be more related to millennials aging and asserting their cultural preferences than to actual economic trends.
