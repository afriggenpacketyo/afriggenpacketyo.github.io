          <p>A growing number of American retirees are choosing to live overseas, drawn by a lower cost of living and a sense of adventure that a domestic retirement may not offer. This trend is highlighted as part of a broader look at modern retirement strategies. For example, the Mediterranean island of Gozo in Malta has become a popular destination for ex-pats seeking a different lifestyle. Organizations like International Living are providing resources and guidance for this expanding demographic, which is increasingly looking beyond U.S. borders to make their retirement funds go further while embracing new cultural experiences.</p>

          <p>A 3.0 magnitude earthquake occurred in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, with tremors felt up to 65 miles away, including in New York City and Connecticut. This event marks the second quake in the state in under two weeks, following a series of smaller tremors in Morris Plains. Officials reported no immediate structural damage but warned of potential aftershocks, advising residents to be vigilant. The article provides context by mentioning the active Ramapo Fault line and comparing this minor event to the more significant 4.8 magnitude quake that struck the region in April 2024, which was felt by millions.</p>

          <p>The Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) movement is inspiring a growing number of people to pursue extreme frugality and aggressive saving to leave the workforce decades ahead of schedule. Proponents like Peter Adeney, known as Mr. Money Mustache, advocate for a lifestyle of mindful consumption, suggesting individuals can achieve financial freedom by saving and investing 25 times their annual expenses. The philosophy, rooted in the 1992 book "Your Money or Your Life," emphasizes redefining one's relationship with money to prioritize life experiences over material possessions. The article profiles a couple who retired in their forties, illustrating the practical application and benefits of the movement.</p>

The National Park Service, which is investigating the incident, used the tragedy to issue a public reminder about the dangers of wildlife on Alaskan roads, especially during dawn, dusk, and nighttime. Officials urged drivers to reduce speed in low-light conditions and be vigilant for large animals.</p>

          <p>In a commentary, writer Rebecca Solnit argues that the media and public's focus on individual high-profile sexual abuse cases, such as those involving Jeffrey Epstein and Sean Combs, obscures the larger, systemic issue of violence against women. The article posits that treating these incidents as shocking aberrations prevents recognition of a pervasive pattern of misogyny that enables such abuse at all levels of society. Solnit contends that this violence is a constant, global pandemic intended to maintain female subordination, and calls for a broader societal conversation and systemic change rather than focusing solely on prosecuting individual perpetrators.</p>

          <p>Decades after David Berkowitz's reign of terror, survivors Robert Violante and Carl Denaro are sharing their stories of the attacks that changed their lives forever. Violante, who was on his first date with Stacy Moskowitz when they were shot, was blinded in the attack, while Moskowitz was killed. Denaro was shot in the head but survived, though his planned military career was derailed. Both men recall the city-wide fear during the 1976-77 murder spree and the complex mix of emotions they felt upon Berkowitz's capture, reflecting on the permanent physical and psychological scars left by the violence.</p>

          <p>Shayna Glassman, whose late father was a neighbor of and was harassed by David Berkowitz, maintains a correspondence and visitation relationship with the convicted "Son of Sam" killer. Her father, Craig Glassman, was a volunteer deputy sheriff who suspected Berkowitz and helped police identify him before his arrest. Shayna, who was only four when her father died, says she initiated contact with Berkowitz as a way to connect with her father's story and legacy. She describes their relationship as non-romantic but psychologically deep, acknowledging that she would have been his prime target during his 1970s crime spree.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners at a condominium in DeKalb County, Georgia, have taken legal action after their homeowners association (HOA) allegedly shut off water to nearly 50 units. The dispute began when residents were told to pay $1,600 for new water meter installations, a cost many could not afford. Despite lacking legal authority, the HOA's utility contractor proceeded with the shut-offs, affecting residents with serious medical needs and families with children. A judge has since issued a temporary restraining order to restore the water, but residents are pursuing the court process to find a permanent resolution.</p>

          <p>Frustration over officiating in the WNBA has reached a boiling point, with prominent players like Kelsey Plum and Angel Reese, along with coaches, publicly criticizing what they see as inconsistent and unreliable calls. Players argue the lack of consistency is not only frustrating but also dangerous, potentially contributing to injuries. In response, league officials, including head of referee development Monty McCutchen, have expressed overall satisfaction with their referees' performance while acknowledging some high-profile errors. They point to a robust internal review process, though the league's part-time referee structure and lack of a centralized replay center are noted as significant challenges.</p>

          <p>In a prison interview marking 40 years since his arrest, convicted serial killer David Berkowitz discussed the 1976-77 shooting spree that terrorized New York City. Now a born-again Christian, Berkowitz expressed remorse for his actions, which he attributed to being possessed by demonic forces, stating he was "walking in darkness." He claimed to take responsibility for the six murders and seven injuries but also hinted that others were involved in a satanic cult, a claim investigators have long dismissed. Berkowitz, serving six life sentences, said he despises the "Son of Sam" moniker and now focuses on ministering to other inmates.</p>

          <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has drawn criticism from environmental groups for replacing a clean energy advocate on the state's powerful public services commission with an appointee seen as an industry ally. The decision not to renew the term of board member Alessandra Carreon, who had pushed for public transparency and opposed rate hikes, was allegedly made under pressure from utility giants DTE Energy and Consumers Energy. Activists fear the new appointment could slow Michigan's clean energy transition and lead to higher consumer bills, particularly as the commission weighs major rate increases and long-term infrastructure plans.</p>

          <p>A senior humanitarian aid official provides a harrowing first-person account of the crisis in Gaza, describing it as a place with "conditions created to kill." The official details the systematic obstruction of aid delivery by Israeli forces, the daily violence against civilians, and the collapse of the health system, including uncovering mass graves at hospitals. The author argues that these are the results of deliberate political choices and accuses Israeli authorities of attempting to silence humanitarian workers and journalists who report on the devastating reality.

          <p>As major donors like the United States and the United Kingdom reduce their foreign aid budgets, a few countries, including Spain, Ireland, and South Korea, are bucking the trend by increasing their development spending. Spain, which received bailout funds a decade ago, has passed a law to more than double its aid budget by 2030, aiming to fill part of the void left by the dismantling of USAID. This shift could reshape global development, moving away from a paternalistic model dominated by a few wealthy nations toward a more collaborative approach, though the increased pledges are not yet enough to cover the massive funding gap.</p>
