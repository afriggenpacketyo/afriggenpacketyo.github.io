          <p>Miki Sudo has won the women's division of the 2025 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, consuming 33 hot dogs in ten minutes to claim her 11th title. The annual Fourth of July event in Coney Island, New York, also features the men's competition, where Joey Chestnut is attempting a comeback after being banned last year. Sudo, who holds the women's world record of 51 hot dogs set in 2024, secured a decisive victory despite falling short of her personal best. The event continues to be a major cultural spectacle, drawing large crowds and national attention.</p>

          <p>Mexican boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Los Angeles for overstaying his visa and allegedly providing false statements on a green card application. The arrest occurred just days after his high-profile fight against Jake Paul. Authorities state he will be deported to Mexico, where he faces charges related to organized crime and arms trafficking. Chávez Jr. has a history of legal and personal issues, including a prior DUI conviction and a pending gun charge from earlier this year.</p>

          <p>Germany has committed to a significant increase in defense spending to modernize its armed forces, the Bundeswehr, in response to geopolitical shifts. While the arms industry, like manufacturer Rheinmetall, is experiencing a major boom, economists are debating the broader economic benefits. A study by the University of Mannheim suggests that military spending provides a moderate economic stimulus, with a lower return on investment compared to infrastructure or education. The article explores concerns that increased defense expenditure might primarily boost corporate profits rather than generating substantial overall economic growth for the nation.

          <p>Heavy rainfall has caused a "catastrophic flooding event" in central Texas, leading to disaster declarations in several counties, including Kerr and Gillespie. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood emergency after over a foot of rain fell in a few hours, causing rivers like the Guadalupe to surge to record levels. Authorities have confirmed fatalities, and extensive water rescues and evacuations are underway. Residents have been urged to shelter in place and avoid travel as the extreme weather has washed out roads and created life-threatening conditions.</p>

          <p>Cape Verde is celebrating its 50th anniversary of independence, reflecting on five decades of remarkable progress, particularly in health and education. Since 1975, the nation has drastically reduced illiteracy from 65% to about 3% and significantly improved its healthcare system, resulting in one of Africa's highest life expectancies. Despite these achievements, the country still faces challenges such as youth unemployment and migration. However, Cape Verde is now recognized as one of the most stable and developed nations on the continent, a testament to its resilience and strategic development.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a phone conversation described as "good" and "useful," following a massive Russian air attack on Kyiv and a U.S. halt on military aid. Zelenskyy stated they discussed Ukraine's air defense needs, joint defense production, and potential for increased aerial protection. The call took place after Trump expressed disappointment with a recent conversation with Vladimir Putin, stating he made no progress toward ending the war. It remains unclear if the discussion will lead to a resumption of the paused U.S. aid shipments.</p>

          <p>President Trump expressed his disappointment following a phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating he "didn't make any progress with him at all" on ending the war in Ukraine. The call, which the Kremlin noted lasted nearly an hour, occurred shortly after the White House announced a pause on some U.S. weapons shipments to Kyiv. Trump has voiced growing frustration with the lack of a ceasefire, a key ambition of his administration. The failed diplomatic effort underscores the deep divisions and ongoing challenges in resolving the protracted conflict between Russia and Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has confirmed that "discussions are ongoing" to form a new left-wing political party, following an announcement by ex-Labour MP Zarah Sultana that she was co-founding the new venture with him. Corbyn, who now sits as an independent MP, praised Sultana's "principled decision" and stated the new party would offer a "real alternative" to the current political system. This move signals a potential realignment on the British left, as some MPs and voters express disillusionment with the current Labour government's policies, particularly on welfare and the conflict in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Following the passage of President Trump's massive tax and policy bill, both Republican and Democratic parties are now focused on controlling the public narrative. Republicans are highlighting the $4.5 trillion in tax breaks, increased defense spending, and border security funding as promises kept. In contrast, Democrats are seizing on estimates from the Congressional Budget Office that the bill will add trillions to the deficit and could cause millions to lose health coverage and food benefits. The opposing messaging campaigns set the stage for a major political battle heading into the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>One of Sweden's most wanted criminals, identified by media as 35-year-old Ismail Abdo, has been arrested in Turkey. Abdo is the alleged head of the Rumba crime organization and is suspected of orchestrating drug trafficking and violent crimes in Sweden from abroad. His arrest is the result of long-term collaboration between Swedish and Turkish authorities. The development is a significant step in Sweden's struggle to combat organized crime, which has led to a surge in shootings and bombings and has seen criminal networks increasingly run by leaders based in other countries.</p>

Bukele posted photos and videos of Ábrego García to counter claims from his lawyers that he suffered severe beatings, sleep deprivation, and malnutrition. The case has drawn scrutiny to a U.S. deal to pay El Salvador to incarcerate suspected gang members.

          <p>Researchers have discovered evidence of a 125,000-year-old "fat factory" operated by Neanderthals at a site in Germany. Analysis of bone fragments and tools suggests these ancient humans systematically processed animal carcasses on a large scale to extract nutritious fat from bones. They likely smashed the bones and boiled them to render the fat, a crucial energy source that would have prevented protein poisoning from a lean-meat diet. This finding provides new insights into the organizational skills, planning, and nutritional understanding of Neanderthals, further challenging outdated notions of them as primitive beings.</p>

Musk argues that the country needs an alternative to the "Democrat-Republican uniparty" to give voters a real voice. However, establishing a new national party is a formidable and expensive task, involving navigating a complex web of 50 different state ballot-access laws, which are often designed to favor the two major parties. The process would likely require years of effort and hundreds of millions of dollars in spending and litigation.</p>
