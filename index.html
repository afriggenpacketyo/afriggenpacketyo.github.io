          <p>Pop artist Charli XCX has officially married George Daniel, the drummer for the band The 1975, confirming widespread online speculation. The news broke after a passer-by filmed the couple posing for photos at Hackney Town Hall in London. Charli XCX later verified the marriage through social media posts, celebrating the occasion with her new husband. The couple, who have been together for several years and collaborated on music, including her recent hit album "Brat," had an intimate ceremony.</p>

          <h2>Milwaukee Brewers Defeat Los Angeles Dodgers Despite Late Offensive Surge</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' offensive struggles continued as they lost 8-7 to the Milwaukee Brewers, marking their ninth loss in the last eleven games. Despite a seven-run performance that included back-to-back home runs in the eighth inning, the Dodgers' pitching and defense could not contain the Brewers. Key moments of offensive promise, such as a three-RBI day for Shohei Ohtani, were ultimately undermined by an inability to score in crucial situations. The loss guarantees another series defeat for the Dodgers against a team that has consistently bested them this season.</p>

          <p>Deadly sectarian clashes in southern Syria's Suweida province have continued, with over 900 reported deaths in the past week, despite a ceasefire announcement from the country's interim president. The violence between Druze fighters and Bedouin gunmen has drawn international concern, with the US calling for an end to the "slaughter of innocent people." Syrian government forces, deployed to quell the fighting, have been accused of participating in attacks on the Druze community. Israel has also intervened with airstrikes against government targets in Damascus to protect the Druze population.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly lowered the number of people considered missing from recent floods, from nearly 100 down to just three. This reduction follows intensive follow-up work by local and state agencies who verified that most individuals initially reported missing were safe. The devastating floods, which occurred around July 4, resulted in a statewide death toll of 134, with 107 of those fatalities in Kerr County. The update provides a measure of relief amid the ongoing recovery efforts from the natural disaster.</p>

          <p>Recent congressional cuts of $1.1 billion in federal funding for public media are severely impacting small, rural radio stations that provide essential local news and information. Allegheny Mountain Radio in West Virginia, for example, relies on the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) for up to 65% of its budget and now faces an uncertain future. These stations serve as a vital link in communities with limited internet and phone access, offering everything from local news to emergency alerts. The cuts, aimed at networks like NPR over perceived bias, are ironically hitting communities that heavily supported the administration pushing for them.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the relentless and brutal nature of modern conflicts in places like Gaza, Ukraine, and Syria stems from a deeper crisis than just politics: a global collapse of a shared moral framework. The author posits that without universally accepted ethical standards, atrocities become justifiable to some, and peacemaking becomes nearly impossible. The piece critiques the rise of moral relativism, exemplified by political figures and public indifference in various nations, which allows for the continued terrorizing of civilians. It concludes by calling for a recommitment to universal ethical principles as the only viable path toward lasting peace.</p>

          <p>A man deliberately drove his car into a crowd of people waiting outside a nightclub in Los Angeles early Saturday, injuring 30 individuals, with at least seven in critical condition. Police identified the driver as 29-year-old Fernando Ramirez, who allegedly made a U-turn before ramming the crowd. Following the crash, bystanders pulled Ramirez from the vehicle and attacked him; he was also shot by an unidentified suspect who then fled the scene. The incident, which occurred outside the Vermont Hollywood club, is being investigated as an assault with a deadly weapon.</p>

Prosecutors argued she shot her sleeping husband twice in the head in a deliberate execution. After an initial trial ended in a hung jury, a second jury found her guilty, leading to a sentence of 40 years to life in prison.</p>

Investigators then used DNA evidence from the crime scene to identify a new suspect, George Burch. Burch's location data from his Android phone's Google Dashboard placed him at the crime scene, where the body was dumped, and near where her belongings were found, leading to his conviction for first-degree murder.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is introducing a new, mandatory "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for most nonimmigrant visa applicants, including tourists, business travelers, and students. This fee is part of the Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" and is in addition to existing visa application costs. The provision states that travelers may be able to get the fee reimbursed after their visa expires if they comply with all visa conditions, such as not overstaying. However, significant questions remain about the implementation and reimbursement process, leading experts to advise treating it as a nonrefundable cost. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee visited the Palestinian Christian village of Taybeh in the occupied West Bank to condemn an arson attack on the ancient Church of Saint George. Residents blame extremist Israeli settlers for the fire, which is part of a surge in settler violence since the start of the war in Gaza. Huckabee, typically a staunch supporter of Israel, called the desecration of a place of worship an "act of terror" and insisted that the perpetrators must be found and prosecuted. His visit aimed to show solidarity with the community.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a defamation lawsuit seeking at least $20 billion in damages against the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones & Company, and its leader, Rupert Murdoch. The suit alleges the paper published a false and defamatory story about a "bawdy" birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein purportedly signed by Trump. Trump has denied the report, calling the letter a fake. The lawsuit faces a high legal bar, as public figures must prove "actual malice" to win defamation cases.</p>

          <p>Health experts and officials in the UK are raising alarms over the increasing use of nicotine pouches, or "snus," among teenagers. These pouches, which are sold without age restrictions, come in various flavors and can contain extremely high levels of nicotine, leading to addiction and severe gum damage. Users report a powerful "hit" that is stronger than cigarettes, and their discreet nature allows for use in schools. While a new bill aims to ban sales to minors, Trading Standards is currently powerless to prevent children from purchasing the highly addictive products.</p>

          <p>A UK government initiative to install "Great British Energy solar panels" on schools has been revealed to be using panels manufactured by two Chinese firms, Aiko and Longi. The discovery has drawn criticism due to allegations of forced labor within China's solar panel supply chains, particularly in the Xinjiang region. Critics argue that taxpayer money should support British manufacturing and ethical supply chains, not potentially unethical ones. A GB Energy spokesperson stated that all contracts complied with UK modern slavery rules and that the company is committed to improving supply chain accountability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drivers across the UK, particularly at airports like Edinburgh, are increasingly avoiding official drop-off zones to evade rising "kiss-and-fly" charges. A recent study found that over half of the busiest UK airports have increased these fees, with Edinburgh charging £6 for a 10-minute stay. Consequently, many drivers wait in nearby lay-bys and coordinate pickups via phone to avoid the charges, despite the inconvenience and risk of fines for improper parking. This behavior highlights public frustration with what many see as extortionate fees for a brief service. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia is conducting a systematic campaign to erase Ukrainian identity and instill pro-Russian sentiment in children living in occupied areas of Ukraine. This effort involves rewriting school curriculums, forcing students to sing the Russian anthem, and bringing in Russian teachers. State-sponsored military-patriotic groups like Yunarmia (Youth Army) are also active, providing basic military training to children as young as eight. The campaign, which the UK government has called "brainwashing," also includes the forced deportation of thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia, an act considered a war crime.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is growing in the UK over the possibility of shortening the traditional six-week school summer holiday to address issues like learning loss and the high cost of childcare for parents. Proponents argue a shorter break could help disadvantaged students and ease financial burdens, while spreading holidays throughout the year might lower travel costs. However, teachers express concerns about losing essential recharge and planning time, and some families value the long break. While some school districts are already experimenting with a five-week summer, the proposal remains divisive across the country.</p>

          <p>The global transition to green technology is creating a severe environmental crisis in Chile's Atacama salt flats, home to the world's largest lithium reserves. The process of extracting lithium, essential for electric car and solar batteries, requires pumping vast amounts of water and brine, depleting the arid region's scarce resources. Local indigenous communities report that wetlands are drying up, native flora is dying, and flamingo populations are shrinking. While mining companies are piloting new, less impactful technologies, locals remain skeptical, arguing they are bearing the environmental cost for a green transition that primarily benefits developed nations.</p>

          <p>The UK chancellor is pushing for a cultural shift to encourage citizens to invest in stocks and shares rather than keeping their money in safe, low-interest cash savings accounts like ISAs. The government plans to send details of investment opportunities to savers and has not ruled out reducing the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs to incentivize the change. Experts note that women, in particular, tend to be more risk-averse savers. Critics warn that pushing inexperienced individuals into volatile markets could backfire and that any changes must be handled carefully to avoid alienating a generation of potential investors.
