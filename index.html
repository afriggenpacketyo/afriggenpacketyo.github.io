          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda is projected to strengthen into a hurricane but is forecast to move away from the southeastern United States, according to the National Hurricane Center. As of Monday, the storm was bringing heavy rain to the northwestern Bahamas, with its path expected to turn east-northeastward toward Bermuda later in the week. While a tropical storm watch for Florida's coast was canceled, swells from Imelda are still expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along much of the U.S. East Coast. The storm formed shortly after Hurricane Humberto, another major Atlantic hurricane that is not expected to make landfall.</p>

          <p>A 40-year-old decorated Marine combat veteran and Purple Heart recipient has been charged with killing three people and wounding five others at a waterfront bar in Southport, North Carolina. The suspect, Nigel Edge, allegedly opened fire with an assault rifle from a boat in what authorities described as a "highly premeditated" attack. Edge, who reportedly suffers from PTSD, has a history of filing lawsuits against local entities and making erratic claims. The incident has prompted calls for improved mental health care services and gun control measures in the state.</p>

According to the department's contingency plan, the Bureau of Labor Statistics would suspend all operations, halting data collection and reporting. This potential delay comes at a critical time, as the Federal Reserve is closely monitoring labor market data to inform its decisions on interest rates.

          <p>The Trump administration is deploying 200 National Guard members to Portland, Oregon, to address crime and illegal immigration, five years after the city experienced prolonged riots and unrest. This action is part of a broader federal crackdown on crime, similar to initiatives recently launched in Washington, D.C., and Chicago. The move follows recent protests and occasional violence near a Portland ICE facility. Oregon's state government has filed a lawsuit to block the deployment, with local leaders arguing it is an unlawful use of military force in a city they claim is not a national security threat.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that a government shutdown is likely unless Democrats alter their negotiating position on a new spending bill. In an interview, Trump expressed confidence that the public would support his stance on cutting spending and cast Democrats' demands for extending Affordable Care Act subsidies as unreasonable. The White House has already instructed federal agencies to prepare for potential layoffs, suggesting the administration is preparing for a funding lapse. Trump is scheduled to meet with congressional leaders from both parties in a final attempt to avert a shutdown before the October 1 deadline.</p>

          <p>"Succession" star Kieran Culkin and his wife, Jazz Charton, are expecting their third child, a development Charton humorously announced on social media. The news fulfills a deal the couple made at the 75th Emmy Awards, where Culkin, upon winning for lead actor, publicly reminded Charton she had said "maybe" to having more children if he won. The couple, who married in 2013, already have two children, Kinsey Sioux and Wilder Wolf. Charton shared that her due date is approaching soon, continuing her tradition of cheeky pregnancy announcements.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a critical meeting with President Trump, Democratic congressional leaders have reiterated that they will not support a government funding bill without concessions on healthcare. Their primary demand is the extension of enhanced Obamacare tax credits, which are set to expire at the end of 2025. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries stated that the party will not back what he termed a "partisan Republican spending bill" that neglects the healthcare needs of Americans. This firm stance sets the stage for a contentious negotiation as the deadline to avoid a federal shutdown approaches.</p>

This move comes as coal's share of U.S. electricity generation has fallen to about 15%, displaced by natural gas and renewable energy.

As a result, seniors may face higher premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums for 2026 plans.

          <p>Shane Lowry played a pivotal role in Europe's Ryder Cup victory, sinking a crucial 6-foot putt on the final hole to secure at least a tie and ultimately help fend off a powerful American comeback. With his team's lead dwindling during the Sunday singles matches, the pressure fell on Lowry to deliver a key point. His euphoric celebration after making the putt highlighted a moment of personal redemption and solidified his importance to the European team. Teammate Rory McIlroy praised Lowry's performance as immense, noting his crucial contributions throughout the tournament at Bethpage Black.</p>

          <p>In a rare address to the United Nations General Assembly, a high-ranking North Korean official declared that Pyongyang will never surrender its nuclear weapons. Kim Son Gyong, the vice minister of foreign affairs, stated that demanding denuclearization is equivalent to asking the country to give up its sovereignty and right to exist. Despite this firm stance, he left open the possibility of diplomacy, echoing recent comments from leader Kim Jong Un about being open to talks with the U.S. if the nation's nuclear arsenal is accepted. North Korea has been under extensive UN sanctions since its first nuclear test in 2006.</p>

However, the Social Security Administration's operational budget requires congressional approval, meaning a shutdown could disrupt other services. According to the agency's contingency plan, functions like benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and replacing Medicare cards could be temporarily halted. While nearly 90% of SSA employees are deemed essential and would continue working, some staff would be furloughed, potentially leading to delays for beneficiaries needing assistance.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced new tariffs set to take effect on October 1, including a 30% levy on imported upholstered furniture and a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities. Industry analysts predict these new taxes will lead to higher prices for consumers, as retailers will likely pass on the increased costs. The move could also deter some Americans from undertaking home renovation projects and create uncertainty for businesses, potentially causing them to delay investment and expansion plans. The tariffs are intended to protect domestic manufacturing, but critics warn they will disproportionately affect low-income consumers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is facing a potential shutdown as the Republican-controlled Congress and the Democratic minority remain deadlocked over a spending bill. Democrats are leveraging their votes in the Senate to demand concessions on healthcare, including an extension of insurance tax credits and a reversal of Medicaid cuts made by the Trump administration. If no agreement is reached by the deadline, non-essential government services will halt, and federal workers will be furloughed. Unlike past shutdowns, the Trump administration appears willing to let the government close and has even threatened to use the opportunity to permanently reduce the federal workforce.</p>

Financial experts recommend workers immediately assess their cash flow, track all expenses, and identify areas to cut back on discretionary spending. Contacting lenders to inquire about hardship assistance, such as payment deferrals, is also a crucial step. In the event of layoffs, workers should research unemployment benefits and options for continuing health coverage, including marketplace plans under the Affordable Care Act, to mitigate the financial impact.</p>
