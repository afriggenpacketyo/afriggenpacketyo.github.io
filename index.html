          <p>President Trump continued his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling his performance "bad" but also indicating he would not attempt to fire him, noting Powell's term ends in eight months anyway. Trump accused Powell of keeping interest rates too high for political reasons, which he claims hinders homeownership. This follows a period of speculation about Powell's job security, though Trump recently called the idea of firing him "highly unlikely." The administration is also scrutinizing a $2.5 billion renovation project at the Fed's Washington buildings, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent calling for an internal investigation into the central bank's operations.

          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has conducted a significant reshuffle of her shadow cabinet, appointing former Foreign and Home Secretary Sir James Cleverly as the new shadow housing secretary. This move places him in direct opposition to Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. Badenoch stated the changes aim to bring more experience to the front bench as the party enters a "new phase" following poor polling and local election results. Other key appointments include Richard Holden as shadow transport secretary and Kevin Hollinrake as the new party chair, while several senior figures like Sir Mel Stride and Dame Priti Patel remain in their posts.</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams made a triumphant return to the court after a 16-month hiatus, winning her first-round doubles match at the D.C. Open with partner Hailey Baptiste. The 45-year-old, who underwent a procedure for uterine fibroids last year, expressed joy at simply being able to play again, stating her health has given her a new perspective on the sport. Williams humorously joked that her sister, Serena, had been "in the way" of her finding doubles success earlier. Her comeback continues with a scheduled singles match, marking a significant moment in her celebrated career.</p>

          <p>An American citizen from Oklahoma, identified as 35-year-old Hosam Saraya, was reportedly executed in Syria during recent violent clashes in the Sweida region. The State Department confirmed the death and is providing consular assistance to his family. The incident occurred as government-backed forces attacked the minority Druze community, with the total death toll from the conflict surpassing 1,000. U.S. senators from Oklahoma condemned the killing, while Israel reportedly launched military strikes to halt the violence against the Druze population. Washington has helped broker a fragile ceasefire, threatening to keep Syria on the list of state sponsors of terrorism if violated.</p>

          <p>Shares of department store Kohl's saw a dramatic surge of over 30% in volatile trading, reminiscent of past meme-stock rallies. The stock's price more than doubled at one point before partially retreating, with trading volume skyrocketing to nearly 17 times its 30-day average. The rally appears driven by retail investors on platforms like Reddit's Wall Street Bets, who noted the stock's high short interest, making it a candidate for a short squeeze. Analysts caution that the surge is disconnected from the company's weak business fundamentals, as Kohl's faces falling sales and is currently led by an interim CEO. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An initial investigation into the deadly December Jeju Air crash in South Korea has suggested pilot error as a contributing factor, drawing immediate and angry protests from victims' families and pilots' unions. The report found that after both engines sustained bird strikes, the pilots shut down the less-damaged engine before the crash-landing that killed 179 of the 181 people on board. Critics accuse authorities of prematurely blaming the deceased pilots to deflect from other potential causes, such as a concrete antenna structure the plane hit. The families are demanding the full release of the cockpit voice and flight data recorders for transparency.</p>

The measure, supported by Mayor Daniel Lurie, aims to clear sidewalks and reduce trash by targeting the estimated 400 recreational vehicles used as homes by those unable to afford housing. While the city says it will offer support to help families find stable indoor housing, critics argue the plan is cruel as there is insufficient shelter available. A permit program will exempt some current RV residents, provided they work with the city to find alternative housing.</p>

However, the timing, just days after Colbert criticized parent company Paramount for a settlement with Donald Trump, has led to speculation about corporate pressure stifling critical voices. While the late-night television format faces declining viewership and ad revenue, Colbert's show was a ratings leader and a prominent critic of the Trump administration.

Hall was one of 11 American soldiers killed when their remote radio navigation site on a mountain was attacked by commandos on March 11, 1968. His remains were unrecoverable at the time. After decades of recovery efforts, including joint operations with Laos and analysis of evidence, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) used anthropological and DNA analysis to confirm his identity. Hall will be buried in Kansas in September.</p>

          <p>Hikmat al-Hijri, a key spiritual leader of Syria's Druze community, has become a controversial figure following deadly violence in the southern province of Sweida. Critics accuse him of escalating the conflict with his belligerent stance against the new Syrian government, while supporters view him as a defender of the Druze people. Al-Hijri's rejection of ceasefire agreements and his call for international intervention, including from Israel, have led to accusations of treason. This article explores his complex role, the internal divisions within the Druze leadership, and how his actions have deepened sectarian tensions in a country struggling with a fragile political transition.</p>

          <p>According to a BBC analysis, there is clear and mounting evidence that Israel has committed a series of war crimes in Gaza since the October 7 attacks, leading to a significant loss of international patience and support. While Hamas's initial attack involved war crimes, Israel's subsequent actions, including the starvation of civilians and the disproportionate killing of tens of thousands of innocents, are under scrutiny by international courts. Key allies, including the U.S. and UK, who initially rallied behind Israel, have grown increasingly critical of its conduct. This shift marks a major inflection point in the long-running conflict, transforming the political landscape of the Middle East.</p>

          <p>A new AARP survey reveals that a growing number of American retirees are heavily dependent on Social Security for their income, with about two-thirds now relying on it substantially, up from half in 2005. This increased reliance comes as the program faces significant challenges, including a long-term funding shortfall that could lead to benefit cuts by 2034. Confidence in the program's future is waning, with only 36% of Americans believing it will remain reliable at current levels. The findings underscore the program's critical importance to millions while highlighting public anxiety about its long-term stability and solvency.</p>

          <p>The UK High Court has ruled that the estate of deceased tech tycoon Mike Lynch and his former business partner owe Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) £700 million. The ruling stems from HPE's 2011 acquisition of Lynch's software firm, Autonomy, for $11.1 billion. HPE successfully argued that Lynch and Autonomy's former CFO, Sushovan Hussain, had fraudulently misrepresented the company's finances, causing HPE to overpay significantly. Lynch, who died in a yachting accident last year, had maintained that HPE botched the acquisition. The ruling brings a long and bitter transatlantic legal battle closer to a conclusion.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify investigation examines the UK's role in providing military support to Israel amid the ongoing war in Gaza, an issue that has drawn significant public and political attention. While the UK is not a primary arms supplier like the U.S., it has approved over £500 million in export licenses since 2015 and supplies key components for the F-35 jets used extensively in Gaza. The Labour government suspended some licenses but created an exemption for F-35 parts. The report also details UK surveillance flights over Gaza, which officials claim are solely for locating hostages, and the training of a small number of IDF personnel in the UK.</p>

The decision cancels planned legislative votes for the week and postpones a potential floor fight over the Epstein records until September. Johnson specifically criticized Republican Rep.

At a recent conference, Carlson criticized the conservative establishment from the right on multiple issues, including its approach to the Epstein saga.

The article suggests that the project of Trumpism is to become the "only people in the room," where their laughter is the only one that counts. True comedy creates connection, but the current landscape often demands laughter as a show of allegiance, making it a serious, not humorous, affair.</p>
