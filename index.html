          <p>President Trump visited Central Texas to survey the damage from catastrophic flash floods that have claimed over 120 lives, with more than 170 people still missing. Meeting with victims' families and first responders in Kerr County, the epicenter of the disaster, he expressed the "anguish of our entire nation" over the tragedy. The president, who has signed a federal disaster declaration for the region, described the event as a "hundred-year catastrophe" and pledged national support for the ongoing search and recovery efforts. The floods were particularly devastating at a girls' summer camp, where at least 27 campers and counselors perished.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has rejected TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, allowing the case to proceed. The lawsuit alleges that the social media platform knowingly employs addictive design features to exploit its younger users for commercial gain, such as increased ad exposure and in-app purchases. The court ruled the state's claims were valid and focused on the app's allegedly dangerous features rather than its user-generated content. This case is part of a broader trend of legal actions by states against tech companies over design elements that may harm children's mental health and safety.</p>

          <p>Lord Ian Blair, who served as the commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police from 2005 to 2008, has passed away at the age of 72. His tenure was marked by significant events, including leading the police response to the 7/7 London bombings. However, his career was also defined by controversy, particularly the fatal shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, who was mistaken for a suicide bomber. Despite being cleared of personal wrongdoing, the incident led to sustained pressure, and he ultimately resigned after losing the confidence of then-Mayor Boris Johnson. Colleagues remember him for his contributions to policing, including improving how sexual assault cases were handled.</p>

          <p>Jannik Sinner has advanced to his first Wimbledon final after decisively defeating seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in straight sets. The 38-year-old Djokovic acknowledged that age and physical wear are becoming significant factors in his performance against younger, sharper opponents. In the other semi-final, defending champion Carlos Alcaraz overcame American Taylor Fritz in a hard-fought four-set match. This sets up a highly anticipated final between Sinner and Alcaraz, a rematch of their recent five-set epic at the French Open, continuing the rivalry between the two dominant young stars of men's tennis.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the Los Angeles Police Department from using rubber bullets and other less-lethal munitions on journalists covering protests. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit by press rights organizations, which argued that reporters were being deliberately targeted while covering demonstrations against the Trump administration's immigration policies. The judge cited specific instances, including an officer appearing to aim at an Australian reporter on live TV. The order protects journalists from being assaulted or obstructed and ensures they can access protest areas, reaffirming 1st Amendment rights and press freedoms.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security announced the recent arrests of five illegal immigrants with prior serious criminal convictions. The individuals, taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), had convictions ranging from second-degree murder and assault to sexual abuse of a child and possession of child sexual abuse material. An assistant secretary stated that under the current administration, DHS is focused on restoring law and order by targeting and removing such individuals from the country.

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated a major reorganization by laying off 1,353 employees, part of a broader plan to reduce its domestic workforce by approximately 15%. The cuts, which include over 1,100 civil service and nearly 250 foreign service staff, are aimed at streamlining what the administration calls a "bloated bureaucracy" by consolidating offices and eliminating redundancies. Critics, including Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, argue these indiscriminate cuts could weaken U.S. diplomatic efforts and undermine national security.

According to career platform Handshake, job listings for these roles have fallen by 15%, while the number of applications per job has surged by 30%. Experts note that AI is particularly adept at the routine tasks often assigned to new hires, leading to a redefinition of entry-level work and a higher demand for AI-related skills. This trend is contributing to a higher unemployment rate for young degree holders compared to the national average, potentially shifting career paths toward skilled trades.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is facing its third heatwave of the summer, with temperatures reaching 34.7C (94.5F), leading authorities to issue amber heat health alerts across southern and central England. The extreme heat and record-low rainfall have prompted a drought declaration in some regions and the imposition of hosepipe bans affecting over seven million people. Health officials are warning the public, especially those with pre-existing conditions, to take precautions against the heat. The conditions have also led to extreme wildfire warnings in Scotland and Northern Ireland, as scientists continue to link the increased frequency of such extreme weather to manmade climate change.</p>

Frost is accused of personally misappropriating over $19 million for luxury purchases, vacations, and political contributions, even as the company was collapsing.

The issue stems from John Textor's 43% stake in Palace while also owning French club Lyon, which also qualified for the Europa League. Because Lyon finished higher in its domestic league, it receives the spot. Palace missed a UEFA deadline to alter its ownership structure and failed to convince the governing body that Textor lacked decisive influence.

          <p>Chemical manufacturer DuPont has agreed to a $27 million settlement to resolve a class-action lawsuit over the PFOA contamination of the water supply in Hoosick Falls, New York. The deal, which avoids a trial, brings the total recovery for residents to over $90 million, following earlier settlements with three other companies. The lawsuit claimed that a local facility that coated fabrics with Teflon, using materials from DuPont and 3M, caused the contamination. PFOA is a harmful "forever chemical" linked to serious illnesses and is now classified as a carcinogen. The settlement includes $6 million for an ongoing medical monitoring program for residents.</p>

          <p>Relatives of Israeli hostages with German citizenship who were kidnapped by Hamas on October 7 have traveled to Berlin to appeal for greater German government involvement in securing their release. It has been 642 days since the attack, and 24 hostages are still believed to be alive in Gaza. The families are meeting with German officials, including the Foreign Minister and President, urging them to apply more diplomatic pressure to advance ceasefire negotiations. They emphasize that international involvement is crucial for reaching a deal to free the remaining captives and is a necessary first step toward de-escalating the wider regional crisis.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services is facing a backlog of over a billion dollars in delayed grants, forcing the agency to ask some laid-off employees to return to work temporarily. Officials blame new bureaucratic review processes implemented by the Trump administration for stalling the awarding of funds for critical programs, including services for unaccompanied migrant children and youth homelessness. With the end-of-fiscal-year deadline looming, the department is reportedly considering shortening application periods and using contractors to clear the backlog. The delays highlight significant operational disruptions within the agency following recent layoffs and policy changes.</p>

          <p>The United Nations human rights office reported that at least 798 people have been killed while attempting to access humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip since late May. The majority of these deaths, 615, occurred near distribution centers operated by the US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), with most casualties resulting from gunshot wounds. This report highlights the extreme dangers civilians face in obtaining essential supplies amid the ongoing conflict and chaotic aid distribution efforts.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid concerns about Social Security's long-term solvency and potential benefit clawbacks, seniors are exploring alternative ways to supplement their retirement income. This article outlines several financial options available to older homeowners and savers. These include reverse mortgages, which provide monthly payments from home equity without immediate repayment, and annuities, which offer guaranteed lifetime income in exchange for a lump-sum investment. For more immediate needs, personal loans are presented as a potential, though more costly, option to bridge financial gaps, offering an alternative to high-interest credit cards for emergency funds.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners looking to quickly access their home's equity, several modern lending strategies can expedite the process of obtaining a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). Applying with fully online lenders can significantly reduce processing time through digital platforms and automated verification. Some lenders also offer low- or no-documentation HELOCs that minimize paperwork for financially stable borrowers. Additionally, using a lender that employs automated or desktop appraisals instead of traditional in-person ones can shave weeks off the timeline, though these faster methods may come with tradeoffs like higher rates or more conservative credit limits.

          <p>The investigation into last month's fatal Air India crash in Ahmedabad is reportedly focusing on pilot error as a primary cause. Preliminary findings from U.S. officials suggest that switches controlling fuel flow to both engines of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner were turned off, leading to a loss of thrust shortly after takeoff. The crash killed 270 people, including individuals on the ground when the aircraft plunged into a medical student hostel. Early assessments have not indicated a mechanical failure with the aircraft or its engines, shifting scrutiny to the actions of the two experienced pilots in the cockpit.</p>

          <p>The U.S. plan to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods has sparked outrage in Brazil, particularly because President Trump explicitly linked the move to the ongoing trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro. Trump called the prosecution of Bolsonaro, who faces charges related to an alleged coup attempt, a "witch hunt" and demanded he be left alone. Brazil's President Lula da Silva condemned the move as an unacceptable interference in the nation's sovereign affairs and independent judiciary, vowing a response based on economic reciprocity. The threat has created a rare moment of unity, with even some Bolsonaro supporters criticizing the U.S. pressure.</p>

The incident is the culmination of a bitter, long-running international custody battle.
