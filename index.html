          <p>The U.S. military is preparing for a potential activation of the D.C. National Guard to support local authorities in the nation's capital, according to a U.S. official. While a final decision has not been made, this move comes as President Trump announces a press conference to address crime in the city, despite data showing a decrease in crime rates. The article also notes Vice President JD Vance dismissing reports of a meeting about Jeffrey Epstein at his residence and laughing off speculation about a 2028 presidential ticket with Marco Rubio. The D.C. National Guard is uniquely under presidential control, not mayoral authority.</p>

          <p>Amid global economic uncertainties, Chinese miners are increasingly seeking opportunities in African goldfields, despite significant security risks. In Mali, a major gold producer, the Chinese embassy has issued repeated warnings for its citizens to halt mining operations and evacuate due to a deteriorating security situation following the 2020 military coup. These advisories follow a series of violent attacks and kidnappings targeting Chinese nationals involved in the gold mining industry. The situation highlights the dangerous conditions many are willing to face, driven by the allure of gold as a stable asset.</p>

          <p>The annual Perseids meteor shower, one of the most anticipated celestial events, is expected to peak on August 12-13. However, astronomers warn that a bright waning gibbous moon, which will be 84% full, will likely diminish the viewing experience this year. The moonlight is projected to reduce visibility by at least 75%, with viewers likely seeing only 10-20 meteors per hour instead of the usual 50 or more in darker conditions. For optimal viewing, NASA suggests looking towards the sky in the early morning hours from a dark, rural location, away from city lights.</p>

          <p>The conviction of nurse Lucy Letby for murdering and attempting to murder babies is being re-examined amid claims of flawed medical evidence from both sides. A BBC Panorama investigation highlights the case of Baby O, where the prosecution's theory of impact-type liver injuries is contested by an independent pathologist. Simultaneously, the defense has presented conflicting theories, including an accidental needle puncture and birth trauma, which also face scrutiny and lack consensus even among their own experts. This deep dive reveals the complexity and ambiguity of the medical arguments, raising questions that the Criminal Cases Review Commission must now consider.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's H20 artificial intelligence chip, designed specifically for the Chinese market, is facing a growing wave of distrust and calls for a boycott from Chinese state media. An outlet associated with state broadcaster CCTV labeled the chip unsafe, alleging the U.S. government could have embedded 'back doors' for surveillance, a claim Nvidia has repeatedly denied. The commentary suggests the chip could be remotely controlled through hardware and software exploits, urging Chinese consumers to avoid it. This campaign of distrust complicates Nvidia's efforts to maintain its market presence in China under strict U.S. export controls.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike near Gaza City's Al-Shifa Hospital has killed five Al Jazeera journalists, an act the broadcaster has labeled a 'targeted assassination.' The journalists were in a designated press tent when the strike occurred. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) later confirmed it had targeted one of the journalists, Anas al-Sharif, claiming he was a Hamas terrorist cell leader posing as a journalist. Press freedom organizations have criticized this pattern, stating that Israel often makes such claims without providing evidence, raising serious concerns about the safety of reporters covering the conflict.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has shrunk to approximately 450,000 personnel, a 20% reduction over the past six years, primarily due to the nation's critically low birth rate. With the world's lowest fertility rate at 0.75 babies per woman, the country is struggling to maintain its conscription-based armed forces, which are considered vital for defense against North Korea. A recent study suggested a minimum of 500,000 soldiers are needed, placing South Korea in a difficult strategic position. This demographic challenge has intensified debates around military policy, including the controversial suggestion of conscripting women.</p>

Run by the charity Gen.Ukrainian, the camp offers group therapy, art sessions, and recreational activities to help children cope with the ambiguous loss and trauma. Many of these children live in a state of frozen grief, uncertain if their parents are captured, trapped, or deceased, with some scouring Russian social media for any information. The camp aims to provide a supportive environment where these children can connect with peers who share their experience and begin to heal.</p>

The company already runs a similar service in Texas, allowing customers to charge their electric vehicles cheaply and sell surplus power back to the grid.

When a black hole is created, for instance from a star's collapse, the resulting distortion in spacetime quickly settles into a stable, mathematically perfect shape. During this brief settling period, the black hole radiates energy as gravitational waves, which are akin to the fading vibrations of a struck bell. These 'good vibrations' offer a unique way for scientists to study the fundamental properties of these enigmatic cosmic objects.</p>

For example, the handout equates to over 13.5% of an average resident's annual income in the poor province of Gansu, compared to just 4.1% in wealthy Shanghai. This disparity could lead to a more noticeable boost in consumption and potentially birth rates in smaller cities and rural areas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Firefighters in western Colorado are battling two major lightning-caused wildfires that have burned over 120,000 acres, forcing evacuations and threatening homes. The larger blaze, the Lee Fire, is being fueled by severe drought conditions and high winds, creating dangerous situations that have required crews to pull back for safety. Meanwhile, in Southern California, the Gifford Fire has consumed over 117,000 acres in the Los Padres National Forest. With continued hot, dry, and windy conditions forecasted for the Southwest, fire crews in both states expect no immediate reprieve from the challenging conditions.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 6.1 earthquake struck the province of Balikesir in northwestern Turkey, resulting in the death of an 81-year-old woman and injuring at least 29 other people. The quake, with its epicenter in the town of Sindirgi, caused 16 buildings to collapse and was felt as far away as Istanbul. Search and rescue operations have concluded, with officials reporting no other serious casualties. Turkey is situated on major tectonic plates and frequently experiences seismic activity, including the devastating earthquakes in February 2023 that killed over 50,000 people in the country's southeast.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a frustrating 5-4 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays, failing to capitalize on numerous opportunities and leaving a season-high 16 runners on base. Manager Dave Roberts expressed frustration, particularly criticizing Shohei Ohtani for a poor baserunning decision and a crucial strikeout with the bases loaded. Despite Ohtani hitting his 41st home run, the team's bullpen faltered again, giving up three solo home runs in the late innings. The loss shrinks the Dodgers' division lead over the surging San Diego Padres, amplifying concerns about the team's recent performance.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new measures to make it easier for NHS employers in England to hire newly qualified nurses and midwives, addressing a surplus of graduates compared to available vacancies. The plan aims to cut red tape, allowing trusts to recruit based on anticipated need rather than waiting for formal vacancies to arise. This move follows a surge in nursing school enrollments during the pandemic, which has led to a competitive job market for new graduates. Nursing unions have welcomed the news but stated the true test will be whether graduates can actually secure jobs.</p>

Armed with five guns, he attempted to enter the CDC building before opening fire from across the street. The incident has prompted a CDC workers' union to demand that federal officials publicly condemn vaccine misinformation, which they argue fuels a climate of hostility and puts scientists at risk.</p>
