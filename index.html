          <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune stated he offered Democrats a procedural vote on extending Affordable Care Act subsidies in an effort to end the ongoing government shutdown. However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer disputed this, claiming no formal proposal was made, highlighting the deep partisan divide. The disagreement underscores the central conflict, as Democrats demand healthcare funding fixes before supporting any government funding bill. The stalemate continues as the shutdown enters its 16th day, with Republicans insisting negotiations can only occur after the government reopens.</p>

The summit will be preceded by preparatory meetings led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This diplomatic effort comes as Trump also focuses on Middle East stability, suggesting success there could aid negotiations with Russia. Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader John Thune is advancing a bipartisan bill to impose new sanctions on Russia, indicating congressional pressure continues despite the planned presidential talks.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa's upcoming Europa League match against Maccabi Tel Aviv will be held without any visiting fans due to significant safety concerns.

The Safety Advisory Group, which is responsible for certifying match safety, officially informed Aston Villa that no tickets would be allocated to the Israeli club's supporters.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a strategic shift during the ongoing government shutdown, Senate Republicans attempted to pass a standalone, year-long funding bill for the Pentagon. However, the procedural vote failed to secure the necessary 60 votes as Democrats remained unified in their opposition. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued against funding the military separately from other crucial domestic programs like healthcare and housing. This move highlights the persistent deadlock, with Democrats demanding a comprehensive funding solution that includes an extension of health insurance tax credits before reopening the government.</p>

          <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune announced his intention to advance a bipartisan bill imposing significant new sanctions on Russia, stating that the "time has come" for a vote. This development occurred shortly after President Trump revealed plans for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the war in Ukraine. The legislation, which has strong support from over 80 senators, aims to increase economic pressure on Moscow, notably by placing heavy tariffs on countries that purchase Russian energy exports. The push for a vote signals growing congressional resolve to adopt a harder line against Russia's actions.</p>

          <p>Senator Mitch McConnell, 83, experienced a fall in a Capitol hallway while on his way to a series of votes related to the government shutdown. The incident occurred as two environmental activists approached him with a question, though he did not respond. Assisted by his security detail, McConnell was able to get up and continue walking, later participating in the scheduled votes. This event has raised renewed concerns about the senator's health, following a serious fall in 2023 that led to a prolonged absence from the Senate for rehabilitation.</p>

          <p>This article explores the options available to individuals being sued over unpaid credit card debt, noting that hiring a lawyer is not always necessary. For straightforward cases where the debt is valid and the amount is undisputed, defendants can respond to the lawsuit themselves to avoid a default judgment. Alternatives to court include negotiating a settlement or payment plan directly with the creditor, seeking assistance from a credit counseling agency, or, in cases of overwhelming debt, filing for bankruptcy. The most critical step is to respond to the lawsuit promptly to prevent actions like wage garnishment.</p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice has issued a ruling clarifying that pets transported on airplanes are legally considered "baggage," not "passengers." The decision came from a case where a Spanish woman sought non-material damages after her dog was lost by an airline, arguing for compensation beyond the limits set for lost luggage. The court determined that under the Montreal Convention governing air travel, liability for a lost pet is subject to the same rules and compensation limits as baggage.

As social media platforms shift from personal connection hubs to content-driven entertainment streams, interactions with friends and family are increasingly consumed passively, similar to content from celebrities or influencers. This can lead to a feeling of being a spectator in loved ones' lives rather than an active participant. The rise of group chats and voice notes further contributes to this trend, emphasizing performance and broadcasting over direct, reciprocal communication.</p>

The Trump administration demanded the data, including names and Social Security numbers, to combat fraud, a move Democratic states have resisted as unlawful. A federal judge recently issued a preliminary order blocking the administration from punishing states that refuse to comply, stating the demand likely violates the law. Critics fear the data could be used for purposes beyond program administration, such as immigration enforcement.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Concerning Lead Levels in Popular Protein Powders</h2>

          <p>A recent Consumer Reports investigation discovered "concerning" levels of lead in many popular protein powder brands, with plant-based powders showing significantly higher contamination than dairy-based alternatives. While the report advises against daily consumption of most tested products, experts clarify that the levels are generally not high enough to cause immediate harm. The primary risk comes from consistent, long-term exposure, which can lead to a buildup of lead in the body. The report calls for stronger FDA regulation, as there are currently no federal limits on heavy metals in supplements.</p>

          <p>Harvard's School of Public Health (HSPH) is facing a severe financial crisis after the Trump administration cut approximately $200 million in federal research funding. The school, which heavily relies on government grants, must now cut $30 million in operational costs and potentially slash up to half of its research programs. The situation has been complicated by controversy surrounding Dean Andrea Baccarelli, whose research linking Tylenol to autism was cited by Trump officials, creating an appearance of alignment with the administration that is actively defunding his institution, leading to internal frustration.</p>

Originally mislabeled as a hardcore band, the group has embraced a more versatile and melodic sound on their new album, "God Save the Gun." Shelton discusses the band's chameleon-like ability to adapt its style while maintaining authenticity, drawing inspiration from a wide range of influences like Modest Mouse and Third Eye Blind.

In an op-ed, Krugman expressed that he could no longer risk his life to defend actions he views as immoral and unconstitutional, such as the pardoning of January 6 insurrectionists and the testing of executive power limits. He urged other military personnel to reflect on their duty to question potentially illegal orders, warning that the nation is on a path toward the collapse of its governmental system.</p>

Experts advise against using local bank branches, as online banks typically offer higher rates due to lower overhead costs. It also suggests diversifying savings by placing some funds into a Certificate of Deposit (CD) to lock in current rates before anticipated Federal Reserve cuts. Finally, the article cautions against assuming these accounts are no longer valuable, as they still offer significantly better returns than traditional savings accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines the central role of soybeans in the global food system, highlighting that the vast majority of the crop is used for animal feed to support meat-heavy diets. The U.S. and Brazil dominate production, while China is the largest importer, creating a delicate geopolitical balance that is currently strained by trade disputes. The piece argues that while the trade war harms American farmers, the real issue is the inefficient use of this highly productive crop. It suggests that instead of subsidizing exports for animal feed, the U.S. should invest in making soy-based foods more appealing for direct human consumption.</p>

          <p>Following reports of lead contamination in products like cinnamon and protein powders, health experts are offering advice on how to minimize exposure. While lead is naturally present in the environment, elevated levels in unregulated products like supplements can contribute to a harmful buildup over time. The CDC warns that lead exposure can cause significant health issues, particularly in children. To reduce risk, experts recommend prioritizing whole foods over processed supplements and looking for trusted third-party certifications, such as the USP label, on any supplement products to ensure they have been tested for safety.</p>

          <p>A Republican-led bill to fund the government failed in the Senate for the tenth time, prolonging a shutdown that has entered its third week. The measure fell short of the 60 votes needed for passage, with the key sticking point being Democrats' insistence on extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies. Democratic Senator Mark Kelly called on President Trump to intervene directly in negotiations with congressional leaders to break the impasse. However, Republican leaders maintain that discussions about the healthcare subsidies must happen separately, after a short-term funding bill is approved to reopen the government.</p>
