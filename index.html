        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union is escalating trade pressure on the United States, outlining potential retaliatory tariffs on $107 billion worth of American goods, including agricultural products like soybeans and bourbon, as well as manufactured goods. This move comes in response to recent tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on steel, aluminum, and cars. The EU is also initiating a World Trade Organization dispute against the U.S. regarding these tariffs. While the EU hopes to negotiate a resolution, they are preparing for a long-term rebalancing of their trade relationship with the U.S., signaling a potential shift towards targeting the American services sector if the trade conflict deepens. The article highlights the EU's intent to have legal plans ready in case negotiations fail.</p>

          <p>Denmark is holding a landmark trial for two men accused of burning a Quran at a public festival and livestreaming it on Facebook, marking the first case under a new law criminalizing the "inappropriate treatment" of religious texts. The law was enacted in response to international tensions caused by a series of Quran burnings in Denmark during 2023, which led to diplomatic incidents and threats. Critics of the law argue that it infringes upon freedom of expression, while supporters maintain it is necessary to protect national security and prevent provocation.

          <p>An Idaho judge has ruled that Bryan Kohberger's immediate family members can attend his upcoming trial for the quadruple murder of four University of Idaho students, even if they are called to testify. The judge balanced Kohberger's Sixth Amendment right to a public trial with the state's interest in obtaining forthright testimony. He determined that the risk of family members shaping their testimony based on trial observations is minimal due to the narrow scope of their proposed testimony and prior recorded interviews. The judge had previously ruled that the victims' family members could also attend the trial.</p>

          <p>An economist discusses the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on American consumers and producers, highlighting the case of a doll manufacturer facing business challenges due to increased costs. The economist projects that household budgets could increase by $5,000 per year due to tariffs. They also question the long-term benefits of bringing back manufacturing jobs to the U.S., suggesting that the shift to a service-based economy has been positive overall. The economist argues that tariffs are a blunt and inefficient tool for shifting consumer habits or improving the environment, suggesting targeted taxes would be a better approach.</p>
