        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The chief inspector of constabulary for England and Wales has stated that police should cease recording non-crime hate incidents, arguing that the current practice places officers in an untenable position. Sir Andy Cooke emphasized the need to distinguish between offensive speech and criminal acts, suggesting that intelligence can be gathered through other means without causing public concern. This recommendation follows public debate over police actions, including visits to individuals over social media posts. The head of the Metropolitan Police agreed, calling for more flexibility and discretion for officers when navigating the fine line between free speech and potential criminality.</p>

          <p>Danish pharmaceutical firm Novo Nordisk has announced a significant corporate transformation that includes cutting approximately 9,000 jobs, representing about 11.5% of its global workforce. The company, known for producing the popular weight-loss drug Wegovy, stated the restructuring aims to simplify its organization and reallocate resources toward growth opportunities in diabetes and obesity treatments. This major overhaul follows the appointment of a new CEO and comes as the company faces increased market competition and supply chain challenges. The move is expected to incur a one-off cost of $1.26 billion, impacting the company's full-year profit growth forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Poland's military, in coordination with NATO allies, shot down multiple Russian drones that violated its airspace during a large-scale Russian aerial assault on western Ukraine. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk described the incursion as an "unprecedented violation" and an "act of aggression," confirming he was in constant contact with NATO leadership. The event marks the first time a NATO country has actively engaged Russian assets in its airspace since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began. Ukrainian officials warned that the incident, involving at least eight drones aimed toward Poland, was a deliberate test of Western resolve by Russia.</p>

The article details his journey from a young talent in Europe to becoming the NBA Rookie of the Year with the Dallas Mavericks and his controversial trade to the Los Angeles Lakers. While celebrated for his complete offensive skill set, Dončić has faced criticism for his defensive shortcomings and on-court behavior. Now with a renewed focus on fitness, he aims to lead Slovenia to another European Championship, embodying both the hopes and the polarizing nature of a generational talent.</p>

          <p>Shares of Inditex, the parent company of Zara, surged after it reported that its new Autumn/Winter collections were well-received by customers, reassuring investors despite weaker-than-expected second-quarter sales. The fashion retail giant saw a 9% year-on-year jump in constant currency sales during the first several weeks of the third quarter, signaling a significant acceleration in business momentum.

          <p>A research team from the Chinese University of Hong Kong has developed an artificial intelligence system that automates a robotic arm to assist surgeons during operations. This AI-driven arm functions as a third hand, performing routine tasks such as retracting tissue, handling gauze, and clipping blood vessels, freeing up the surgeon to focus on more complex actions. The technology is designed to address the growing clinical demand and strain on medical professionals caused by an aging population. By automating simple but essential surgical tasks, the system aims to improve efficiency in the operating room and potentially reduce patient wait times for necessary procedures.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, is examining the complex cultural and social legacy of the Plattenbau, the prefabricated concrete slab apartment blocks that defined much of East Germany's urban landscape. Once promoted as a socialist utopia to solve post-war housing shortages, these buildings later became symbols of urban decay and social strife following German reunification. The exhibition, titled "Wohnkomplex: Art and Life in Plattenbau," explores this divisive architectural heritage through artworks that reflect collective memories, social change, and the painful transformations of the 1990s.

However, the team has significantly underperformed in both scoring goals and preventing them, with players failing to convert high-quality chances and the goalkeeper conceding more than expected.

          <p>A BBC investigation has found that a private security contractor, UG Solutions, is employing members of a US biker gang known as the Infidels Motorcycle Club to manage armed security at aid distribution sites in Gaza. The gang, founded by US military veterans, has a documented history of anti-Islamic rhetoric and symbolism, raising serious concerns about its suitability for the role in a conflict zone where hundreds of civilians have been killed. Key leadership positions within the Gaza security operation are held by senior members of the Infidels MC. Critics have condemned the hiring as dangerously inappropriate and likely to exacerbate violence.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 7-2 victory against the Colorado Rockies, extending their lead in the National League West to two games. Starting pitcher Emmet Sheehan delivered a dominant performance, taking a perfect game into the sixth inning and ultimately allowing just one run over seven innings while striking out nine. The offense was powered by four home runs, including two from Teoscar Hernández, providing ample support for the strong pitching. Sheehan's outing continues a trend of excellent starting pitching for the Dodgers and strengthens his case for a role on the team's postseason roster as the regular season nears its conclusion.</p>

          <p>China's consumer price index (CPI) fell by 0.4% in August from a year earlier, a steeper decline than economists had forecast, signaling persistent deflationary pressures in the world's second-largest economy. The drop was largely attributed to lower food prices, while core CPI, which excludes volatile items, saw a modest increase. Meanwhile, the producer price index also continued its decline, falling 2.9%. The data intensifies calls for Beijing to implement more robust stimulus measures to boost sluggish domestic demand and counteract weakening growth as the economic recovery continues to face significant headwinds.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, allowing her to remain in her position while her lawsuit proceeds. The judge ruled that the Trump administration's justification for her removal, based on alleged mortgage fraud that occurred before she took office, was likely insufficient under the Federal Reserve Act's "for cause" provision. This legal challenge is viewed as a significant test of the Federal Reserve's independence from political interference. The ruling ensures Cook will participate in the central bank's upcoming interest rate meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time, obesity has become the most prevalent form of malnutrition among school-aged children and adolescents globally, surpassing the number of those who are underweight, according to a new UNICEF report. Since 2000, obesity rates among those aged five to nineteen have nearly tripled, while the number of underweight children has declined. UNICEF attributes this alarming trend to the proliferation of unhealthy food environments dominated by ultra-processed and fast foods high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats. The report calls for urgent policy interventions, including better food labeling and restrictions on marketing junk food to children.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reportedly asked the European Union to impose tariffs of up to 100% on China and India for their continued purchases of Russian oil. The move is intended to increase economic pressure on Moscow to end the war in Ukraine by targeting key buyers of its energy exports. According to sources, Trump made the request during a meeting with senior U.S. and EU officials, indicating Washington would be prepared to mirror any tariffs Europe imposes. This proposal comes as the U.S. has already levied punitive tariffs on Indian imports, a move that has strained relations with New Delhi.</p>
