          <h2>OECD Predicts Slower Economic Growth for China Due to Trade Tensions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 04:30:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has revised its economic growth forecast for China downwards to 4.3 percent for the coming year. The revision is attributed to ongoing global trade disputes, substantial trade barriers, diminishing confidence, and heightened policy uncertainty. The report highlights that these factors are exerting downward pressure on economic growth rates worldwide, with China, Canada, Mexico, and the United States being particularly affected. The OECD anticipates that Chinese exports will be curbed by newly imposed tariffs, while imports will decrease as production becomes increasingly localized, disproportionately impacting private companies, including foreign ones, which are major exporters. Optimism is tempered due to the impact of trade tensions on the Chinese economy. </p>

          <p>South Korea's new President Lee Jae-myung, from the liberal Democratic Party, has pledged to prioritize pragmatism and unity to address the crisis resulting from the imposition of martial law by his predecessor, Yoon Suk-yeol. In his inaugural speech, Lee emphasized enhancing trilateral cooperation with Japan and the United States while remaining open to dialogue with North Korea. He expressed his intention to build rational and constructive relationships with neighboring countries, founded on mutual recognition, sincere apologies where appropriate, active cooperation where interests align, and fair competition where differences remain. Lee's five-year term began immediately after his election victory, following Yoon's removal due to a Constitutional Court ruling on his declaration of martial law. </p>

          <p>Eighteen years after Madeleine McCann's disappearance, Portuguese and German authorities have resumed their search in Praia da Luz, Portugal. The search is focused on abandoned buildings and wells in the municipality of Lagos, near where Madeleine vanished in 2007. German investigators identified Christian BrÃ¼ckner as their prime suspect in 2020; he is currently serving a sentence in Germany for a sexual assault committed in Portugal in 2005. The search site is located approximately 3.5 miles from the Ocean Club resort, where Madeleine and her family had been staying, and involves clearing grass and vegetation, draining a well, and examining an abandoned farm. The ongoing search reflects the continued effort to find answers in this high-profile missing persons case.</p>

          <p>During a volunteer dig at Vindolanda, a Roman fort near Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland, England, a couple unearthed a sandstone carving of Victoria, the Roman goddess of victory. The artifact was found in rubble near former infantry barracks, which were built around 213 A.D. The Vindolanda Trust believes the stone was part of a larger, brightly painted work, possibly adorning an ornamental arch and gate. Experts note that similar finds from Roman Britain are increasingly rare, highlighting the significance of this discovery. The piece is set to go on display at the Vindolanda museum next year, offering insight into the grandeur and symbolism present in Roman forts nearly 2,000 years ago.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that making a deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping is "extremely hard," amidst rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China. The statement comes as U.S. officials suggest the two leaders might speak this week to address stalled trade talks. Washington and Beijing have blamed each other for violating a trade agreement reached in Switzerland, with the U.S. criticizing China for not easing restrictions on rare earths exports and China criticizing the U.S. for limiting China's access to advanced technology and revoking visas for Chinese students. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi conveyed that recent negative measures by the Trump administration undermined China's legitimate rights and interests. </p>

She admitted to discarding a food dehydrator and wiping her phone out of fear of being blamed for the deaths, explaining she had lied about a cancer diagnosis to conceal plans for weight-loss surgery.

Despite this, Tesla's total sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared to the same period last year. The company is facing increased competition and reputational damage related to CEO Elon Musk's political activities, though a return to focusing on Tesla may improve its global sales.</p>

          <p>Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako, accompanied by Princess Aiko, paid their respects to the war dead in Okinawa ahead of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. The imperial family laid flowers at the national cemetery for the war dead in Itoman, underscoring their desire to remember and pass on the lessons of the war to the next generation. The emperor has consistently expressed his strong desire for peace, echoing the sentiments of his father, former Emperor Akihito. Okinawa fell into U.S. hands in the closing months of World War II in 1945, and around 200,000 people lost their lives in the ensuing battle.</p>

          <p>The United States has doubled its tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%, increasing global trade tensions and casting a shadow on the OECD ministerial gathering. President Trump's sweeping tariffs have strained U.S. ties with trading partners, prompting negotiations to avoid the duties. The OECD has cut its global growth forecast due to the tariffs, with the U.S. economy expected to face the biggest repercussions. While the U.K. received a temporary exemption, the EU and Canada have expressed strong opposition and threatened retaliation, reflecting widespread concerns over the impact of the tariffs. </p>

The decision is intended to align with President Trump's goal of re-establishing a "warrior culture." The move comes during Pride Month, and follows other actions by the Trump administration to eliminate references to diversity, equity, and inclusion. The ship had been named in 2016 by then-Navy Secretary Ray Mabus to honor leaders who fought for civil and human rights. </p>

The EU Chamber of Commerce in China has engaged with Chinaâ€™s Ministry of Commerce, sensing that Beijing is overwhelmed with applications to export the minerals. The situation has led to production halts for some companies, as thousands of applications await review with limited resources. </p>
