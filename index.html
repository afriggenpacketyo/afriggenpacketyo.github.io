          <p>During Liverpool's Premier League victory parade, a car collided with pedestrians on Water Street, resulting in injuries and the detention of a 53-year-old man. Police have requested the public refrain from speculation and share any relevant footage while avoiding the distribution of distressing content online. Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed his shock and concern, thanking emergency services for their swift response, while the Liverpool Football Club conveyed their support to those affected.

          <p>A recent report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) suggests that the official unemployment rate of 4.2% may not accurately reflect the state of the labor market. LISEP's "true rate" of unemployment, which stood at 24.3% in April, includes those seeking full-time employment, but unable to find it, and those stuck in poverty-wage jobs. This measure captures labor market nuances missed by traditional indicators, such as Americans who struggle to afford basic needs like housing and nutritious meals. According to LISEP, many are in "survival mode," lacking the means to achieve even the first rung of the American dream, with Hispanic, Black, and women workers disproportionately affected.

          <p>Aston Villa has lodged a complaint with PGMOL, the referees' body, regarding the appointment of Thomas Bramall for their match against Manchester United, citing a "big mistake" that impacted their Champions League qualification hopes. The controversial decision involved Bramall blowing for a foul against Villa's Morgan Rogers, preventing a potential goal. Former referees' boss Keith Hackett criticized the appointment of an inexperienced referee for such a crucial game, suggesting that a top official like Michael Oliver should have been selected instead. The complaint highlights concerns about the consistency and quality of refereeing in critical Premier League matches.</p>

          <p>President Trump has voiced criticism of Vladimir Putin's attacks on Ukrainian cities, describing the Russian leader's actions as "absolutely CRAZY," but has not taken steps to impose new sanctions on Russia. Despite acknowledging the severity of the attacks, Trump has refused to join European allies in implementing additional financial penalties or providing increased military aid to Ukraine. This reluctance to take concrete action has created a strategic void, allowing Russia to continue its attacks without facing significant consequences from the United States. Experts suggest that Trump's approach signals a disengagement from the conflict, undermining support for Ukraine and potentially emboldening Russia to escalate its aggression.</p>

          <p>Charles Rangel, a U.S. congressman from New York City for 46 years and the last surviving member of the "Gang of Four," has died at the age of 94. Rangel, a Korean War veteran and founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, dedicated his career to fighting for affordable housing, urban revitalization, and equal opportunities. Despite facing ethics violations in 2008, including allegations of tax law violations and improper use of rent-subsidized apartments, Rangel remained a respected figure, leaving behind a legacy of public service and advocacy for his Harlem district.

The speech also touched on potential funding shifts from Harvard University to trade schools, and while Hegseth focused on men's sacrifices, Vance acknowledged the contributions of both sons and daughters of the nation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to delay tariffs on the European Union has sparked renewed discussions aimed at reaching a trade agreement. While both sides express optimism, significant differences remain regarding key issues such as consumption tax systems and digital regulations. European negotiators hope to reduce existing tariffs, but the Trump administration seems firm on maintaining a 10 percent floor. The EU is refining lists of retaliatory tariffs in case negotiations fail, while also exploring options to reduce the trade deficit by purchasing more American liquefied natural gas and microchips, though a complete elimination of the trade gap is unlikely.

          <p>Nine European Union member states, led by Italy and Denmark, are advocating for a reinterpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights to facilitate the expulsion of foreign national criminals. This push has sparked controversy, raising questions about judicial independence and the protection of human rights. Experts note that the European Court of Human Rights already considers state interests in migration cases, and the main challenges in deporting criminals often stem from lack of cooperation among member states and with third countries. Critics view this effort as a political move aimed at addressing voter concerns about migration, rather than a genuine attempt to improve legal frameworks.</p>

Despite a high percentage of pitches in the zone, hitters are making solid contact, leading to blown saves and increased ERA. The Dodgers' coaching staff aims to help Scott locate his fastball better and induce more chase on his slider, even if it means more walks. With several key relievers injured, Scott's performance is crucial, and the team hopes these adjustments will stabilize the bullpen and improve his effectiveness in save situations.</p>

          <p>Charles B. Rangel, the former dean of New York’s congressional delegation and the first Black chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has died at 94. Rangel, a mainstay of Harlem’s Democratic old guard, was first elected to Congress in 1970 and served longer than any other New Yorker but one. He was instrumental in persuading Hillary Clinton to enter electoral politics by running for the Senate from New York when Daniel Patrick Moynihan retired. Although he ventured politically beyond Harlem only once, unsuccessfully seeking the Democratic nomination for City Council president in 1969, he won re-election with monster margins in a district where, by 2010, only about one in three residents was Black.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has characterized Donald Trump's recent remarks calling Vladimir Putin "absolutely crazy" as an "emotional reaction," following Russia's intensified aerial attacks on Ukraine. Trump's comments, made after Russia launched a large-scale assault on Ukrainian cities, were dismissed by Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, as stemming from "emotional overload." Meanwhile, Germany's chancellor announced the removal of range restrictions on arms supplied to Ukraine, potentially signaling an imminent decision on providing Taurus missiles, a move Russia has warned against. The exchange underscores escalating tensions and diverging perspectives on the conflict in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>President Trump used his Memorial Day address at Arlington National Cemetery to honor fallen soldiers but also made several political remarks. He criticized the previous administration's border policies and asserted his efforts to "fix" the nation, eliciting applause from supporters. While paying tribute to the sacrifices of military personnel, Trump also promoted upcoming events like the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary and the World Cup, suggesting his presidency was divinely timed. The speech drew attention for its blend of solemn remembrance and partisan messaging, reflecting Trump's characteristic style of public address.</p>

          <p>President Trump has proposed redirecting $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to trade schools across the country, citing concerns about antisemitism at the university. The announcement follows previous actions to freeze or withdraw funding from Harvard, and signals a potential shift in federal priorities toward vocational education. Trump accused Harvard of being slow to provide information on foreign student lists and suggested that the funds could better serve trade schools, which focus on practical skills. The move reflects ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and higher education institutions, particularly regarding issues of political ideology and foreign influence.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike on a school in Gaza City sheltering displaced families resulted in the deaths of at least 54 Palestinians, according to hospital directors. The Fahmi Al-Jargawi School, housing hundreds of people, was struck, with reports of severely burned bodies recovered from classrooms. The IDF claimed it targeted a Hamas and Islamic Jihad command center and accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields. The event follows other attacks resulting in civilian casualties, and comes as mediation efforts to establish a ceasefire continue, though a Hamas proposal was rejected by the US special envoy Steve Witkoff.</p>
