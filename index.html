        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Israeli military has conducted a strike in Doha, Qatar, targeting the senior leadership of Hamas, including negotiators involved in ceasefire talks. The attack, which caused explosions in the Qatari capital, was immediately condemned by Qatar as a "cowardly Israeli attack" and a blatant violation of international law. In response, the U.S. embassy in Doha issued a shelter-in-place order for its citizens. This major escalation extends the conflict's geographic scope and complicates diplomatic efforts, occurring alongside intensified Israeli military operations and evacuation orders in Gaza City.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. labor market created 911,000 fewer jobs through March 2025 than initially reported, according to a significant downward revision from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This adjustment, the largest on record since 2002, suggests that the economy and income growth were on a much weaker footing prior to the recent economic slowdown. The sectors most affected by the markdown were leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, and retail. This new data may provide the Federal Reserve with more justification to consider interest rate cuts to support the weakening employment picture. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Asian longhorned tick, an invasive species, has been identified in Maine for the first time, marking its farthest northeastern spread in the United States since its initial discovery in 2017. This tick poses a serious threat to livestock and can transmit diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever to humans. A unique danger of this species is that females can reproduce asexually, allowing a single tick to rapidly create a large infestation. Officials are emphasizing the importance of surveillance and advise the public to take precautions by checking for ticks after being outdoors and using appropriate repellants.</p>

He is accused of stealing a designer duffel bag from a boat on Lake Minnetonka during the Fourth of July weekend. The bag reportedly contained over $270,000 worth of valuables, including a $228,000 Rolex watch, thousands in cash, and limited-edition clothing. Authorities allegedly found the bag in Frattalone's home, though the watch was missing. He is scheduled for his first court appearance on September 11.</p>

          <p>The U.S. manufacturing sector has shed 42,000 jobs since April, with a total loss of 33,000 positions in 2025, according to a new analysis of government labor data. A report from the Center for American Progress attributes this decline to economic uncertainty fueled by the Trump administration's tariffs, restrictive immigration policies, and changes to renewable energy tax credits. Companies, particularly in durable goods manufacturing, are reportedly hesitant to hire due to unpredictable costs and ongoing legal challenges to the administration's trade policies.

          <p>The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) announced that the economy added 911,000 fewer jobs in the year ending March 2025 than previously estimated, indicating a significantly weaker labor market. This routine annual revision has gained political significance, coming weeks after President Donald Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following a weak monthly jobs report. Trump had previously expressed frustration with a similar, smaller downward revision in 2024, claiming without evidence that the numbers were manipulated. This large adjustment adds fuel to the political debate over the health of the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers with large cash reserves, deciding between opening a single jumbo CD or multiple standard CDs in a laddering strategy presents a key choice. Experts note that while jumbo CDs, typically requiring a $100,000 minimum deposit, used to offer higher rates, the current inverted yield curve means shorter-term standard CDs can be just as competitive. The decision hinges on balancing the simplicity of a single jumbo CD against the flexibility of a CD ladder, which allows for staggered access to funds. Savers should also consider FDIC insurance limits, which cap coverage at $250,000 per depositor per institution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a CEO who has conducted over 500 interviews, there are three subtle behaviors from candidates that signal major red flags to hiring managers. The first is tardiness, even by a minute, as it suggests poor planning and a lack of respect for time. The second is giving generic, theoretical answers instead of specific examples rooted in personal experience, which fails to demonstrate proven skills. The final red flag is low energy or a lack of engagement, as the interview is considered a candidate's best-case performance, and disinterest at this stage predicts poor performance on the job.</p>

          <p>China has revealed its new Type 100 tank, a smaller and lighter vehicle that represents a significant shift in its military's approach to land warfare. The tank is equipped with a diesel-electric hybrid power system, allowing for quieter, stealthier movement, and relies on advanced active protection systems rather than heavy armor. Its most revolutionary feature is its high degree of "informationisation," which integrates crewed and uncrewed systems to enhance situational awareness and coordinate networked firepower. This design indicates a strategic pivot towards a more technologically advanced, information-driven form of combat.</p>

          <p>James Talarico, a 36-year-old Democratic state representative and Presbyterian seminarian from Texas, has announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Republican John Cornyn. Talarico has gained national attention through viral social media clips where he articulates progressive political positions through the lens of his Christian faith. Some Democratic strategists believe his unique approach and appeal to younger voters could offer a new model for the party in Texas and other traditionally conservative states, though he faces a challenging primary and general election.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Braun, a convicted drug dealer whose 10-year federal prison sentence was commuted by President Donald Trump in 2021, has been found guilty of violating the terms of his supervised release. He was arrested in connection with several recent crimes, including menacing a hospital nurse, threatening a synagogue member, and groping his family's nanny. A federal judge ruled that prosecutors had proven the violations occurred, and Braun, who has been in custody since April, now faces a potential sentence of up to five more years in prison.</p>

          <p>A Russian glide bomb attack on the village of Yarova in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region has killed at least 24 civilians and injured nearly two dozen more. The strike occurred as residents were lining up to collect their pensions, an act Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned as a "frankly brutal" and "savage" attack on ordinary people. This event is part of a recent escalation in Russian aerial strikes and has prompted renewed calls from Ukraine for stronger international sanctions and a more forceful global response to halt such attacks.</p>

          <h2>US Fossil Fuel Subsidies Total Nearly $31 Billion Annually, New Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 09:00:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis by the environmental group Oil Change International reports that the U.S. government provides nearly $31 billion in subsidies to the fossil-fuel industry each year. This figure, which has more than doubled since 2017, includes tax breaks, royalty relief, and other forms of financial support that directly contradict climate goals. The report highlights that these subsidies create a massive barrier to decarbonization by making new fossil fuel production artificially profitable, with the benefits largely going to corporate shareholders and executives rather than contributing to a green energy transition.

          <p>Shake Shack is launching a new menu centered around French onion flavors, including a French Onion Soup Burger, beer-battered onion rings, and Parmesan garlic fries. This move is part of the company's strategy to lean into premium, limited-time offerings rather than compete in the value wars dominating the fast-food industry. The CEO described the approach as the "democratization of fine dining," aiming to provide high-quality, innovative items at a price point around $11, which is significantly lower than what a similar burger might cost at a full-service restaurant.

          <p>House Democrats have released a page from a birthday book given to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which features a sexually suggestive drawing of a woman's torso with a cryptic note and a signature that appears to be Donald Trump's. The note reads, "We have certain things in common, Jeffrey... may every day be another wonderful secret." The White House has vehemently denied that Trump authored the note or created the drawing, calling the story false and asserting that the signature is not his. The release has fueled political controversy, with Democrats accusing the president of a cover-up.</p>

          <p>A U.S. House committee has publicly released a 238-page scrapbook created for Jeffrey Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003, revealing its high-profile contributors. The book, compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell, contains a collection of flattering and often highly sexualized letters and photos from powerful figures, with notes attributed to Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, and current UK ambassador Peter Mandelson. The contents, which include a cryptic message signed "Donald" under a sketch of a naked woman, have intensified scrutiny of the extensive social and political connections maintained by the convicted sex offender.</p>
