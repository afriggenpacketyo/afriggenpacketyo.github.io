        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba's cloud computing unit launched the Qwen3 family, featuring eight AI models ranging from 600 million to 235 billion parameters. Analysts note that these models demonstrate China's narrowing technological gap with the United States, even amid export restrictions on advanced semiconductors. Su Lian Jye from Omdia suggests that the impact of US sanctions on China's AI development has diminished due to the increasing availability of domestic AI chips from companies like Huawei and Cambricon Technologies. This article suggests that China is becoming increasingly competitive in the AI space despite facing external pressures. Optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas hospitality workers, who heavily rely on tips, are still waiting for President Trump to fulfill his campaign promise to eliminate taxes on tips. Inflation has made basic necessities more expensive, increasing the importance of tip income for workers like Sebastian Espinoza. While the White House claims to be working with Congress to address the issue, two bills are currently under consideration: one to eliminate federal income tax on tips and another to also raise the sub-minimum wage. The article highlights the financial strain on tipped workers and their desire for tangible action on tax relief.</p>

          <p>Yosemite National Park officials are warning visitors to be cautious of mule deer, which cause more injuries than any other animal in the park. Despite their seemingly harmless appearance, mule deer are wild and can become aggressive if startled, especially when approached or fed. Bucks are particularly prone to aggressive behavior during mating season, and females can be protective of their fawns. Officials emphasize that feeding and approaching wildlife is illegal and advise maintaining a safe distance. The article aims to raise awareness about wildlife safety in Yosemite.</p>

          <p>An 18-wheeler carrying eight million dimes for the U.S. Mint overturned on U.S. Route 287 in Alvord, Texas, resulting in a spill of freshly minted coins across the highway.

Despite initial excitement, residents did not flock to the scene to collect the spilled dimes, especially after heavy rain washed away some of the remaining coins.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York City Rent Guidelines Board voted in favor of rent increases for nearly one million rent-stabilized apartments, citing rising costs for landlords. The preliminary vote supports increases of 1.75 to 4.75 percent on one-year leases and 4.75 to 7.75 percent on two-year leases. Tenant advocates argue the increases will harm lower-income residents, while landlords claim the increases are insufficient to cover rising expenses.

          <p>New car sales in the U.S. surged in March as buyers sought to avoid anticipated tariff increases on imported vehicles and auto parts.

However, a study projects that overall vehicle sales could fall significantly in the coming years if the tariffs remain in place.

          <p>During Microsoft's earnings call with investors on Wednesday, tariffs came up only once, during prepared remarks.

Microsoft does not currently expect any material impact from tariffs, and that it had not seen elevated buying of its products ahead of tariffs during the quarter. Optimism score is 60.</p>
