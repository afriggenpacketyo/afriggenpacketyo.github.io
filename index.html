          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-06 18:33:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Air Traffic Controllers Association has directed its members to continue working without pay during the U.S. government shutdown, cautioning that failure to report for duty could result in termination. This mandate comes as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy reported a slight uptick in sick calls among controllers, acknowledging the severe impact on morale from being required to work unpaid. The Federal Aviation Administration designates air traffic controllers as essential workers, ensuring they will eventually receive back pay, yet the ongoing situation raises significant concerns about potential air travel delays and the long-term effects of understaffing in control towers nationwide. The union emphasizes the professionalism required despite the financial hardships.</p>

          <p>A tornado that devastated Enderlin, North Dakota, in June has been reclassified by the National Weather Service as an EF-5, the most powerful rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, making it the first U.S. twister of this intensity in 12 years. The federal agency's Grand Forks office estimated wind speeds surpassed 210 mph, leading to significant destruction including extensive tree damage, the overturning of several grain-loaded train cars, and the complete obliteration of a farm. The tragic event lasted nearly 20 minutes, creating a 12-mile path of devastation and resulting in the deaths of two men and a woman. This reclassification highlights the catastrophic force of the storm and its profound impact on the affected communities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government is set to acquire a 10% ownership stake in Trilogy Metals, Inc., a Canadian company holding extensive mining claims in Alaska's remote Ambler Mining District, through a $35.6 million investment. This strategic move, announced by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, is intended to secure vital critical mineral supplies for the nation, with the agreement also including warrants for an additional 7.5% of the company. Concurrently, President Trump signed an executive order to enhance the utilization of Alaska's resources and support the construction of a 200-mile road in the state. This initiative underscores a significant governmental effort to strengthen domestic supply chains for essential minerals, despite the company's reported financial losses.</p>

This event occurred shortly after news broke of her split from husband Keith Urban, following 19 years of marriage, with court documents indicating she filed for divorce on September 30 citing "irreconcilable differences" and "marital difficulties." Sources close to the couple suggested the separation was "inevitable," as they had reportedly been living separately for a period.

          <p>The Supreme Court has refused to consider Ghislaine Maxwell's appeal to overturn her 2021 conviction and 20-year prison sentence for her role in a scheme to sexually exploit and abuse minor girls with Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell had argued that a 2007 nonprosecution agreement between Epstein and federal prosecutors in Miami should have barred her own prosecution. However, lower courts and the Justice Department maintained the agreement was geographically limited and did not apply to her charges in New York. This decision means her conviction and sentence remain in effect, barring a presidential pardon, which President Trump indicated he would "take a look at" when asked.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles city leaders have approved significant increases in parking costs and extended paid-parking hours, marking the first rate hike in over a decade for its 35,000 metered spaces. Meter prices will rise by 50 cents per hour, and paid parking will now apply on Sundays, with extended hours until midnight in nightlife areas and 8 p.m. elsewhere. City transportation officials assert these changes aim to encourage vehicle turnover, thereby assisting businesses, and are expected to generate an additional $14.4 million for the city's financially strained coffers. Neighboring cities like Beverly Hills and Santa Monica have also recently raised their parking rates.</p>

While the White House cited FBI data showing a rise in violent crime, the Memphis Police Department reported a decrease, with murder at a six-year low. These discrepancies are attributed to differences in geographical scope—FBI data includes a nine-county metro area, while MPD focuses on city limits—and counting methods, where the FBI counts each victim versus the MPD counting each incident. Experts advise caution and careful examination of definitions when interpreting crime data.</p>

          <p>A career federal prosecutor in Virginia, Elizabeth Yusi, reportedly believes there is no probable cause to file criminal mortgage fraud charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James, despite pressure from Trump allies. This sets up a potential confrontation with Lindsey Halligan, a Trump appointee and ally with no prosecutorial experience, who was installed as U.S. attorney and secured an indictment against former FBI director James Comey after his predecessor resisted. The case highlights concerns about political influence in the Justice Department, with several prosecutors in the eastern district of Virginia having been fired or resigned amid increased pressure to pursue Trump's perceived enemies.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has named Frank Bisignano, the current Social Security Administration Commissioner, to the newly created role of CEO of the IRS, overseeing its daily operations while retaining his SSA position. Bessent cited shared technological and customer service goals between the agencies as justification. However, Social Security advocates express concern about Bisignano's ability to lead two major government agencies simultaneously, especially given recent job cuts at the SSA and the lack of a confirmed deputy commissioner. The SSA, however, asserts that Bisignano's appointment reflects the significant customer service improvements achieved under his leadership.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's decision to relinquish its "developing country" status and associated privileges at the WTO is a strategic move, gaining more than it loses. The author posits this as a "tactical retreat" akin to Mao Zedong's protracted war theory, allowing China to remove a key criticism from the U.S. and EU while conceding little substance. By aligning itself with the Global South and repositioning its political narrative, China aims to outlast stronger adversaries and reframe the international trade battlefield. The article suggests this move is a calculated maneuver to strengthen its long-term global standing.</p>

China and India, the largest sources of international students, saw declines of 12.4% and 44.5% respectively. Many international students are also choosing to remain in the U.S. during breaks, fearing re-entry issues even with valid visas.

OpenAI President Mira Murati underscored the industry's need to collaborate to meet massive demand for AI services.

Schiffmann claims the controversy and vandalism were part of a deliberate marketing strategy to generate "mindshare," believing traditional marketing is passé. Despite significant investment in marketing and the acquisition of "Friend.com," only about 1,000 pendants have been activated, and the company currently lacks a clear path to profitability.

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he would consider invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy the military if federal courts or local officials impede his ability to send the National Guard for law enforcement operations. His comments followed a federal judge blocking troop deployment to Portland, a city Trump described as a "burning hell hole." Trump's deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, characterized rulings against the White House's agenda as a "legal insurrection." The Insurrection Act of 1807 grants the president sweeping emergency powers for domestic military deployment, last used in 1992 during the Los Angeles riots.</p>

          <p>Metropolitan Police have dismantled an international criminal gang suspected of smuggling up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones from the UK to China in the past year, marking the largest operation against phone thefts in the UK. The investigation began when a victim traced a stolen iPhone to a warehouse near Heathrow Airport, leading to the discovery of nearly 900 phones in one shipment. So far, 18 suspects have been arrested, and over 2,000 stolen devices recovered. Police believe the gang is responsible for exporting a significant portion of phones stolen in London, where thefts have nearly tripled in four years due to high demand for second-hand devices overseas.</p>
