        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has proposed new regulations targeting the market power of Apple and Google. The CMA aims to address concerns over app store commissions, inconsistent review processes, and barriers to competition on mobile operating systems and browsers. These changes could force the tech giants to allow alternative payment systems and make it easier for users to switch between platforms. Both Apple and Google have criticized the proposals, citing potential risks to user security and innovation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of 115 international aid groups has issued a stark warning about "mass starvation" in Gaza, attributing the crisis to the Israeli government's ongoing siege. The joint statement highlights the severe depletion of supplies, with aid workers themselves now struggling for food and facing extreme danger during distributions. The Gaza Ministry of Health reports a rising death toll from malnutrition, particularly among children and the elderly. Organizations like Doctors Without Borders and Oxfam are calling for an end to the restrictions that they say are causing chaos and death.</p>

          <p>The sentencing hearing for Bryan Kohberger will provide the first opportunity for the families of the Idaho murder victims to address him directly through impact statements. Public attention is high, with figures like Donald Trump calling for Kohberger to explain his motive for the crime. The two roommates who survived the attack may also speak, though their participation remains their personal choice. This hearing is seen as a crucial step for the community and families to find some form of closure following the tragic events.</p>

          <p>The BBC has confirmed it will air a previously recorded series of MasterChef, even after misconduct allegations against presenters Gregg Wallace and John Torode were upheld. The corporation stated the decision was made after consulting with the contestants, whose journeys are considered the show's primary focus. While the BBC has not yet decided on the fate of a celebrity spin-off, it emphasized that broadcasting the series does not diminish the seriousness of the findings against the presenters. The editing will likely be adjusted to place more emphasis on the amateur chefs.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian and Russian delegations are scheduled to meet for a third round of ceasefire negotiations as President Trump threatens significant new economic sanctions against Moscow. The talks, initiated by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, aim to address humanitarian issues and work towards a lasting peace, though the Kremlin has downplayed expectations for a breakthrough. Trump has expressed growing frustration with Russia's actions, setting a September deadline for a peace deal and shifting US policy to endorse weapon sales to Ukraine. Analysts suggest Moscow is proceeding cautiously, weighing Trump's unpredictable approach.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has concluded its investigation into the 2023 plane crash that killed Eugene Peltola Jr., husband of former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola. The final report identifies the probable cause as a combination of the plane being overweight with moose meat and the significant drag caused by a set of moose antlers attached to a wing strut. Peltola, the sole occupant, was transporting the meat for a group of hunters in a remote area of western Alaska. The report notes that turbulent conditions likely exacerbated the effects of the excess weight and drag.</p>

          <p>German officials have dismissed reports of a serious division within the ruling coalition regarding its policy on the Gaza conflict. The speculation arose after Germany declined to sign a joint declaration with 28 other Western nations condemning the "inhumane killing" of Palestinian civilians. Senior members of the junior coalition partner, the Social Democrats (SPD), had publicly urged the government to join the condemnation. However, a top aide to Chancellor Friedrich Merz insisted the coalition is united on its goals, arguing that private diplomacy is more effective.</p>

          <p>Two former City traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for interest-rate rigging overturned by the UK's Supreme Court after a decade-long legal battle. The men were among 19 traders convicted in the UK and US for manipulating the Libor and Euribor benchmark rates during the financial crisis. They have consistently maintained their innocence, arguing they were scapegoated for what were then common commercial practices. The ruling deems their original trials unfair, and the Serious Fraud Office will not seek a retrial.</p>

          <p>A shooting in a rural area near Maguiresbridge, County Fermanagh, has left two people dead and two others injured. The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service responded to the incident on Drummeer Road, transporting one victim by air ambulance to Belfast and another by road to a local hospital. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has closed the road but stated there is no ongoing risk to the public.

          <p>The upcoming EU-China summit in Beijing is clouded by significant trade frictions and political disagreements, with China having already cut the planned talks from two days to one. The EU's primary complaint is its €400 billion trade deficit, which it blames on China's protectionist industrial policies, subsidies, and the resulting "dumping" of cheap goods like electric vehicles. Additional tensions stem from China's export curbs on critical rare earth minerals and its tacit support for Russia's war in Ukraine. Analysts believe a breakthrough is unlikely, viewing the summit as an attempt to manage barriers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old man, Terrance Lamar Bowie, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder in Shelby Township, Michigan. The investigation began when police received a 911 call from a man who immediately hung up, prompting a welfare check at an apartment. Upon arrival, officers were met by Bowie, who allegedly told them there was a dead body inside, where they discovered a deceased 27-year-old woman. Authorities have confirmed the victim and suspect knew each other and that it was not a random act of violence. Bowie's bond has been set at $2 million.</p>

          <p>The UK government has imposed its first-ever sanctions specifically targeting people-smuggling networks, freezing the assets of 25 individuals and entities and banning them from the country. The list includes suspected gang leaders, a Chinese company accused of manufacturing small boats for illegal crossings, and others involved in facilitating the journeys. Foreign Secretary David Lammy called the move a "landmark moment" in the fight against gangs who profit from risking vulnerable lives. However, migration experts have expressed skepticism, suggesting the impact may be limited given the vast scale of the smuggling industry.</p>

The judge granted the unusual sentence of probation after a psychological assessment concluded Phillips was under "extreme emotional distress" at the time, having just moved to Connecticut after a period of homelessness.

          <p>China has achieved a near-monopoly on the refining of rare earth elements, critical components for everything from smartphones to advanced defense systems. This dominance was built over decades through strategic industrial policy, which included consolidating hundreds of small, polluting mines into six state-controlled super-companies. The article details how this consolidation allowed Beijing to control both supply and price, creating a powerful tool in its trade disputes with the West. Recent export controls have highlighted the world's dependence on China, galvanizing new investment in U.S.-based refining capabilities for the first time in years. (not investment advice)</p>
