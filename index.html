          <p>The CEO of Crocs has described the current consumer environment as "concerning," prompting the footwear company to plan a reduction in orders for the second half of the year. Citing cautious discretionary spending among U.S. consumers facing price increases, the company noted that retail partners are also acting more carefully. This cautious outlook led to a significant drop in Crocs' stock price after it issued a weaker-than-expected forecast for the third quarter. To protect profitability, the company is pulling back on promotions and resetting inventory for its Heydude brand, actions that are expected to create short-term sales headwinds.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has sided with the Trump administration, throwing out a lower court's contempt order against federal officials regarding the deportation of Venezuelan migrants. The case stems from the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members, which a district judge had ordered to be halted. When planes carrying the migrants were not turned around, the judge found officials in criminal contempt, but the D.C. Circuit Court has now vacated that order. The majority opinion stated the ruling was necessary to prevent extended conflict between the executive and judicial branches over core functions like foreign policy, while the dissenting judge argued it undermines the rule of law.</p>

          <p>House Majority Whip Tom Emmer has sharply criticized Minnesota Governor Tim Walz following the release of David Brom, a man who murdered his family with an axe as a teenager in 1988. Brom was granted supervised work release after serving 37 years, a decision made possible by a 2023 state law that limited life sentences for juvenile offenders. Emmer accused the governor of enacting soft-on-crime policies that undermine justice for victims and risk public safety. The law, signed by Walz, does not grant automatic release but allows juvenile offenders to seek supervised release after serving a minimum of 15 years.</p>

Trump asserted on social media that the tariffs have had a "huge positive impact" on the stock market and that reversing them now would be a "judicial tragedy." Market analysts note that while markets have shown short-term positive reactions to tariff suspensions, the president's shifting rhetoric often creates instability. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that Bitcoin's traditional four-year price cycle, which has historically revolved around its "halving" events, may be ending due to fundamental market shifts. The recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has introduced significant institutional investment, altering typical price discovery patterns and causing Bitcoin to hit an all-time high before the last halving, not after. Experts also point to a more supportive regulatory environment and increased accumulation by long-term holders as factors that are dampening volatility. This shift could mean that the massive 70-80% price crashes seen in previous cycles are a thing of the past. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the margin pressure from inflation, the club highlights the restaurant's strong traffic and brand loyalty as key strengths.

          <p>A new Environmental Protection Agency proposal aims to revoke a 2009 "endangerment finding," which serves as the legal basis for regulating greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. If passed, this would repeal all greenhouse gas standards for light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicles, easing pressure on automakers to produce electric vehicles. Experts suggest this would allow manufacturers more flexibility to align their vehicle production with the actual pace of consumer EV adoption, which has recently shown signs of slowing. While the auto industry has invested heavily in EVs, this deregulatory move under the Trump administration could enable a renewed focus on internal combustion engine vehicles to meet market demand.</p>

Key factors that could contribute to a price drop include cooling inflation, which is now approaching the Federal Reserve's target, and an easing of geopolitical tensions. Historically, gold prices rise during periods of economic uncertainty and conflict, so a stabilization in these areas could reduce demand for the metal as a safe-haven asset. While timing the market is difficult, monitoring these macroeconomic indicators could help investors identify a more affordable entry point into the precious metal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Byron Allen's Allen Media Group has agreed to sell 10 of its television stations to Atlanta-based Gray Media for $171 million. The deal includes network-affiliated stations in markets such as Huntsville, Alabama, and Fort Wayne, Indiana. This move marks a retrenchment for Allen, who had been on a major buying spree in recent years with the goal of becoming the largest independent TV operator in the U.S., but was left with significant debt. Allen Media Group will continue to own other assets, including several television channels and the Weather Channel, while Gray Media will expand its presence into three new markets through the acquisition.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has altered or removed information from government environmental websites at a much higher rate in its second term compared to its first, according to a report by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI). The watchdog group found 70% more significant changes in the first 100 days of the current term, with a particular focus on erasing information related to environmental justice and diversity, equity, and inclusion. Key resources like the Council on Environmental Quality's Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool have been taken down. While some climate change information has also been removed, the erasure of environmental justice content has been more comprehensive.</p>

          <p>A fast-moving wildfire, named the Canyon Fire, has forced the evacuation of thousands of residents in Southern California. The blaze ignited Thursday near the border of Ventura and Los Angeles counties and quickly grew to nearly 5,000 acres by Friday morning with zero percent containment. Extreme heat, with temperatures forecast to reach 100°F, and dry conditions are fueling its rapid spread and complicating firefighting efforts. More than 2,700 people are under mandatory evacuation orders, while another 14,000 have been warned to be ready to leave, as officials urge residents in affected areas to take all orders seriously.</p>

          <p>A High Court in Pretoria, South Africa, has ordered that the remains of former Zambian President Edgar Lungu be returned to Zambia for a state funeral, ruling against the wishes of his family. Lungu died in South Africa while receiving medical treatment, and his family wanted him buried there, citing political tensions with his successor, President Hakainde Hichilema. The Zambian government, however, insisted on a state funeral in the capital, Lusaka. The court determined that a former president's right to be honored by the state outweighs the personal wishes of the family, ordering them to surrender the body to Zambian authorities immediately.</p>

          <p>UK fashion retailer River Island has received High Court approval for a restructuring plan that includes closing 33 stores to avoid insolvency. The company cited a shift to online shopping and rising operating costs for its financial difficulties, warning it could run out of cash by the end of August without the plan. In addition to the closures, the brand will seek rent reductions at 71 other locations and make about 110 head office roles redundant. The company's chief executive stated the move will provide a strong platform to deliver its transformation strategy and align its store portfolio with customer needs.</p>

          <p>German football club Bayern Munich has announced it will end its commercial sponsorship deal with "Visit Rwanda" following months of criticism over the African nation's alleged role in the conflict in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo. The partnership, which included displaying 'Visit Rwanda' on pitchside advertising, will now transition to focus solely on football development through the club's youth academy in Kigali. The move comes after DR Congo's foreign minister called on the club to end its "blood-stained" deal, and after Bayern fans protested the partnership. The club confirmed its contract, running until 2028, will remain in place with the new focus.</p>

In response, private equity firm KKR has urged Assura's board to back its cash offer, arguing it faces no competition hurdles.

Her exit reshapes the dynamics of the crowded Democratic field, opening up access to her network of prominent Bay Area political donors.

A U.S. Customs ruling clarified that these specific gold bars, often used to back commodity exchange contracts, are not exempt from the sweeping tariffs. The Swiss precious metals association stated the tariff makes it economically unviable to export these products to the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A stark contrast has emerged between the U.S. government's climate policy and a growing international legal consensus on climate responsibility. The International Court of Justice recently issued a unanimous opinion that states have a binding legal obligation to protect the climate system, making failure to do so a potentially wrongful act. In contrast, the U.S. EPA announced plans to rescind its 2009 endangerment finding, the legal foundation for nearly all federal climate regulations. This divergence places the U.S. in a form of legal isolation, as international courts increasingly affirm that climate change is a human rights issue that triggers binding obligations for both nations and corporations.</p>
