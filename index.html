          <p>Texas Republicans are initiating mid-decade congressional redistricting to gain an advantage in the 2026 midterms, a move prompted by former President Trump. This challenges established political norms, forcing Democrats in states like New York and California to consider retaliatory measures. However, Democratic efforts are hampered by independent redistricting commissions and state laws designed to prevent such political maneuvering. The situation highlights a growing partisan battle over electoral maps, where Democrats may be forced to abandon their own principles on fair districting to remain competitive.</p>

Everett discusses her long journey from waitress to cabaret star and how the show helped her process personal loss, including the deaths of family members. Though not renewed for a fourth season, Everett expresses immense gratitude for the opportunity to create a show that resonated deeply with audiences.</p>

          <p>Patients across England are facing significant distress as the latest strike by resident doctors forces the cancellation of crucial medical procedures. Individuals with serious conditions, including cancer and chronic pain, have had their surgeries postponed, with some fearing the delays could have life-threatening consequences. While some patients express frustration at the striking doctors, others voice sympathy for their concerns over pay and working conditions. The walkouts have left many feeling lost and ignored by a system struggling to manage the ongoing industrial action.</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of 220 Members of Parliament has signed a letter calling on UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to formally recognize a Palestinian state. The letter, supported by over half of Labour MPs and figures from eight other parties, argues the move is a vital step toward a two-state solution and would send a powerful message of support. In response, Starmer stated that recognition must be part of a broader, coordinated peace plan developed with allies. The pressure mounts as France commits to recognition and international leaders demand an end to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass stated she profoundly regrets her trip to Ghana, which coincided with devastating wildfires that ravaged parts of the city. In an interview, Bass explained that there was no indication of the impending danger or historic hurricane-force winds when she departed. The mayor faced intense criticism for the trip, returning a day after the fires began, and subsequently replaced the city's fire chief. Bass defended her administration's budget decisions and claimed she was not properly briefed on the escalating fire risk before she left.</p>

          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the SHARE Act, has been introduced in Congress to encourage public companies to distribute stock to their non-executive employees. The legislation would offer a 3-percentage-point corporate tax rate reduction to large companies that grant at least 5% of their stock to the lowest-paid 80% of their workforce. Proponents, like Rep. Tom Suozzi, argue the plan could transfer nearly $4 trillion in wealth to about 40 million middle-class Americans, aiming to broaden economic ownership. The bill is designed to offset dilution costs for companies with the tax cut, promoting employee loyalty and shared prosperity. (not investment advice)</p>

The case began in 2005 with a police investigation in Florida and culminated in federal charges in 2019, shortly before his death in custody. Key events include a controversial 2007 non-prosecution agreement that granted immunity to Epstein and his co-conspirators, and civil lawsuits from victims that eventually helped unseal critical records.

Although the island only appears briefly in the novel, it served as a catalyst for the author, who had a real-life encounter there that informed the book's central theme: the legacy of a narcissistic, con-man father. The piece delves into how a location can shape a writer's work in unexpected ways, even if it isn't the primary setting. For le Carré, Corfu became a place to contemplate themes of identity, influence, and betrayal that are central to his protagonist's story.</p>

This rhetoric comes as the Director of National Intelligence released documents alleging the Obama administration promoted a "contrived narrative" about Russian interference.

          <h2>Analysis Questions Lack of Backlash Over Taxpayer-Funded Trump Trip to Scottish Golf Resorts</h2>

          <p>An opinion piece questions why President Trump's five-day trip to Scotland, which is primarily focused on visiting his personal golf resorts, has not generated more significant public and media backlash. The author argues the visit is another example of Trump using the presidency to promote his business interests at taxpayer expense, a practice that has become normalized. The article highlights the high cost of such trips, estimating that his visits to Mar-a-Lago alone have cost taxpayers at least $34 million. The author concludes that Trump has been emboldened to continue this behavior due to a lack of resistance from Congress and other institutions.</p>

          <p>A visual report from inside New York's largest federal immigration courthouse captures the anxiety and emotional turmoil faced by migrants amid the Trump administration's crackdown. The article documents a single day where individuals attending routine hearings were unexpectedly detained by federal agents in the courthouse hallways, a practice that has drawn legal challenges. Scenes of a brother being torn from his sister and a father being apprehended while his young children waited outside illustrate the human cost of these courthouse arrests. The report highlights the precarious situation for migrants, for whom simply showing up to court can lead to immediate detention and deportation proceedings.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed a key police accountability measure by ending Department of Justice investigations and consent decrees for nearly two dozen police departments, including in Louisville, Kentucky. These agreements were designed to force reform in departments found to have a pattern of misconduct, such as the LMPD following the killing of Breonna Taylor. The DOJ's civil rights division head called the consent decrees a "failed experiment," a move that activists see as a major setback for police reform. While some city officials have pledged to continue with reforms voluntarily, critics question their ability to self-enforce without federal oversight.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, President Donald Trump stated he believes the central bank is prepared to start lowering interest rates. Trump described the meeting as positive and interpreted Powell's comments on the country's economic health as a signal that policy easing is forthcoming. For months, the president has publicly pressured the Fed to cut rates to stimulate the economy further. Despite past rancor, the tone from both the White House and the Fed appeared more conciliatory after the meeting, though administration officials maintain a review of the central bank is still needed.

          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has lowered its financial outlook for the year after reporting a 29% drop in second-quarter operating profit. The company attributed the decline to a €1.3 billion hit from U.S. tariffs and €700 million in restructuring costs during the first half of the year. VW now projects a lower operating return on sales and expects full-year sales to be flat, a downgrade from its previous forecast of up to 5% growth. The results highlight the significant challenges facing European carmakers, including U.S. trade policy and intense competition. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump initially deflected the question, citing the sensitivity of the interview, before adding that he is "allowed to do it."

She speculates that Kohberger's primary target may have been Madison Mogen, and he became enraged when he found Goncalves in bed with her, disrupting his plans and leading to a violent assault. At Kohberger's sentencing, Goncalves's mother and sister delivered scathing victim impact statements, condemning him and expressing their profound loss.

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has announced the launch of a new political party, aiming to challenge the UK's established political order. Polling suggests a Corbyn-led party could capture around 10% of the vote, potentially drawing support from Labour and, most significantly, the Green Party. This could fragment the left-wing vote, possibly benefiting right-wing parties like Reform UK in a general election. The new party's first major test will be the local elections in May, with its success likely depending on its appeal to young voters and its ability to form electoral pacts with the Greens.</p>

In an effort to maintain services, NHS England has instructed hospitals to avoid canceling non-urgent work unless absolutely necessary.
