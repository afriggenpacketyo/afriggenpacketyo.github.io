          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones, prompting an outpouring of support from political figures across the spectrum. The article details the specifics of Biden's diagnosis, including a Gleason score of 9, and notes that the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management. Vice President JD Vance questioned whether the American people had a clear picture of Biden's health while he was in office, sparking debate about transparency and fitness for duty.

          <p>China has accused the United States of undermining their preliminary trade agreement after the U.S. issued an industry warning against using Chinese chips, specifically those from Huawei. The article relays that Beijing has demanded that the Trump administration correct its mistakes, calling the U.S. Commerce Department's guidance discriminatory and market distorting. The warning came shortly after the Trump administration announced a "China trade deal" following high-level talks in Geneva, Switzerland. The U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods could be dialed back up if a broader trade deal cannot be reached by the time the pause expires.</p>

          <p>Portugal's ruling Democratic Alliance is set to govern again in a minority government after recent elections, but the hard-right Chega party has emerged as a significant political force. The article explains that Chega, with its anti-immigrant message, garnered over 22 percent of the vote, signaling a shift in Portuguese politics. Analysts suggest this rise will likely pressure the government to adopt more right-leaning stances on issues like immigration. The center-left Socialist Party experienced major losses, marking its worst political performance since the end of the Salazar dictatorship, highlighting Chega's inroads into traditionally left-leaning regions.</p>

The delay in a major ground offensive reflects disagreements between far-right ministers pushing for re-occupation and top generals concerned about sustainability and hostage safety.

The agreement on plant and animal health is expected to benefit food producers, while the key concession made by the UK was an extension to the agreement on fisheries by 12 years. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that Brexit has caused a 4% reduction in GDP, and fully compensating for that would require rejoining the single market and customs union.</p>
