          <p>The United States is conducting a review of the multi-billion dollar Aukus submarine agreement with the UK and Australia to ensure it aligns with the "America First" agenda. This review, led by Elbridge Colby, raises questions about the US commitment to sharing advanced submarine technology. Both Australia and the UK have downplayed the review, emphasizing the importance of the pact for security in the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic regions. Experts suggest the review may lead to a shift in focus away from submarines, while China would likely view a US withdrawal as a victory.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has appointed eight new advisors to the CDC's vaccine recommendations committee, circumventing the usual CDC selection process. The appointees include individuals who have previously criticized vaccine recommendations or questioned their safety, such as Dr. Robert Malone and Dr. Martin Kulldorff. This move has drawn criticism from medical professionals who express concerns about the lack of transparency and potential for undermining public confidence in vaccines. Kennedy defends his picks as committed to evidence-based medicine, while public health advocates worry about the potential for an anti-vaccine agenda.</p>

The hosts, who are DACA recipients themselves, feel betrayed by the silence, especially given the support artists showed during the California wildfires.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a new species of dinosaur, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, in a Mongolian museum collection, which they say rewrites the evolutionary history of tyrannosaurs. The 86-million-year-old skeletons belong to the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including the T. rex. Khankhuuluu represents an evolutionary shift from small hunters to formidable giants, weighing about 750kg. The species also exhibits early stages of features key to tyrannosaurs' dominance, such as skull anatomy that enabled a strong jaw.</p>
