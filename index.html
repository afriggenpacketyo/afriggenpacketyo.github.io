          <p>Train services connecting Glasgow and London faced significant disruptions due to a fallen tree damaging overhead electric lines in southern Scotland. Avanti West Coast reported blocked lines between Lockerbie and Carstairs, leading to delays and cancellations. Passengers were advised to use alternative east coast rail services or request refunds, while Network Rail Scotland worked to repair the damaged lines, aiming to reopen the route by mid-morning. The incident highlights the vulnerability of transportation infrastructure to adverse weather conditions.</p>

          <p>Thames Water faces an uncertain future after KKR, a US private equity firm, withdrew from plans to invest Â£4 billion into the company. This setback increases the risk of the company collapsing into government-supervised administration. Thames Water serves approximately a quarter of the UK's population, primarily in London and southern England, and is burdened with debts of around Â£19 billion. Despite KKR's withdrawal, Thames Water Chairman Sir Adrian Montague expressed the company's commitment to finding a sustainable recapitalization plan with creditors and stakeholders. Regardless of the ownership situation, water services are expected to continue without interruption.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the incident between Max Verstappen and George Russell during the Spanish Grand Prix, where Red Bull initially ordered Verstappen to concede his position after contact in Turn One. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner cited previous penalties as the reason for the decision, but stewards later ruled no further action was necessary, suggesting Verstappen could have justifiably kept the place. Horner admitted that the decision to pit Verstappen for hard tires under the safety car was also a mistake, as Verstappen questioned the move, which ultimately impacted his race performance. The team acknowledged the need for better in-race decision-making.</p>

The search, authorized by German prosecutors, focuses on the area between the Ocean Club holiday resort and the former residence of prime suspect Christian BrÃ¼ckner. BrÃ¼ckner, currently imprisoned in Germany for a separate crime of sexual assault, has been identified as the prime suspect in McCann's disappearance since 2020 but denies any involvement.

          <p>This Fox News article discusses the role of shamelessness in politics, arguing that politicians often justify changing positions or engaging in hypocrisy due to party loyalty or pressure from donors. It uses examples from Donald Trump's career to illustrate how a willingness to contradict oneself can be a survival tactic. The article also touches on how Trump's supporters trust him to push boundaries but expect him to accept counterpressure and recalibrate. Ultimately, the piece suggests that a certain degree of shamelessness is necessary for political success.</p>

Abdel Fattah, a prominent figure in Egypt's 2011 pro-democracy protests, has been imprisoned almost continuously since 2014, with his family fearing he is being unjustly detained.

The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) and other state media outlets have criticized the recent discounts offered by carmakers. The MIIT stated that uncontrolled price wars are a classic example of "involutionary" competition, hindering investment in research and development. The People's Daily described the domestic carmaking sector as being in a "sub-healthy" state due to shrinking profit margins amid industrial overcapacity.</p>

          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has significantly lowered its economic growth forecasts for the U.S. due to President Donald Trump's tariff policies. The U.S. growth outlook was revised downward to 1.6% for 2025 and 1.5% for 2026. Factors contributing to the downgrade include the fallout from Trump's tariff policy, elevated economic policy uncertainty, a slowdown of net immigration, and a smaller federal workforce. The OECD also adjusted its inflation forecast, noting that higher trade costs, especially in countries raising tariffs, will push up inflation, partially offset by weaker commodity prices (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A landmark review has found that the water sector in England and Wales is failing and requires stronger regulation to protect billpayers and the environment. The independent Water Commission, led by Sir Jon Cunliffe, highlighted shaken public trust due to pollution, financial difficulties, mismanagement, and infrastructure failures. The review called for clearer government direction, a better approach to long-term investment, and a stronger voice for local communities. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the water system as "broken" and pledged a full government response to the commission's findings.</p>
