          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 08:50:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail companies are utilizing a 'tariff hacking' strategy known as the B2B2C model to lessen the financial impact of the ongoing trade war on consumers. This method involves routing online sales through a middleman company that purchases the goods at a wholesale price, thereby paying a significantly lower U.S. tariff. While this approach has helped brands like Yours Clothing and Tod's Group avoid price hikes, some logistics experts caution that it may be a risky, short-term solution that could face future scrutiny and audits.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping held a crucial phone call to finalize an agreement aimed at preventing a ban on the social media platform TikTok in the United States.

          <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari has expressed his support for two additional interest rate cuts before the end of the year. He argues that the inflationary impact from President Trump's tariffs is likely a temporary, one-time effect, which provides the central bank with the flexibility to pursue easier monetary policy. This dovish stance comes as the Fed navigates a weakening labor market while inflation remains above its 2% target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola commented on the team's challenging schedule, which allows for only two days of recovery before a critical Premier League match against title rivals Arsenal. The team played a Champions League game just 66 hours prior to the upcoming fixture. The article delves into the tactical and physiological challenges of such fixture congestion, noting that historical data surprisingly indicates that both City and Arsenal often perform better with shorter rest periods between European and domestic games.</p>

The demonstrators staged a direct action by blocking an underground garage used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to transport detainees. Inside the building, a separate group of elected officials was arrested by federal officers after demanding to inspect the conditions of the ICE intake facility.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly poised to fire Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, for his office's refusal to bring mortgage fraud charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. According to sources, federal prosecutors found no clear evidence of wrongdoing by James, but Trump administration officials still pushed for an indictment. This move is intensifying concerns that the president is using the Department of Justice to investigate and punish his political adversaries.</p>

          <p>A Taliban official has rejected recent comments by U.S. President Donald Trump suggesting that America could retake the Bagram airbase in Afghanistan. Zakir Jalal, an official in the Taliban's foreign ministry, asserted that the possibility of any foreign military presence was 'completely' rejected during the Doha talks. Trump had hinted at retaking the strategically located base, citing its proximity to China's nuclear weapons development sites, a claim that has been disputed by fact-checkers.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of the year, financial experts are providing advice to consumers on how to effectively pay down personal debt. The core strategies recommended include creating a detailed budget to identify extra cash for payments, proactively negotiating for lower interest rates on credit cards, and considering balance transfers for high-interest debt. Experts also stress the importance of understanding the emotional spending behaviors that contribute to debt accumulation as a key step toward financial health. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has dismissed the notion that players Raheem Sterling and Axel Disasi are facing a 'hard life' after being excluded from the first-team squad. When questioned about the mental challenge for the two players, who are training separately, Maresca contrasted their situation with that of his 75-year-old father, who worked as a fisherman for 50 years. His comments come as the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) is in discussions with the club regarding the treatment of the isolated players.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, financial experts are advising homeowners and borrowers on when it makes sense to refinance their loans. They suggest that a refinance is generally most beneficial when there is at least a one-percentage-point difference between a borrower's current interest rate and the new available rate. While the Fed's action may lead to lower consumer rates over time, experts caution that this single cut is unlikely to create a major immediate benefit for most people looking to refinance.

It argues that both camps, including figures like Eliezer Yudkowsky and Silicon Valley leaders, base their extreme predictions on a flawed and unscientific conception of 'superintelligence.' The author suggests that these sensationalized fantasies of apocalypse or utopia are distractions from the more immediate, practical dangers of current AI technology and primarily serve the interests of tech oligarchs.</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified an entirely new species of dinosaur, named Newtonsaurus cambrensis, from a fossilized jawbone that was discovered in Wales more than 125 years ago. By using modern 3D scanning to reconstruct the fossil, researchers determined it belonged to a large, carnivorous theropod from the late Triassic period. This discovery is significant as it challenges the long-held scientific consensus that large predatory dinosaurs did not emerge until the following Jurassic period, reshaping our understanding of dinosaur evolution.</p>
