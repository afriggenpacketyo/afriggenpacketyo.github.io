          <p>Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla was expected to attend a $25 million fundraiser for a pro-Trump super PAC, occurring just one day after the president publicly demanded that pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, significantly lower their drug prices. The administration sent letters to 17 drugmakers asking for commitments to match lower international prices for certain programs. This event highlights the complex relationship between the pharmaceutical industry and the administration, as Bourla has previously engaged with Trump, notably during the COVID-19 vaccine development initiative known as "Operation Warp Speed." The industry argues that such price controls could stifle innovation.</p>

          <p>Lifeguards in Seal Beach, California, are reporting a significant rise in stingray-related injuries, jumping from an average of one to as many as 15 per day. Officials attribute the increase to a period of calm, warm waters, which draws the stingrays closer to the shore where more people are swimming. The area known as “ray bay” is a particular hotspot due to warmer water from a nearby power plant. To avoid stings, beachgoers are advised to shuffle their feet in the sand to alert the animals. If stung, the recommended treatment is to soak the wound in very hot water to neutralize the venom.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of the Environmental Protection Agency's own analysis indicates that the Trump administration's plan to roll back stricter vehicle emission standards could lead to higher gasoline prices and the loss of nearly half a million jobs by 2035. The data, originally from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, suggests that promoting electric vehicles and fuel efficiency under previous policies would have lowered future gas costs. The administration argues the rollback provides consumers with more affordable car choices and that the EPA lacks the authority to regulate greenhouse gases without new congressional action.

          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated that President Trump has "real concerns" about the accuracy of federal jobs data, defending the decision to fire Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. The dismissal occurred after the July jobs report showed slower-than-expected hiring and a significant downward revision of 258,000 jobs for the previous two months. Greer suggested the large revisions were cause for concern, while critics, including McEntarfer's predecessor, called the firing "groundless" and a threat to the credibility of federal economic statistics.

While the administration argues the policy will revive U.S. manufacturing, economists warn of potential inflation and supply chain disruptions as companies may stop importing low-margin products.

          <p>Paula Deen has suddenly closed The Lady and Sons, the iconic Savannah, Georgia, restaurant that launched her to fame over 25 years ago. The establishment, known for its classic Southern fare, was pivotal in her rise, leading to a Food Network show and celebrity status. Deen announced the closure on her website, stating she and her sons would now focus on their four Paula Deen's Family Kitchen locations. This follows a pattern of abrupt closures for Deen's other restaurants, and comes years after a controversy involving her admission of using a racial slur.</p>

The investigation also found that the Black Hawk pilots missed a crucial command from air traffic control and that the controller failed to warn the airliner about the helicopter's proximity.

The defector, using the name Jin-su, explained how he used fake identities to secure remote work with Western companies, earning thousands of dollars a month, with 85% of his wages sent back to North Korea. These workers operate under close surveillance, primarily from China, and use sophisticated methods to hide their nationality. The operation is a significant source of income for the sanctioned nation, estimated to generate hundreds of millions of dollars annually.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia is suing the Trump administration, alleging an "unconstitutional pressure campaign" to stop hospitals from providing gender-affirming care to transgender youth. The lawsuit argues the White House and Justice Department are intimidating providers with subpoenas and threats of prosecution under laws not intended for this purpose, creating a de facto national ban. This legal action follows the closure of several prominent gender-affirming care clinics in response to federal pressure, even in states where such care remains legal, forcing many families to travel for essential medical services.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury has found Tesla partly responsible for a 2019 crash that killed a pedestrian and severely injured another while a Model S was using the company's Autopilot software. The company was ordered to pay up to $243 million in damages. Plaintiffs argued the driver-assistance software was flawed and should have alerted the driver or applied the brakes before the collision. Tesla maintained the driver was solely at fault for being distracted and vowed to appeal the verdict, which marks a significant setback and the first jury decision against the company in a fatal Autopilot-related crash.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Supreme Court has issued a ruling that narrows the scope for millions of motorists to claim compensation over hidden commissions in car finance deals. The court did not uphold a previous ruling that deemed all such secret payments unlawful, but it left the door open for claims based on unfairly large commissions. The decision was a mixed result for consumer advocates, as it significantly reduces the potential compensation liability for lenders from an estimated £30 billion. Claimants in the case described the outcome as a "bitter pill to swallow" for the many who will now be unable to seek redress.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made several moves to strengthen their team ahead of the trade deadline, acquiring right-handed relievers Brock Stewart and Paul Gervase and versatile outfielder Alex Call. Manager Dave Roberts expressed confidence that the additions would "raise the floor" of the ballclub for its playoff push. Stewart, a former Dodger, returns as a high-leverage reliever with increased velocity, while Call provides a right-handed bat and solid on-base skills. The team hopes these new players, combined with improved performance from their existing stars, will be key to their late-season success.</p>

          <p>A psychotherapist and former cult member, Gillie Jenkinson, is raising awareness about the dynamics of cults and the need for specialized support for survivors. She explains that cults use coercive control and tactics like "love bombing" to exploit followers, and they are not always religious or easily identifiable. Red flags include an "us-versus-them" mentality, control over information, and high barriers to leaving. Jenkinson advocates for extending coercive control laws to cover groups and for creating specialized NHS counseling services to help people process the trauma and destigmatize the experience of leaving a cult.</p>

The company, which owns TikTok and its Chinese version Douyin, also stated the average tenure is three years. These figures were shared to counter online speculation that the company had a much higher turnover rate. The data suggests that ByteDance is a relatively attractive employer within China's competitive tech industry, which has been known for its demanding work culture, even after the company shifted away from the infamous "996" work schedule in 2021.</p>

The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 people who have been living and working legally in the U.S. for years. The judge found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing the administration's decision was "preordained" and potentially motivated by racial animus.

In an act of resourcefulness, she registered the name "Taylor Kia of Lima" for herself and sent the dealership a cease-and-desist letter. The dealership tried to force the entire dispute into arbitration, but an appeals court has now ruled that the fight over the trade name is a separate matter from the car purchase.
