          <p>After a U.S. trade court blocked President Trump's tariffs, Goldman Sachs economists suggest the administration has alternative legal means to impose them, including Section 122 of U.S. trade law, Section 301 investigations, and Section 338 of the Trade Act of 1930. Section 122 could allow a quick replacement of the 10% tariff with a similar one up to 15%, though it would only last 150 days without congressional action. The administration is appealing the ruling, and legal experts suggest the Supreme Court could ultimately decide the case. The article also notes that Trump has a good understanding of how to play the courts to gain time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stock markets experienced a surge after a federal court blocked President Trump's tariffs on China and other major U.S. trading partners. The ruling invalidated levies unveiled in a Rose Garden ceremony and a 10% tariff imposed on goods from nearly all countries. The Trump administration has appealed the ruling, creating uncertainty about the tariffs' ultimate fate. The court's decision centered on Trump's invocation of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, and even before the ruling, some tariffs had been rolled back due to trade agreements.

          <p>Senator Marco Rubio is spearheading a major reorganization of the State Department, aiming to cut or consolidate over 300 offices and bureaus to streamline the agency and enhance its diplomatic mission. The restructuring seeks to reduce bureaucratic red tape, emphasize the agency's role in representing the U.S. abroad, and eliminate bureaucratic overgrowth. The plan involves slashing or merging 40% of domestic offices, potentially affecting 15% to 20% of the agency's domestic personnel. The reorganization also includes adding new offices, such as a bureau of emerging threats, and shifting focus towards embassies to implement "America First" diplomacy.</p>

          <p>An article in *The Atlantic* argues that the U.S. Court of International Trade's decision to strike down almost all of President Trump's tariffs is a vindication of the rule of law. The author emphasizes that the Constitution delegates tariff power to Congress, not the presidency, and that the court's ruling merely affirmed Congress's power. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit included multiple states, and the Court of International Trade was specifically created to handle trade disputes. The article asserts that the administration's criticism of the judiciary suggests contempt for any check on presidential power.</p>

The remains, including a skull and separated bones, have been sent to the Medical University of South Carolina for forensic analysis and identification.

          <p>In the Sean Combs sex-trafficking and racketeering case, Casandra Ventura's stylist, Deonte Nash, underwent cross-examination after testifying he witnessed Combs repeatedly beating Ventura. Nash is a key witness, claiming Ventura expressed discomfort with sexual encounters involving male prostitutes. The defense questioned Nash about Ventura's flirtation with Michael B. Jordan, suggesting Combs's violence was motivated by jealousy and drug use, not sexual coercion. A former personal assistant of Combs, referred to as “Mia,” is expected to testify about being sexually assaulted by her boss.</p>

          <p>Stock markets experienced gains after a panel of U.S. judges blocked President Trump's tariffs, offering a chance at reprieve for economies like Australia, Britain, Canada, the European Union, and India. The S&P 500 index rose, driven by Nvidia's strong earnings report, while markets elsewhere showed mixed results. Analysts suggest the court ruling reduces uncertainty, but the Trump administration could pursue other legal routes to enact tariffs. The White House maintains that little has changed, and markets may continue to fluctuate based on tariff developments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article in *Vox* discusses the potential impact of the Trump administration's actions on Harvard University and U.S. scientific supremacy. The administration's move to bar international students from Harvard is seen as a death blow, especially if it spreads to other top schools. The author argues that U.S. science heavily relies on foreign talent, and cutting off federal funding and revoking visas would undermine American scientific leadership. The article also notes that the US’ K-12 education system is mediocre, making elite universities like Harvard crucial for attracting global talent.</p>

          <p>Following a U.S. court's decision to block some of President Trump's tariffs, trade partners are more wary than hopeful, with many reacting cautiously to the news. While stocks rose internationally, economists point out that Trump could pursue other legal avenues for tariffs, and the administration plans to appeal the decision. The court's move offers a fragile chance at reprieve for economies, guaranteeing continued chaos. The ruling blocks across-the-board tariffs but does not affect sector-specific tariffs, leaving the United States and trading partners negotiating on those sectors. (not investment advice)</p>
