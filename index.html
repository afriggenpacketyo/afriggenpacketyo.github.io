          <p>A Reddit post from a man in Melbourne, Australia, has gone viral after he described his frustration with a roommate who uses a loud blender at 5:30 a.m., violating the house's established quiet hours. The man's attempts to resolve the issue, including buying a portable blender for his roommate, were dismissed by the roommate and his girlfriend, who called his complaints "frivolous." The situation has sparked a widespread online debate about shared living etiquette, with most users supporting the original poster's position on noise discipline.

          <h2>Warren Buffett Explains His Investment Philosophy and Aversion to Gold</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warren Buffett outlines his investment framework, categorizing assets into three types: currency-denominated, non-productive, and productive. He expresses skepticism towards currency-based investments like bonds, noting that their value is contingent on government stability and tends to decline over time. Buffett famously critiques gold as a non-productive asset, arguing its value relies solely on the hope that someone else will pay more for it in the future, without it generating any intrinsic value. He strongly favors productive assets, such as farms or businesses, which are valued based on the output they can deliver, making them rational and tangible investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zions Bancorporation experienced a $1 billion valuation drop after disclosing that $60 million in loans were unlikely to be repaid, sparking wider fears about the regional banking sector. A lawsuit filed by its subsidiary alleges that fund managers from the "Cantor Group" engaged in a "sweeping betrayal of trust" by secretly subordinating the bank's loans and eliminating the collateral. The bank discovered the alleged scheme after a similar fraud lawsuit was filed against the same group by Western Alliance, prompting an internal investigation and a significant financial charge-off.

          <p>The United Kingdom is marking the 70th anniversary of its first garden centre, an industry that has grown into a beloved national pastime with around 1,500 locations. These establishments have evolved beyond selling plants to become comprehensive retail and social destinations, often including popular cafes that attract a wide range of visitors. According to the Horticultural Trades Association, over two-thirds of UK adults visited a garden centre in 2024, highlighting their role as places for shopping, dining, and community interaction. The enduring appeal lies in their ability to offer a relaxing and inspiring experience for the whole family.</p>

          <p>A global movement is underway in major cities like New York, London, and Montreal to redesign urban spaces in favor of cyclists, aiming to create cleaner, safer, and more sustainable environments. By implementing protected bike lanes, redesigning intersections, and adjusting traffic signals, cities are making cycling a more accessible and less stressful mode of transport for all ages. This shift is driven by numerous benefits, including significant cost savings for individuals, a 75% reduction in carbon emissions for short trips, and improved public health outcomes. Despite challenges like the regulation of e-bikes and cultural resistance from drivers, the trend towards bike-friendly cities represents an optimistic future for urban development.</p>

          <p>Players from Spanish football clubs Oviedo and Espanyol staged a 15-second on-field protest by refusing to move at the start of their match, opposing La Liga's decision to host a game in Miami. The Spanish Footballers' Association coordinated the symbolic action, citing a lack of transparency and dialogue from the league regarding the plan to move a Barcelona vs. Villarreal fixture to the United States. This protest is part of a broader discontent within Spanish football, with other clubs and coaches, including Real Madrid's Xabi Alonso, arguing that the move distorts the competition. The demonstrations are expected to continue across other La Liga games.</p>

The university defended the project as essential for its future competitiveness, stating the revenue will fund core academic services and keep students in a supportive on-campus environment.

          <p>A significant political trend is emerging in the United States, where Gen Z women represent the most left-leaning demographic in modern history, a stark contrast to their male peers who skew more conservative. This ideological gender divide is often attributed to the direct impact of political issues like reproductive rights and economic inequality on women's lives, making political engagement a form of self-defense. Many of these young women reject the 'liberal' label, viewing the Democratic party as too centrist and beholden to corporate interests. Their leftist identity is shaped by coming of age amidst crises like climate change and job insecurity, leading them to see moderation as a surrender of their values.</p>

The existence of this weapon was disclosed just before Kim Jong-un's visit to Beijing, his first since 2019.

          <p>An analysis of federal data by the Pew Research Center reveals that remarriage is a common outcome for divorced Americans, with approximately two-thirds choosing to marry again. The study found that men are slightly more likely to remarry than women, and nearly half of those who remarry have a child with their new spouse. Economically, remarriage appears beneficial, as the median household wealth of remarried adults is significantly higher than that of divorced individuals and comparable to those in their first marriage. While divorce rates have generally declined since the 1980s, the data underscores that remarriage continues to be a significant pathway for family formation in the U.S.</p>

The analysis points to the quiet effectiveness of the first-term Resistance, which contributed to the 2018 midterm "blue wave" through persistent, community-based organizing.

          <p>Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner has confirmed that team captain and England defender Marc Guehi intends to leave the club next year. The 25-year-old has reportedly informed the club that he will not sign a new contract, with his current deal set to expire at the end of the season. Glasner stated that while the club offered Guehi a new contract in an effort to keep him, the player expressed a desire for a different challenge. This decision leaves Crystal Palace with the option of selling him during the January transfer window or allowing him to leave on a free transfer next summer.</p>

          <p>President Trump has described the idea of a tunnel connecting Russia and the United States under the Bering Strait as "interesting" after it was raised by Russia's investment envoy. The proposal, dubbed the "Putin-Trump" tunnel, is currently undergoing a feasibility study initiated six months ago, according to Russian officials. During a press conference, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, when asked for his opinion, responded, "I'm not happy with this idea," which drew laughter. The ambitious 70-mile project is envisioned as a rail link symbolizing unity, with Russian officials suggesting Elon Musk's Boring Company could potentially reduce the high construction costs.</p>

          <p>Iran's Foreign Ministry has announced that it no longer considers itself bound by the restrictions of the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the JCPOA, as the agreement officially expired. The deal, which capped Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief, has been in jeopardy since the U.S. withdrew in 2018. Tensions have escalated further after Britain, France, and Germany triggered a mechanism to reinstate UN sanctions, citing Iran's violations of the accord. In response, Tehran has stated it sees no reason to negotiate with the European powers, effectively terminating the remaining provisions of the landmark agreement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The opening T20 match of England's winter tour against New Zealand in Christchurch was washed out by rain after England had completed its innings. On a challenging pitch, England posted a score of 153-6, largely thanks to a crucial unbeaten 49 from all-rounder Sam Curran, who rescued the team from a precarious 81-5. Despite Curran's efforts, heavy rain prevented New Zealand from beginning their chase, leading to the match being declared a no-result. The outcome was a frustrating start to the white-ball series, which serves as preparation for the upcoming T20 World Cup.</p>

          <p>Organizers of the "No Kings" movement are anticipating millions of demonstrators to protest President Trump's policies in cities across the United States. This marks the second major wave of protests by the coalition of progressive groups, which accuses the president of authoritarian behavior. The demonstrations are a response to what organizers describe as an escalation of norm-violating actions, including aggressive immigration raids and attacks on federal institutions. While supporters of the president have labeled the event as anti-American, organizers emphasize a commitment to peaceful protest and building solidarity against what they see as threats to democracy.</p>

During a meeting with Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand in Beijing, Wang described her visit as a "fresh start" and stated that China is ready to advance the settlement of legitimate concerns on both sides. This positive diplomatic signal follows Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's recent visit to Washington, as Ottawa engages in careful diplomacy to manage complex international relations.

          <p>A second nationwide "No Kings Day" of protests is scheduled, with organizers citing a heightened sense of urgency following several months of escalating actions by the Trump administration.

The demonstrations aim to provide a broad platform for various grievances, including economic issues and environmental rollbacks, under the unifying theme of defending American democracy.

Scott Wiener is reportedly preparing to run for Nancy Pelosi's congressional seat in 2026, a move that has ignited a contentious and nationally watched political race in San Francisco.

The race is further complicated by another challenger, wealthy progressive Saikat Chakrabarti, who is positioning himself as a disruptive force.

Tribal leaders argue that L.A.'s extraction of water has desiccated their ancestral homeland, Payahuunadü, drying up springs and meadows and harming the ecosystem. While the L.A. Department of Water and Power contends its water management is sustainable, the Bishop Paiute, Big Pine Paiute, and Lone Pine Paiute-Shoshone tribes are campaigning for the return of land and water.
