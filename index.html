          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military conducted strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran, citing a "spectacular military success" aimed at eliminating Iran's nuclear enrichment capabilities.

Trump warned Iran against retaliating, promising a stronger response if necessary, while Iran's Foreign Minister stated that Iran reserves all options to defend itself.

          <p>As artificial intelligence becomes more prevalent, researchers are raising concerns about potentially harmful responses from AI models, including hate speech and copyright infringements. They emphasize the need for regulations and thorough testing to mitigate these risks, highlighting the challenges in ensuring AI models behave as intended. Red teaming, a practice common in cybersecurity, is suggested as a method to evaluate AI risks, but the current number of professionals working in red teams is insufficient. Standardized 'AI flaw' reports and user-centered practices are recommended to improve the understanding and management of AI risks.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors allege that an Indiana teenager murdered four family members in 1989 following an argument regarding prom night restrictions. Jeff Pelley, 17 at the time, was reportedly upset that his father grounded him for stealing and insisted on driving him to prom, leading to a deadly confrontation. The victims included his father, stepmother, and two stepsisters, who were found shot at their home after church parishioners noticed their absence. Despite the lack of forensic evidence, Pelley was convicted in 2006 based on circumstantial evidence and a timeline suggesting he committed the murders before attending prom.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's decision to launch airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear sites marks a significant departure from previous U.S. policy, as he is the first president to directly attack Iranian territory. While previous administrations refrained from such actions, Trump justified the strikes as necessary to eliminate Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity. The success of the strikes and Iran's response remain uncertain, but the move could have implications for nonproliferation efforts and regional stability. The article suggests that Iran may now resort to unconventional tactics in response to the strikes.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of U.S. strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, lawmakers from both parties have expressed mixed reactions. Republican lawmakers, including Sens. Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz, supported Trump's actions, while Democrats like House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries criticized the decision to launch the attack without congressional consultation. Some lawmakers argued that the strikes were unconstitutional, while others emphasized the need to address Iran's nuclear ambitions. The debate highlights the ongoing tensions regarding the president's authority to engage in military actions without congressional approval.</p>

          <p>The United States' decision to bomb Iranian nuclear sites has significantly altered the trajectory of the conflict between Israel and Iran, prompting questions about Iran's potential response. Benjamin Netanyahu praised President Trump's decision, while Iran has vowed to retaliate against the U.S. if it entered the war. The U.S. strikes may allow Israel to declare its main war aim complete, but the risk of further escalation depends on how Iran and its allies react. The article suggests that Iran's response could determine whether the conflict escalates further or moves toward resolution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent suggestion of a two-week window for diplomacy with Iran was a deliberate deception to mask his plan to bomb Iranian nuclear sites. The decision to strike was made privately after a meeting with national security advisers, and the announcement of a potential negotiation was intended to catch Iran off guard. The U.S. government prepared for potential Iranian retaliation by evacuating citizens from Israel and moving personnel from American embassies. The operation was coordinated with Israel, and Trump was influenced by the success of Israel's offensive in eroding Iran's air defenses.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed the nation from the White House, declaring the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites a "spectacular military success." He warned of "far greater" attacks if Iran does not "make peace," stating that the targeted sites "have been completely and totally obliterated." Trump thanked U.S. service members and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while Iran's Atomic Energy Organization confirmed the strikes but claimed they would not halt its nuclear program. The strikes come after a period of escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, with Iran threatening retaliation against the U.S. if it joined the conflict.</p>

          <p>A urine-based cancer risk screening kit developed by Japanese startup Craif Inc. is showing promise in detecting cancer at its earliest stages using non-invasive methods. The test kit can simultaneously assess a person's risk for up to seven types of cancer by detecting microRNA in urine samples. A trial in Hokkaido detected tumors and precancerous cells in several participants, leading to early treatment. The company aims to expand the use of the kit to improve cancer detection rates, especially in areas with limited medical resources.</p>

The study, led by Professor Li Lei, reorganized yeast metabolism into four distinct yet interconnected phases, mirroring the concept of mutual promotion and restraint in traditional Chinese medicine. The team's work highlights how the four phases reflect unique metabolic states, akin to the "four symbols" theory in traditional Chinese medicine, which emphasizes balance between passive and active forces.</p>

The best-case scenario involves the fall of the Iranian regime, while the worst-case scenario includes Iran developing a nuclear weapon and retaliating against U.S. interests. The success of the strikes depends on accurate intelligence and competent leadership, which are questionable given the composition of the White House national-security team.</p>
