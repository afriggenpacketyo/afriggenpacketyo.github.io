          <p>Three former federal immigration judges, who collectively handled thousands of cases, are speaking out after being abruptly fired by the Justice Department without cause. The judges expressed concern that their dismissals were an attack on judicial impartiality, with some claiming they were pressured on how to rule in specific cases to facilitate ICE apprehensions. Amid a backlog of nearly four million immigration cases, the judges' union reports over 100 judges have been fired, transferred, or retired under the current administration, raising fears about the erosion of due process.</p>

          <p>University of North Carolina football players have dismissed suggestions that head coach Bill Belichick's high-profile romance with Jordon Hudson is a distraction for the team. Players noted that Hudson is rarely seen at the team's facilities and that any "noise" is confined to social media, not impacting their focus on the upcoming season. Belichick himself described the media attention on his personal life as something he is accustomed to from his time with the Patriots.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Why the Biden Administration Did Not Release the Epstein Files</h2>

          <p>An analytical article examines the reasons why the full Jeffrey Epstein investigation files were not released during the Biden presidency, despite their potential political implications for Donald Trump. The piece explains that legal barriers, particularly the secrecy of grand jury testimony, would have made a unilateral release nearly impossible without court approval. Furthermore, appearing in the files does not inherently imply wrongdoing, and releasing vast amounts of unverified information falls outside of normal government protocol, making it a legally and ethically complex challenge for any administration.</p>

          <p>Britain's Emma Raducanu defeated former world number one Naomi Osaka in straight sets to advance to the quarterfinals of the Washington Open. The victory continues a strong run for Raducanu, who is set to become the new British number one. In the men's singles competition, however, fellow Britons Cameron Norrie and Dan Evans were both eliminated in the last 16. Raducanu is also still competing in the women's doubles, having advanced to the semi-finals with her partner.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has agreed to a settlement with the Trump administration to end a months-long dispute and restore hundreds of millions in frozen federal research funding. The deal requires the university to pay $221 million and make concessions related to DEI programs and international student admissions to resolve allegations of on-campus antisemitism. The administration's targeting of Columbia is part of a broader pattern of pressuring universities, with critics viewing it as an attack on higher education.</p>

          <p>A judge in Ontario has acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team who were accused of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2018. The judge ruled that the testimony of the complainant, identified as EM, was not "credible or reliable," and therefore the prosecution could not prove its case. The trial, which centered on the issue of consent, drew significant public attention and highlighted inconsistencies in the woman's statements to police and investigators. The players' lawyers stated the verdict was a relief after years of damage to their clients' reputations.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have successfully grown the world's largest barium gallium selenide (BGSe) crystal, a key component for developing powerful laser weapons. The crystal, measuring 60mm in diameter, can efficiently convert lasers into mid- to far-infrared beams capable of long-distance atmospheric transmission. This breakthrough could enable the creation of ground-based lasers powerful enough to disable satellites, as the material can withstand significantly more energy than existing military-grade crystals.</p>

The company is increasingly focusing on its long-term bets in autonomous driving and robotics to drive future growth, though these initiatives face their own challenges and skepticism.
