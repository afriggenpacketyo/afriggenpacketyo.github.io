          <p>The Trump administration mistakenly issued reduction-in-force notices to key CDC personnel, including those vital for responding to Ebola and measles outbreaks and publishing the influential MMWR journal, due to "coding errors" during widespread health employee layoffs. While these specific employees are expected to have their notices rescinded within days, hundreds of other HHS staff will still lose their jobs as the government shutdown continues. Amidst this, President Trump announced he is directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to utilize available Department of Defense research and development funds to ensure military members receive their pay on October 15th, despite the ongoing funding dispute in Congress.</p>

          <p>China is in the process of drafting its 15th five-year plan, a crucial document that will outline the nation's development priorities and economic direction for the coming half-decade. Historically, these expansive blueprints have driven massive infrastructure projects, such as the 2009 stimulus package, which propelled economic growth but also accumulated local government debt, a persistent challenge. Experts anticipate the upcoming plan will continue significant infrastructure investment, but with a renewed emphasis on tech-driven and people-centric projects to meet evolving societal demands and address past financial pressures more sustainably.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado asserted in an NPR interview that her country is experiencing "profound, total chaos" under President Nicolás Maduro, vehemently advocating for his removal. She claims the 2024 election was rigged, with the Venezuelan people having already mandated regime change, despite Maduro's narrative that his departure would bring chaos. Machado, who was barred from running but backed opposition candidate Edmundo González, further accused Maduro of leading a drug cartel, destabilizing the region, and transforming Venezuela into a haven for enemies of the United States, including Iran and Russia.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is set to attend an international peace summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, on Monday, where a Gaza peace plan will be formally signed, marking a historic turning point. This significant event follows a ceasefire that took effect Friday, resulting from the first phase of a deal brokered by US President Donald Trump between Israel and Hamas. While the initial phase involves Hamas releasing hostages and Israel releasing Palestinian prisoners, alongside increased aid to Gaza, crucial later phases concerning the Strip's governance, Israeli troop withdrawal, and Hamas's disarmament still require complex negotiations among international partners.</p>

The article argues that the US's stronger capital access and the strategic alignment between Nvidia and the Trump administration position it to accelerate data center production more rapidly, potentially hindering China's near-term bid to lead the global data center industry.</p>

          <p>An appeals court has ruled that National Guard troops sent to Illinois by President Donald Trump can remain in the state under federal control but cannot be deployed, granting a pause in the case for further arguments. This decision upholds a temporary block by a federal judge who found no substantial evidence of a "danger of rebellion" in Illinois, and cited the 10th and 14th amendments, as Trump continues his immigration crackdown. Separately, Democratic US Senators Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth were denied entry to an ICE facility near Chicago, where a federal judge also ordered the removal of illegal fencing, with senators expressing concern about "stonewalling" and what the government might be hiding.</p>

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old British army horse, has been retired to The Horse Trust sanctuary in rural Buckinghamshire after sustaining a broken bone and serious bleeding during a dramatic incident last year. Quaker was one of five Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment horses that were spooked by construction noise, leading them to gallop through the streets of London, causing injuries to five soldiers and four pedestrians. Despite receiving ongoing veterinary care, Quaker was unable to return to his ceremonial duties, prompting the Ministry of Defense to decide that retirement was the best option for his welfare and long-term recovery.</p>

Metropolitan Police made 14 arrests for various offenses, including breaches of public order, following a scuffle with a small group of counter-protesters. Speakers at the rally described the US-brokered ceasefire as "precarious" and vowed to continue protesting until Palestinians achieve full freedom, arguing the deal fails to address the conflict's root causes.</p>

Despite a proposed amendment advocating for the Holyrood election to be treated as a de-facto referendum, Swinney emphasized his leadership commitment to delivering independence for Scotland, though agreement from the UK government would still be necessary.</p>
