            <p>JPMorgan Chase reported first-quarter earnings surpassing estimates, driven by strong equity trading. CEO Jamie Dimon acknowledged the turbulent economic landscape, citing geopolitical tensions, potential benefits from tax reform and deregulation, and the risks of tariffs and trade wars. Dimon also pointed to ongoing inflation, high fiscal deficits, and elevated asset prices as contributing factors to the uncertainty. While the bank prepares for various economic scenarios, its strong performance reflects resilience amid broader market volatility, with shares rising more than 1% after the report's release.

            <p>A helicopter crash in the Hudson River near Lower Manhattan resulted in the deaths of six people, including the pilot and a family of Spanish tourists.

            <p>U.S. stocks experienced a slight decline following China's imposition of new tariffs on American goods, escalating trade tensions between the two nations. China's tariff increase came in response to a previous tariff hike on Chinese goods by President Trump, creating uncertainty in the market. Asian and European markets showed mixed reactions, with some indices slipping and others rising based on stimulus measures and tariff adjustments. Trump hinted at the potential resumption of sweeping tariffs if a deal cannot be reached, adding further volatility to the global economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking the temporary legal status of hundreds of thousands of migrants from Nicaragua, Venezuela, Cuba, and Haiti. The judge stated that the Department of Homeland Security incorrectly interpreted the law when deciding to end the two-year parole granted by the Biden administration. The ruling prevents the expedited deportation of approximately 450,000 individuals who had flown to the U.S. after applying under a now-closed Biden-era policy, highlighting a legal challenge to the administration's immigration policies.</p>

            <p>U.S. companies are beginning to pass on the costs of the Trump administration's tariffs to consumers, with some introducing "tariff surcharges" on goods. Companies like Labucq and Dame are openly communicating these added costs to customers, while others are using the situation to promote "pre-tariff sales." As tariffs and retaliatory measures impact supply chains, businesses are seeking to maintain profitability by adjusting prices, and consumers are reacting with a mix of stockpiling and price sensitivity. This is creating both uncertainty and promotional opportunities in the marketplace. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Tommy Robinson, also known as Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, is appealing for an early release from prison, arguing that his segregation is negatively impacting his mental health. Robinson was sentenced to 18 months in October for contempt of court after repeating lies about a Syrian refugee, violating a court order. His lawyers presented evidence of complex post-traumatic stress disorder and ADHD, claiming his segregation is making him ill beyond what the sentencing judge anticipated. The Solicitor General argued that Robinson remains in defiance of the court order and that his conditions are manageable within the prison.</p>

            <p>Businesses employing disabled individuals are facing financial strain due to significant payment delays from the government's Access to Work scheme. The scheme, designed to provide grants for supporting disabled employees, is reportedly causing backlogs and leaving companies out of pocket, with some facing potential closure. One company claims to be owed nearly £200,000, while another was forced to shut down partly due to issues with the program. Critics point to increased bureaucracy and poor internal processes as contributing factors, raising concerns about the impact on disabled people's employment prospects.</p>

            <p>A new study suggests that Los Angeles' "mansion tax," designed to fund affordable housing, is contributing to a decline in overall apartment construction. The tax, which applies to property sales over $5 million, has made it more difficult to profit from new housing developments, according to the report. Researchers estimate that the measure is causing a reduction of at least 1,910 units per year, including a loss of affordable units. While supporters tout the tax's revenue generation for affordable housing initiatives, critics argue it is hindering overall housing supply.</p>

The author uses Syria as a case study, highlighting how sanctions imposed by the west have hurt the country's economy and driven its people abroad, without achieving political change. The piece also points to the ineffectiveness of sanctions against Russia, noting that the country's economy has adapted and even outperformed Britain since the economic war was declared. The author concludes that free trade should have no barriers and that its benefits are universal.</p>
