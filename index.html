          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that equity prices appear to be "fairly highly valued" by many metrics. Speaking in Rhode Island, Powell clarified that while the central bank monitors overall financial conditions, it does not currently see elevated risks to financial stability. He explained that markets often price in anticipated interest rate changes, which has contributed to the recent rally in stocks and other assets following the Fed's latest rate cut. Powell's comments provide insight into the Fed's perspective on current market levels, balancing the observation of high valuations with a lack of immediate stability concerns.</p>

          <p>During a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, former President Donald Trump criticized the organization's New York headquarters, recounting his unsuccessful bid to manage its renovation years ago. He claimed he could have completed the project for a fraction of the cost with superior materials, contrasting his vision of marble and mahogany with what he described as the UN's inferior result. Trump used the anecdote, along with a malfunctioning teleprompter and escalator, to frame the UN as an ineffective and poorly managed institution. His remarks were part of a broader critique where he questioned the UN's potential and accused it of relying on "empty words."</p>

          <p>Amazon is set to close its 19 physical grocery stores in the United Kingdom, less than five years after introducing the till-free concept in London. The company plans to convert five of the locations into its Whole Foods brand, which it also owns. This strategic shift involves focusing on its online grocery delivery services through partnerships with established retailers like Morrisons and Co-op. The decision impacts 250 employees, who have entered a consultation process, with Amazon stating it will offer redeployment opportunities where possible. Analysts suggest the move reflects the highly competitive UK grocery market and Amazon's experimental, delivery-focused strategy.</p>

Trump threatened Russia with tariffs over the Ukraine war but insisted European nations must cease buying Russian energy. He also called on Hamas to release hostages and criticized countries that have moved to recognize a Palestinian state, framing his own actions as those of a global peacemaker deserving of a Nobel Prize.</p>

          <p>The popular Fat Bear Week competition has commenced, inviting the public to vote for the brown bear that has most successfully fattened up for winter hibernation in Alaska's Katmai National Park. Twelve bears, including last year's champion Grazer, are competing for the title, with their progress streamed on live webcams as they feast on salmon from the Brooks River. The event, a partnership between the National Park Service and explore.org, has grown into a global phenomenon, drawing millions of viewers and over a million votes annually.

          <p>Two of the largest local television station owners in the U.S., Nexstar and Sinclair, have announced they will not air "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" despite ABC lifting the host's suspension. The late-night show was taken off the air after Kimmel made controversial comments linking the killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to the MAGA movement. Both station groups, which control a significant portion of ABC's affiliates, deemed the remarks inappropriate and are replacing the show with other programming. The decision has ignited a nationwide debate about censorship, network-affiliate relations, and the influence of political pressure on broadcast television content.</p>

To combat this, Gates announced a $912 million pledge to fight infectious diseases, emphasizing that sustained funding is critical for continued success. He cautioned that progress driven by innovations in fighting diseases like HIV and malaria will stall if the U.S. cuts its foreign health aid, which currently constitutes about 1% of the federal budget.

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales visited Southport to offer support to families and schools affected by the fatal knife attack that occurred last summer. The royal couple met with teachers and pupils at the schools attended by the three young girls who were killed. Prince William delivered a speech paying tribute to the community's resilience, the pastoral care of the staff, and the grace of the bereaved parents. He viewed a new playground built in the victims' memory, calling it a symbol of remembrance and a testament that love overcomes tragedy. This visit follows a previous one last autumn, reinforcing their commitment to the town's healing process.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed new revisions to the H-1B visa program, which is widely used by the tech industry to hire skilled foreign workers. The proposed changes would prioritize applications from employers who offer higher wages once the annual visa quota of 85,000 is met. According to the Department of Homeland Security, this move is intended to better protect American workers from wage competition. This proposal follows a recent, and controversial, decision to introduce a $100,000 fee for each H-1B visa, a move that has created significant uncertainty for employers and has strained diplomatic ties, particularly with India, whose citizens are the primary recipients of the visa.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Guardian considers the political future of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, amid speculation she may run for the Senate or the presidency in 2028. The article argues that in a political landscape dominated by an aging establishment, AOC's charisma and connection with progressive voters could represent a significant shift for the Democratic party. It acknowledges that her political positions have evolved since her 2018 election, sometimes drawing criticism from her base, particularly regarding her stance on the conflict in Gaza. However, the author concludes that despite any perceived flaws, her fighting spirit may be what is necessary to challenge the current political status quo.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has fallen to 6.13%, its lowest level in three years. For a $350,000 mortgage, this translates to a principal and interest payment of approximately $2,128 per month. This is about $210 less per month compared to the payments on the same loan at the beginning of 2025, when rates were above 7%. Over the life of the loan, this lower rate could save a borrower more than $75,000 in total interest. The more favorable rate environment has also created attractive refinancing opportunities for current homeowners looking to lower their monthly payments. (not investment advice)</p>

Raffensperger, a Republican, is running on a platform of conservative principles and adherence to the law. Duncan, who has since switched to the Democratic party, is positioning himself as an anti-extremist candidate. Their candidacies ensure that the political fallout from the 2020 election and its subsequent legal cases will remain a central theme in Georgia politics, highlighting the deep divisions within the state's conservative landscape.</p>

The sector's rally is largely attributed to the expectation that the Federal Reserve will continue to cut interest rates. Cramer emphasized that while it's tempting to lock in profits, the strategy is not to sell winners to fund underperforming stocks, especially if the interest rate environment remains favorable for banks.
