          <p>President Trump has agreed to postpone the implementation of 50% tariffs on goods from the European Union until July 9, following a phone call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Von der Leyen requested the extension to allow more time for negotiations to reach a favorable trade deal, emphasizing the close trade relationship between the EU and the US. Trump confirmed the extension on Truth Social, stating it was his "privilege" to grant the request, signaling a temporary easing of trade tensions. The EU and US will now resume discussions with the aim of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement within the new timeframe. The move provides some relief to markets concerned about renewed global economic disruption. Optimism is cautiously higher as the two sides engage in further talks. </p>

          <p>A Republican senator has indicated that there is significant resistance to President Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill" in the Senate, potentially hindering its passage unless substantial changes are made. Senator Ron Johnson criticized the bill for increasing the deficit and urged for deeper spending cuts to return to pre-pandemic levels. The bill also faces opposition due to its inclusion of a debt ceiling increase, which some senators prefer to address separately. Speaker Johnson defended the bill as an investment that will stimulate the U.S. economy, while critics argue that its spending cuts are insufficient and that it disproportionately benefits the wealthy.</p>

Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo were among 37 traders prosecuted for manipulating the Libor and Euribor benchmarks. Evidence has emerged that central bankers and government officials pressured banks to engage in similar conduct on a much larger scale, raising questions about fairness. The Serious Fraud Office maintains that the defendants were convicted of conspiracy to defraud, while supporters argue that their actions have been retrospectively criminalized.

Recovered in the 1930s, the mosaic disappeared after World War II and resurfaced in the possession of art dealer Helen Fioratti, who had purchased it in good faith. After authorities determined it had been stolen from a museum, the mosaic was returned to Italy, where it is now on display.</p>

          <p>Fogo Island, a remote island off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, is attempting to reinvent itself after years of economic decline. The island's economy, which once revolved around cod fishing, is now being revitalized by a luxury inn that acts as an economic engine. The inn's presence has begun to change the character of the island, attracting visitors and creating new opportunities for the local community. The people of Fogo Island, largely descended from British and Irish migrants, are embracing their heritage while adapting to a changing world.</p>

          <p>Dr. Daniel Perl's discovery of microscopic scarring in the brains of service members and veterans who died by suicide has led to groundbreaking research into blast-related brain injuries. The research suggests that repeated, low-level blast pressure from weapons can cause brain damage, even without major bombings. This has prompted the military to modify training and weapons to reduce blast exposure. The work of Frank Larkin, whose son Ryan, a Navy SEAL, took his own life, has been instrumental in raising awareness and driving research into these invisible wounds. The information could change the way veterans are treated and trained.</p>

The cleanup process involves extracting batteries, submerging them in saltwater to dissipate energy, and then crushing the cells before transporting the waste to landfills. The large scale of the destruction and the complexity of the waste pose significant logistical and environmental challenges.</p>

The remarks came after Moscow launched its largest aerial assault, firing 367 drones and missiles, resulting in numerous casualties and widespread destruction. Zelensky urged international leaders to increase pressure on Putin, arguing that the lack of strong condemnation enables further aggression. President Trump later commented on the attacks, expressing his disapproval of Putin's actions but providing no specifics regarding potential responses.

This approach emphasizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing, encouraging parents to respond with empathy rather than judgment. Emotionally safe parents see misbehavior as a signal for support, set boundaries with empathy, and prevent shame by reconnecting after conflicts. The key is for parents to do their own inner work first, reflecting on their childhood experiences and emotional triggers to better understand their reactions and respond to their children with compassion.</p>
