          <p>A devastating flash flood in Texas Hill Country has resulted in at least 104 fatalities, with dozens of people, including summer campers, still unaccounted for. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, overwhelming communities and a girls' summer camp, Camp Mystic, which suffered a significant loss of life. A major disaster declaration has been signed as massive search and rescue operations, involving state and federal agencies, continue around the clock. The event's suddenness and severity have shocked local officials and residents, prompting a large-scale response.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a socialist candidate for New York City mayor, has garnered surprising support from a number of wealthy individuals and millionaires, despite his platform calling for increased taxes on them. Supporters, including venture capitalists and business owners, have publicly stated their belief in paying a fair share to fund beneficial social policies like improved housing and support for small businesses. This backing from some of the city's elites, including figures from Wall Street and major law firms, highlights a complex political alignment where some affluent residents are endorsing a candidate whose policies would directly increase their tax burden.</p>

          <p>The government of El Salvador has informed the United Nations that the United States holds legal responsibility for over 200 migrants sent to the CECOT mega-prison. This declaration contradicts the Trump administration's claims that it cannot retrieve the migrants because they are under Salvadoran authority. The migrants, accused of gang affiliations, were transferred under a deal where El Salvador agreed to house them. El Salvador's report states its role was limited to providing prison infrastructure for individuals detained under the justice system of another state, placing the onus for their fate back on the U.S.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Central Texas, which have claimed over 100 lives, were caused by a convergence of weather factors, including moisture from a former tropical storm, over a flood-prone region. The deluge caused the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes during the night, catching residents and summer camps by surprise. Officials are now facing scrutiny over the timing and effectiveness of emergency warnings, with some leaders stating the scale of the event was completely unforeseen. The disaster has triggered a massive search and rescue operation and a federal disaster declaration.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has condemned recent federal immigration raids in Los Angeles as proof of President Trump's "polluted heart," while simultaneously calling for billions in federal aid for wildfire recovery. This places Newsom in the difficult position of criticizing the administration from which he is requesting $40 billion in disaster relief funds. He argued that disaster aid should be a nonpartisan issue, urging federal support for all affected states, including Texas. Newsom also highlighted the potential negative impact of the raids on the state's construction workforce, which is crucial for rebuilding efforts.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats have proposed an amendment to the UK's Football Governance Bill that would require at least 10 Premier League matches per season to be broadcast on free-to-air television. The proposal aims to tear down the "paywall" that locks the country's top football league behind expensive subscription packages, making it more accessible to the public. This amendment would empower the new independent football regulator to enforce this requirement. The move is part of the party's broader commitment to widening public access to major sporting events, similar to a model used in Spain for La Liga matches.</p>

Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called such claims a "depraved lie," asserting that the local NWS office was well-staffed and issued timely warnings. This defense comes after some Democrats, including Senator Chuck Schumer, called for an investigation into whether staffing shortages impacted the agency's forecasting ability. The White House provided a specific timeline of alerts issued, arguing that the NWS did its job effectively in the face of an unpredictable "act of God."</p>

          <p>A coalition of 18 states, led by California, has filed a legal challenge against recent federal immigration raids in Los Angeles, arguing they are unconstitutional. The states contend that masked federal agents are conducting "suspicionless" stops, violating residents' rights and creating a culture of fear that harms public safety and prosperity. The legal action supports a lawsuit filed by advocacy groups, seeking a temporary restraining order to halt the operations. The move escalates the conflict between state governments and the Trump administration over its aggressive mass deportation agenda and tactics in so-called sanctuary cities.</p>

          <p>Recent controversies at Wimbledon, including a crucial point being replayed due to an accidentally deactivated electronic line-calling system, have reignited the debate over technology's role in sports officiating. While systems like Hawk-Eye and football's VAR are demonstrably more accurate than the human eye, they are not infallible and their use can lead to frustration among players and fans. Experts argue that the tension lies between the quest for technological perfection and the human elements of fairness and context. The debate highlights a broader societal unease with replacing human judgment with automated systems, even when the data supports their superiority.</p>

          <p>A jury has acquitted music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs of the most serious charges against him, including sex trafficking and racketeering, following a high-profile federal trial. His defense team successfully argued that while Combs was a flawed partner, his actions did not meet the legal definition of the crimes alleged by the prosecution. According to his lawyer, Combs received a standing ovation from fellow inmates upon returning to jail, who viewed his acquittal as a rare victory against the government. Combs remains incarcerated pending sentencing on lesser prostitution-related convictions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent immigration raids in Los Angeles, characterized by masked federal agents detaining people at workplaces and bus stops, are being enabled by a significant increase in funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). A sweeping spending bill passed last week has turbocharged the Trump administration's deportation agenda, with a new target of at least 3,000 immigration arrests per day. This article suggests that the enhanced budget is a key factor making the administration's large-scale deportation goals operationally possible. The aggressive tactics have instilled fear in immigrant communities and drawn criticism for their indiscriminate nature.</p>

          <p>Cole's French Dip, the oldest continuously operating restaurant and saloon in Los Angeles, will permanently close in early August after more than a century in business. The owner cited a combination of factors crippling independent restaurants, including the pandemic's effects, rising costs, high rent, and increasing crime. The establishment, which opened in 1908, is one of two local restaurants that claim to have invented the French dip sandwich. The closure marks the end of an era for a beloved city landmark, prompting an outpouring of support and sadness from patrons and the downtown L.A. community.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. publicly praised Mom's Meals, a company providing taxpayer-funded meals to Medicaid and Medicare enrollees, for helping to make America healthy. However, an analysis of the company's menu reveals that its offerings are the kind of ultraprocessed, heat-and-eat foods that Kennedy often criticizes. Nutrition experts note the meals are high in sodium and contain numerous chemical additives that are hallmarks of ultraprocessed foods. This endorsement creates a contradiction with Kennedy's public health platform, which advocates for a diet of whole, unprocessed foods to improve national health.</p>

          <p>A group of leading medical associations and a pregnant physician are suing the Trump administration over Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s decision to recommend against COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women. The lawsuit alleges that Kennedy's unilateral announcement circumvented scientific review panels and ignored evidence that pregnant women face heightened risks from the virus. The plaintiffs, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, argue the move is part of a dangerous anti-vaccine and anti-science agenda. They are seeking to block a policy they believe will dismantle preventative health systems and cause preventable harm.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI have officially concluded their investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, finding no evidence of a so-called "client list" that could implicate high-profile associates. Their report also reaffirms the medical examiner's finding that the disgraced financier took his own life in his jail cell in 2019. These conclusions directly contradict long-standing conspiracy theories that Epstein was murdered to prevent him from exposing powerful individuals. The findings were met with disbelief and accusations of a cover-up by some supporters of President Trump, who had promised to release incriminating files.</p>
