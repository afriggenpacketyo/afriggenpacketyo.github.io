          <p>Michael Ratney, former U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, argues that perceptions of the country should evolve given its significant social and economic reforms. He notes the dismantling of guardianship laws for women, increased investment in renewable energy, and a general sense of ambition and confidence within the kingdom. Ratney suggests that a successful relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, potentially through a treaty, could benefit American national security by fostering stability in the Middle East and collaboration in areas like AI. He also notes concerns around human rights and political dissent that still persist within the country.</p>

The letter notes that the reduction in overdose deaths witnessed in 2024 was a direct result of sustained financial investment, and cutting these investments now would reverse progress.

          <p>A recent Japanese government survey has revealed that approximately half of respondents believed at least one instance of false information on social media after encountering it. The survey, the first of its kind, highlights the growing problem of fake news and the need for improved media literacy among the public. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is urging people to be skeptical and verify information before sharing it, as the survey showed that one in four who encountered false information went on to spread it further. The government aims to accelerate efforts to improve media literacy to combat the spread of misinformation.</p>

          <h2>China Lifts Ban on Boeing Deliveries After Trade Deal Pause</h2>

          <p>China has reportedly lifted a ban on airlines taking delivery of Boeing planes following a temporary agreement with the United States to cut steep tariffs. Officials in Beijing have begun informing domestic carriers and government agencies that deliveries of U.S.-made aircraft can resume. This decision reverses a previous situation where Boeing had to consider reselling dozens of aircraft due to the tariffs. The agreement between Washington and Beijing involves slashing reciprocal tariffs between the two countries by over 100% during a 90-day negotiation period, providing relief to both Boeing and Chinese airlines.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Parliament is set to vote on a bill that would legalize assisted dying for terminally ill adults, marking the third time such a proposal has been considered. The bill, tabled by Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur, would allow patients with a terminal illness and mental capacity to request medical assistance to end their lives, with the minimum age raised from 16 to 18. The vote is a free vote, meaning MSPs are not instructed by their parties, and is expected to be close. The Scottish government is officially neutral, but key figures like First Minister John Swinney and former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon have expressed opposition.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied a preliminary injunction to block the Internal Revenue Service from sharing immigrants' tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for identifying and deporting individuals illegally in the U.S. The ruling, a win for the Trump administration, argues that undocumented immigrants paying taxes are not entitled to the same privacy protections as citizens and legal residents. Nonprofit groups expressed disappointment but noted the ruling's limitations on the scope of information sharing. The decision follows the resignation of a former acting IRS commissioner over the agreement allowing ICE to cross-verify names and addresses against tax records.</p>

The agreement involves a temporary halt to the majority of tariffs for 90 days, with mutual tariffs reduced from 125% to 10%.

Experts suggest that China's technological progress alone may not be sufficient to overcome its structural economic imbalances. Despite these challenges, Chinese tech entrepreneurs and investors remain optimistic, while acknowledging the higher pain threshold of the Chinese populace.</p>

          <p>Following trade talks between the U.S. and China, tariff rates have been adjusted, but it's important to understand the new effective rates. While the headline changes suggest a reduction, the baseline tariff rate for Chinese exporters is estimated to be around 50%, which includes tariffs imposed during Trump's first term plus the new duties still in force. Specific tariff levels will vary depending on the product, but the overall impact on Chinese manufacturers and exporters remains significant. The 90-day agreement aims to provide some relief, but previously imposed tariffs remain in place.</p>

Some fintechs, like Revolut and Bunq, are already diversifying, while others may face a reset in income expectations. (not investment advice)</p>
