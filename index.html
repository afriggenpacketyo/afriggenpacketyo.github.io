          <p>Esther Ghey, the mother of Brianna Ghey, who was murdered by two 15-year-olds, has voiced her frustration with the UK government's approach to online safety. She argues that the Online Safety Bill, intended to protect young people online, is potentially being weakened for trade negotiations with the US, which she finds shocking. Brianna had viewed self-harm content online, and one of her murderers had consumed violent content, highlighting the dangers of unrestricted online access for young people. Ghey is advocating for stricter measures, including restricting social media access for those under 16, to prevent mental health issues stemming from harmful online content.</p>

          <p>British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover has announced a temporary halt to U.S. shipments for a month as it assesses the impact of newly implemented tariffs on vehicle imports by the Trump administration.

The White House also intends to place tariffs on some auto parts no later than May 3.

Supporters argue it's crucial for climate adaptation and water supply protection, while opponents claim it's an expensive boondoggle harming the environment and communities.

          <p>Joel Budd's book "Underdogs" challenges common myths about the white working class, arguing that their distinctiveness is primarily shaped by geography rather than ethnicity. The article highlights the neglect of smaller towns outside metropolitan areas, where many white workers reside, leading to limited social mobility and opportunities. Budd's research also reveals a diversity of opinions within the white working class, particularly on immigration, which is often misrepresented by politicians and the media. The article suggests that addressing the issues faced by the working class requires a reclamation of class politics.</p>

          <p>The article argues that Britain should not be cowed by Trump's tariffs but instead seize opportunities in Europe, Canada, and beyond. It criticizes Trump's economic policies as based on a flawed understanding of trade and calls for a global response to sustain a rules-based trading system. The author suggests that Britain should combine with the G7 (excluding the US) and the EU to create a new global trade order, potentially involving a closer relationship with Canada and the Commonwealth. The goal is to maintain open trade and challenge US monopoly digital platforms.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer has promised to protect UK companies from the "storm" caused by Donald Trump's new tariffs, vowing to use industrial policy to support British businesses. While the UK faces a relatively low tariff rate compared to other nations, Starmer emphasizes the need to "fight for the best deal" and improve domestic competitiveness. The article also notes the increase in employer national insurance contributions and the FTSE 100's recent decline. The Prime Minister has spoken to other world leaders over the weekend to work on strategies for dealing with the trade tariffs.</p>
