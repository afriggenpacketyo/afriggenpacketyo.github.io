          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was released from the hospital after receiving treatment for an inflammation of the inner ear, which caused him to experience vertigo. Hospital officials reported that Lula underwent imaging and blood tests, which returned normal results. The leftist president, who is expected to run for reelection next year, has a history of medical issues including a past concussion, brain surgery, high blood pressure, and throat cancer. Lula is currently in his third term as Brazil's president.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting has called on doctors in England to vote against industrial action in an upcoming ballot. Streeting emphasized the importance of collaboration between doctors and the government to improve the NHS, warning that strikes would hinder progress. This year, resident doctors are set to receive an average pay rise of 5.4%, exceeding that of other healthcare professionals, but the union insists this increase is insufficient to compensate for previous below-inflation pay awards.</p>

          <p>The government is implementing changes to apprenticeship funding, shifting the focus to individuals under 21. Under the new plans, only those under 21 will qualify for funding for level 7 apprenticeships, equivalent to a master's degree. The government aims to create 120,000 more training opportunities for young adults and those needing retraining. These changes are intended to address a decline in entry-level apprenticeships and better allocate apprenticeship levy funds.</p>

          <p>King Charles and Queen Camilla's visit to Canada is seen as a symbolic affirmation of Canadian sovereignty amid tensions with President Trump. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited the monarch to open Parliament, emphasizing Canadaâ€™s distinct heritage from the U.S. The King's speech is expected to diplomatically assert Canada's independence. The visit follows Trump's previous calls for Canada to become a U.S. state and reflects ongoing debates over national identity and political traditions.</p>

While Israel has begun allowing some aid into Gaza, aid groups say it's insufficient to meet the population's needs, and a new aid distribution system is being met with resistance from U.N. agencies and aid groups.</p>

This shift in tone comes amid escalating drone and missile strikes by Russia, which Ukrainian officials describe as the largest since the war began. Trump also criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the Russian government downplayed Trump's remarks. Despite the heightened conflict, Russia and Ukraine completed a prisoner swap, offering a rare sign of cooperation.</p>
