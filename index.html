This positive performance occurred despite a continued loss of broadband customers, a challenge the company is addressing with a new market strategy. The company's overall net income saw a significant boost from the sale of its stake in Hulu to Disney. While the traditional pay-TV business declined, growth in the film studios, theme parks, and the Peacock streaming service helped offset these losses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following her 2024 election loss, Kamala Harris has announced she will not run for governor of California, a decision that has significant implications for the state's political landscape and her own future. In her statement, Harris acknowledged that the Democratic party's traditional playbook has often failed, suggesting a need for new methods to address the country's challenges. Her choice leaves the gubernatorial race wide open and fuels speculation about her next steps, which could include starting a non-profit or focusing on helping Democrats in the upcoming midterm elections.

          <p>An analysis of the Cincinnati Bengals suggests that the team's opportunity to win a Super Bowl with quarterback Joe Burrow is diminishing due to questionable team-building strategies. Despite Burrow's elite talent, the franchise has struggled to surround him with a consistently strong supporting cast, particularly a protective offensive line. The article criticizes the front office for misallocating resources, making poor draft choices, and retaining a coaching staff that has not maximized the team's potential. With contract disputes and a reluctance to make aggressive changes, the Bengals appear to be relying too heavily on Burrow's individual brilliance to overcome roster deficiencies.</p>

Critics argue that Bove's elevation sets a dangerous precedent, suggesting that personal fealty to the president is being prioritized over constitutional duty. The move is seen by some as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to install loyalists in key judicial positions, potentially undermining the independence of the courts.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the foundational principles of the United States as the nation approaches its 250th anniversary on July 4, 2026. It emphasizes that America was founded on ideals of liberty and equality, as articulated in the Declaration of Independence, rather than on shared ethnicity or territory. The author argues for the importance of civic renewal and reconnecting with this shared history to overcome contemporary divisions. The piece calls for a recommitment to the ongoing, imperfect work of forming a more perfect union, urging citizens to understand their role in sustaining democracy.</p>

The new laws also make permanent several tax benefits, such as allowing rollovers from 529 college savings plans and expanding the saver's credit.

          <p>Moderna and BioNTech, the two companies that became famous for their mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, are now taking distinctly different paths for their futures. Moderna is doubling down on its mRNA technology, investing its pandemic earnings into a broad pipeline of vaccines for other viruses like flu and RSV. In contrast, Germany-based BioNTech has used its windfall to diversify through acquisitions, notably moving into promising new cancer drug technologies. This strategic divergence is reflected in their stock performance, with investors showing more confidence in BioNTech's broader, less risky approach compared to Moderna's focused but more volatile vaccine-centric model.

          <p>As climate change leads to increasingly hotter summers, experts advise on how to manage the negative effects of extreme heat on both physical and mental well-being. High temperatures can cause heat-related illnesses and also contribute to irritability, agitation, and a form of seasonal affective disorder. To cope, it is recommended to stay indoors in air conditioning during peak heat, adjust exercise routines to early mornings, and stay hydrated. Psychologists also suggest being mindful of heat's impact on mood, avoiding major decisions on hot days, and maintaining social connections, even if it means moving traditional outdoor activities indoors to stay safe.</p>

The Trump administration has applied them to specific products like steel and cars, as well as against countries like China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU, arguing they protect U.S. jobs and reduce the trade deficit. However, this policy has caused global economic volatility and led some companies to raise prices for U.S. consumers.</p>

          <h2>Lithuanian Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas Resigns Amid Corruption Allegations</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lithuanian Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas has resigned from his position following mounting pressure from investigations into his past and present business dealings. Anti-corruption agencies launched probes after media reports detailed alleged misconduct, including his failure to pay a fine from a 2012 abuse-of-power conviction. More recently, his family's company was scrutinized for its use of EU funds and a subsidized state loan. Paluckas, who denies wrongdoing, stepped down before facing potential impeachment proceedings, a move that will likely trigger the resignation of the entire cabinet and create a leadership vacuum in the Baltic nation.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Withdrawal from Unesco Seen as Part of a Wider Attack on Democracy</h2>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Trump administration's decision to withdraw the United States from Unesco for a second time is a grave error that harms America's global standing. The authors contend that this move is not an isolated act but part of a broader pattern of disrespect for culture, free expression, and human rights, aligning with authoritarian tactics seen globally. By dismissing Unesco's work in preserving world heritage and promoting education, the administration is seen as attacking the very democratic ideals that autocrats seek to control. The piece urges Congress to oppose the withdrawal and for funders to support cultural institutions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This contributor argues that the Trump administration's practice of withholding or rescinding congressionally appropriated funds is both irresponsible and illegal. The author draws a parallel to President Nixon's impoundments, which were unanimously found unlawful by the Supreme Court, and notes that even Justice Clarence Thomas has previously agreed that such actions are unconstitutional. The piece criticizes the administration for sidestepping the Impoundment Control Act and creating chaos by defunding programs after bipartisan spending bills have been signed into law. This approach is described as a damaging assault on the separation of powers and congressional authority.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that recent tax legislation, while providing some benefits, fails to address the fundamental fiscal challenge of aligning government spending with what Americans are actually willing to pay for. The author contends that simply raising taxes on the wealthy is not a viable solution, as federal revenues have historically remained stable around 17-18% of GDP regardless of tax rates. Instead of continuing to accumulate debt, which burdens future generations, the conversation should shift to what level of government services we truly want and can afford. This requires making difficult choices about spending on various programs, including major entitlements.</p>

          <p>Authorities and family members are continuing a desperate search for Whisper Owen and her 8-month-old daughter, Sandra McCarty, who vanished more than two weeks ago. The Sacramento pair was last seen after a doctor's appointment in Fresno. Owen's car was last detected by a license plate reader in Atwater, California, on the evening of July 15, but there has been no sign of them since. The family is concerned about a potential medical emergency, as Owen has a history of high blood pressure. With no clues or signs of foul play, their disappearance remains a troubling mystery.</p>

          <p>In a significant deviation from the Republican party line, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has used the term "genocide" to describe Israel's actions and the resulting humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Her comments, made on social media, coincide with growing global outrage over widespread starvation and civilian deaths in the Palestinian enclave. While still condemning the October 7th attack by Hamas, Greene's use of the term signals a potential crack in the typically unconditional Republican support for Israel. The shift in rhetoric, also echoed in part by President Trump, comes as graphic images of the famine have proliferated online.</p>

          <p>This article explores the deep connection the Harbaugh family has to Canton, Ohio, a city known as the “Cradle of Coaches.” Before Jim and John Harbaugh became famous NFL coaches, their father, Jack Harbaugh, began his own coaching career there in 1961 after his playing days. The piece recounts several colorful and challenging anecdotes from Jack's early days coaching junior high football for Canton McKinley High. These formative experiences, from dealing with unruly players to being a scout-team quarterback, shaped the family's storied coaching legacy, making their return to Canton for the Hall of Fame game particularly meaningful.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the infamous Hillside Strangler case, which terrorized Los Angeles between 1977 and 1978 with a series of brutal killings of young women. The killers were cousins Angelo Buono and Kenneth Bianchi, who posed as police officers to lure their victims. The investigation was hampered by a lack of coordination until Bianchi was arrested in Washington state and implicated his cousin. However, the prosecution of Buono nearly collapsed when the district attorney's office moved to drop the charges, citing Bianchi's unreliability as a witness, before a judge intervened and ordered the trial to proceed, leading to Buono's conviction.</p>

          <p>A growing number of musical artists, including the popular band King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, are pulling their catalogs from Spotify to protest CEO Daniel Ek's personal investments in an AI defense firm.

The boycotting artists state they do not want their music to be associated with or financially benefit a platform whose leader is involved in the AI warfare industry.

          <p>A recent tragedy in which a gunman claimed in a suicide note that he suffered from CTE due to playing high school football has intensified the debate over the sport's safety for young athletes. While chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a degenerative brain disease caused by repeated head injuries, it can only be definitively diagnosed after death. Experts state that while the risk correlates with the number of seasons played, it is possible for high school players to develop the condition. The incident highlights the ongoing concerns and political pressure in states like California regarding youth tackle football and the long-term health risks involved.</p>
