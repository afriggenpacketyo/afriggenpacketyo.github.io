          <p>In Bogotá, Colombia, a widespread scam known as "pinchallantas" involves vandals on motorcycles intentionally puncturing car tires with sharp objects. They then guide the stranded drivers to complicit mechanics who overcharge for repairs, often creating more damage to inflate the bill. Despite a recent surge in complaints and a police crackdown, the fast-moving nature of the con makes it difficult to stop, highlighting a persistent issue of creative street-level fraud in the city.</p>

          <p>The practice of tipping in the U.S. is rooted in the post-Civil War era, originating as a way for employers to avoid paying fair wages to formerly enslaved Black workers in service jobs. According to the Economic Policy Institute, this system led to the creation of the subminimum tipped wage, currently $2.13 per hour at the federal level. This history reveals that tipping is less a reward for good service and more a mechanism for customers to subsidize employee wages, a system perpetuated by powerful industry lobbying.</p>

          <p>In the hot jungles of northern Guatemala, conservation groups have set up artificial watering holes to help wildlife cope with extreme heat and drought. Motion-activated cameras placed nearby have captured incredible footage of a wide array of species, including elusive jaguars and tapirs, using the water tubs. The project not only provides vital relief for animals but also offers researchers valuable insights into their behavior, demonstrating a simple yet effective way to mitigate some of the impacts of climate change on ecosystems.</p>

          <p>Frankie Muniz, known for his Emmy-nominated role in "Malcolm in the Middle," is now a full-time driver in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series, proving his commitment to motorsports. Unlike some celebrities who dabble in racing, Muniz has put his acting career on hold to compete, insisting his passion for driving predates his Hollywood fame. While facing skepticism, he is dedicated to climbing the NASCAR ladder, viewing racing not as a hobby but as the profession he feels he was always meant to pursue.</p>

          <p>In Augusta, Georgia, a community organizer has spent six years trying to open a freestanding birth center to provide an alternative to hospital births in a region surrounded by maternity care deserts. Despite community support and successfully lobbying for a change in state law, she faces significant hurdles, primarily from local hospitals unwilling to partner with the center. The struggle highlights a national issue where concerns over lost revenue and malpractice liability can prevent the establishment of needed maternal health options.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sinkholes, depressions in the ground caused by water erosion, are reportedly becoming more frequent due to climate change. Research indicates that intensified weather patterns, such as severe droughts followed by heavy rainfall, weaken the ground and lead to collapses, particularly in susceptible "karst terrain." Regions like Turkey's Konya Plain have seen a dramatic rise in sinkholes as drought lowers the water table, a phenomenon exacerbated by human groundwater pumping, posing a growing threat to populated areas worldwide.</p>

          <p>Amid rising skin cancer rates, this article examines the science of sunscreens and debunks common myths. It explains how organic (carbon-based) and physical (mineral-based) sunscreens work to block harmful UVA and UVB radiation, which damages skin and can cause cancer. While some concerns exist about certain chemicals, experts stress that the protective benefits of using any approved sunscreen far outweigh the potential risks, and warn against ineffective do-it-yourself or "natural" alternatives that offer negligible protection.</p>

This measure is intended to allow more humanitarian aid to enter and be distributed within the territory amid growing international concern over a severe hunger crisis.

Several meteorological signs, including warming ocean temperatures in the Main Development Region and a favorable phase of the Madden-Julian Oscillation, point toward a more conducive environment for storm formation. While the season has so far been below average in terms of accumulated energy, experts advise that this is likely to change as the peak months of August and September approach.</p>

          <p>Despite criticism from some prominent right-wing figures, many of Donald Trump's supporters in places like Johnstown, Pennsylvania, remain unfazed by the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files. Interviews reveal a constituency that is largely dismissing the issue, trusting the president, and believing he is the victim of a media double standard. Their loyalty appears rooted in his perceived performance on issues like the economy and border security, suggesting the Epstein story may not have the political impact some critics anticipate among his base.</p>

They contend that for science to be a positive force and defend itself against bad-faith attacks, scientists must honestly reckon with these entanglements rather than denying them, thereby building a more rigorous and resilient practice.</p>
