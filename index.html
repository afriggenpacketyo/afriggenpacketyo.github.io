        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions initiated by the Trump administration, China experienced a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April. This contrasts with market concerns over rising Treasury yields and Moody's downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest this shift indicates changing global investment dynamics, with investors moving away from US dollar assets since the trade war began. Bank of America analysts noted that a weaker US dollar, peaking US bond yields, and China's economic recovery are favorable for emerging markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Limited (CATL), the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) battery maker, saw its shares jump over 10% during its Hong Kong Stock Exchange debut, marking the biggest IPO of the year.

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating a collision between a Mexican navy training ship and the Brooklyn Bridge, which resulted in the deaths of two sailors and injuries to nineteen others.

Investigators are examining the crew's actions, the vessel's condition, and environmental factors to determine the cause, including the status of the engines and whether proper procedures were followed.

These rate cuts are part of a broader stimulus package that includes reductions to the lending rates and the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserves.

          <p>Chinese defence firms showcased AIâ€™s potential to improve combat decisions at an annual military expo in Beijing, giving a glimpse of what could be available to the armed forces. Vendors also demonstrated how AI could be applied to daily training, intelligence gathering, and physical training for soldiers. EverReach AI, for instance, presented an AI-assisted military training model with a flight map near the Taiwan Strait, suggesting its potential use in refining drills around Taiwan. The system learns from each flight training session to suggest actions to commanders.</p>

          <p>A new UK-EU deal, aimed at easing trade frictions, underscores the continuing complex relationship between the UK and its nearest neighbors. While the government touts improvements in trading ties, some Brexiteers criticize the acceptance of "dynamic alignment" with EU rules, trading some power for easier trade. The agreement's details, including costs, defense cooperation, youth travel, and professional qualification recognition, remain to be sorted. This summit is planned as the first of many, reflecting the permanent nature of the UK's uneasy relationship with the EU, regardless of membership.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering accepting a free luxury Boeing 747-8 from Qatar to serve as Air Force One while awaiting delayed replacements, involving secret coordination between Washington and Doha. This arrangement raises ethical questions and concerns about financial sense, given the costs of refitting the plane for presidential use. The Qatari government has denied any intention of using the transaction as part of an influence campaign, and Mr. Trump has said he would not use the plane after leaving office. There are still many complications regarding the acquisition and preparation of the aircraft for presidential use.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's coral reefs are experiencing severe bleaching due to rising ocean temperatures, with 84% of coral reefs under heat stress. Marine scientist Greg Asner notes that the decline of coral reefs is worsening, with some reefs dying in weeks or days. Without healthy reefs, aquatic creatures lose habitats, and coastlines lose natural protection from storms. Efforts are underway to educate tourists about reef-safe sunscreens and to use underwater nurseries for coral regrowth, but significant recovery depends on controlling fossil fuel emissions.</p>
