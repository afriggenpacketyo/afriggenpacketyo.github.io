          <p>In a recent interview, H.R. McMaster, former National Security Advisor, addressed the ongoing shifts within the National Security Council, highlighting a conflict in the administration regarding America's role in global affairs. He suggests that the departure of key figures indicates a struggle between internationalist and retrenchment worldviews. McMaster emphasizes the importance of the NSC staff in providing the President with comprehensive analysis and options, expressing concern that President Trump's impatience may lead him to view the NSC as an impediment. He also touches on the administration's approach to European allies and the influence of certain individuals on the President's decision-making process, noting the risk of replicating flaws from previous administrations' foreign policy. Relevant context: The interview took place amidst reported departures from the National Security Council.</p>

          <p>French police conducted a nighttime raid to rescue the father of a cryptocurrency millionaire who was held hostage for ransom. The victim was located in a house south of Paris and treated for injuries, with reports suggesting that his captors had cut off one of his fingers. Five people have been detained in connection with the abduction, which appears to be part of a growing trend of criminals targeting crypto millionaires for ransom. This incident follows a similar case in January, where a French police unit freed a co-founder of a crypto-wallet firm and his wife.</p>

          <p>Dozens of US arts organizations have received notifications that their government grants have been terminated, following President Trump's proposal to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). The cancellations affect various projects, including those aimed at communities of color. The proposed budget plan includes cuts in support to public broadcasters, aligning with the president's efforts to reduce government support for the arts. Democrats and arts unions have criticized the cuts as disastrous to public access to creative expression, while the NEA is updating its grant-making policy priorities to focus on projects that reflect the nation's artistic heritage as prioritized by the president.</p>

          <p>Saturday Night Live's cold open satirized President Trump's first 100 days in office, portraying him signing a series of absurd executive orders. The sketch included orders reinstating Columbus Day, allowing older men to date younger women, reducing interracial couples in commercials, and banning Hispanic babies from getting their ears pierced. The satire highlights the perception of Trump's affinity for executive orders and the potential for unexpected policy decisions. The humor stems from the unsettling possibility that some of the outlandish orders could be attempted in reality.</p>
