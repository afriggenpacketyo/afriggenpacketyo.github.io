          <p>Tens of thousands of people marched across the Sydney Harbour Bridge in a pro-Palestinian demonstration, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The event proceeded after a last-minute Supreme Court authorization, which overruled a police rejection based on safety and traffic concerns. The protest, which included notable figures like Julian Assange, caused significant traffic disruption but remained peaceful, highlighting mounting pressure on the Australian government regarding its stance on the conflict. Organizers called the court's decision "historic," while police managed the large crowds.</p>

          <p>The BBC has initiated an investigation, aided by an external law firm, into allegations of cocaine use by two unnamed stars on its popular show, "Strictly Come Dancing." The claims were reportedly first made in a legal submission from a former celebrity contestant and were said to be widely discussed among the show's participants. This probe comes after a series of other controversies related to behavior on the show, prompting the BBC to implement new welfare measures for cast and crew last year. The corporation has stated it has clear protocols for handling such complaints.</p>

          <p>Russian authorities have attributed a large fire at an oil depot near the Black Sea resort of Sochi to a Ukrainian drone attack, which also led to a temporary suspension of flights at the local airport. This incident was part of a wider wave of overnight drone attacks by Ukraine, with Russia claiming its air defenses intercepted 93 drones in total. Meanwhile, a Russian missile strike in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv injured at least seven civilians, continuing a week of deadly attacks on Ukrainian population centers.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce a new offense that could imprison individuals for up to five years for advertising illegal Channel crossings online. This measure, part of a broader bill, aims to give law enforcement more power to disrupt people-smuggling gangs that often use social media to promote their services. The proposal comes as the number of migrants arriving in the UK on small boats reaches a record high for the year, prompting criticism from the opposition for being "too little, too late" to fix the problem.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England's monetary policy committee is widely anticipated to announce an interest rate cut this week, likely reducing the headline rate to 4.0%. This decision is viewed as a necessary measure to prevent economic contraction, driven by factors including a rising unemployment rate and the global trade impact of new US import tariffs. Despite potential relief for borrowers, the move underscores concerns of imminent stagflation, a scenario where growth slows while inflation remains stubbornly above the official 2% target. The committee's updated forecasts are expected to reflect a gloomy economic outlook for the UK. (not investment advice)</p>

This event follows another strong earthquake and a rare volcanic eruption in the same region within the past week, highlighting significant recent seismic activity in Russia's Far East.

          <p>A couple in Guernsey was astonished to discover an intact World War II German bunker buried beneath their property in the Torteval area. Aware that their home was on the site of a former gun emplacement, they began digging after a tip from a previous resident and unearthed the structure. The bunker, which contains two main rooms and German writing on the walls, is now being converted into a games room and gym, with the couple committed to preserving its historical elements as a reminder of the island's wartime occupation.</p>

          <p>The family of Lucy Hargreaves, a 22-year-old mother who was shot and killed in her Liverpool home, has made a renewed appeal for information on the 20th anniversary of her murder. On August 3, 2005, three men burst into her home, shot her as she slept on a sofa, and set the house on fire. Her partner and two-year-old daughter escaped the blaze from an upstairs window. Despite 21 arrests over the years, no one has ever been convicted for the crime, which police described as brutal.</p>

The rush by criminals to produce these knock-offs often involves inferior or toxic materials, with the Intellectual Property Office noting that counterfeiting is a major source of criminal income, second only to drug trafficking.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new climate study suggests that significant reductions in air pollution in East Asia over the past decade may have inadvertently accelerated global warming. While the clean-up efforts have improved public health, the removal of aerosols—pollutant particles that reflect sunlight—has reduced their cooling effect, potentially unmasking the full impact of greenhouse gases. Researchers estimate that the 75% drop in sulphur dioxide in the region since 2013 could have contributed up to 0.05 degrees Celsius to the global surface warming rate, highlighting a complex trade-off in environmental policy.</p>

          <p>A small earthquake with a magnitude of 3.0 rattled parts of the New York City metropolitan area on Saturday night, with its epicenter located near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey.

The U.S. Geological Survey noted that while earthquakes are uncommon on the East Coast, this event was not considered significant, though it follows a larger, more widely felt 4.8 magnitude quake that occurred in April 2024.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, Germany has agreed to finance the production of long-range combat drones directly within Ukraine, marking a new level of military-industrial cooperation between the two nations.

This move represents a deeper German commitment, moving beyond supplying existing weapons to directly investing in and sharing technology with Ukraine's burgeoning domestic defense industry, which also benefits German startups.</p>

The piece suggests that the aggressive actions have undermined diplomacy, strengthened hardliners in Tehran, and that a path to peace requires a renewed focus on regional nuclear pacts.</p>

The proposed deal would have confirmed a block of nominees in exchange for policy concessions, but it collapsed after Trump told Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer to "GO TO HELL!" on social media. The stalemate leaves dozens of nominations pending and has led Republicans to threaten changing Senate rules to speed up confirmations when they return, escalating partisan tensions over the confirmation process.</p>
