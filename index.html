          <p>A 27-year-old man from Michigan was killed by law enforcement after he opened fire on a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen, Texas. The suspect, identified as Ryan Lewis Mosqueda, fired dozens of rounds, injuring two officers and a border patrol employee before being neutralized. Authorities found additional weapons in his vehicle, which was spray-painted with a phrase from the "Call of Duty" video game series. The FBI has taken over the investigation, and a motive has not yet been determined.</p>

          <p>A judge has granted a request for a mental evaluation for Jose Ibarra, who was convicted and sentenced to life for the murder of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley. Ibarra's attorneys argued that he may not have been competent to stand trial, claiming he suffers from a "congenital deficiency." Prosecutors noted no evidence of incompetence was presented during the trial but did not oppose the evaluation for post-conviction proceedings. The case has drawn national attention due to Ibarra's status as an immigrant who entered the U.S. illegally.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has reportedly allowed a rule requiring passengers in standard security lines to remove their shoes to expire at several U.S. airports. While the change is being phased in, travelers at airports including BWI, LAX, and LaGuardia have reported not having to remove footwear. Previously, only passengers with TSA PreCheck were exempt from this requirement. The TSA stated it is always exploring ways to enhance the passenger experience while maintaining strong security.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of the catastrophic Texas floods that killed over 100 people, political finger-pointing has begun regarding the response and potential preventative measures. Senator Ted Cruz, after returning from a trip to Greece, acknowledged the need for a retrospective review of the warning systems. Meanwhile, Democrats are questioning whether job cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under the Trump administration impacted the forecasting and warning capabilities. The White House has dismissed these claims as a "depraved lie" during a time of national mourning.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nominated President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in the Middle East. The discussion was expected to focus on securing a ceasefire in the 21-month-long Gaza war, with negotiators from Israel and Hamas meeting in Qatar. Trump expressed optimism about a deal and also stated his intention to resume sending weapons to Ukraine to help them defend against Russia. Netanyahu addressed the future of Gaza, suggesting Palestinians should have the "free choice" to leave if they wish.</p>

The initial plan was part of a Trump administration push to shrink the federal workforce to pre-Biden administration levels.

          <p>Aaron Phypers has filed for divorce from his wife of six years, actor Denise Richards, citing "irreconcilable differences." In his petition, Phypers is seeking spousal support from Richards, claiming he has had no income since closing a business last year while estimating her monthly earnings at over $250,000. The couple, who married in 2018, do not share any children. This was Richards' second marriage, following her divorce from Charlie Sheen, and Phypers' second, after his split from actor Nicollette Sheridan.</p>

          <h2>California Rejects Trump Administration's Demand to Ban Transgender Athletes from Girls' Sports</h2>

          <p>The California Department of Education has formally refused to comply with a Trump administration directive to bar transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women's sports. The federal Office for Civil Rights had determined California's inclusive policy violates the rights of female students under Title IX and gave the state a deadline to comply. By rejecting the demand, California risks an unspecified "imminent enforcement action," potentially including the withholding of federal funding. The confrontation highlights the deep divide between state and federal interpretations of civil rights protections for transgender students.</p>

          <p>Roman Starovoit, who was dismissed as Russia's Transport Minister by President Vladimir Putin, died by suicide hours later, according to Russian officials. His body was found with a gunshot wound in a car outside Moscow. Starovoit had previously served as the governor of the Kursk region and was reportedly implicated in an embezzlement investigation related to the construction of regional fortifications. His death occurred amid significant air travel disruptions across Russia, which the government attributed to "external interference" as Ukraine reported successful long-range strikes.</p>

          <h2>Texas Disaster Highlights California's Own Significant Risk from Extreme Floods</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 19:13:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The deadly flash flood in Texas serves as a stark reminder of the similar dangers California faces from extreme weather events. Experts note that California has many low-lying areas along rivers and creeks, hilly topography, and a history of devastating floods and debris flows. While the state's storm patterns differ from Texas, an intense atmospheric river could produce catastrophic, wide-scale flooding. Scientific projections indicate that climate change is increasing these risks, though California's stronger local planning and building regulations may offer better protection than what was seen in Texas.</p>

          <p>Seraphine, the upscale maternity fashion retailer famously worn by Catherine, Princess of Wales, has ceased trading and entered administration. The company, which had struggled with "fragile consumer confidence" and rising costs, has made the majority of its 95 staff redundant. Founded in 2002, the brand's popularity surged after being worn by royalty, leading to a stock market listing in 2021 before it was taken private again in 2023. Administrators are now exploring options for the business and its assets, including the potential sale of the brand name. (not investment advice)</p>

In his specially equipped "Feminine Shuttle," Dr. Baksheiev performs examinations and minor surgeries, finding higher-than-average rates of malignant tumors.

          <p>The public inquiry into the UK's Post Office scandal is set to release the first part of its final report, focusing on compensation for the victims and the human impact of the crisis. Thousands of sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted for financial shortfalls caused by the faulty Horizon IT system. While this initial report will make recommendations on redress, the second part, which will assign blame, is not expected until at least 2026. Victims hope the findings will pressure the government and Post Office to deliver on promises of full and fair compensation.</p>

          <p>King Charles III is playing a central role in the first UK state visit by a French president since 2008, a trip aimed at strengthening post-Brexit ties between the two nations. The visit by Emmanuel Macron involves significant royal pageantry and is seen as a key "soft power" opportunity to reinforce cooperation on defense, trade, and migration. Having already established a warm rapport with the Macrons during a 2023 visit to France, the King's involvement is considered crucial for diplomacy. The trip is hoped to reset a relationship that had become strained in recent years.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors not to overreact to the Trump administration's latest round of tariff announcements, suggesting they are likely a starting point for negotiations rather than a final policy. Following a market dip after President Trump set an August 1 deadline for new tariffs on 14 countries, Cramer argued that the administration has a history of postponing or reducing such levies. He believes the ultimate goal is not to reshore manufacturing but to increase U.S. exports by pressuring trade partners into more favorable deals for American goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A large-scale operation involving dozens of federal officers and national guard troops in Los Angeles's MacArthur Park neighborhood has drawn sharp criticism from local officials. Mayor Karen Bass called the show of force, which included armored vehicles and agents on horseback, a "political stunt" and an "intimidation tactic" that looked like a "city under siege." The raid, which appeared to result in no arrests, was seen by immigrant rights advocates as part of the Trump administration's effort to make an example of Los Angeles and create a "reality TV spectacle" of immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock fell by 6.8%, erasing $79 billion in market value, as investors grew concerned about CEO Elon Musk's increasing political involvement. The drop followed Musk's announcement that he is forming a new political party, "the America party," and a public spat with President Donald Trump. Analysts suggest investors are exhausted by Musk's political activities, fearing they serve as a distraction and could lead to negative repercussions for his businesses. The move is seen as the opposite of what shareholders want during a crucial period for the electric carmaker. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic raises questions about the coherence and control of U.S. foreign and defense policy under the Trump administration. It argues that with the President's interest being "capricious and episodic," key decisions are often driven by lower-level, unelected officials like Undersecretary of Defense Elbridge Colby, who reportedly initiated a halt on Ukraine weapon shipments. This creates a dysfunctional system, common in authoritarian states, where policy voids are filled by functionaries pursuing their own agendas without clear guidance from the top, leading to inconsistent and unpredictable actions on the world stage.</p>
