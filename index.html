            <p>On Easter Sunday in National Harbor, Maryland, police responded to a stabbing call where a man and woman were critically wounded; the suspect then set fire to an apartment. Officers later encountered the suspect at National Harbor, where he was armed with a knife and moved towards an officer, leading to an officer-involved shooting. The suspect was shot and subsequently died at a nearby hospital, while the stabbing victims are in critical but stable condition. The Maryland Attorney General's Independent Investigations Division is now investigating the incident.</p>

            <p>Austan Goolsbee, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, suggests that President Trump's tariffs could lead to a temporary surge in economic activity due to preemptive purchasing and inventory stockpiling by businesses and consumers. This "artificially high" activity in the short term could be followed by a slowdown in the summer as demand is satisfied early, particularly in sectors like the auto industry. Goolsbee remains optimistic about the longer-term economic outlook, citing steady employment and decreasing inflation, but acknowledges uncertainty surrounding future tariff negotiations.

            <p>A draft executive order reportedly prepared for President Trump proposes sweeping changes to the U.S. State Department, including shuttering embassies in Sub-Saharan Africa and eliminating bureaus focused on democracy, human rights, and international organizations. The order suggests consolidating regional bureaus into four "regional corps" and overhauling the process for selecting diplomats, emphasizing alignment with the president's foreign policy vision. While the White House has not commented, Secretary of State Marco Rubio dismissed the report as "fake news," the proposed changes aim to streamline mission delivery and align the department with an "America First Strategic Doctrine."</p>

            <p>The felling of a 500-year-old oak tree in Enfield, North London, by Toby Carvery has sparked widespread anger and debate.

            <p>Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of violating a 30-hour "Easter truce" announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed Ukraine's front line was hit by numerous Russian assaults, while Russia's defense ministry stated it had repelled Ukrainian attacks and accused Kyiv of drone and shell launches. Zelenskyy dismissed Putin's truce declaration as a "PR" exercise, while the Russian defense ministry insisted its troops had strictly observed the ceasefire. The announcement came shortly after US President Trump threatened to "take a pass" on brokering further peace talks.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen stated that the El Salvadorian government initially attempted to prevent him from visiting Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national mistakenly deported from Maryland, before reversing course. Van Hollen met with Abrego Garcia after holding press conferences highlighting the government's violation of international law. President Nayib Bukele posted images of the meeting with drinks, which Van Hollen said were staged, to create a false impression of Abrego Garcia's situation. Abrego Garcia, who has been transferred to a different facility, remains at the center of a legal battle regarding his return to the U.S.</p>

While the idea of commodifying national belonging is generally unpopular, Trump's focus on efficiency and financial gain reflects a market-driven approach to immigration. This could involve streamlining the U.S.'s "golden-visa" scheme, which is currently considered cumbersome and underpriced.</p>
