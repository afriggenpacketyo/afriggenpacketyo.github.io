          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators announced plans to cut key interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio in an effort to bolster economic growth amidst trade tensions with the United States. The People's Bank of China will reduce the seven-day reverse repurchase rates by 10 basis points, leading to a decrease in the loan prime rate, while also lowering the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points, injecting significant liquidity into the market. This move comes as Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng is set to hold talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Switzerland to discuss tariff and trade matters, signaling a potential turning point in the ongoing trade war. The measures aim to stabilize markets, support exporters, aid small businesses, and boost domestic consumption amid escalating tariffs imposed by both countries.</p>

          <p>Four women, identified as Jane Does, have filed a lawsuit against Motown legend Smokey Robinson and his wife, Frances Robinson, accusing the singer of sexual assault and creating a hostile work environment. The women, who worked as housekeepers for the Robinsons, claim that Smokey Robinson sexually assaulted them repeatedly over several years, while Frances Robinson allegedly failed to prevent the abuse and subjected them to racially charged epithets and created a hostile work environment. The lawsuit seeks $50 million in damages, alleging sexual battery, assault, false imprisonment, and failure to pay minimum wage.

          <p>Police in Austin, Texas, are searching for a 9-year-old girl, Ava Marie Gonzales, who has been missing since December 2017, after her mother, Virginia Marie Gonzales, was arrested for allegedly locking her 7-year-old daughter in a closet. The 7-year-old was found malnourished and barricaded in a closet, leading to the arrest of Gonzales on a charge of injury to a child. Authorities are concerned about Ava's welfare due to the circumstances in which her sibling was found, and the mother has provided conflicting information about Ava's whereabouts.

The technology, developed by Yves Ocello from IB2, neutralizes silica and sulfur, allowing high-silica bauxite to be refined using the Bayer method.

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new law to criminalize climbing on the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square, along with other war memorials. Offenders could face up to three months in prison and a £1,000 fine for desecrating the monument. The move comes after the statue has been targeted by demonstrators in recent years, including those protesting against various issues. The law aims to ensure that the statue is treated with the respect it deserves, alongside other sacred war memorials around the country.</p>

          <p>A year after a tornado destroyed his family's home in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, 9-year-old River Garrett is focused on rebuilding and finding perspective. Despite the loss, River and his family consider themselves lucky, especially compared to others in the neighboring town of Barnsdall, where rebuilding efforts are still ongoing. River's positive outlook and awareness of others' struggles highlight the importance of perspective in healing from loss.

          <p>Elon Musk's team attempted to keep details of his Texas mansion and security operations private after neighbors complained about unpermitted construction. His employees cited Musk's work with the Trump administration as a reason to exempt his property records from public records laws. The effort was unsuccessful, and Musk lost an appeal to keep the fence and gate on his property. The article notes that the mansion is one of three Musk bought for his children and their mothers and has become a hub for his security operations.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is reportedly planning to eliminate the Energy Star program, a popular energy efficiency certification for home appliances. The decision was announced during a staff meeting where managers stated that divisions overseeing climate change and energy efficiency would be eliminated. The move is part of a broader restructuring that will shrink the EPA's staffing to levels last seen during the Reagan administration. The Energy Star program has been credited with saving households and businesses billions of dollars in energy costs and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly terrorist attack in Kashmir, India launched strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, claiming to target terrorist infrastructure.

The strikes come after weeks of rising tension between the nuclear-armed neighbors over the shootings in the picturesque resort town of Pahalgam. The 22 April attack by a group of militants saw 26 people killed, with survivors saying the militants were singling out Hindu men.</p>

The operation, which targeted nine sites, follows a militant attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, in which 26 people were killed last month. Pakistan has every right to give a robust response to this act of war imposed by India, and a strong response is indeed being given. Most airlines are diverting out of Pakistani airspace, flight tracker FlightRadar24 said on X, while Indian airlines such as IndiGo and SpiceJet said that airports in northern India and flights were impacted.</p>
