          <p>A new study reveals that nearly one in five urinary tract infections (UTIs) in a Southern California patient group were linked to E. coli strains found in contaminated meat. Researchers used genomic analysis to trace the bacteria from grocery store meat, primarily turkey and chicken, to human infections. The findings suggest that improving food safety standards could significantly reduce the incidence of these common and sometimes dangerous infections, which disproportionately affect women and the elderly. The study also noted a higher risk in lower-income areas, highlighting potential systemic issues in food supply and handling.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police in London is undertaking a massive review of 9,000 child sexual exploitation cases spanning a 15-year period. This initiative follows a national report that found such crimes were more widespread and organized than previously understood. The force acknowledged past failings and has implemented new training for thousands of officers to better identify and investigate group-based offending. The review aims to address historical shortcomings and ensure justice for victims who were let down by the authorities meant to protect them.</p>

          <p>During protests against a planned immigration enforcement surge in the San Francisco Bay Area, officers shot at a U-Haul truck that was reversing towards them outside the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda. The driver was wounded but sustained non-life-threatening injuries and was later taken into custody. The incident occurred after a day of tense demonstrations, where protesters blocked the base entrance to oppose the use of the facility as a staging area for Border Patrol agents.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The historic East Wing of the White House was demolished to make way for a new, $300 million ballroom, a move initiated by President Donald Trump. The rapid deconstruction has shocked many observers and historians who view it as a break from presidential norms and a disregard for the building's historical significance. Pundits discussed the president's authority to alter such a landmark, with some interpreting the action as a symbol of his unconventional approach to the presidency and a challenge to traditional checks and balances. The demolition has raised questions about the preservation of national heritage sites.</p>

          <p>Following the controversial demolition of the White House East Wing, a journalist embarked on a quest to locate the historic rubble. The search led to a public golf course in East Potomac Park, where trucks were seen depositing dirt from the site, reportedly to be used in creating a new golf hole. Further investigation traced the debris trail to an industrial park in Maryland, though site workers were tight-lipped and denied receiving White House remnants. The article reflects on how a cherished national symbol can be reduced to rubble and hauled away, its final resting place shrouded in secrecy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has abruptly ended trade talks with Canada, a decision that experts warn could lead to higher prices for consumers on goods like cars, auto parts, and home appliances. The move was reportedly in response to a Canadian television ad that featured former President Ronald Reagan cautioning against trade wars. This halt in negotiations may keep existing steep tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum in place for longer, affecting U.S. manufacturing costs. While the broader USMCA trade agreement remains, the breakdown in talks could create uncertainty for future negotiations and economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A vibrant 1943 portrait by Pablo Picasso of his muse and partner, Dora Maar, sold for $37 million at an auction in Paris. Titled "Bust of a Woman with a Flowered Hat," the painting had been in a private family collection since 1944 and was hidden from public view for over 80 years. The work captures a difficult period in the couple's relationship as it was coming to an end. The final sale price surpassed expectations and marked the highest price paid for an artwork in France this year, highlighting the enduring market power of Picasso's work.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated he would like China's assistance in dealing with Russia to help bring an end to the war in Ukraine. Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump mentioned his "very good relationship" with Chinese President Xi Jinping, suggesting Xi could have a "big influence on Putin." The statement comes as Trump expresses growing frustration with the lack of progress in ceasefire negotiations with Moscow. This potential diplomatic shift is notable given that China is Russia's most significant ally, providing crucial economic support amid Western sanctions.</p>

          <p>With an early flu season underway in England, the National Health Service (NHS) is urging parents to get their children vaccinated, especially during the half-term school break. Health officials report that flu cases and hospitalizations are increasing, particularly among children, who are considered significant spreaders of the virus. Most children are offered a quick and painless nasal spray vaccine. The vaccination campaign aims to protect children from serious illness and reduce the overall community spread of the virus, which health experts warn can be unpredictable and deadly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two-time Olympic soccer gold medalist Abby Wambach offers unconventional parenting advice, urging parents not to attend their children's sports practices. She argues that a parent's absence allows children to develop internal motivation, resilience, and the freedom to take risks and make mistakes without feeling watched. By not being present, parents can avoid inadvertently making their children's motivation dependent on external approval. Wambach suggests this approach helps kids become self-starters, a valuable trait for success later in life, and encourages parents to focus on sportsmanship over performance during games.</p>

          <p>Overnight Russian missile and drone attacks have killed at least four people and wounded 20 more in various regions of Ukraine, including the capital, Kyiv. In response, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy renewed his urgent plea for more Western air defense systems, specifically U.S.-made Patriot systems, to protect Ukrainian cities from such assaults. Ukraine's air force reported that it successfully intercepted the majority of the 62 drones and four of the nine missiles launched by Russia. The deadly strikes underscore the ongoing threat to civilian life and infrastructure as the war continues.</p>

          <p>Despite a dramatic 80% decrease in the number of active serial killers since their peak in the 1970s, public fascination with them remains incredibly high, often fueling unfounded rumors like the "Rainey Street Ripper" in Austin, Texas. Experts attribute the decline in serial killings to factors like the disappearance of hitchhiking, advances in DNA technology, and widespread surveillance. However, the cultural appetite for these stories persists in popular media, with shows about past killers becoming major hits. This article explores the societal need for such "monsters" as cautionary figures, even as the nature of violent crime shifts towards mass shootings.</p>

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of Taiwan's return from Japanese rule, a senior Chinese official, Wang Huning, delivered a strong message against Taiwanese independence. He stated that Beijing will leave no room for any "separatist activities" and emphasized the need to deepen cross-strait integration to foster a shared Chinese national identity. The commemoration of "Taiwan Restoration Day" is viewed as a strategic move by Beijing to reinforce its sovereignty claims over the self-ruled island. The address underscores the Chinese Communist Party's unwavering commitment to achieving what it terms the "complete reunification of the motherland."</p>

One builder, Manny Goza, claims to have paid for his house with gold he found over several years. While the work is grueling and returns are uncertain, the allure of striking it rich is drawing renewed attention, supported by financial titans who are also advocating for gold as a key portfolio diversifier.

          <p>President Trump has called for the prosecution of several former Biden-era Justice Department officials, including Attorney General Merrick Garland, FBI Director Christopher Wray, and special counsel Jack Smith. In a social media post, Trump accused them of illegal conduct related to an FBI investigation, dubbed "Arctic Frost," that reportedly obtained phone records of nine Republican lawmakers. This demand is the latest instance of Trump advocating for the prosecution of his political adversaries.
