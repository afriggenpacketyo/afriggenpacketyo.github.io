          <p>U.S. Senator Steve Daines has stated that long-term peace in the Middle East, particularly between Israel and Iran, is contingent upon a change in the Iranian regime. While expressing cautious optimism about the current ceasefire, he believes that a lasting solution requires an Iranian government that recognizes Israel's right to exist. Daines clarified that this change should originate from within Iran, not through U.S. intervention, to ensure its legitimacy. He warned that without such a fundamental shift, any truce is merely a temporary pause in a persistent conflict.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Department of Justice and the FBI has concluded that there is no evidence of a "client list" or of Jeffrey Epstein blackmailing prominent individuals. The two-page memo, which details an exhaustive search of all files, also reaffirmed that Epstein's death in a federal lockup in 2019 was a suicide. This finding contradicts previous statements by Attorney General Pam Bondi and aims to quell widespread public speculation and conspiracy theories surrounding the case. The memo states that perpetuating unfounded theories does not serve the more than 1,000 victims of Epstein's abuse.</p>

          <p>AI-focused cloud provider CoreWeave has announced its intention to acquire data center infrastructure company Core Scientific in an all-stock transaction valued at around $9 billion. The deal is expected to significantly expand CoreWeave's access to power and real estate, adding 1.3 gigawatts of capacity and eliminating future lease obligations. CoreWeave's CEO, Mike Intrator, stated the acquisition will enhance operating efficiency as the company continues to compete with major cloud providers. The transaction, pending shareholder and regulatory approval, is anticipated to close in the fourth quarter of 2025.</p>

          <p>A recent Guardian column criticizes The New York Times for its reporting on New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, suggesting the paper may be trying to undermine his campaign. The critique focuses on a news story about how Mamdani identified his race on a college application, which the columnist argues was a non-story amplified from a questionable source. The piece also points to a pre-primary editorial from the Times that urged voters not to rank Mamdani. The columnist suggests these actions, taken together, appear to constitute a crusade against the progressive candidate.</p>

          <p>Days after a catastrophic flood devastated Camp Mystic in Texas, survivor testimonies are painting a harrowing picture of the disaster. Campers described being awakened by storms before realizing the Guadalupe River had engulfed the camp, with some witnessing first responders pulling girls from the raging water. The deluge, which rose 26 feet in 45 minutes, destroyed low-lying cabins and left a scene of utter devastation. The Christian girls' camp, a beloved institution for generations, has confirmed at least 27 fatalities among its campers and counselors.</p>

          <h2>Officials Face Scrutiny Over Adequacy of Warnings Ahead of Deadly Texas Floods</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the death toll from the Texas floods rises, questions are emerging about whether officials provided adequate and timely warnings to residents and campers. While the National Weather Service issued several alerts, some residents report not receiving them or not understanding the severity of the threat. Local officials have pointed to challenges like a lack of cell service in some areas and the absence of a county-wide siren system due to cost. The debate highlights the "last mile" problem in emergency communications and the difficulty of conveying an unprecedented disaster.</p>

          <p>Jurors in a Liverpool court were shown CCTV footage of an incident at Manchester Airport where two brothers are accused of violently assaulting three police officers. The confrontation allegedly began after one brother headbutted a customer at a Starbucks.

Both brothers deny the allegations of assault causing actual bodily harm, while one also denies an earlier assault on a member of the public.</p>

          <p>As the UK braces for a third heatwave, farmers are warning that the countryside is like a "tinder box" and that major wildfires are a "disaster waiting to happen." Some farmers argue that land management policies incentivizing the removal of grazing animals have led to a dangerous buildup of dry vegetation that fuels fires. With the UK experiencing its warmest and driest spring in decades, the National Farmers' Union is calling for government and fire services to work with them on prevention. The Met Office has issued red alerts for "very high" UV levels.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Pediatrics has found a significant increase in handgun possession among teenagers in Florida over the last 20 years. The research, which analyzed survey data from over 700,000 students, showed that general handgun carrying rose by 65% between 2002 and 2022. The increase was most substantial among females, middle school-aged teens, and white students. In contrast, the study found that carrying a handgun in school actually decreased by 60% during the same period, a trend researchers suggest may be linked to increased school security measures.</p>
