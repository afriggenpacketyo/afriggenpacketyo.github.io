          <p>Constance Marten, recently found guilty in the death of her baby, was a disciple at the Synagogue Church of All Nations in Nigeria as a teenager, a church whose late leader was accused of widespread sexual assault and violence. A fellow disciple described the institution as "a place of torture," though there is no evidence Marten herself was abused there. Years later, Marten communicated that the experience left her confused and that it took her years to feel normal again, suggesting the time deeply affected her mental state and distrust of institutions.</p>

          <p>The Women's Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) is underway in Morocco, showcasing the continent's growing talent but also highlighting familiar organizational and financial problems. While host nation Morocco is emerging as a force in women's football and stars like Nigeria's Asisat Oshoala are competing, the tournament faces issues like last-minute scheduling and smaller venues. Significant pay disparities and financial struggles persist for many teams, with the prize money for WAFCON winners being considerably less than their male counterparts, reflecting broader challenges that hinder the sport's full potential in Africa.</p>

          <p>In a direct interview, U.S. President Donald Trump stated he is "disappointed in him, but not done with him" regarding Russian President Vladimir Putin and the ongoing war in Ukraine. He detailed his frustration with failed peace negotiations, recounting how productive calls are often followed by new attacks on Ukrainian cities. Trump also reversed his previous stance on NATO, now calling the alliance strong, and confirmed a deal to sell weapons to European allies who will, in turn, supply Ukraine, marking a significant shift in his administration's policy.</p>

          <p>The Port of Antwerp-Bruges in Belgium has become a massive holding area for thousands of vehicles destined for the United States, as manufacturers halt shipments to avoid President Trump's steep new tariffs. Port data reveals a significant drop in vehicle transport to the US, particularly a 31.5% decline in heavy equipment like tractors, since the tariffs were announced. This "instant shock" to the supply chain has created logistical bottlenecks and uncertainty for European carmakers, who face a 25% tariff on top of the previous 2.5% rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article from Fox News posits that President Trump's second term has been characterized by aggressive actions to deliver on campaign promises, which are often framed by mainstream media as destructive and anti-democratic. The author argues that just as the Biden administration worked to undo Trump's first-term policies, Trump is now systematically reversing Biden-era reforms on the border, tariffs, and regulations. The article also touches on the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case, suggesting it was a "huge PR disaster" that feeds public sentiment that the powerful are never held accountable.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preserving the work permits and deportation protections for nearly 12,000 Afghans, which were set to expire. The Trump administration had moved to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for this group, arguing that conditions in Afghanistan had improved enough for their safe return. Immigrant advocacy groups sued to block the revocation, and the court's intervention provides a one-week reprieve while it considers the case, highlighting the precarious situation for Afghans who fled the Taliban's return to power.</p>

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the transition to electric vehicles, with EVs now accounting for over 93% of new car sales in 2025 and making up 40% of all passenger cars in Oslo. The country's success is attributed to a long-term strategy of combining strong incentives for EV buyers, such as tax exemptions, with increasingly high taxes on polluting internal combustion engine cars. This sustained policy approach, along with heavy investment in public charging infrastructure, has effectively pushed gasoline and diesel vehicles out of the new car market.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te is reportedly planning to make a "stopover" in the United States, possibly in New York and Texas, on his way to visit Paraguay in August. As Paraguay is one of the few nations that formally recognizes Taiwan, such a visit is diplomatically significant. However, any stop on U.S. soil by a Taiwanese leader is viewed by Beijing as a provocation and a challenge to its sovereignty claims over the island. The potential trip comes at a time of already tense U.S.-China relations and could be derailed to avoid jeopardizing a potential summit between the two nations' presidents.</p>

          <p>Yields on Japanese government bonds have surged to levels not seen in decades, with the 10-year yield hitting its highest point since 2008. This spike is driven by mounting investor concern over Japan's fiscal discipline, as political parties discuss consumption tax cuts ahead of an upcoming election. With Japan already holding one of the world's highest public debt-to-GDP ratios, markets are worried that increased spending or tax cuts funded by more debt could further destabilize the nation's finances, prompting investors to demand higher yields for holding the country's debt.

Tesla contends the driver was solely to blame, alleging he was distracted by a dropped cell phone at the time of the incident.
