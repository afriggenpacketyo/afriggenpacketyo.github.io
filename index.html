          <p>The UK's ambassador to the U.S., Peter Mandelson, has stated he anticipates more of his "embarrassing" correspondence with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein will become public. Following the release of a 2003 letter where he called Epstein his "best pal," Mandelson expressed deep regret over the friendship, attributing it to being deceived by a "charismatic criminal liar." The revelation has prompted political pressure, with opponents questioning Prime Minister Keir Starmer's judgment in appointing Mandelson and demanding full disclosure of all communications.</p>

          <p>In a significant escalation, Poland's air force shot down at least three of nineteen Russian drones that violated its airspace overnight, an act its military command called "unprecedented" aggression. The incident prompted Poland to request the invocation of NATO's Article 4, which allows for consultations among allies when a member's security is threatened. NATO allies, including the U.S. and France, condemned the violation and expressed full solidarity with Poland, while Russia's Kremlin deflected questions regarding the provocation.</p>

          <p>While dining at a seafood restaurant in Washington D.C., former President Donald Trump was met by a mixture of cheering supporters outside and chanting protesters inside. He used the occasion to praise his federal crackdown on crime in the city, claiming it has made the capital safe. Inside the restaurant, a small group of pro-Palestine protesters confronted him before being removed by the Secret Service, while other patrons chanted in support of the former president. The event highlights the deep political divisions surrounding his presence and policies.</p>

          <p>Despite missing quarterly earnings and revenue estimates, Oracle's stock surged after the company issued extraordinarily strong forward-looking guidance for its cloud infrastructure business. The company projects its cloud revenue will jump 77% this fiscal year and anticipates it will grow tenfold within the next five years, driven by massive AI deals with customers like OpenAI. Analysts on the earnings call expressed shock and amazement at the projected growth, which boosted the company's remaining performance obligations to $455 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has asserted that the U.S. economy is slowing down, a view he said was confirmed by a recent Labor Department report. The department significantly revised its nonfarm payrolls data downward by 911,000 jobs for the year through March 2025, the largest such revision in over two decades. While Dimon noted that most consumers are still employed and spending, he stated it is unclear whether the weakening will lead to a recession and expects the Federal Reserve will likely cut interest rates.

          <p>Uber is set to launch helicopter ride-sharing on its app as early as 2026 through an expanded partnership with electric air taxi manufacturer Joby Aviation. The move follows Joby's acquisition of Blade, a helicopter transport company, and advances Uber's long-held ambition to offer air transportation. The integration aims to lay the groundwork for introducing Joby's quiet, zero-emission aircraft in the future. Proponents believe the technology can reduce traffic congestion, though companies still face significant regulatory hurdles from the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has granted a preliminary injunction preventing President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, allowing her to remain in her post as her lawsuit proceeds. The judge ruled that Cook has a strong case that her removal violated the Federal Reserve Act's "for cause" provision, which likely pertains only to conduct while in office. Trump had sought to remove Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud that predated her appointment, part of a broader conflict over the central bank's independence.</p>

This would push the annual headline consumer price index (CPI) to 2.9%, its highest since January. However, the Federal Reserve is still widely expected to cut its benchmark interest rate, as the price increases are largely attributed to tariff-sensitive goods rather than the broader services sector, and the labor market shows signs of weakening.

          <p>Since seizing power in a 2022 coup, Burkina Faso's Captain Ibrahim Traore has cultivated an image on social media as a young, pan-African revolutionary standing up to former colonial powers. However, this narrative contrasts sharply with the reality on the ground, where the security situation has worsened, with jihadist groups controlling large parts of the country. Human rights organizations also point to his consolidation of power, crackdown on the press, and the introduction of authoritarian laws as evidence of an autocratic regime.</p>

          <p>Protesters across France engaged in a day of widespread disruption, blocking roads and clashing with police in an effort to pressure President Emmanuel Macron and his new prime minister. The "Block Everything" movement, which gained momentum online, led to nearly 200 arrests as demonstrators responded to calls for blockades, strikes, and other acts of civil disobedience. The interior minister accused the protesters of attempting to create "a climate of insurrection" amid anger over Macron's leadership and austerity policies.</p>

          <p>A German court has sentenced Issa Al H., a 27-year-old Syrian national, to life in prison for murdering three people and injuring ten in a knife attack at a street festival in Solingen in August 2024. The court also noted the "particular severity of the crime," meaning he will likely never be released. Prosecutors argued the attack was an Islamist-motivated act of terror, and the case has intensified Germany's political debate surrounding asylum policy, internal security, and the challenges of bureaucratic failures in deportation processes.</p>

          <p>A new report from the National Transportation Safety Board provides frightening details about a Delta flight in July that encountered 2.5 minutes of severe turbulence over Wyoming. The incident subjected unbuckled passengers and crew to gravitational forces up to 1.75 times their body weight, violently throwing them into the ceiling. The flight, which had its seatbelt sign off, diverted to Minneapolis, where 18 people were hospitalized. The investigation will examine the pilots' decisions to alter their route and turn off the seatbelt sign.</p>
