          <p>A retired IRS agent from Southern California, Elana Cohen-Roth, has been sentenced to 12 years in state prison after being convicted of defrauding an elderly woman in Sonoma County out of $1 million in life savings. Cohen-Roth befriended the 66-year-old victim while preparing her taxes and then offered her fraudulent "investment opportunities" promising high returns with no risk. The scheme, which ran from 2013 to 2019, involved Cohen-Roth using the victim's money to pay off earlier investors in a Ponzi scheme and fund a lavish lifestyle. The victim was left financially destitute after Cohen-Roth failed to return her money when requested, while the judge gave a lesser sentence due to the defendant's age.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan agreed to a cease-fire after days of escalated fighting, but reports of violence continued, with both sides accusing each other of violating the truce. The cease-fire, announced by President Trump, came after missile, drone, and artillery strikes following a terrorist attack in Kashmir. Despite the agreement, cross-border firing was reported, and India accused Pakistan of breaking the truce, while Pakistan claimed to be committed to the cease-fire. Several countries, including Saudi Arabia and the United States, had been working to de-escalate the conflict, which stems from the unresolved dispute over Kashmir dating back to the 1947 partition. The article includes a graphic showing locations of claimed strikes.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterbacks Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders participated in their first minicamp practice, with Gabriel taking the first snap. However, Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski cautioned against reading too much into the order, stating that the team will evaluate all quarterbacks throughout the spring. The Browns have a crowded quarterback room with Deshaun Watson's status uncertain due to an Achilles injury, along with Kenny Pickett and Joe Flacco also on the roster. Stefanski emphasized that the team has a plan for determining the Week 1 starter and that the evaluation process is all-encompassing.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan have accused each other of ceasefire violations just hours after agreeing to a truce following days of cross-border military strikes. India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri reported explosions in Indian-administered Kashmir and accused Pakistan of repeated violations, while Pakistan's foreign ministry stated its commitment to the ceasefire but blamed India for violations in some areas. The recent fighting, involving drones, missiles, and artillery, marks the worst military confrontation between the two nations in decades, triggered by India's strikes in response to a militant attack in Pahalgam, for which Pakistan denied involvement. President Trump announced the ceasefire, claiming it was brokered by the U.S., a claim partially confirmed by Pakistan.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has directed federal agencies to cease estimating the economic impact of climate change when developing policies and regulations, except where explicitly required by law. This directive effectively shelves the "social cost of carbon" metric, which quantifies the economic damage from global warming, including wildfires, floods, and droughts. Jeffrey B. Clark, acting administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, expressed doubt about the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change. Scientists and environmental groups criticize the move as denying reality, while industry groups like the American Petroleum Institute support limiting the social cost of carbon, as it can justify stricter pollution regulations.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that talks among Ukraine's allies in Kyiv represent a "significant moment" in efforts to secure a ceasefire in the conflict with Russia, while acknowledging it's not "the end of the process." Approximately 30 global leaders reaffirmed their call for Russia to agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire starting Monday, threatening "massive" sanctions if Russia does not comply. President Trump reportedly reaffirmed his support for the ceasefire in a call with Starmer. The leaders warned of new sanctions on Russia's energy and banking sectors if Putin rejects the proposal, while the Kremlin reacted by accusing European leaders of confrontational remarks.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's pursuit of personal profits through cryptocurrency ventures is hindering his crypto legislation agenda, as lawmakers rejected the GENIUS Act due to conflicts of interest. Senator Jeff Merkley criticized the president's meme coin, $TRUMP, and his family's crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, for creating a "pay-for-play scheme." The GENIUS Act, aimed at establishing federal rules for stablecoins, failed to advance in the Senate due to Democratic defections. Some investors and entrepreneurs believe Trump's financial entanglements are impeding long-awaited advancements in the crypto industry and harming the reputation of the U.S. crypto industry.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may struggle to avoid President Trump's "Too Late" label due to the volatile policy mix of tariffs and uncertainty surrounding economic data. Economists suggest Powell's cautious approach to interest rate cuts, despite Trump's insistence on lower rates, could lead to the Fed acting too slowly. The president's tariffs threaten both growth and inflation, creating a no-win situation for Powell, who is attempting to balance the Fed's dual mandate of full employment and low inflation. Some economists believe that if the Fed waits for labor market confirmation, it will be behind the curve, potentially leading to a recession.</p>

          <p>A preliminary 4.1 magnitude earthquake struck parts of the southern U.S. on Saturday morning, with the epicenter near Greenback, Tennessee. Residents in Atlanta and western North Carolina reported feeling the tremors. The USGS initially reported the earthquake as a 3.5 magnitude quake before increasing it to 4.1. There were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries. The Eastern Tennessee seismic zone is one of the most active in the Southeast, and earthquakes are not uncommon in the region.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Britain, France, Germany, and Poland, on their first joint visit to Ukraine, threatened Russia with “new and massive” sanctions on its banking and energy sectors if President Putin refused to agree to a full, unconditional 30-day cease-fire. The effort, coordinated with the White House, calls for a truce to begin on Monday. The Trump administration has proposed the 30-day cease-fire, to which Kyiv agreed, during talks this spring in Saudi Arabia. The visit came one day after Russia’s celebration of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a wayward Soviet spacecraft intended for Venus, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after 53 years and splashed down in the Indian Ocean. Launched in 1972, the spacecraft became stranded in Earth’s orbit after a rocket booster malfunctioned. The event is a reminder of the Cold War space race and the Soviet Union's ambitious Venera program, which achieved several firsts in exploring Venus. While the re-entry is not unusual, it highlights the increasing number of objects falling from the sky as nations and companies launch more hardware into orbit.</p>
