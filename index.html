        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, halting the Trump administration's plans to significantly cut jobs and reorganize major federal agencies. Judge Illston ruled that agencies cannot undertake large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force that disregard congressional mandates, and the President must partner with Congress for such actions. The order effectively pauses any further reductions in force and reorganization of the executive branch for the duration of the lawsuit, ensuring that agencies continue to fulfill their statutory duties as defined by Congress. This decision marks a significant legal challenge to the administration's efforts to reshape the federal workforce.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is implementing a policy to expedite the deportation of certain migrants by terminating their immigration court cases. ICE prosecutors are requesting immigration judges to dismiss cases, allowing agents to arrest these individuals and place them in a fast-tracked "expedited removal" process. This process bypasses the lengthy immigration court system, enabling quicker deportations for migrants who lack proper documentation and cannot prove they have been in the U.S. for more than two years. Advocates report arrests of migrants outside courthouses, raising concerns about due process and legal representation.</p>

          <p>Democrats are strongly criticizing the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," passed by the House, arguing it disproportionately benefits the wealthy while harming low-income Americans. The bill extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts, increases military and border security spending, and cuts Medicaid and SNAP. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates it will add $3.8 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, with preliminary analyses suggesting the lowest-income Americans will see a decrease in resources while the highest earners gain. Democrats claim the bill strips healthcare, increases poverty, and denies communities necessary resources.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration following the revocation of its ability to enroll international students, accusing the administration of First Amendment violations and retaliation. The lawsuit alleges the administration's action, which revokes the university's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, is retribution for Harvard exercising its rights to control its governance and curriculum. Harvard claims it complied with the administration's demands for information on student visa holders, and that the decision could affect nearly a quarter of its student body. The administration says Harvard failed to condemn antisemitism and created an unsafe environment for Jewish students.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he is recommending a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, effective June 1, citing stalled trade negotiations and unfair trade practices. Trump complained about trade barriers, VAT taxes, and lawsuits against American companies, leading to a significant trade deficit. The announcement came shortly after he threatened tariffs on Apple products made outside the U.S., causing immediate drops in U.S. stock futures and European stock markets. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hopes this will "light a fire under the EU" to negotiate.</p>

Trump suggested this exchange could lead to broader diplomatic efforts to end the conflict, while spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that there were "no decisions or agreements yet on the next venue for negotiations between Russia and Ukraine." The prisoner exchange was agreed upon during the first direct Russia-Ukraine peace talks in weeks, and the process may take several days to complete. Trump stated before his second term that he could end the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours.</p>

Trump's social media posts urged Apple to manufacture iPhones in the U.S. or face a 25% tariff and criticized the European Union's trade posture, recommending a 50% tariff on EU goods. The market dip reversed some gains made in recent weeks as Trump rolled back levies, and consumers face the highest overall average effective tariff rate since 1934.</p>

The initial study suggested the presence of dimethyl sulfide, a gas exclusively produced by life on Earth, in K2-18b's atmosphere. However, the new analyses found no compelling evidence of this gas, with one study suggesting the signal could be attributed to propyne, a gas used in welding.

          <p>A tax and policy bill passed by House Republicans would significantly impede the growth of electric vehicles by repealing critical subsidies. The bill eliminates subsidies for battery manufacturing, incentives for electric vehicle purchases, and funding for charging stations, while also imposing a new annual fee on electric car owners. Analysts predict this will raise electric car prices, slow sales, and potentially delay automakers' plans for new factories. Environmentalists warn that the rollback will lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions and dirtier urban air, placing the U.S. further behind China and Europe in electric vehicle adoption.</p>

          <p>Mark Dial, a former Philadelphia police officer, has been convicted of voluntary manslaughter, reckless endangerment, and possessing an instrument of crime, but acquitted of murder charges, in the shooting death of Eddie Irizarry during a 2023 traffic stop. Dial fatally shot Irizarry as he sat in his car; Dial's attorneys argued he acted in self-defense, believing Irizarry was holding a gun. Dial could face up to six years in prison at his sentencing in July. The verdict follows a series of legal twists and turns in the case.</p>

The findings contradict claims from the White House that a Chinese lab leak was the "real source" of the pandemic. The study focused on sarbecoviruses, including Sars-CoV-1 and Sars-CoV-2, tracing the original Sars-CoV-1 to western China before its emergence in Guangdong.</p>
