          <p>This BBC Verify article examines the UK government's progress on key pledges related to illegal immigration and asylum. While the government promised to end the use of asylum hotels by 2029, the number of hotels used actually increased between July and December. Efforts to disrupt people-smuggling gangs are underway, but progress is difficult to measure, although French authorities have prevented some crossings. The government has also pledged to clear the asylum backlog, which has seen a 50% increase in decisions, but the overall backlog has still risen due to a record number of applications. While returns of those with no legal right to remain in the UK have increased, the number of forced removals remains relatively low.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Louisiana invalidated an EEOC regulation mandating that most U.S. employers provide accommodations, such as time off, for workers seeking abortions. The ruling, a victory for conservative and religious groups, argues that the EEOC exceeded its authority by including abortion under pregnancy-related conditions in the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. This law, initially enjoying bipartisan support, aims to protect pregnant workers but faced backlash when the EEOC included abortion coverage. The judge's decision vacates the abortion provision, while the rest of the regulations remain in effect, and the Trump administration is unlikely to appeal this ruling, further signaling the political divide on women's reproductive rights.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's tour of the Persian Gulf, Gulf leaders are deepening ties with the US, signaling a potential shift in the region's geopolitical landscape. This realignment poses risks for China, which has cultivated the Gulf as a key partner for energy imports and infrastructure projects. Trump's focus on redirecting Gulf capital into US markets threatens China's access to petrodollars. Additionally, the easing of sanctions on Syria signals a strategic realignment, potentially impacting regional dynamics and further complicating China's role in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Louisiana State Police have arrested two individuals, Cortnie Harris and Corvanntay Baptiste, for allegedly assisting some of the ten inmates who recently escaped from a New Orleans jail. Harris is accused of transporting two of the escaped inmates to various locations within New Orleans and was in contact with another inmate before the escape. Baptiste allegedly provided food to one of the escapees, Corey Boyd, while he was in hiding. These arrests follow the apprehension of a third person, a jail maintenance worker, who is accused of disabling water to the cell, facilitating the inmates' escape.

          <p>President Trump is reportedly shifting his approach to the Russia-Ukraine war, moving away from personally brokering a cease-fire agreement. After calls with Presidents Putin and Zelensky, Trump suggested that he will no longer work to personally broker an agreement between the two leaders, stating that Europe should handle the situation. This shift comes after Trump felt frustrated by Putin's rejection of a meeting in Istanbul. While the US will continue sharing intelligence and providing some aid, this move places greater responsibility on Europe to support Ukraine and potentially leads to further Russian gains. Trump's primary motivation for ending the conflict may be to normalize relations with Moscow and negotiate a trade deal involving Russia's rare-earth minerals.</p>

The flight, carrying nearly 100 passengers, landed safely, and passengers were evacuated. The NTSB's investigation is ongoing to determine if the oil reservoir was in that state before takeoff.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the deportation of eight men to South Sudan "unquestionably" violated his order requiring migrants to have a meaningful opportunity to challenge their removal to third countries. The judge criticized the Department of Homeland Security's actions and questioned whether the deportees had a fair chance to object. Justice Department attorneys argued the orders were unclear, leading to "misunderstanding." The Department of Homeland Security defended the deportations, stating that the men were convicted of heinous crimes, including murder and sexual assault, and that South Sudan was not their final destination. The judge will decide later whether to hold Homeland Security officials in contempt of court.</p>

ICE cited a no-contact visitation policy and unspecified security concerns as reasons for the denial.
