        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Yields on U.S. Treasury bonds rose significantly after a federal appeals court ruled that most of the Trump administration's global tariffs are illegal, vesting that power solely with Congress. The decision raises the possibility that the government may have to refund billions in collected tariff revenue, which could necessitate a surge in new Treasury issuance to cover the shortfall. This development adds further stress to the U.S. fiscal situation, contributing to market uncertainty and pushing borrowing costs higher for the government. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A judge in France has ordered actor Gerard Depardieu to stand trial on charges of sexual assault, following accusations made by actor Charlotte Arnould in 2018. Depardieu, who has denied the allegations, has been accused of inappropriate conduct by approximately 20 women. This legal development follows a separate conviction in May, where he received an 18-month suspended sentence for sexually assaulting two other women on a film set in 2021. The decision marks a significant step in the legal proceedings against the prolific 76-year-old actor.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's long-term government borrowing costs have surged to their highest level since 1998, placing significant pressure on the nation's finances ahead of the next Budget. The interest rate, or yield, on 30-year government bonds jumped to 5.698% amid growing investor concern about the stability of public finances. This increase makes it more expensive for the government to borrow and tightens the fiscal constraints on Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who must adhere to self-imposed rules about debt reduction.

          <p>China held its largest-ever military parade to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, using the event to display its advanced weaponry and deepening geopolitical alliances.

The parade featured hypersonic weapons and nuclear-capable missiles, underscoring China's growing military might and its strengthening ties with nations adversarial to the West.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Femicide Census campaign group has revealed a startling statistic about violence against women in the UK. According to the data from 2022, more women were killed by their own sons than by a stranger, with 12 such cases compared to 11. The report sheds light on the often-hidden issue of child-to-parent abuse, which advocates say is not adequately recognized by support services, leaving many mothers to endure serious violence without sufficient help from authorities.</p>

          <p>A shocking report from Uganda's Inspectorate of Government has found that 35% of the country's civil servants, totaling nearly 133,000 people, paid bribes to secure their jobs between 2018 and 2022. The investigation revealed that job seekers paid a collective $7.73 million in bribes, with recruiters demanding large sums for senior roles. This systemic corruption is said to undermine public service delivery, particularly in critical sectors like health and education, by promoting incompetence and diverting funds.

          <p>A powerful solar storm has made the aurora borealis visible across the United Kingdom, with sightings reported from northern Scotland down to Kent on the south coast. The phenomenon was caused by a coronal mass ejection from the sun, which sent charged particles interacting with Earth's atmosphere to create the vibrant light display. Space weather forecasters suggest the activity could continue, offering another chance for people across the UK to witness the Northern Lights, provided skies remain clear.</p>

          <p>As Britpop nostalgia surges with a massive Oasis reunion tour, the band Suede, widely credited with starting the movement, is looking forward, not back. In an interview, the band reflects on its complex legacy, having distanced itself from the jingoistic turn Britpop later took. With their tenth studio album, "Antidepressants," Suede continues to evolve creatively, embracing an "anti-nostalgia" philosophy focused on longevity and artistic restlessness rather than capitalizing on the revival of a past era.</p>

          <p>At age 37, Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw is experiencing a renaissance season, which he attributes to a fundamental shift in his training regimen. After years of back problems, Kershaw has embraced a new approach focusing on the mobility and stability of his hips, pelvis, and lower back—an area his trainers have nicknamed "the bowl." This departure from his old, heavy-lifting routine has allowed him to feel healthier and more consistent on the mound, contributing to a stellar performance in his 18th MLB season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates a significant barrier to on-time college graduation is the inability of students to enroll in required courses for their majors when they need them. Universities often fail to offer enough sections of necessary classes, leading to full courses and long waitlists, which forces students to extend their studies. This systemic scheduling problem, expected to worsen with budget cuts at institutions like the California State University system, ultimately increases the time and money students must spend to earn their degrees.</p>
