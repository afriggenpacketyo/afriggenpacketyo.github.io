          <p>Conservative activist Charlie Kirk was tragically shot and killed while addressing an outdoor event at Utah Valley University, attended by approximately 3,000 people. Eyewitnesses recounted that a single shot struck him in the neck as he engaged in a debate about gun violence, causing immediate chaos and widespread panic among the crowd. Authorities have since launched an intensive manhunt for the shooter, who is believed to have fired from a nearby rooftop, with initial suspects being questioned and later released. This shocking assassination has deeply resonated across the United States, prompting an outpouring of grief and reigniting urgent conversations about the escalating political violence in the country, leaving many to question the safety of public discourse.</p>

          <p>Global stock benchmarks, including the MSCI All Country World Index and S&P 500, have achieved fresh record highs, propelled by easing inflation pressures, resilient corporate earnings, and strong expectations for U.S. interest rate cuts. A surprisingly soft U.S. producer price index reading further bolstered investor sentiment, increasing bets on multiple Federal Reserve rate reductions in 2025, with a quarter-point cut in September seen as highly probable. Oracle's blockbuster outlook for AI-related revenue also significantly amplified confidence in the ongoing tech-led rally, driving its shares to an all-time high. However, some analysts strike a cautionary note regarding the future impact of U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

One of the two student victims is in critical condition, while the other sustained non-life-threatening injuries. Authorities responded swiftly to numerous 911 calls, making contact with the shooter within five minutes, and later secured the school after a preliminary investigation indicated the shooting occurred both inside and outside the building. The tragedy has led to school closures in the Evergreen and Conifer areas, with officials emphasizing community support and the ongoing challenges of gun violence.</p>

The Guardian notes he would have undergone the highest level of vetting, while the Daily Telegraph criticizes Sir Keir Starmer's handling of personnel issues. Separately, Britain is considering sending fighter jets to Poland to bolster defenses after Russian drones were shot down over its territory, described by The Times as a "blatant provocation."

          <p>This article posits that the transatlantic relationship between Europe and the U.S. is undergoing a deep, structural rupture that transcends Donald Trump's presidency. The author, having observed recent developments in Washington, expresses doubt that stability can be restored, suggesting a future of transactional convenience or an ominous "world of empires." European leaders' current strategy of appeasement towards Trump is deemed counterproductive, as it may signal Europe's susceptibility to colonization. The article urges Europe to accept this new reality and actively build strategic autonomy, including exploring alternative international trading systems without the U.S., to avoid being marginalized.</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA, was a profoundly influential conservative activist and a close confidant to Donald Trump, effectively serving as an envoy to a new generation of voters. His assassination at a Utah college campus plunged the White House into a funereal mood and prompted an outpouring of grief from across the political spectrum, including prominent Democrats. The article details Kirk's meteoric rise from a teenage activist to a pivotal figure in the MAGA movement, credited with mobilizing young conservatives and significantly shaping the national political discourse. His unwavering loyalty to Trump, even when it meant subordinating his own views, defined his brand of politics.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles, at Clarence House in London for their first face-to-face encounter since February 2024. This 50-minute private tea is widely interpreted as a small yet significant step towards healing the "damaging rift" within the royal family, following Harry's previous public expressions of a desire for reconciliation. The mutual silence from both Buckingham Palace and Prince Harry's team regarding the specifics of their conversation suggests a delicate but hopeful shift in their relationship dynamics. While a full family reconciliation remains uncertain, the meeting itself is seen as crucial for rebuilding connections after years of estrangement.</p>

          <p>A recent Redfin report indicates that San Francisco's housing costs, when measured by the mortgage payment-to-income ratio, have returned to July 2018 levels, signaling a stabilization in the market. This trend is attributed to slowing home-price growth and falling mortgage rates, particularly benefiting tech-driven metros where wages have grown considerably faster than the national average. However, the article clarifies that "normal" for San Francisco still means a significantly high proportion of income spent on mortgages (74% in 2018). Furthermore, the ongoing artificial intelligence boom continues to spike rents and crowd out lower-wage tenants, creating a two-tiered market.</p>

Trump cited allegations of mortgage fraud, which Cook denies, with her attorneys arguing it is a pretext to pressure the Fed to cut interest rates.

          <p>The assassination of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk is viewed by experts as a "watershed moment" in a surge of U.S. political violence, threatening to inflame an already fractured country. Researchers at the University of Maryland note a significant increase in politically-motivated attacks this year, nearly double the previous period, driven by factors like economic insecurity, demographic anxieties, and inflammatory political discourse. Experts warn of a "vicious spiral" where retaliatory violence becomes increasingly likely, emphasizing the urgent need for leaders to strongly condemn such acts and address the deep-seated animosity to prevent widespread civil unrest.</p>

          <p>Thousands of residents in rural West Virginia, particularly in Appalachian coal country, have relied on untreated water sources like abandoned coal mines for nearly 50 years due to severely failing infrastructure. Historically, coal companies maintained these water systems, but their decline left communities with crumbling treatment plants and unsafe tap water, which many consume without testing. Non-profit organizations like DigDeep are now actively working to replace these dilapidated systems and bring clean, safe water to communities like Rhodell for the first time in a decade. This initiative highlights a critical public health crisis and the fundamental need for basic human rights and infrastructure investment.</p>

          <p>Senior cancer doctors in England are warning that excessive bureaucracy is creating an unacceptable "postcode lottery" for patients seeking the latest cancer treatments. The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) states that cumbersome funding applications for advanced therapies, such as Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR), lead to unequal access, primarily favoring larger, better-funded units. This situation is deemed "inequitable and unjust" and incompatible with the National Health Service's principles. The RCR and other bodies have urged the government to cut red tape and streamline access, ahead of a new cancer strategy aimed at putting the NHS at the forefront of global cancer care.</p>

Harris, who unexpectedly became the presumptive Democratic nominee after Biden dropped out, also expresses frustration with Biden's inner circle for allegedly failing to defend her against unfair attacks and for contributing to negative narratives about her office. While defending Biden's capacity, she acknowledges his fatigue, stating her loyalty to the country supersedes personal loyalties.</p>

Beijing discreetly launched an $8.42 billion national AI fund and is actively integrating AI across various economic sectors, including power grids and the coal industry, as part of a wide-ranging "AI+" initiative. Despite lagging in advanced chips, China aims for "usable" technology and competitive generative AI models, showcasing resourcefulness and adaptation. This strategy highlights an intensifying tech rivalry, with China aiming to become a global AI innovation center by 2030, even as analysts warn of overcapacity risks. (not investment advice)</p>
