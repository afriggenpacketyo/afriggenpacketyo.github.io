        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney has announced Canada's ambitious goal to double its non-U.S. exports within the next decade, citing American tariffs and growing trade uncertainty as key motivators. He stressed that Canada can no longer solely rely on the U.S. as its primary foreign partner, necessitating a strategic shift towards global giants like India and China. This economic reorientation aims to safeguard Canadian jobs in sectors vulnerable to U.S. tariffs, such as autos and steel, and to foster national economic stability amidst a fundamentally changed global trade landscape. Carney acknowledged the challenges ahead, noting the transformation will require sacrifices and time, with the government's budget on November 4 expected to detail these crucial measures.

          <p>Four survivors of child sexual exploitation have demanded the resignation of UK Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips, accusing her of "betrayal" and undermining trust in the ongoing grooming gangs inquiry. They cite concerns that the inquiry's scope is being diluted and that proposed chairs, with backgrounds in policing or social work, lack victim confidence, mirroring past institutional failures. This public demand follows the withdrawal of two potential inquiry chairs and highlights deep divisions among survivors regarding the inquiry's direction and its focus on racial and religious motivations behind the abuse. The Prime Minister has defended Phillips and committed to an undiluted, judge-led inquiry, inviting the dissenting survivors to rejoin the panel to ensure accountability and justice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, aiming to degrade Moscow's ability to finance the war in Ukraine. This significant escalation threatens to disrupt the energy lifeline between Russia and its major Asian customers, China and India, which collectively import substantial volumes of Russian crude daily. While designed to avoid an immediate supply shock by setting a November 21 deadline, the sanctions will compel buyers to seek alternative sources, likely from the U.S. and OPEC, potentially increasing global oil prices. Experts anticipate a short-term hiatus in Russian crude flows to these markets, creating additional costs and complications for global energy trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents of Russia's Belgorod region are experiencing increasing blackouts, air-raid sirens, and drone attacks, as Ukraine retaliates against Russian bombardments. The number of Ukrainian drone attacks on Belgorod, a key logistics and staging hub for Russian forces near the border, has nearly quadrupled since early 2025, causing significant power outages affecting thousands. Ukrainian authorities assert these strikes are a direct response to Russia's ongoing assaults on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, signaling a reciprocal strategy. Local residents describe a terrifying environment, compounded by fuel shortages and rising generator prices, as the conflict increasingly impacts daily life within Russia's border regions.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Prepares Border Patrol Immigration Crackdown in San Francisco</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to expand its nationwide immigration crackdown to the San Francisco area, deploying Border Patrol agents to target "criminal illegal aliens," including murderers and gang members. This move has drawn strong condemnation from California Governor Gavin Newsom and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who accuse the administration of creating fear and anxiety in immigrant communities through "un-American tactics." Federal officials insist the operation targets dangerous individuals, but critics view it as an "appalling abuse of law enforcement power" that wastes resources. The deployment is part of an aggressive expansion of deportation efforts into Democratic-led cities far from the U.S. border, raising tensions between federal and local authorities.</p>

          <p>The Chicago Fire ended a 16-year playoff victory drought, securing a dominating 3-1 triumph over Orlando City in an Eastern Conference wild-card match. Hugo Cuypers netted a second-half brace, and Brian Gutiérrez also scored, leading the eighth-seeded Fire to their first postseason win since 2009. The Fire now advance to face the top-seeded Philadelphia Union in the first round, with Game 1 scheduled for Sunday. Despite Orlando City's struggles on offense, with Chicago outshooting them significantly, Orlando's Tyrese Spicer managed a late goal. This victory marks a significant turnaround for the Fire, who had not played a postseason match since 2017, demonstrating a strong return to form.</p>

          <p>New York's final mayoral debate was dominated by heated personal attacks between Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani, overshadowing substantive policy discussions. Cuomo accused Mamdani of lacking new ideas, while Mamdani questioned Cuomo's past failures and sexual harassment allegations, which Cuomo dismissed. The debate also touched on ICE raids, quickly devolving into arguments about candidates' relationships with Donald Trump and the safety of Jewish New Yorkers. Curtis Sliwa, the third candidate, interjected with "zingers" but did little to shift the overall perception of the race. Mamdani faced criticism for evading questions on education and zoning, reinforcing the view that the debate likely did not change voter opinions ahead of the election.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has conducted two strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Pacific Ocean, killing five people, as part of an escalating and controversial campaign against seaborne drug smuggling. These latest attacks, following seven previous strikes in the Caribbean, mark a geographical expansion of the operation. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth equated alleged drug traffickers to terror groups, justifying the lethal force and claiming these are "narco-terrorists." The article highlights the White House's reliance on a "dubious legal theory" involving "designated terrorist organizations" and Article Two powers for these actions. The CIA's central role in intelligence gathering means much evidence used to select targets remains secret, drawing condemnation from civil liberties groups.</p>

The city council approved a plan to transform the 100-acre property into a mixed-use site, featuring 3,000 housing units and 600,000 square feet of upscale retail space, along with over 9 acres for parks and recreation. Community members gathered to bid farewell to the nostalgic hub, which was once Orange County's second-highest-grossing retail center in its heyday. While anchor stores like JCPenney are closing, Best Buy and Target are expected to remain during the multi-year redevelopment, aiming to revitalize the area into a thriving activity center.</p>

          <p>South Korea's central bank, the Bank of Korea, held its benchmark interest rate at 2.5%, extending a pause since May, primarily due to concerns over household debt despite stable inflation and an improving economic growth outlook. This decision follows the introduction of tighter property rules in Seoul aimed at curbing borrowing and cooling the housing market, which remains a critical constraint. The central bank also noted increased uncertainties from ongoing trade talks with the U.S., which are expected to gradually expand the impact of U.S. tariffs on exports, affecting the nation's economic growth. Analysts anticipate a potential rate cut in November if trade progress is made and housing policy stabilizes further. (not investment advice)</p>

Amazon denies the accusations, stating it approves over 99% of pregnancy accommodation requests and does not have fixed quotas, assessing performance based on safe and achievable expectations.

          <p>Early voter turnout is exceeding expectations in California’s special election for Proposition 50, a Democratic-led effort to redraw the state’s congressional districts. Over 3.4 million mail ballots have been returned, comparable to presidential election levels, with Democrats outpacing Republicans and non-party preference voters. Governor Gavin Newsom and former President Obama, who endorsed Proposition 50, emphasize the measure's importance for democratic fairness against partisan gerrymandering. This high engagement is notable for a redistricting topic, suggesting strong interest in preventing efforts to entrench political power.
