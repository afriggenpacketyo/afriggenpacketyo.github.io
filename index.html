        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent New York Federal Reserve survey indicates that Americans' concerns about inflation diminished in May after President Trump softened some of his tariff proposals. The one-year inflation outlook dropped by 0.4 percentage points to 3.2%, while the three-year outlook fell to 3%. Despite remaining above the Fed's 2% target, these figures suggest a positive shift in sentiment, possibly influenced by Trump's revised tariff approach which included a 90-day negotiation window. The survey also revealed improved employment expectations and increased confidence in the stock market, painting a more optimistic economic picture. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities have released new photos, including tattoo details, of Travis Decker, the 32-year-old man suspected of killing his three young daughters in central Washington. Law enforcement agencies are conducting extensive searches in forested areas and rivers, urging residents to check security footage for any sightings of Decker. The victims, aged 5, 8, and 9, were found near a campground after being reported missing by their mother when Decker failed to return them after a visit. Decker, a former Army soldier with wilderness survival skills, is considered dangerous and potentially armed, prompting warnings for the public not to approach him but to call 911 immediately.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing immigration protests in Los Angeles, Tom Homan, a border official in the Trump administration, clarified that his recent remarks were taken out of context. Homan stated that while no one is above the law, his comments about potentially arresting California officials were not specifically directed at Governor Newsom or Mayor Bass. He emphasized that while peaceful protests are protected under the First Amendment, actions that impede law enforcement or damage property would not be tolerated. President Trump echoed similar sentiments, warning that California officials who obstruct law and order would face charges.</p>

Trump justified the ban by pointing to factors such as the presence of terrorists, visa security concerns, and inadequate record-keeping.

          <p>Warner Bros.

CEO David Zaslav indicated that the Global Networks division will decide whether to license TNT Sports programming to the Streaming and Studios business or other entities. This could potentially lead to TNT Sports being merged with another entity, such as Comcast's forthcoming spinout, Versant, or a licensing deal with another media company. While HBO Max will continue to license sports for existing deals, the long-term strategy for TNT Sports remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage stated he "forgave" Zia Yusuf after Yusuf criticized a party MP's call for a burka ban, leading to Yusuf's resignation as chairman. Yusuf, who initially stepped down after calling the MP's statement "dumb," later reversed his decision and will continue working for the party in a different role. Farage explained that Yusuf "lost his rag" but regretted his comments the following morning, prompting Farage to forgive him. Yusuf will now lead the party's Doge unit, inspired by US initiatives to cut wasteful spending in councils controlled by Reform.</p>

Adams framed antisemitism as a "vile disease" and referenced recent attacks to justify the order, which requires city agencies to use the IHRA definition. The move comes ahead of the Democratic primary for NYC mayor, where support for Israel is a key issue.
