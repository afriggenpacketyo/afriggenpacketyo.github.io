          <p>This article investigates the severe consequences of the Trump administration's decision to cut nearly all U.S. aid to Afghanistan, leading to the closure of over 400 medical clinics. It shares the personal stories of families who have lost mothers and newborns during childbirth because they could no longer access essential medical care in remote areas. The closures have overwhelmed the remaining hospitals, which are also facing drastic funding shortages, contributing to a significant increase in maternal and infant mortality rates in the country.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old man was arrested in Phoenix after being filmed trampling a public memorial for the recently assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The incident occurred outside the headquarters of Turning Point USA, the organization Kirk co-founded, where the suspect was seen kicking over flowers and other items left by mourners. A bystander intervened to stop the man before police, who were already on site for traffic control, took him into custody on charges including criminal damage and disorderly conduct.</p>

However, this article explains that major banks and financial institutions are becoming wary, viewing the trend as a challenge to their revenue streams and a significant blind spot in assessing consumer credit risk. This lack of visibility into BNPL debt poses a challenge for understanding the broader financial system's stability. (not investment advice)</p>

Key performances included a long touchdown run by Puka Nacua and two touchdown passes from quarterback Matthew Stafford, one of which was his first to newly acquired receiver Davante Adams. The victory is seen as a solid performance for the Rams, but the article frames it as a prelude to a much more significant challenge against the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles next week.</p>

          <p>The final stage of the Vuelta a España was abandoned after pro-Palestinian protesters breached the course in Madrid, knocking down barriers and occupying the road. The disruption led organizers to end the race early for safety reasons, declaring Jonas Vingegaard the overall winner without a podium ceremony. The protests were directed against the participation of the Israel-Premier Tech team and followed several other disruptions throughout the three-week event, reflecting broader political tensions surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>In municipal elections held in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, the center-right CDU party of Chancellor Friedrich Merz emerged as the winner. However, the results also showed a dramatic surge in support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which more than tripled its share of the vote compared to the last local elections in 2020.
