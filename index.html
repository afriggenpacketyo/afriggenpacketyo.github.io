          <p>A 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck in the Drake Passage, prompting tsunami warnings and evacuations in Chile and Argentina. Chilean authorities called for coastal evacuations in the Magallanes region, and Argentina took precautionary measures in Tierra del Fuego. Thousands were moved to higher ground, with no immediate reports of damage or injuries. Chilean President Gabriel Boric urged residents to follow authorities' instructions, as Chile is frequently impacted by earthquakes due to its location at the convergence of three tectonic plates.</p>

          <p>The remedies trial in the U.S. government's antitrust case against Google's advertising technology is scheduled to begin on September 22. A judge previously ruled that Google held illegal monopolies in online advertising markets, tying its publisher ad server and ad exchange together. This follows a prior ruling that Google monopolized internet search. Google is navigating antitrust challenges while also competing in the generative AI market. Google maintains that its proposed ad tech remedy addresses the court's liability decision, while the DOJ seeks further divestiture of Google's ad tech tools.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant surge in measles cases, reaching levels not seen since 2019, with over 900 confirmed infections across 29 states. A major outbreak in West Texas has contributed to the death of two unvaccinated children, raising concerns among health officials. The article emphasizes the safety and effectiveness of the MMR vaccine, while also noting that lower vaccination rates are contributing to the resurgence of this highly contagious disease. Health officials are urging people to get vaccinated to prevent further spread of the disease, as measles can lead to severe complications and even death, especially in unvaccinated individuals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has found a link between chemicals in common household products and increased heart disease mortality. Researchers at NYU Langone Health discovered that daily exposure to phthalates, found in plastics, cosmetics, and detergents, could have contributed to over 356,000 heart disease deaths worldwide in 2018. The study focused on DEHP, a type of phthalate used to make plastics more flexible, which has been linked to inflammation in heart arteries. The regions with the highest death tolls include the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, and the Pacific, underscoring the urgent need for global regulations to reduce exposure to these toxins.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed budget aims to slash federal rental assistance by 40%, shifting funds to states for them to design their own programs. The plan also includes a two-year cap on rental aid for able-bodied adults. Critics warn that these cuts could lead to a surge in homelessness, as nearly half of all renters are already cost-burdened. While Congress holds the authority over spending, the proposal raises concerns about the future of housing aid for millions of low-income Americans.</p>

          <p>An oil spill off the Louisiana Gulf Coast is raising alarms, with former disaster response specialists warning that recent DOGE job cuts at NOAA may hinder response efforts. The leak, originating from a capped well, is contaminating marshlands and threatening wildlife habitats. Despite cleanup efforts, concerns are growing about the reduced capacity of NOAA's Office of Response and Restoration Emergency Response Division, which has experienced significant staff reductions. Experts are also highlighting the broader issue of thousands of unplugged, abandoned wells in the Gulf, compounded by the Trump administration's push to expand offshore drilling.</p>

          <p>This article provides guidance on how to handle a lawsuit over unpaid debts, emphasizing that settling for less than the full amount owed is often possible, even after legal proceedings have started. It suggests negotiating directly with the creditor or debt collector, working with a debt settlement company, checking for legal defenses or procedural errors, and hiring a debt defense attorney. The article stresses the importance of acting quickly, getting any settlement agreement in writing, and ensuring the lawsuit is formally dismissed to protect one's financial and legal interests.</p>

          <h2>Man's Snake Venom Injections Lead to Discovery of Universal Antivenom Antibodies</h2>

          <p>Scientists have identified antibodies in the blood of Tim Friede, who has been injecting himself with snake venom for nearly two decades, that can neutralize the poison from cobras, mambas, and other deadly species. This discovery may pave the way for a universal antivenom, addressing a global health problem that affects millions. The researchers found that two antibodies from Mr. Freide's blood, when combined with a drug that blocks neurotoxins, protected mice from the venom of 19 deadly snake species. This marks a significant step forward in antivenom research, which has lagged behind demand despite the high number of snakebites worldwide.</p>

The unrest was triggered by a blasphemous audio recording and escalated due to tensions between Druze communities and the new interim Syrian government. The situation is further complicated by divisions within the Druze community, the presence of armed groups, and Israel's intervention, which is seen by some as exacerbating the conflict and destabilizing the political transition.</p>
