          <p>The jury in the federal trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs has reached a partial verdict but remains deadlocked on the most serious charge of racketeering, which carries a potential life sentence. After two days of deliberations, the jurors informed the judge they were unable to reach a unanimous decision on that specific count. The judge has urged them to continue their efforts to break the impasse, and deliberations are set to resume. This development introduces significant uncertainty into the outcome of the high-profile case against the music mogul.</p>

          <p>Facing 153 legal claims related to clergy sexual abuse, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fresno has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Church officials claim the filing is the only viable path to manage the claims equitably while continuing its ministry. However, attorneys representing the survivors have condemned the move as a strategic delay tactic designed to help the diocese avoid full accountability and justice for the victims.</p>
