          <p>China's industrial profits fell by 9.1% in May compared to the previous year, marking the most significant drop since last October. The decline is attributed to insufficient domestic demand, lower industrial product prices, and an intense price war among companies vying for market share. Despite mixed economic data, including a rise in retail sales, economists are divided on whether this downturn will prompt Beijing to introduce further stimulus measures, as overall GDP growth appears to be on track.
