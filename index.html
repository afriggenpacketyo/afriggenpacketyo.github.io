          <p>The Department of Justice has placed an attorney on indefinite paid leave following a hearing in a lawsuit concerning a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador. Sources indicate that Erez Reuveni, the acting deputy director for the Office of Immigration Litigation, was sidelined for allegedly failing to "zealously advocate" for the government's position. Attorney General Pam Bondi emphasized the requirement for DOJ attorneys to advocate strongly for the U.S., and that failure to do so would result in consequences. The government is appealing the judge's order to facilitate the return of the deported man.</p>

          <p>The United States has revoked all visas held by South Sudanese passport holders and will cease issuing new ones due to South Sudan's failure to accept repatriated citizens promptly. Secretary of State Marco Rubio cited this lack of cooperation as the reason for the action, emphasizing the importance of enforcing immigration laws for national security. The State Department stated that it is time for South Sudan's government to "stop taking advantage" of the U.S. and that the visa restrictions will be reviewed upon full cooperation from South Sudan.</p>

          <p>Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner met with Birmingham council leaders to discuss resolving the ongoing bin strike and clearing the accumulating waste backlog. Birmingham City Council declared a major incident due to industrial action by Unite union members over pay, resulting in uncollected rubbish piling up in the city. Rayner was briefed on clean-up plans and efforts to end the dispute, while Unite accused the government of blaming bin workers for a situation caused by austerity measures.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump urged Americans to "hang tough" as the US began collecting a 10% "baseline" tariff on all imports, triggering market turmoil and international backlash. The UK and France are among the countries affected, and both countries have said that nothing is off the table in terms of retaliatory measures. China announced retaliatory tariffs of 34% on US imports, escalating trade tensions. Trump described the market volatility as "an economic revolution" that the US "will win".</p>

The judge ruled that the whistleblowers were terminated in retaliation for reporting allegations that Paxton misused his office. Paxton has denied the allegations and intends to appeal the ruling. The case stems from a 2020 FBI investigation into Paxton, which ultimately led to his impeachment in 2023, though he was later acquitted in the Senate.</p>
