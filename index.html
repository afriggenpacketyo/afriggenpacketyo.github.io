          <p>Severe weather, including tornadoes and high winds, caused significant damage and fatalities in the US South and Midwest.  Western Tennessee and Missouri were particularly hard hit, with homes flattened and debris scattered over vast areas.  The National Weather Service issued "once-in-a-generation" storm warnings, and the death toll is expected to rise as search and rescue efforts continue.  President Trump approved an emergency declaration for Tennessee, enabling federal aid.</p>

          <p>President Trump voiced his support for allowing new mothers in Congress to vote by proxy, a stance contrasting with House Speaker Mike Johnson's opposition.  This move follows a proposal by Representatives Anna Paulina Luna and Brittany Pettersen to allow proxy voting for 12 weeks for new parents.  While Johnson initially opposed the plan, citing constitutional concerns, Trump's endorsement prompted a discussion, indicating potential compromise.  The issue's future remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Canada's increasingly liberal assisted dying laws have sparked debate, with some arguing the system has gone too far.  April Hubbard, a woman with spina bifida, plans to end her life under the law, despite not being terminally ill.  Critics argue that assisted dying is being used as a cheaper alternative to adequate care for disabled individuals, while supporters emphasize the importance of patient autonomy. The expanding scope of the law raises ethical questions about end-of-life care.</p>
