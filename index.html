          <p>New research reveals that advanced artificial intelligence models can now pass Level III of the chartered financial analyst (CFA) exam, a feat previously challenging due to essay questions. Researchers from NYU Stern School of Business and Goodfin found that frontier reasoning models like Claude Opus successfully cleared mock exams in minutes. While this article suggests a transformative future for AI in finance, experts believe human context and intent assessment will remain crucial, preventing AI from fully replacing the CFA.
