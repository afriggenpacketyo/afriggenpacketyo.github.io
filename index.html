          <p>Multiple sources have informed CBS News that Israel is reportedly prepared to launch an operation into Iran, prompting the U.S. to anticipate possible Iranian retaliation targeting American sites in neighboring Iraq. The U.S. State Department has advised some Americans to leave the region due to heightened tensions, and the Pentagon has authorized military family members to voluntarily depart the Middle East. Despite these rising tensions, President Trump's Middle East envoy plans to proceed with a sixth round of talks with Iran on its nuclear program in the coming days. Iran's Defense Minister has warned that if nuclear talks fail and conflict ensues, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps will target all U.S. bases in host countries. Optimism remains low due to the volatility of the situation.</p>

          <p>David Hogg has stepped down from his position as a Democratic National Committee (DNC) vice chair, citing a fundamental disagreement with the party apparatus regarding the role of the vice chair. Hogg stated his intention to focus on his PAC, Leaders We Deserve, which aims to endorse and support aligned candidates in Democratic primaries. This decision follows controversy surrounding Hogg's plan to back primary challenges against incumbent Democrats, a move that drew criticism from senior DNC leaders, including chair Ken Martin. Martin acknowledged Hogg's activism and wished him well, and the DNC will proceed with a re-do election for the vice chair position. His departure signals a rift within the party regarding strategies for internal change and external opposition.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is set to partially evacuate its embassy in Iraq, removing non-essential staff and their dependents due to heightened security risks amid rising tensions with Iran. U.S. officials have been informed that Israel is prepared to launch an operation into Iran, leading to concerns about potential Iranian retaliation against U.S. sites in Iraq. This decision coincides with stalled U.S. talks regarding Iran's nuclear program, despite ongoing efforts by U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with Iranian officials for further discussions. President Trump has reiterated the U.S.'s stance against Iran developing nuclear weapons and indicated growing uncertainty about Iran's commitment to halting uranium enrichment.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced significant spending increases for the National Health Service (NHS) in England, along with boosts for defense and housing, outlining the government's spending plans for the remainder of the decade. While additional funding is allocated for artificial intelligence and transport projects, some departments, including the Foreign Office and the environment department, will face budget cuts. Reeves emphasized that the Spending Review aims to deliver security, economic growth, and a future-proof NHS, while the Conservative shadow chancellor criticized it as a "spend now, tax later review." Despite some departments facing financial constraints, Reeves asserted that the government is not reverting to austerity measures, focusing instead on long-term investments and key public services.</p>

          <p>During a House Ways and Means Committee hearing, Representative Linda Sanchez (D-CA) accused Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent of interrupting her due to her gender, prompting audible reactions from the room. The exchange occurred during a tense questioning session about the impact of tariffs enacted under President Trump's administration. Sanchez's remark was met with disapproval, with one attendee reacting audibly, and the White House's official account calling the move "shameful." Bessent, who is openly gay, did not address the accusation and instead focused on defending the administration’s trade policies, and the incident quickly spread across social media, sparking debate over appropriate decorum in congressional hearings.</p>

The astronomers described a new star glowing brightly in the southern sky, noting its size, color, and brightness in a formal report to the emperor. This rediscovered memorial confirms that the phenomenon was a nova, a slow, temporary brightening caused by a dying star, rather than a comet or meteor.

This review raises questions about the future of the agreement, which aims to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines and counter China's growing power. Both Australia and the UK have downplayed the significance of the review, emphasizing that it is natural for a new administration to reassess agreements. The move comes amid pressure from the White House for Australia to increase its military spending, and the outcome of the review could potentially shift the focus of the security pact away from submarines.</p>

          <p>As tensions persist following mass immigration raids in Los Angeles, people continue to rally in protest of the Trump administration's detention and deportation of immigrants. While things on Wednesday quieted down in some parts of the country, demonstrations continued in cities across the country, including Seattle, Chicago and San Francisco. The protests, which have lasted five days, were sparked by immigration raids in Los Angeles late last week, and the administration's decision to send in the military. The events highlight the ongoing debate and divisions surrounding immigration policies and enforcement in the United States.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's favorability among Republicans has declined by 16 points since March, according to a recent Quinnipiac poll, following a public falling out with President Donald Trump. While a majority of Republicans still view Musk favorably, the number has decreased from 78% to 62%. Overall, only 30% of self-identified voters surveyed in the U.S. hold a favorable opinion of Musk, with a significant divide between Republican and Democratic voters. This shift in public opinion comes after Musk criticized Trump's spending bill, leading to a social media exchange between the two figures, and despite the decline, Musk remains popular among Republicans for his role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).</p>

          <p>Asif William Rahman, a former CIA analyst, has been sentenced to 37 months in prison for leaking classified documents about Israel's plans to strike Iran. Rahman pleaded guilty to willful retention and transmission of national defense information under the Espionage Act. Using his high-level security clearance, Rahman printed, photographed, and sent out top-secret documents that were later circulated on social media. Israel carried out air strikes on Iran last October, targeting military sites in several regions, in response to the barrage of missiles launched by Tehran weeks earlier, and this case underscores the serious consequences of mishandling classified information.</p>

          <p>Chris Mason analyzes the UK's Spending Review, highlighting the government's long-term approach to capital spending aimed at transforming the public realm and boosting economic potential. While day-to-day spending is limited or even cut in some areas, the government is betting on the public's patience to see the benefits of these long-term investments. This strategy contrasts with the typical political focus on short-term wins, but the current volatile political climate and public restlessness may pose challenges to this approach. The government is taking a risk by prioritizing long-term gains over immediate relief, hoping that voters will remain patient as the changes unfold.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expanding its immigration enforcement efforts, targeting undocumented farm workers in California and carrying out raids in agricultural areas. Immigration lawyers report that detainees, including families with small children, have been held in poor conditions with limited access to food and water. The raids have sparked protests in Los Angeles and other cities, drawing criticism from advocacy groups and local officials. These actions are part of a broader effort to meet detention quotas and enforce stricter immigration policies, leading to increased concerns about the treatment and rights of immigrants.</p>
