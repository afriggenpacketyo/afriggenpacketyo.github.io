          <p>A widespread manhunt is ongoing for the suspect who assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. Authorities initially detained and questioned two individuals but later released them, stating they had no connection to the fatal shooting. The investigation now involves multiple active crime scenes as law enforcement searches for a gunman who reportedly fired a single, fatal shot from a distance of 200 yards. The 31-year-old's death has been labeled a political assassination by Utah's governor, prompting a major federal and state law enforcement response to find the perpetrator.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles, for a private tea at Clarence House, their first face-to-face meeting in over a year and a half. This encounter is viewed by royal correspondents as a small but significant step toward a potential reconciliation following years of public friction. The meeting, which lasted about 50 minutes, follows a recent shift in Prince Harry's tone, where he expressed a desire for reconciliation with his family. While this meeting marks progress, a full family reconciliation, particularly with his brother Prince William, remains uncertain.</p>

          <h2>Bipartisan Condemnation Follows Assassination of Conservative Activist Charlie Kirk</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 23:32:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has drawn widespread condemnation from political leaders across the ideological spectrum, including President Trump and former Presidents Biden and Obama. While there was unified shock and denunciation of political violence, partisan tensions surfaced on the House floor during an attempt to hold a moment of silence. President Trump blamed "radical left" rhetoric for the attack, while others, like former President George W. Bush, called for civility and an end to vitriol in the public square. The reactions highlight the deep political divisions in the nation even in a moment of shared tragedy.</p>

          <p>South Korea's President Lee Jae-myung has stated that Korean companies will be very hesitant to invest in the United States following a major immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia. The raid resulted in the detention of over 300 South Korean nationals who were working to set up the new facility. President Lee expressed bewilderment at the action, noting that sending technicians to establish overseas factories is standard practice and crucial for such large-scale investments. The incident has raised concerns in Seoul about its economic and diplomatic alliance with Washington, especially amid sensitive trade talks.</p>

          <h2>Witnesses Recount Charlie Kirk Was Debating Gun Violence Moments Before He Was Fatally Shot</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eyewitnesses to the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk report a chilling irony: the conservative activist was actively engaged in a debate about gun control and mass shootings when he was assassinated. Attendees near the stage at Utah Valley University described hearing a single loud "pop" before seeing Kirk grab his neck as blood poured out, causing widespread panic. The event, part of Kirk's "Prove Me Wrong" tour, had minimal security, with no metal detectors for the crowd of over 3,000 people. The gunman remains at large after two individuals initially taken into custody were released without being linked to the crime.</p>

          <p>Three senior FBI officials have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, claiming they were illegally fired for political reasons at the direction of the White House. The complaint alleges that FBI Director Kash Patel told one of the agents his own job depended on terminating personnel involved in past investigations of President Trump. The lawsuit suggests a broader purge within the agency to punish agents for their professional duties, particularly those connected to the January 6 investigations. The fired agents, all decorated veterans, argue the terminations were unconstitutional and put national security at risk.</p>

          <p>The public assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah university is a stark manifestation of America's increasingly violent and fractured political landscape. The event follows a disturbing pattern of recent political violence, including assassination attempts on Donald Trump and attacks on other lawmakers. Kirk, a hero to young conservatives, will now be seen as a martyr, likely intensifying the already heated rhetoric from all sides. In the aftermath, leaders are grappling with how to ensure public safety and maintain civil discourse in an environment where political life itself appears to be turning into a blood sport.</p>

          <p>A new report from real estate company Redfin suggests that San Francisco's housing costs have returned to a "normal" level, aligning with their July 2018 ratio of mortgage payments to local income. This normalization is not an indication of affordability but rather a re-stabilization in tech-driven markets where wage growth has outpaced the national average while home price growth has cooled since the pandemic. The analysis highlights a return to a pre-pandemic equilibrium for homeowners in high-salary cities like San Francisco and Oakland. However, the trend does not extend to the rental market, where the AI boom continues to drive up prices.</p>

          <p>In her forthcoming book, former Vice President Kamala Harris writes that Joe Biden's decision to seek re-election was a choice that should not have been left to an "individual's ego." Harris describes the reliance on the president and first lady's personal decision as reckless, given the high stakes for the country. She reveals she felt she was in the worst position to advise him against running, as it would have appeared self-serving. The book also criticizes Biden's inner circle for failing to defend her against negative narratives and at times fueling them, offering a candid look at internal White House dynamics.</p>

          <p>With the September 11th attacks now a historical event for today's students, teachers are finding new ways to convey its significance and emotional impact. Programs like the one at New York's 9/11 Memorial and Museum connect educators with survivors, such as retired firefighters, to provide powerful firsthand accounts for their lesson plans.

          <p>China is adopting a focused and state-driven approach to artificial intelligence, contrasting with the massive private investments seen in the U.S. Instead of pursuing human-level artificial general intelligence, Beijing is concentrating on practical applications across its economy through its "AI+" initiative, backed by a national AI fund of over $8 billion. This strategy leverages China's existing talent and infrastructure to integrate AI into sectors like energy and industry, even while facing U.S. restrictions on advanced chips. The approach emphasizes resourcefulness and adaptation, aiming for widespread implementation rather than purely theoretical advancements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new legislative proposal in California would inject an additional $18 billion into the state's wildfire insurance fund, which is at risk of depletion following recent catastrophic fires. Under the deal, electric utility customers would contribute $9 billion by extending a surcharge on their monthly bills for an additional ten years. The state's three large for-profit utilities, including Southern California Edison, would match this with a $9 billion contribution from their shareholders. The last-minute bill aims to stabilize the fund that covers damages from utility-caused fires, though consumer advocates express concern about rising electricity rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Israeli missile strike in Doha, Qatar, targeting senior Hamas officials has likely killed the U.S.-brokered peace deal they were there to discuss. The attack, which has been condemned by a furious Qatari government, undermines Qatar's role as an indispensable mediator and jeopardizes the fate of the remaining hostages held by Hamas. U.S. officials were reportedly enraged by the unilateral action, which they believe may have been intended by Prime Minister Netanyahu to scuttle negotiations. The strike complicates regional stability and leaves the White House in a difficult position as it navigates its alliance with Israel.</p>

          <p>Nepal's government has collapsed after violent anti-government protests, triggered by a social media ban, led to the prime minister's resignation. This makes Nepal the third of India's neighbors to experience such turmoil recently, following Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, adding significant strain to India's regional diplomacy. Given the two nations' deep historical ties and long, open border, any instability in Nepal is a major security concern for New Delhi. India is now faced with the challenge of navigating a volatile situation and engaging with a new, undetermined leadership in a country of immense strategic importance.</p>

          <p>Six months into an all-out bin strike in Birmingham, residents are still grappling with piles of uncollected rubbish and expressing deep frustration with the ongoing dispute. While the city council is managing regular collections of general waste, recycling services remain suspended, forcing some residents to store waste inside their homes or make their own trips to the tip. The dispute between the council and the Unite union over service changes remains at a stalemate, with negotiations abandoned and workers voting to extend their strike. This prolonged disruption has damaged the city's reputation and left its residents feeling ignored.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett appeared at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library one day after joining a majority ruling that allows federal agents to conduct immigration raids based on racial profiling. During the event for her new memoir, Barrett largely avoided discussing controversial jurisprudence, instead sharing anecdotes about life on the court. However, she did touch upon the 4th Amendment, which was central to the previous day's contentious ruling, explaining that terms like "unreasonable" leave room for judicial disagreement. Her visit drew supporters who praised her for her Christian faith and her role in overturning Roe v. Wade.</p>
