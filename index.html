        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced his intention to soon secure a majority of his nominees on the Federal Reserve board, aiming to reduce interest rates. This declaration followed his controversial move to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, citing allegations related to her mortgages. Trump believes that with a board majority, housing markets will improve due to lower rates, a key economic objective for his administration. Cook's attorney has stated she will file a lawsuit to challenge her removal, arguing the president lacks the authority for such an action.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A massive dust storm, known as a haboob, recently impacted the Phoenix area, causing travel disruptions and power outages for thousands. This article explains that haboobs are dust storms specifically triggered by outflowing winds from an incoming thunderstorm over dry, dusty regions. Originating from the Arabic word "habb" meaning "to blow," these phenomena significantly reduce visibility and increase wind speeds, posing hazards, especially for drivers. The National Weather Service advises motorists to pull off the road, turn off lights, and set emergency brakes if caught in such conditions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The debate concerning federal policing in Washington D.C. is escalating to Congress, with lawmakers divided over the city's "home rule" and the role of federal forces. President Trump utilized a 1973 Home Rule Act provision to deploy National Guard troops, citing an emergency, and Republicans are now proposing legislation to extend presidential control over D.C. police operations and alter bail laws. Democrats are expected to counter these efforts, seeking to restore local control, while balancing concerns about public safety and potential political implications. The legislative fight is anticipated to command significant attention when Congress reconvenes.</p>

Despite criticism from social media users, including prominent political figures, and a dip in stock prices, the company emphasized its commitment to heritage while also evolving.

          <p>Pop superstar Taylor Swift's engagement announcement to Travis Kelce caused a brief but notable surge in shares for Signet Jewelers, a publicly traded jewelry retailer. The news, featuring a "cushion cut" engagement ring, led to a 2% increase in Signet's stock, as fans potentially sought similar designs. This event further highlights Swift's significant economic influence, following previous instances where her "Eras" tour generated consumer spending bumps acknowledged by Wall Street and the Federal Reserve. Her actions continue to capture attention in both the entertainment and financial sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Frontier Airlines is strategically expanding its network with 20 new routes, many in key Spirit Airlines markets, as Spirit faces severe financial difficulties and potential insolvency. Frontier's CEO, Barry Biffle, expressed confidence in capturing most of Spirit's market share if the rival airline were to collapse, although he declined to comment on potential mergers. Both budget carriers have contended with shifting consumer preferences, excess domestic capacity, and rising operational costs. Spirit's situation has become particularly dire, leading to cost-cutting measures like pilot furloughs and route reductions, making it vulnerable to Frontier's aggressive expansion.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced plans to seek the death penalty for murder cases in Washington D.C., describing it as a "preventative" measure. This proposal comes amidst his administration's deployment of National Guard troops to the capital to address crime, a strategy he has hinted at expanding to other cities. While most D.C. murders are prosecuted under local law, which repealed the death penalty decades ago, federal laws could theoretically allow for capital punishment if juries agree.

          <p>Ukrainian forces have acknowledged that Russia's military has crossed into the eastern industrial region of Dnipropetrovsk, aiming to establish a foothold, though Ukraine states their advance has been halted. This marks the first large-scale attack in the region, which is Ukraine's second-biggest heavy industry center. The incursion comes as US-led diplomatic efforts to end the war appear to be faltering, despite recent meetings between President Trump and Vladimir Putin. While Russia has not officially claimed Dnipropetrovsk, any significant advance would be a blow to Ukrainian morale and strategic defense.</p>

          <p>President Trump is actively working to diminish the autonomy of the U.S. Federal Reserve, a move unprecedented in recent generations, by relentlessly criticizing its leaders and policies. His efforts include publicly lambasting Chairman Jerome Powell and attempting to fire Governor Lisa Cook over unconfirmed allegations, which Cook is challenging legally. Trump aims to reshape the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee through appointments and removals, thereby gaining control over interest rate decisions. This article analyzes his strategy to exert political influence over an institution traditionally insulated from such interference, raising concerns about the long-term independence of the central bank.</p>

          <p>A whistleblower, Charles Borges, the chief data officer at the Social Security Administration, alleges that former Trump appointees copied over 300 million Americans' Social Security numbers and personal data to a private, inadequately secured server. This action, described by career cybersecurity officials as "very high risk," could potentially expose sensitive information to identity theft. The copied data, part of the NUMIDENT database, was reportedly moved after a Supreme Court ruling granted temporary access to Trump-affiliated officials. Despite the SSA's statement that the data remains secure, the complaint raises serious concerns about privacy protections and potential gross mismanagement.</p>

          <p>Israel's military claims a strike on Nasser Hospital in Gaza, which killed five journalists and at least 15 others, targeted a camera allegedly used by Hamas for surveillance. This explanation contrasts with Prime Minister Netanyahu's earlier statement regretting a "tragic mishap" without mentioning a specific Hamas target. The incident, described by witnesses as a "double-tap" strike, has drawn outrage from press associations, which noted the lack of warning. The IDF stated six of those killed were terrorists, without providing immediate evidence.

          <p>With national credit card debt exceeding $1.21 trillion, this article offers strategies for consolidating credit card debt without negatively impacting one's credit score. It suggests options such as enrolling in a debt management program through a credit counseling agency, which can simplify payments and potentially lower interest rates. Another method is using a personal loan for consolidation, which can improve credit mix and utilization once credit cards are paid off. Balance transfers to low-rate or 0% APR cards and leveraging home equity are also discussed as viable paths. The article emphasizes addressing underlying spending habits for lasting financial health.
