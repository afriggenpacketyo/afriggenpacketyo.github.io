          <p>Lee Roy Jordan, a formidable linebacker who was a cornerstone of the Dallas Cowboys' famed "Doomsday" defense, has passed away at the age of 84. Jordan was instrumental in leading the team to its first Super Bowl victory during the 1971 season. A first-round draft pick in 1963 after a celebrated career at the University of Alabama, he remained a Cowboy for his entire 14-year NFL tenure, earning five Pro Bowl selections. His legacy was cemented when he became the first player inducted into the team's Ring of Honor by owner Jerry Jones, and he remains second on the franchise's all-time tackles list.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order, the "Protecting Chicago Initiative," aimed at safeguarding residents' rights amid reports of a potential deployment of federal agents to the city. The order directs all city government departments to protect residents from federal actions and clarifies that Chicago police will not collaborate with federal agents. Johnson stated he has received "highly credible reports" of an imminent arrival of a militarized federal presence, prompting this preemptive measure. The move has drawn criticism from the White House, which characterized it as a publicity stunt distracting from the city's crime issues, creating a tense standoff between local and federal authorities.</p>

          <p>A fitness method with military origins is gaining widespread popularity on social media, where influencers are promoting the use of weighted vests during walks and workouts to enhance results. The practice, known as rucking when done with a backpack, has been used for decades by soldiers and athletes to build endurance and strength. Experts note that while the trend can increase calorie burn and cardiovascular demand, it is not a replacement for traditional strength training and should be approached with caution. They advise starting with a light weight, focusing on proper posture, and consulting a medical professional, especially for individuals with pre-existing joint or back conditions.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has delivered a significant blow to President Trump's trade agenda, ruling that his broad "reciprocal tariffs" imposed on numerous countries are illegal. The court determined that the president overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to implement the levies, stating that such power rests exclusively with Congress. This decision jeopardizes tariffs affecting a large portion of U.S. imports, including those previously placed on China, Canada, and Mexico. However, sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum, imposed under a different authority, remain unaffected by the ruling, which the administration plans to appeal to the Supreme Court.

          <p>A new investigation by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has implicated famed Sheriff Buford Pusser in the 1967 murder of his wife, Pauline, a case that inspired the movie "Walking Tall." For decades, it was believed she was killed in an ambush targeting her husband. However, modern forensic analysis, including an exhumation and new autopsy, revealed inconsistencies with Pusser's account, suggesting the crime scene was staged and a gunshot wound he sustained was likely self-inflicted. Officials now believe Pauline was shot outside their vehicle before being placed inside, contradicting the long-held narrative and bringing a grim new perspective to a legendary story.</p>

          <p>Amid evolving technology, there remains no universal standard for how much screen time is safe for children, but experts agree on precautionary principles tied to developmental stages. For infants, a "screen-free until three" approach is recommended to encourage exploration of the physical world and development of self-controlled attention. As children grow, limited and supervised screen time is advised to ensure they develop crucial social skills, imagination, and a moral compass without digital interference. While acknowledging the role of digital interaction in modern life, psychologists and pediatricians stress that real-world engagement is irreplaceable for healthy cognitive and social growth, urging parents to prioritize content and co-viewing over strict time limits.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor Rebecca Patterson has issued a warning that President Trump's efforts to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook could undermine the central bank's independence and lead to negative long-term economic consequences. Patterson, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, argues that politicizing the Fed could erode its credibility, potentially leading to weaker stock market performance, higher inflation, and a depreciated currency. While markets might initially react positively to politically motivated interest rate cuts, she cautions that sustained inflation would eventually harm consumption and corporate earnings. This move is seen as a potential first step toward filling the Fed with loyalists. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Since joining Everton on a season-long loan from Manchester City, Jack Grealish has experienced a significant career resurgence, becoming a key player for his new club. After being sidelined for much of last season, Grealish has delivered back-to-back man-of-the-match performances, including providing multiple assists in consecutive games. His revitalized form is putting pressure on England manager Thomas Tuchel, who recently left the midfielder out of the national squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers. With his creative prowess on full display, Grealish is making a strong case for his inclusion in England's World Cup plans next summer.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is moving forward with plans to cut over 500 government positions at Voice of America (VOA) and its parent agency, the U.S. Agency for Global Media.

This move escalates a legal battle over the fate of the agency, which provides news to millions in countries with restricted press freedom. Critics and a group of employees who sued the administration argue that dismantling the VOA cedes influence to authoritarian regimes and undermines its mission to broadcast objective news globally.</p>

          <p>Many Afghans who fled the Taliban takeover and were promised entry into Germany are now living in fear of deportation from Pakistan, where they have been waiting for visas. Despite Germany ending a freeze on admissions, the process has been slow, leaving thousands in limbo. These individuals, including those who worked for international organizations, face persecution or death if sent back to Afghanistan. With a Pakistani deadline for formalizing their status expiring, the threat of forced return is imminent, placing immense strain on families who have already lost years of their lives while seeking safety and a future for their children.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 12:50:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have developed an AI-enhanced stethoscope that can detect three serious heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—almost instantly. The device analyzes subtle sounds in heartbeat and blood flow that are undetectable to the human ear and uses an AI algorithm trained on data from thousands of patients to identify issues. A large-scale study in London GP surgeries found that patients examined with the AI stethoscope were significantly more likely to receive an early diagnosis. Experts are calling the tool a potential "game-changer" that could lead to faster treatment and better patient outcomes, with plans for a wider rollout across the UK.</p>

          <p>The new remake of the 1984 cult classic "The Toxic Avenger" offers a well-made and entertaining, if somewhat sanitized, tribute to the Troma original. Directed by Macon Blair and starring Peter Dinklage, the film recasts the story with a more sincere emotional core and a sharper environmental message, pitting its mutant hero against a villainous pharmaceutical corporation. While the movie retains the gratuitous gore and goofy humor of its predecessor, its polished production and appealing cast, including Kevin Bacon and Elijah Wood, create a disconnect from the gleefully cheap and offensive style that defined the original. The result is a diverting piece of schlock that is accessible to a broader audience.</p>

Union leaders express concern that federal policies are creating an environment of fear and instability for workers, particularly in the public sector and healthcare industries.

The ideology, which gained traction in the U.S., has spread worldwide through social media algorithms that reward provocative content, with influencers like Andrew Tate popularizing its tenets.

Wineries like Robert Craig lost their entire crop from one vineyard to the blaze, compounding financial devastation from previous fires in 2020 and 2018. Even vineyards untouched by flames face the threat of "smoke taint," which can ruin grapes and make them unusable.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the eligibility and rules surrounding Social Security survivor benefits for individuals whose spouse has passed away. Generally, a surviving spouse can claim these benefits if they are 60 or older (50 if disabled), or at any age if caring for the deceased's child under 16. It is not possible to collect both your own full retirement benefit and a full survivor benefit simultaneously; the Social Security Administration will pay the higher of the two amounts. A common strategy is to claim one benefit first while allowing the other to grow, potentially switching to the larger benefit later to maximize lifetime payments. (not investment advice)</p>
