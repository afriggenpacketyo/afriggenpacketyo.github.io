            <p>President Xi Jinping met with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to discuss bilateral cooperation and regional issues, signaling China's increased engagement with its Asian neighbors. The meeting underscored China's efforts to strengthen relationships in Southeast Asia amid escalating trade friction with the United States. Agreements were expected to be signed to boost Malaysian exports like palm oil and durian, attract Chinese tourists and students, and facilitate technology sharing in renewable energy. Some analysts believe China expects Malaysia to support it as the region’s leading power, which could strain relations with the U.S.</p>

            <p>Patrick Warburton, known for his roles in "Seinfeld" and "Family Guy," revealed that his devoutly Catholic parents were not fans of his work. They viewed "Family Guy" as blasphemous and disapproved of his role in "Seinfeld" due to its handling of sexuality. Warburton's mother even belonged to the American Television Council and attempted to have "Family Guy" canceled, despite her son earning money from the show. The actor acknowledged the conflict between his faith and some of his comedic roles, but stated that he believes God has a sense of humor.</p>

            <p>Families are claiming that federal civil rights investigations into schools have stalled due to significant staff cuts within the U.S. Education Department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR). A lawsuit has been filed aiming to force the government to act on complaints, particularly those related to disability discrimination. The OCR has lost a substantial portion of its staff, leading to delays in investigations and undermining civil rights protections for students with disabilities. Parents feel they have nowhere else to turn as restraint and seclusion practices remain common, especially for students with disabilities.</p>

            <p>A Montana woman's struggle with schizoaffective disorder has led to a cycle of homelessness and inadequate care, highlighting gaps in the state's mental health system. Budget cuts in 2017 led to the loss of case management services, exacerbating her condition and leading to repeated institutionalization without long-term stability. While Montana is investing $300 million to improve behavioral health care, the lack of access to housing remains a significant barrier to recovery. The story underscores the need for comprehensive support, including housing, to break the crisis cycle for individuals with severe mental illness.</p>

            <p>Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti acknowledges the difficulty of overcoming a 3-0 first-leg deficit against Arsenal in the Champions League quarter-final. Despite the odds, the team remains determined to attempt a 'Remontada' (comeback). The team has only managed once before in Europe's top-tier tournament to come back from a 3-0 first-leg deficit. Jude Bellingham emphasized the team's determination and the unique environment at Real Madrid, where comebacks are expected.</p>

            <p>The U.S. military will control a strip of federal land along the border with Mexico, potentially allowing troops to detain migrants. The Trump administration's move aims to circumvent a federal law prohibiting military involvement in domestic law enforcement. This transfer of land is being reviewed by the Pentagon, but the intention is for troops to detain migrants found on the land and hand them over to civilian law enforcement agencies. This action has raised concerns about potential legal challenges.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Treasury market experienced an unusual sell-off, with yields rising sharply amid market turmoil caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. The sell-off raises questions about who was selling the safe-haven asset during a time of uncertainty. Potential sellers include China, which may be weaponizing its Treasury holdings, and Japanese life insurers, who may be reducing exposure due to concerns about U.S. policy. The sell-off could have significant implications for the global economy and financial markets (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>Harvard University is standing firm against demands from the Trump administration, even after the government froze $2.2 billion in federal funds. President Alan Garber emphasized that no government should dictate what private universities can teach. The dispute stems from concerns about antisemitism on campuses and the administration's demands for changes in governance, hiring, and teaching practices. Harvard's decision sets up a potential battle between the federal government and higher education, with billions of dollars and academic freedom at stake.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's escalating use of tariffs has plunged the U.S. into a series of trade wars, creating uncertainty for businesses and consumers. The timeline of events includes new tariffs on imports from China, Mexico, and Canada, as well as retaliatory measures from these countries. The situation has led to concerns about higher prices and potential economic consequences for businesses and economies worldwide. The EU has paused its retaliatory measures, but is ready to re-implement if necessary.</p>

            <p>Joe Biden, in his first speech since leaving the White House, criticized the Trump administration's welfare policies, describing social security as a "sacred promise". He condemned the administration's cuts to the Social Security Agency, which provides benefits to millions of Americans. Biden's remarks came as Trump signed an order preventing illegal immigrants from obtaining social security payments. Obama has criticized the Trump administration on social media, saying that its decision to freeze more than $2bn (£1.5bn) in federal funds for Harvard University was "unlawful and ham-handed".</p>

            <p>A study suggests that the use of disposable e-cigarettes or vapes is falling in the UK ahead of a ban on their sale, scheduled for June 1, 2025. The percentage of young adults using disposable vapes has decreased significantly, but researchers believe users are switching to refillable and rechargeable vapes rather than quitting altogether. The government's ban aims to reduce littering and address rising rates of youth vaping, but the study warns that the ban may have a limited impact on overall vaping rates.</p>
