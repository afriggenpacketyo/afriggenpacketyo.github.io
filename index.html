            <p>A recent poll by the NASUWT teaching union reveals that social media influencers are contributing to increased misogyny and sexism in schools across the UK. Teachers cite influencer Andrew Tate as a prominent example, with students echoing his views on women. The Department for Education acknowledges the damaging impact of dangerous influencers and is supporting teachers in addressing the issue. The union is set to discuss motions to safeguard children from far-right and populist movements using social media for recruitment.</p>

            <p>The ACLU is seeking an emergency order from the Supreme Court to temporarily block the removal of Venezuelan detainees accused of being foreign gang members under a wartime law. The organization argues that the detainees are being transferred to Texas and face imminent deportation without due process. The Trump administration has been flying hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants deemed members of Tren de Aragua to El Salvador, where they are being held in a mega-prison.

            <p>The Trump administration has released the first tranche of records on Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 assassination, comprising roughly 10,000 pages of previously classified documents. The disclosure, ordered by President Trump and supported by RFK's son, could reignite speculation about the killing. The released documents include handwritten notes by Sirhan Sirhan, witness interviews, crime scene photos, and FBI memos. An additional 50,000 pages of related files have been discovered and will be released later.</p>

            <p>Artists are protesting the recent trend of using AI to generate doll-like images of people, arguing that it devalues creativity and threatens their livelihoods. The #StarterPackNoAI movement has emerged as a counter-trend, with artists sharing their own handmade creations. They emphasize the importance of human effort and personality in art, contrasting it with the often-homogenous and derivative nature of AI-generated images. Some artists report losing contracts to AI design work.</p>
