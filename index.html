          <p>Asia-Pacific markets saw a general increase after U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order, reducing Japanese auto import tariffs to 15% and confirming $550 billion in Japanese investments in U.S. projects. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices rose, as did South Korea's Kospi. Several Asian chip stocks also climbed after Trump's comments about potential tariffs on semiconductor imports from firms not moving production to the U.S. This positive market reaction was also influenced by hopes for a favorable August jobs report in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Israel's military has confirmed control over 40% of Gaza City, with intentions to seize the entire area as part of its ongoing offensive, "Operation Gideon’s Chariots." Brigadier General Effie Defrin stated forces have secured significant neighborhoods and aim to dismantle Hamas's rule and retrieve hostages. This development follows warnings of potential military rule and calls for Palestinians to evacuate to the south. Gaza health officials reported at least 53 Palestinian deaths, mostly in Gaza City, amidst heavy bombardments.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the U.S. is prepared to "blow up" foreign crime groups, potentially with international cooperation. During a visit to Ecuador, he confirmed the U.S. will designate two major Ecuadorian gangs, Los Lobos and Los Choneros, as foreign terrorist organizations. This move follows a U.S. strike in the Caribbean against alleged drug traffickers and comes amidst rising violence in Ecuador, a key transit point for cocaine. The designation allows the U.S. to target assets and share intelligence without limitations, aiding Ecuador's "war" on criminal organizations.</p>

The Pentagon described this as a "highly provocative move" intended to interfere with U.S. counter-narcotics and counter-terror operations. The U.S. warships were deployed to the region as President Trump intensifies efforts against drug cartels and tensions escalate with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The Trump administration accuses Maduro of allying with cartels, while Maduro has called the U.S. deployment a "criminal and bloody threat."</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom stated that President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles for immigration raids cost taxpayers nearly $120 million. The deployment, which involved over 4,200 soldiers and marines, was recently ruled illegal by a judge, violating the Posse Comitatus Act. Newsom, who had filed a lawsuit against the deployment, condemned it as "waste, fraud and abuse" and "political theater." He highlighted the financial burden and negative impact on military readiness and soldiers' living conditions.</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed sanctions on three Palestinian human rights organizations—the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and Al-Haq—for requesting the International Criminal Court (ICC) investigate Israel for alleged genocide in Gaza. These groups had asked the ICC to examine Israeli airstrikes, the siege, and population displacement. The U.S. administration, which does not recognize the ICC's authority, has previously sanctioned ICC officials. This action follows a resolution by genocide scholars stating criteria for genocide in Gaza have been met, a claim Israel denies.</p>

This surge, fueled by voter dissatisfaction with slow growth, the NHS, and immigration, positions Nigel Farage as a potential next UK prime minister.

          <p>David Bowie's previously unknown final project, an "18th Century musical" titled The Spectator, has been discovered among his notes. The musical, whose existence was unknown even to close collaborators, explores 18th-century London art, satire, criminal gangs, and figures like "Honest" Jack Sheppard. Bowie's notes, now donated to the V&A Museum, reveal his deep fascination with the period's vibrant and diverse culture. This project would have fulfilled Bowie's lifelong ambition to write for theater, offering a unique glimpse into his creative process and intellectual interests during his final months.</p>

          <p>Michael Schena, a 42-year-old U.S. State Department employee, has been sentenced to four years in prison for conspiring to collect and transmit national defense secrets. Schena sold "sensitive" government documents to individuals he believed were working for the Chinese government, receiving at least $10,000. Despite not definitively proving the documents reached Chinese agents, the case relied on Schena's admission of his belief. Justice Department officials emphasized that Schena "threw away his career, betrayed his country and abused the trust" placed in him by exploiting his top-secret security clearance.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa defender Ezri Konsa stated that financial restrictions "killed" the club's activity in the summer transfer window. Villa, fined by UEFA for breaching financial rules, had to achieve a positive transfer balance to register new players for the Europa League and adhere to Premier League profit and sustainability rules. This led to minimal permanent signings, the sale of Jacob Ramsey for £40 million, and reliance on loan deals. Konsa expressed frustration but maintained belief in the squad and manager to overcome these challenges, despite a slow start to the season.</p>

The Trinity Biotech machines produced inaccurate haemoglobin A1C test results, leading to some patients being wrongly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and prescribed unnecessary medication. NHS England confirmed 16 hospital trusts use the affected machines, and type 2 diabetes diagnoses rose unexpectedly in 2024. Patients like Vicky Davies experienced adverse effects from incorrect medication. NHS trusts are recalling affected patients, with the manufacturer working with regulators to address the issue.</p>
