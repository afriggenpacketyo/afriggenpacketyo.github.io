          <p>China has rejected Japan's assertion that a Chinese coast guard helicopter intruded into Japanese airspace near the Senkaku Islands, which China refers to as Diaoyu. The Chinese Foreign Ministry summoned a Japanese diplomat to protest the alleged intrusion of a Japanese civilian aircraft into the area. China urged Japan to cease illegal activities and prevent similar incidents. Japan's Defense Ministry reported that the helicopter flew above the territorial waters for approximately 15 minutes, prompting the scrambling of Japanese Air Self-Defense Force jet fighters, marking the fourth such intrusion by Beijing. The incident underscores ongoing tensions over the disputed islands.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Hunan University in China collaborated with students to recreate an ancient rice dish based on a 2,000-year-old bamboo manuscript called "Shi Fang." The manuscript contains recipes from the Han Dynasty era, including steamed fish and chicken soup. Using wooden steamers and clay pots, the students prepared a non-glutinous rice dish that turned out to be "loose yet elastic" in texture. The ancient rice had a pleasing texture and a lower sugar content than modern rice, leading researchers to describe it as a "comfort food." The project deepened the students' appreciation for traditional Chinese culture and ancient culinary practices.</p>

          <p>Dani Bowman and James B. Jones, stars of Netflix's "Love on the Spectrum," have voiced their disapproval of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial statements about autism. Kennedy had suggested that autism "destroys families" and imposes significant limitations on individuals. Bowman, founder of DaniMation, and Jones, a technical support professional, both challenged Kennedy's remarks, emphasizing that autistic individuals are capable and can lead independent, fulfilling lives with support. They advocate for understanding and opportunity rather than pity or stereotypes, and some went as far as to call for Kennedy's resignation from his position.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell faces a challenging situation as he considers whether to hold interest rates steady amid concerns about inflation and mounting pressure from President Trump to cut rates. Recent government data showing a healthy increase in April payrolls could support the Fed's decision to maintain current rates. However, uncertainty remains due to potential impacts from higher U.S. duties on imports. Economists anticipate Powell will prioritize price stability, given concerns that inflation expectations may be loosening, especially with solid job growth.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy faces instability due to President Trump's unpredictable policies, creating uncertainty for businesses and consumers.

Ambiguity surrounding tariff rates and federal budget cuts, particularly those affecting science and immigration, contribute to economic ambiguity. This uncertainty, described as fear, impacts business decisions and consumer spending, potentially leading to shortages and soaring prices.

The fragmentation of British politics is evident in the rise of smaller parties like the Liberal Democrats and Greens, leaving both Labour and the Conservatives struggling to maintain their grip on power.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Times conducted soil testing in Altadena and Pacific Palisades to assess contamination levels after wildfires. Reporters collected 40 soil samples from residential properties, following rigorous protocols to prevent cross-contamination. The samples were tested for 17 metals using EPA-approved methods at a state-certified laboratory. The methodology mirrored practices from previous post-wildfire efforts, but differed by collecting only one composite sample per property, which may have missed smaller contamination hotspots. The results revealed elevated levels of contaminants, highlighting potential risks to residents.</p>

          <p>Following wildfires in Los Angeles, concerns are rising about toxic soil contamination in affected areas, with the government not conducting soil testing on cleared properties. A Los Angeles Times investigation revealed potentially dangerous levels of contamination, indicating that the government's debris-removal process may not be sufficient to ensure safety. The investigation highlights the need for thorough soil testing to protect residents from potential health hazards associated with the toxic materials released by the fires. The tests found elevated levels of arsenic, lead and mercury.</p>

          <p>President Trump's policies have had an unexpected influence on Australia's election, bolstering Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's re-election. While Albanese avoided direct criticism of Trump, the global turmoil set off by Trump's policies contributed to an anti-Trump sentiment among voters. The opposition leader's alignment with some of Trump's ideas also hurt his campaign. Voters were concerned about the rising cost of living and the impact of Trump's tariffs on their retirement accounts, leading to a resounding victory for Albanese and his Labor Party.</p>
