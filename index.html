          <p>Bill Gates has warned that 2025 could see the first increase in global child deaths in decades, potentially reversing 25 years of progress that cut annual deaths from over 10 million to under 5 million. To combat this, he announced a $912 million pledge to fight infectious diseases, stressing the need for sustained U.S. foreign health aid, which constitutes about 1% of the federal budget. Gates argued that continued investment is crucial for leveraging innovations like AI-driven tools and preventing future pandemics, emphasizing both the moral and strategic benefits of maintaining this modest funding level.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American households are expected to face a 7.6% average increase in their home heating bills this winter, with costs reaching an estimated $976. The National Energy Assistance Directors Association attributes this rise to soaring electricity and natural gas prices, driven by grid maintenance costs and increased demand. This follows a summer with the highest air-conditioning bills in over a decade, compounding financial strain as energy-related debt among consumers has grown to $23 billion. The article also provides suggestions for lowering utility bills, such as home insulation and accessing federal assistance programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Chair Powell Cites Slowing Labor Market as Reason for Interest Rate Cut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 12:35:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell explained that last week's interest rate cut was prompted by a weakening labor market, which now outweighs concerns about persistent inflation. He described the current economic landscape as a "challenging situation," with upside risks to inflation and downside risks to employment, conditions consistent with mild stagflation. Powell stated the Fed's current policy stance is "modestly restrictive" but well-positioned to respond to future developments, including potential further cuts if needed. The decision comes amid slowing payroll growth and continued uncertainty from tariffs, highlighting the delicate balance the central bank must maintain. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a period of strengthening, the growth rate for single-family home rents in the U.S. began to slow in July, potentially indicating that landlords are adjusting to consumer financial pressures. According to data from Cotality, rent prices increased by 2.3% year-over-year, a rate below the pre-pandemic average and a significant deceleration from the pandemic-era boom. While markets like Chicago still show strong growth, others, such as Miami, have cooled dramatically from their 2022 peaks. This trend is observed across all price tiers and could influence the strategies of single-family rental REITs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Scientists Express Alarm Over Trump Administration's Claims Linking Tylenol and Vaccines to Autism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 12:32:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists and autism experts are expressing significant concern after President Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made unsubstantiated claims linking Tylenol use during pregnancy and childhood vaccines to autism. Researchers, including one whose work was cited by the White House, stated that the administration distorted their findings, which called for judicious use of Tylenol but did not establish a causal link to autism. Experts worry these remarks will undermine public trust in safe medical practices, noting that fevers—often treated with Tylenol—pose a greater risk to fetal development and that the vaccine-autism link has been thoroughly debunked.</p>

          <p>Amazon has announced plans to close its 19 till-free "Fresh" grocery stores across the United Kingdom, less than five years after their launch.

Five of the shuttered locations are slated to be converted into Whole Foods stores, which Amazon also owns.

          <p>President Trump has increased the likelihood of a government shutdown by abruptly canceling a scheduled meeting with Democratic congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries. Trump claimed the meeting would not be productive, calling the Democrats' funding demands "unserious and ridiculous" in a social media post. Democratic leaders responded by accusing the president of throwing a "tantrum" and running away from negotiations, stating that Trump will "own the shutdown." With both chambers of Congress in recess and previous funding proposals failing, the move escalates the political battle over who is to blame if government funding lapses on October 1.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has endorsed Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race, providing a significant boost to the progressive candidate. Her support is notable as other high-profile New York Democrats, including Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, have remained silent, highlighting a rift within the party. Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist, has drawn criticism from some moderates for his stances on Israel and his economic policies. Despite this, polls show him with a commanding lead over opponents, and he has also received endorsements from Governor Kathy Hochul and Senator Bernie Sanders.</p>

          <p>Broadcaster Alex Faust has been named the new play-by-play voice for TNT's Major League Baseball postseason coverage, replacing the legendary Bob Costas who recently retired.

The 36-year-old Faust currently calls MLB games for Apple TV+ and has worked on other sports for TNT. Costas, 73, concluded a 44-year career that earned him 29 Emmy Awards and saw him host 12 Olympic Games.</p>

          <p>Palestinian and Jordanian authorities have reported that Israel will indefinitely close the Allenby Bridge crossing, the only land border for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank that does not go through Israel. The closure to both passenger and cargo traffic was announced without immediate comment from Israeli officials, who were observing a public holiday. The crossing had been intermittently closed since last week, after a truck driver killed two Israeli military personnel there. This move further isolates the West Bank and comes as Israeli forces continue a major offensive in Gaza City.</p>

          <p>A satirical article in The Atlantic addresses a report that former border czar Tom Homan was recorded accepting $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents in a sting operation, a case the Trump administration later dropped. The author humorously suggests that if Trump officials are so responsive to money, perhaps taxpayers should start a program of "taxpayer-funded bribes" to encourage them to act in the national interest. The piece uses the incident to critique the perceived transactional nature of the administration, sarcastically lamenting that the alleged $50,000 bribe is "chicken feed" compared to what the private sector can offer.</p>

          <p>In a speech at his party's conference, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey positioned his party as the primary opposition to Nigel Farage's Reform UK, which he accused of wanting to turn Britain into "Trump's America." Davey painted a stark picture of a UK under Farage, with weakened public services, environmental damage, and an erosion of rights, urging his party to champion British values of tolerance and decency. He framed the next election as a "battle of ideas" and appealed to disillusioned Conservative voters to join the Lib Dems. The speech focused heavily on attacking Farage, whom he mentioned 31 times.</p>

          <p>In her new memoir, "107 Days," Kamala Harris provides a candid look at her 2024 presidential campaign, revealing a deeply fractured relationship with Joe Biden and his team. She describes being sidelined and given "impossible" jobs, and recounts her frustration with Biden's perceived self-centeredness and his team's denial about his fitness to run, a decision she calls "recklessness." Harris also admits to her own campaign errors, such as her infamous "not a thing comes to mind" comment on The View, which she calls a "hand grenade." The book offers insights into her strategic thinking, including why she didn't choose Pete Buttigieg as her running mate.</p>

          <p>NASA has announced it is targeting a February launch for its Artemis II mission, which will send four astronauts on a ten-day journey around the Moon. This will be the first crewed lunar mission since the Apollo 17 flight in 1972 and serves as a critical test of the Orion spacecraft and Space Launch System (SLS) rocket. The crew will not land but will travel further into space than any previous mission, gathering data on the spacecraft's systems and the effects of deep space on the human body. The success of Artemis II is a crucial step toward the program's ultimate goal of landing astronauts on the lunar surface.</p>

          <p>A young moose nicknamed Emil, who became a social media sensation after roaming across central Europe from Poland or the Czech Republic, has been safely captured in Austria. Authorities decided to intervene when the animal approached a busy motorway during rush hour. After being tranquilized, Emil was fitted with a GPS tag and released near the Czech Sumava national park, an area with an established moose population. While his journey has ended, animal welfare groups have used his case to call for better wildlife corridors and protection laws in the region.</p>

          <p>It has been almost three decades since a German footballer, Matthias Sammer in 1996, won the Ballon d'Or, the sport's top individual award. An article from DW explores potential reasons for this drought, despite Germany's national team and club successes, including a 2014 World Cup win. One theory is a lack of elite, flashy attacking players, as the award has overwhelmingly favored forwards. The nearly two-decade dominance of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo also presented a major hurdle for all other contenders. However, with a new era emerging, young German talents like Jamal Musiala could have a chance to end the long wait.</p>

          <p>A DW Fact Check article provides a guide on how to recover deleted or altered online content, challenging the notion that what disappears from the internet is gone forever. It highlights the importance of digital archiving for accountability, explaining that tools like the Wayback Machine, Archive.today, and Perma.cc create 'snapshots' of web pages that can be accessed later. These archives are crucial for fact-checkers, historians, and researchers, and have been used as evidence in court cases. The article notes the challenges, as not all content is archived, but emphasizes that these tools are vital for preserving a shared digital reality.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications is causing significant confusion and uncertainty for immigrant workers and their employers. While the White House clarified the one-time fee applies only to new applicants, immigration lawyers express concern over gray areas, such as whether current visa holders who travel abroad while an extension is pending could be affected. Attorneys are advising H-1B employees not to travel internationally until further guidance is issued. The steep fee is expected to have a "chilling effect" on the program, which is heavily used by the tech and healthcare industries to hire skilled foreign workers.</p>
