          <p>Authorities in Michigan are pursuing terrorism and multiple assault with intent to murder charges against a 42-year-old man who allegedly stabbed eleven people at a Walmart in Traverse City. The suspect used a folding knife in what appears to be a random attack near the store's checkout area before being confronted by citizens and arrested. All victims, ranging in age from 21 to 84, were treated at a local hospital and are expected to survive, with their conditions steadily improving. The FBI is assisting local law enforcement in the ongoing investigation into the motive for the attack.</p>

          <p>Following the England women's football team's historic Euro 2025 victory against Spain, Downing Street is not planning to declare a national bank holiday to celebrate the event. This decision aligns with the precedent set after the team's 2022 win and the men's 1966 World Cup victory. Despite calls from political figures like Keir Starmer for a day of celebration, the government is likely considering the significant economic cost, previously estimated at over £1 billion. A homecoming parade is scheduled in London to honor the Lionesses' achievement of retaining their title.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 16:00:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NASCAR driver Aric Almirola accused Austin Hill of an intentional wreck during the Xfinity Series race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The incident occurred with ten laps remaining, resulting in a hard crash for Almirola, who described the impact as one of the most violent of his career, comparing it to a previous crash where he broke his back. While Hill claimed the contact was unintentional, he received a five-lap penalty for the maneuver. Almirola was uninjured, but he strongly condemned the move as uncalled for in racing.</p>

          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar has won his fourth Tour de France, concluding the race with a significant lead over his rivals. The final stage in Paris featured a novel and controversial addition: three circuits around the steep, cobbled streets of Montmartre, a departure from the traditional sprinter-friendly finish on the Champs-Elysées. While Tour director Christian Prudhomme was enthusiastic about the change, several top riders, including Jonas Vingegaard, expressed concerns about the added stress and danger on the narrow climb. Pogačar remained unfazed, comfortably securing his victory and cementing his status as a dominant force in modern cycling.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Thailand and Cambodia are scheduled to meet in Malaysia for peace talks aimed at ending deadly border clashes over contested temples. The negotiations, mediated by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, follow days of fighting that has resulted in at least 34 deaths and displaced around 200,000 people. Despite the planned talks, artillery exchanges continued over the weekend, with both sides accusing the other of initiating attacks and escalating the conflict. US President Donald Trump claimed he influenced the decision to negotiate after speaking with both prime ministers and threatening potential tariffs.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade agreement, establishing a 15% baseline tariff on most EU exports to the US, which averts the threat of a much higher 30% rate. The deal, announced after negotiations in Scotland, also includes major EU commitments to purchase $750 billion in US energy and invest $600 billion in the American economy. However, some key sectors are excluded or face different terms, with a punitive 50% tariff on steel remaining in place. The agreement provides stability to the massive transatlantic trade relationship, though it raises the cost of commerce compared to pre-Trump levels.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have secured their star offensive tackle, Rashawn Slater, with a four-year, $114 million contract extension. The deal reportedly includes $92 million in guaranteed money, setting a new record for an NFL offensive lineman. Slater, a two-time Pro Bowl selection, is a cornerstone of the team's offensive line and is tasked with protecting quarterback Justin Herbert's blindside. The move reflects the high value the team places on Slater and is part of a broader effort by the Chargers to solidify their offensive line ahead of the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>CBS's decision to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in 2026 has ignited a debate about the viability of the traditional late-night television format. While some view the cancellation as a purely financial move by parent company Paramount amidst industry-wide pressures, others see it as a sign of the genre's decline. The article notes that late-night shows are expensive to produce and are facing dwindling linear TV audiences and ad revenue. The future of other programs, like ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live," whose contract is up in 2026, will be a key indicator of the industry's long-term commitment to the format.</p>

          <p>White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought has indicated that the administration is considering further spending cuts through the rescissions process before the end of the fiscal year. Speaking on CBS, Vought did not rule out sending another package to Congress to claw back appropriated funds, following a recent $10 billion cut to foreign aid and public broadcasting. He stated his office is reviewing funding for agencies like the National Institutes of Health line-by-line for waste. This approach has drawn criticism from Democrats and some Republicans for potentially undermining congressional authority and bipartisan negotiations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis by Ezra Klein suggests the Jeffrey Epstein controversy poses a unique political problem for Donald Trump by turning his own tactics against him. Having built his brand on promoting conspiracy theories about a secretive "deep state," Trump now presides over that very state and is facing pressure from his own base to reveal secrets about Epstein. His attempts to deflect and distract are seen by some as deepening suspicion, creating a dilemma where any action or inaction fuels the very conspiratorial thinking he has long encouraged. This dynamic complicates his ability to manage the narrative effectively with his supporters.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic argues that the Trump administration's foreign policy has created a global environment more tolerant of corruption, influencing leaders like Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The article points to Zelensky's recent signing of a law that weakened his country's anti-corruption agencies, a move he later reversed after public outcry. The author contends that by dismantling U.S. anti-kleptocracy programs and defending foreign leaders facing corruption charges, the Trump administration has signaled that pressure for good governance is off. This shift has allegedly allowed leaders, even those previously seen as democratic champions, to protect political allies from scrutiny.</p>

          <p>A group of 21 Democratic senators, led by Chris Van Hollen, is calling on the Trump administration to stop funding the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an Israeli-backed private organization distributing food in Gaza. In a letter to the Secretary of State, the senators expressed grave concerns about GHF's methods, which use armed contractors and have been linked to hundreds of deaths as starving civilians crowd distribution sites. They are urging the U.S. to cease its $30 million pledge to GHF and instead resume support for established U.N. aid mechanisms, citing the escalating humanitarian crisis and reports of a "death trap" environment.</p>

          <p>Megan Horneman, CIO of Verdence Capital Advisors, has warned that the stock market may be overly complacent and is "pricing in the perfect situation" as the August 1st trade tariff deadline approaches. She expressed concern that investors are underestimating potential risks, including uncertainty around Federal Reserve policy and technically overbought conditions, particularly in growth stocks. While remaining a long-term bull, Horneman suggests a short-term valuation correction is possible if rate cuts are delayed or trade issues escalate. She advises investors to ensure their portfolios are appropriately allocated to navigate the potential volatility. (not investment advice)</p>
