            <p>A Wisconsin Legislative Audit Bureau (WLAB) audit revealed that the University of Wisconsin system and several state agencies did not specifically track spending on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives during FY 2023-2024, estimating the university system spent $12.5 million on DEI-related salaries and $40.2 million on DEI offices. The university was already scaling back DEI efforts after a 2023 deal with Republican legislators. The audits, ordered by state Republicans, align with broader efforts to limit DEI in American institutions, echoing Trump administration policies.</p>

            <p>Following the implementation of global financial market tariffs, Donald Trump spent his time golfing, dining with donors, and making comments such as “this is a great time to get rich,” even as the U.S. economy faced significant turmoil. This juxtaposition has drawn comparisons to historical figures like Nero, who was said to have fiddled while Rome burned, illustrating Trump's governing style characterized by erratic decisions, disregard for convention, and surrounding himself with deferential advisors, raising concerns about his detachment from the anxieties of ordinary people.</p>

            <p>Economists argue that while tariffs implemented by President Trump could potentially preserve American jobs in specific industries by discouraging imports, US consumers would bear the cost through higher prices. A Penn State University economist noted that regions heavily exposed to import competition from China experienced manufacturing job losses, although consumers benefited from more affordable goods. These tariffs are a blunt instrument for raising prices, potentially preserving American jobs at the expense of consumer savings.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has been arresting and detaining protesters involved in pro-Palestinian demonstrations, justifying their actions by branding the protesters as "Hamas supporters" without evidence. This approach aligns with Project Esther, a plan from the Heritage Foundation aimed at cracking down on antisemitism by rebranding pro-Palestinian supporters as Hamas supporters, advocating for the public firing of pro-Palestinian professors, and the deportation of student visa and green-card holders critical of Israel. Critics argue this conflates support for Palestinian rights with antisemitism and dismantles civil society institutions.</p>

The strong winds, originating from a cold vortex system over Mongolia, caused damage to vehicles and the closure of parks, but no injuries were reported. The city issued its first orange alert for strong winds in a decade, with conditions expected to ease by Sunday.</p>

Roosevelt's success as president was rooted in his policies, which he was able to explain with clarity and compassion, and not just his use of mass media.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's order to expand timber production in the United States will affect all 18 of California's national forests, spanning over 20 million acres. The directive stems from President Trump's executive order to increase American timber production by 25%, aiming to provide domestic timber supplies, create jobs, reduce wildfire disasters, and improve habitats. Environmental groups have expressed outrage, arguing that the order will bypass environmental laws and expedite logging, potentially harming ecosystems and endangering species.</p>

            <p>US farmers are concerned about President Trump's tariffs, as they increase costs and risk retaliation against US crop exports. China has imposed a 125% tariff on US goods, leading to fears of losing customers. The White House is considering ways to help farmers, but farmers say government aid is not their first choice. China went elsewhere for soybeans during Trump's first term and the U.S. market share has never recovered.</p>
