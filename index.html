          <p>The United Kingdom and the European Union have reached a significant agreement aimed at resetting their relationship following the UK's departure from the bloc in 2020. The deal covers various areas, including security, energy, trade, travel, and fisheries, and is seen as a new chapter in their post-Brexit relations. This agreement seeks to reduce red tape for businesses, extend fishing rights for EU trawlers in UK waters until 2038, and allow British holidaymakers to use more eGates in EU airports. While some issues, like youth mobility, remain to be fully resolved, the agreement is praised by both sides as a positive outcome amid shifting global dynamics.</p>

          <p>The Democratic primary for mayor of Pittsburgh has become a proxy for the national struggle within the Democratic Party, pitting progressive incumbent Ed Gainey against challenger Corey O‚ÄôConnor.

O‚ÄôConnor, backed by significant financial support and the legacy of his late father, criticizes Gainey's management and focuses on fiscal stability.

          <p>Portugal‚Äôs governing center-right coalition secured victory in a snap election, but failed to achieve a majority as the hard-right Chega party gained significant ground. This outcome underscores the rise of Chega, which means ‚Äúenough‚Äù in Portuguese, as a major political force capitalizing on anti-immigration sentiment and economic frustrations. While Prime Minister Lu√≠s Montenegro‚Äôs coalition has refused to ally with Chega, the election results suggest Portugal is likely headed for another unstable minority government. Chega's success marks the first time a hard-right party has gained such traction in Portugal since the end of its nationalist dictatorship in 1974.</p>

Prime Minister Keir Starmer is hosting EU leaders in London for a summit focused on deepening ties and cutting red tape to boost the British economy. Agreements include extending EU fishermen's access to British waters in exchange for easing customs checks on food imports and a new defense and security pact.

          <p>Keir Starmer is betting that the public has moved past the major debates surrounding Brexit and is primarily interested in pragmatic solutions to reduce friction with the EU. The new UK-EU deal aims to improve relations without revisiting fundamental questions like membership in the single market or customs union. While Conservatives and Reform UK criticize the deal as a "surrender," the Liberal Democrats urge greater ambition. The success of Starmer's strategy depends on whether the public truly desires minimal friction with the EU, potentially establishing him as a post-Brexit prime minister.</p>
