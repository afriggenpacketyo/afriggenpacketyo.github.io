          <h2>UK Poised to Benefit from New EU-U.S. Trade Agreement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 04:42:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent EU-U.S. trade agreement, which sets a 15% tariff on EU goods imported to the U.S., is projected to offer an unexpected economic advantage to the United Kingdom. Experts indicate that the UK's pre-existing 10% tariff rate with the U.S. could make British exports more competitive, potentially diverting American demand from EU products to UK-manufactured goods. This scenario might also encourage EU-based manufacturers, particularly those with slim profit margins, to consider relocating or expanding their operations within the UK to mitigate tariff impacts. Furthermore, the deal's prevention of a more punitive 30% tariff on the EU helps avert a potential major downturn for a key trading partner, indirectly benefiting the UK economy.

          <h2>India Becomes Leading Smartphone Exporter to U.S., Surpassing China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 04:34:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India has emerged as the top exporter of smartphones to the U.S. in the second quarter, surpassing China, according to Canalys. Indian-assembled smartphones now constitute 44% of U.S. imports, a significant rise from 13% last year, driven by a 240% increase in volume. This shift is largely attributed to Apple's accelerated move to manufacture iPhones in India amid U.S.-China trade uncertainties. While overall iPhone shipments to the U.S. saw a decline, this trend reflects a broader manufacturing supply chain diversification away from China, though efficiency rates in India and Vietnam are noted to be lower.

          <p>England's women's football team, the Lionesses, will hold an open-top bus parade in central London to celebrate their historic Euro 2025 victory over Spain. The procession will culminate in a ceremony at the Queen Victoria Memorial, following their triumphant return to the UK and a reception at Downing Street. This win, secured via a 3-1 penalty shootout, marks the first time an English team has won a major tournament on foreign soil, drawing over 16 million TV viewers. The government has also announced plans to increase funding for women's and girls' football facilities, aiming to capitalize on this momentum for broader sport development.</p>

          <p>A Russian airstrike on a prison near Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, killed 17 inmates and wounded 42 others in an overnight attack. Ukrainian officials reported eight strikes, likely from high-explosive aerial glide bombs, which also damaged nearby homes. President Zelenskyy's chief of staff condemned the incident as another war crime by Russia. This attack comes as U.S. President Donald Trump issued an ultimatum to Moscow, threatening sanctions if a ceasefire is not agreed upon within days, though previous warnings have not halted Russian barrages.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan detainees, recently freed from El Salvador's notorious "Cecot" prison, have shared harrowing accounts of their 125-day incarceration, describing it as a "cemetery of the living dead." Many, without criminal backgrounds, were deported by the U.S. as part of the Trump administration's anti-immigrant crackdown, often targeted for being Venezuelan or having tattoos. Prisoners endured physical and psychological abuse, including beatings and threats, leading some to contemplate suicide. Their release came through a prisoner swap deal between Washington and Caracas, prompting calls for accountability and legal action against the U.S. government for the "abduction" of these individuals.</p>

          <p>In a horrific incident in Nigeria's Zamfara state, kidnappers murdered at least 35 of 56 abducted villagers, despite receiving ransom payments for their release. Local officials confirmed that most victims were young people "slaughtered like rams." While 18 individuals, primarily women and one boy, were released, the bodies of those killed are unlikely to be returned. This atrocity underscores the escalating and lucrative kidnapping crisis by criminal gangs, known as bandits, in northern Nigeria.

          <p>Food price inflation in the UK has risen for the sixth consecutive month, reaching 4% in July, primarily driven by higher costs for meat and tea. The British Retail Consortium attributes this to tighter global supplies impacting wholesale prices, with chicken prices alone nearly doubling in two years due to avian flu and lower stock intensity. This increase contributes to household grocery bills projected to rise by £275 this year. Overall shop price inflation also increased to 0.7%, indicating growing pressure on consumers' budgets despite retailers' efforts to mitigate costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A gunman wielding an assault-style rifle stormed a Park Avenue office skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan, killing four people, including 36-year-old police officer Didarul Islam, before taking his own life. The attacker, identified as 27-year-old Shane Tamura of Las Vegas, had a documented mental health history and drove cross-country to carry out the attack. Officer Islam, a Bangladeshi immigrant and father of two, was praised as a hero for protecting New Yorkers. The incident caused widespread fear, prompting shelter-in-place orders and bringing parts of Midtown to a halt as authorities investigated the motive behind the tragic spree.</p>

Relocating to Bengal, he impressed coaches with his pace and swing, eventually breaking into the IPL and then India's Test squad.

          <p>Shares of Singapore Airlines (SIA) plummeted over 8% after the carrier reported a 59% decline in net profit for the first quarter of its financial year. The significant drop to S$186 million was attributed to reduced interest income and losses from associated companies, notably Air India, in which SIA holds a 25.1% stake following a merger. Analysts indicate Air India's deeper-than-expected losses and reputational damage from a recent incident are dragging down SIA's bottom line. Despite strong demand for air travel and cargo, rising competition and operating costs are normalizing SIA's margins, prompting some analysts to downgrade the stock. (not investment advice)</p>

Advocates argue the policy is a misinterpretation of law, "arbitrary and capricious," and causes "catastrophic" harm by separating families and disrupting lives.
