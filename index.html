          <p>President Donald Trump publicly dismissed recent global "No Kings Day" protests, labeling them "a joke" and ineffective, while asserting that he is not royalty but rather works tirelessly to enhance the nation's greatness. He suggested the demonstrations were financially backed by "Soros and other radical left lunatics" and were not representative of the country. Despite initial concerns about potential violence, the rallies held in major cities like New York and Washington, D.C., remained largely peaceful amid an ongoing government shutdown.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced a positive opening, with major indexes like Japan's Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rising, after China opted to keep its benchmark lending rates unchanged. The one-year loan prime rate remained at 3%, a decision consistent with market expectations. This stability in China's monetary policy, coupled with anticipation of its third-quarter GDP data, contributed to the regional market buoyancy. U.S. markets also closed higher, partly influenced by a more conciliatory tone in trade discussions with China, as this article highlights. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite Musk's long-standing criticism of LiDAR as "expensive and unnecessary," its cost has significantly decreased, and other auto executives consider it "mission critical."

          <p>A federal judge ordered that X and xAI's antitrust lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI, alleging AI market monopolies, must remain in federal court in Fort Worth, Texas, despite the companies having "at best minimal connections" to that geographic area. In a sharply ironic four-page order, Judge Mark Pittman encouraged the companies to relocate their headquarters to Fort Worth, implicitly criticizing the practice of "forum-shopping" by plaintiffs. This article highlights the ongoing legal battles in the tech sector and judicial concerns about venue selection.</p>

          <p>Federal officials, including the Secret Service, discovered a "suspicious stand" near Palm Beach International Airport, an area routinely used by Air Force One when President Trump travels to Florida. The agency found "items of interest," which appeared to be a hunting stand set up high in a tree, during a pre-arrival sweep. While sources indicate the stand had been there for months and did not pose an immediate threat, its discovery underscores persistent security concerns around presidential movements, especially following a previous assassination attempt in the area.

          <p>The Trump administration announced a seventh strike on an alleged drug-carrying vessel, resulting in three fatalities, bringing the total deaths from such operations to at least 32. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated the latest strike targeted a boat linked to a Colombian guerrilla group, carrying substantial narcotics in international waters. The administration justifies these actions by deeming drug cartels terrorist organizations and considering drug smuggling an "armed attack," a controversial stance that has drawn pushback from lawmakers questioning its legal and constitutional basis.

Subsequent plans focused on "strategic emerging industries" like green technology, granting China a near monopoly on critical resources.
