          <p>A sniper opened fire on a Dallas Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility, killing two detainees and critically wounding a third before taking his own life. The Department of Homeland Security has labeled the incident an "attack on ICE law enforcement," citing anti-ICE messages found on the shooter's shell casings. The event has intensified the national debate over political rhetoric concerning immigration enforcement, with officials calling for an end to violence against law enforcement. The FBI is investigating the shooting as an act of targeted violence.</p>

          <p>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is featured in a new political ad supporting California's Proposition 50, a measure backed by Governor Gavin Newsom. The proposition aims to redraw the state's congressional districts to create five more Democrat-leaning seats, presented as a countermeasure to Republican-led redistricting efforts in Texas. The ad frames the vote as a crucial fight for democracy against former President Trump's influence on electoral maps. The move has drawn criticism from California Republicans and fueled speculation about Ocasio-Cortez's future political ambitions.</p>

          <p>Major broadcast group Nexstar Media is still evaluating whether to resume airing "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on its ABC-affiliated stations. The show was preempted by Nexstar and other station owners following its return to the air, leaving it unavailable in about 20% of the country. The preemption stems from controversy over comments Kimmel made linking an alleged killer to the MAGA movement, which also led to a temporary suspension of the show by parent company Disney. Discussions between Nexstar and Disney are ongoing to ensure the program aligns with the interests of the communities they serve.</p>

          <p>A joint U.S.-Mexican operation resulted in the capture of Martha Alicia Mendez Aguilar, a cartel leader known as "La Diabla," accused of running a horrific infant trafficking ring. Aguilar, a leader in the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), allegedly lured pregnant women, performed forced C-sections that killed the mothers, and sold the newborns in the U.S. for up to $14,000. The capture was facilitated by intelligence from the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center, highlighting an expanded application of counterterrorism tools against cartels. The investigation into the trafficking network is ongoing.</p>

          <p>An analysis piece raises concerns about the shifting media landscape under the second Trump administration, highlighting a potential deal for TikTok's U.S. operations to be sold to a consortium including Trump ally Larry Ellison. This move, along with other events like the pressure campaign against "Jimmy Kimmel Live," signals a trend toward media entities becoming more aligned with the administration's political interests. The article argues that while the deal may address concerns about Chinese influence, it creates new risks of domestic government surveillance and manipulation of social media data for political purposes.

This pullback has contributed to a broader market slide from recent record highs. In other tech news, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Instagram has surpassed 3 billion monthly active users, joining Facebook and WhatsApp at this milestone. The platform's growth is attributed to the success of its short-form video feature, Reels, and the use of AI to enhance its content recommendation systems. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents in San Rafael, a city in the San Francisco Bay Area, are being warned about an unusually aggressive squirrel that has attacked multiple people. At least two individuals required emergency room treatment for bites and scratches after unprovoked attacks by the animal. Officials have posted flyers to alert the community, and wildlife experts speculate the squirrel's behavior may stem from being fed by humans when it was young, causing it to lose its natural fear. Experts remind the public not to feed wild animals and have noted that squirrels are not typically carriers of rabies.</p>

He argued that international institutions have proven too weak to guarantee Ukraine's safety and called for global rules to govern the use of artificial intelligence in weaponry. Zelenskyy emphasized that stopping Russia now is critical to prevent a more destructive future arms race, potentially involving nuclear-capable drones. His address came shortly before U.S. President Donald Trump signaled a potential shift in his stance on the war's outcome.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, the average 30-year mortgage rate has fallen to a three-year low of 6.13%, providing significant savings for homebuyers. For a $250,000 mortgage, the monthly principal and interest payment is now approximately $1,520, which is about $150 less per month compared to the rates seen at the beginning of the year. This reduction in borrowing costs has spurred an increase in mortgage applications from both new buyers and existing homeowners looking to refinance. Over the full 30-year term, the lower rate translates to a total interest savings of around $54,000.</p>

          <p>An analysis explores the profound impact of conservative organizer Charlie Kirk's death on the MAGA movement, arguing that many on the right view his killing as their "George Floyd moment." To his allies, Kirk was not just a media personality but a crucial organizer who championed competing within democratic systems, making his death feel like an attack on that principle. This perspective helps explain the vehement reaction from conservative leaders, who blame a broader liberal culture for the violence rather than a lone actor. The aftermath has intensified the belief that they must now seize cultural and political control.</p>

          <p>A bronze-painted statue depicting President Trump and Jeffrey Epstein holding hands appeared on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., but was removed by U.S. Park Police in less than 24 hours. The installation, titled "Best Friends Forever," was placed by an activist group to satirize the two men's past association. Although the group had a permit for the display, the Department of the Interior stated it was removed for non-compliance, a claim the artists dispute. The White House criticized the artwork, while the activist group accused the administration of illegally suppressing speech.</p>

          <p>Doctors are expressing concern after President Trump claimed that taking Tylenol (acetaminophen) during pregnancy is linked to a "very increased risk" of autism in children. Medical experts and organizations like the Autism Science Foundation state there is no conclusive scientific evidence to support this claim and that such remarks could cause unnecessary fear among expectant mothers. Obstetricians worry that pregnant women might avoid the medication when needed to treat dangerous fevers or pain, as acetaminophen is one of the few pain relievers considered safe during pregnancy. They plan to continue recommending it based on established medical guidance.</p>

          <p>A family has shared that their son, diagnosed with nonverbal autism, began speaking just days after starting an off-label treatment with leucovorin, a drug typically used to mitigate chemotherapy side effects. The drug, a derivative of folic acid, is being studied by pediatric neurologist Dr. Richard Frye as a potential treatment for a subset of children with autism who may have a blockage in folate transport to the brain. While preliminary studies have shown positive effects on speech, more research is needed for FDA approval. A primary obstacle is the lack of financial incentive for pharmaceutical companies to fund trials for an inexpensive, generic drug.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that infections from drug-resistant "nightmare bacteria" have increased by 70% in the U.S. The surge is primarily driven by bacteria containing the NDM gene, which are resistant to most antibiotics, including last-resort carbapenems. Researchers suggest the increase may be linked to a surge in antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic, which can accelerate the development of antimicrobial resistance. The report warns of the grave danger posed by these infections, as they could make common ailments like urinary tract infections much more difficult to treat.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the UN, U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to reverse his previous stance on the war, stating that Ukraine is in a position to "WIN all of Ukraine back." This marks a significant departure from his earlier suggestions that Kyiv would need to cede territory for a peace deal. Zelenskyy praised the meeting as productive and described Trump as "well-informed," viewing the shift as a potential game-changer. While the statement was met with cautious optimism in Ukraine, it remains unclear if this rhetorical change will translate into a concrete policy pivot from the White House.</p>

He also claimed the UK has abandoned its "powerful edge" in North Sea oil due to high taxes, despite regulators projecting that 90% of future production will come from existing fields.

The system, which books taxis for necessary travel without presenting public transport as an alternative, has been criticized as a "ridiculous waste of taxpayer money."
