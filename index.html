          <p>Newly released police records shed light on the mental state of the 29-year-old who attacked a Dallas immigration facility. His parents reported he believed he suffered from "radiation sickness" and a "plastic allergy" after returning from Washington state, becoming a loner obsessed with AI. The documents detail his withdrawal and recent target practice but offer no clear motive for the attack, which killed two detainees and wounded another before the shooter took his own life. Federal authorities previously noted he left behind anti-ICE writings.</p>

          <p>Disney is considering a co-CEO structure to replace Bob Iger, with top internal candidates being Dana Walden and Josh D'Amaro, who have complementary expertise in entertainment and parks. The board is looking at models like Netflix's successful dual-CEO system, and Iger reportedly consulted Netflix's Ted Sarandos about the arrangement. However, corporate governance experts and company insiders express skepticism, citing Disney's famously political culture and the difficult power-sharing dynamic during the previous Iger-Chapek transition. Such a move could be risky for the company's stability.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of U.S. rare earth mining companies experienced a significant rally, continuing gains after President Trump threatened 100% tariffs on Chinese imports. The move came in response to Beijing's announcement of new restrictions on its own rare earth exports, a sector it globally dominates. This escalation in the U.S.-China trade dispute has prompted investors to speculate on the increased value of domestic mineral sources. China currently produces nearly 70% of the world's rare earths and processes almost 90% of the global supply. (not investment advice)</p>

The changes aim to address consumer confusion and high price points that have hindered sales since the models' 2021 launch. The revamp includes updated styling, a lower starting price under $65,000, and the introduction of a new range-extended plug-in powertrain.

          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by a record-breaking trading revenue of nearly $9 billion. The bank's profit increased by 12% to $14.39 billion, with overall revenue rising 9% to $47.12 billion. CEO Jamie Dimon attributed the strong performance to market volatility spurred by President Trump's policies, which compelled investors to reposition their portfolios. Despite the positive results, Dimon noted the firm is preparing for potential future turbulence stemming from geopolitical uncertainty and the risk of persistent inflation.

          <p>The International Monetary Fund has upgraded its economic outlook for the United Kingdom, projecting it will be the second-fastest-growing economy in the G7 for this year and the next. The IMF forecasts modest growth of 1.3% for both years, outperforming all G7 members except the United States. However, the report also warns that UK inflation is expected to be the highest in the G7 in 2025 and 2026, driven by rising energy costs. The global outlook remains cautious, with the IMF citing risks from US tariffs and a potential bust in the AI technology boom. (not investment advice)</p>

The article suggests that the transformation America is currently undergoing will have significant repercussions for its internal stability.

In the ad, Obama warns that "democracy is on the ballot" and accuses Republicans of attempting to "rig the next election" by gerrymandering districts in other states. The proposition, backed by Governor Gavin Newsom, seeks a mid-decade redistricting that could improve Democratic chances in five of the state's 52 congressional districts.

          <p>The Israeli gymnastics team, including reigning world floor champion Artem Dolgopyat, will be unable to compete in the upcoming World Artistic Gymnastics Championships after being denied entry visas by the host nation, Indonesia. As the world's most populous Muslim country, Indonesia cited Israel's military offensive in Gaza as the reason for the decision. The Israel Gymnastics Federation's appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) for provisional measures was rejected. This is not the first such incident; in 2023, Indonesia was stripped of its right to host the Under-20 Football World Cup for refusing to host the Israeli team.</p>

          <p>The United States government warned Dutch officials months in advance that chipmaker Nexperia's CEO needed to be removed to prevent the company from facing repercussions related to the U.S. entity list. Court documents show the U.S. informed the Netherlands in June about a policy change that would extend blacklisting to subsidiaries of listed companies. Nexperia is fully owned by Wingtech, a Chinese tech firm added to the entity list in December. Following this pressure, Dutch authorities removed founding CEO Zhang Xuezheng from his position, a move that angered Beijing.</p>

          <p>Authorities have publicly identified the 16 individuals who were killed in a large explosion at the Accurate Energetic Systems plant in rural Tennessee on October 10. The blast, which was felt over 20 miles away, left no survivors at the site. Among the victims was a local church pastor, and the community is reportedly in deep mourning. Investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives face a difficult task in determining the cause, as critical evidence has been scattered across a wide area and must be painstakingly reassembled.</p>

          <p>A trial has begun for a Sudanese asylum seeker accused of murdering a 27-year-old hotel worker in a "vicious and frenzied attack" on a train station platform in Walsall, England. Prosecutors allege that Deng Majek, 19, stabbed Rhiannon Whyte 23 times with a screwdriver in October 2024. The jury was told that the defendant was seen on CCTV following the victim from the hotel where they both were, and was later seen dancing and laughing after the attack.

          <p>European industries, particularly automotive companies, are growing concerned about new export controls on rare earth materials announced by Beijing. The latest restrictions require licenses for products containing even small traces of rare earths and for related processing equipment. An EU official stated that Brussels has been in discussion with China over the curbs but that business planning remains difficult. The move is widely seen as a strategic play by China to gain leverage against the U.S., but European firms fear they will be caught in the middle of the escalating trade dispute.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is actively dismantling the Pentagon's long-standing approach of treating climate change as a critical national security threat, despite its growing impact on military operations. For decades, the Department of Defense has recognized that extreme weather floods bases, sidelines troops with heat-related illnesses, and fuels global instability. However, the new leadership has cut climate research funding and abandoned adaptation plans, with the defense secretary dismissing such concerns. Critics warn this policy shift puts troops at risk and creates strategic vulnerabilities by ignoring a key driver of modern conflict.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming U.S. defense strategy report is expected to introduce significant changes to the nation's approach to countering China, according to Chinese defense researchers. While a Pentagon memo indicated the report will prioritize deterring China in the Indo-Pacific, some sources suggest it will elevate the defense of the U.S. homeland above threats from China and Russia. One researcher interprets this not as a pivot away from the region, but as a shift toward a broader, indirect containment strategy. This would focus on peripheral regions rather than direct confrontation along the Indo-Pacific front lines.</p>

One landmark law requires AI chatbots to disclose they are not human and to prompt minors to take breaks, while another mandates social media platforms to add warning labels about potential mental health risks. Further legislation increases penalties for the distribution of deepfake pornography and requires device makers to implement age verification tools in their app stores.

The investigation found that the companies illegally restricted the ability of independent retailers to set their own online and offline prices for their products. By dictating minimum sales prices and maximum discount rates, the brands engaged in anti-competitive behavior that resulted in higher prices and reduced choice for consumers. The parent companies of the brands are Kering, Richemont, and LVMH, respectively.</p>

However, legal principles against "double jeopardy" make it exceptionally difficult to retry an acquitted person, and the specific charges under the Official Secrets Act do not allow for a second prosecution under any circumstances.</p>
