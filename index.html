          <p>President Trump announced a framework for a trade deal with the United Kingdom from the Oval Office. The announcement follows earlier reports of progress in trade negotiations between the two countries. This deal marks the first major trade agreement since Trump's implementation of widespread tariffs, and could potentially ease investor concerns about global trade tensions. The specifics of the agreement are expected to be released soon, and the administration is closely monitoring developments between Pakistan and India after the two nations exchanged fire.</p>

          <p>Shopify's stock experienced a decline of over 5% in early trading due to mixed first-quarter results and cautious guidance for the upcoming period. While the company's earnings per share and revenue surpassed expectations, its projections for gross profit and revenue growth fell slightly short of analyst forecasts. Shopify acknowledges the uncertainty created by President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, noting that a small percentage of its gross merchandise volume is affected by the expiration of duty-free shipments from China. The company is actively monitoring data and helping its merchants adapt to potential changes.</p>

This criticism is the latest in a series of attacks from Trump on Powell's monetary policy decisions. The Federal Reserve's last rate cut occurred in December 2024, leaving the rate range at 4.25% to 4.50%.

          <p>Financial experts suggest that using an inheritance to pay off credit card debt can be a wise move, particularly with high interest rates and significant consumer debt. Paying off debt can provide an immediate and higher return compared to long-term market returns. However, the decision depends on individual financial situations, goals, and other considerations, such as potential claims against the estate or urgent financial needs. It's also crucial to address the root causes of the debt to avoid accumulating it again in the future.</p>

          <p>President Vladimir Putin of Russia and Xi Jinping, the leader of China, issued a joint rebuke to Washington on Thursday, a day before celebrations in Moscow to mark the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. The leaders held talks at the Kremlin, part of a state visit that Moscow organized for Mr. Xi before his attendance alongside other foreign leaders on Friday at a military parade in Red Square. The two leaders usually sign a raft of bilateral agreements during their one-on-one summits, and Thursday was no exception.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates announced plans to shutter the Gates Foundation in 2045 and criticized Elon Musk for slashing funding to USAID, accusing the Tesla CEO of “killing the world’s poorest children.” Gates condemned the funding cuts, saying they have led to life-saving food and medicines expiring in warehouses, and could result in the resurgence of diseases. He also announced that he plans to distribute “virtually all” of his wealth through the Gates Foundation over the next 20 years.</p>

A letter signed by 42 MPs highlights anxieties about the potential impact on disabled individuals and their families. The MPs are urging ministers to postpone any decisions until comprehensive assessments of the cuts' effects on employment and health are published, especially in light of Labour's recent losses in local elections.</p>

Swinney's decision is influenced by his religious beliefs and concerns about potential impacts on patient-clinician relationships and vulnerable individuals.

          <p>Russia will celebrate the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s defeat with visiting heads of state and a show of armed might in Red Square, staged as a display of global clout, grandiose and intimidating, and a portent of eventual triumph in the war against Ukraine. The annual military parade below the walls and towers of the Kremlin is expected to be the largest since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, a commemoration the government and its cheerleaders have used to raise support for the war, conflating what may be the greatest source of national pride with the far more divisive current conflict.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England reduced UK interest rates to 4.25% from 4.5%, marking the fourth cut in the past year, driven by a slowdown in inflation. Governor Andrew Bailey cautioned about global economic unpredictability due to US tariffs. The Bank considered a larger cut but balanced this with concerns over a potential global trade war impacting growth, offset by lower energy bills and inflation. This decision aligns with anticipated details of a UK-US tariff deal. Future rate cuts are expected to be gradual, reflecting a divided rate-setting committee.</p>
