          <p>China's Foreign Ministry has called on the United States to respect facts and stop spreading disinformation to create a conducive environment for trade talks. This statement comes after accusations from both countries regarding violations of a previous tariff truce agreed upon in Geneva. The US had also reportedly suspended the sale of certain jet engine technology and chip design software to China. China insists that pressure and coercion are not effective methods for engaging with them, as they seek meaningful dialogue to resolve trade disputes.</p>

          <p>Constellation Energy's stock value increased by 15% after Meta signed a 20-year agreement to purchase nuclear power from the company. Beginning in June 2027, Meta will buy approximately 1.1 gigawatts of energy from Constellation's Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois, which is the entire output from the site's one nuclear reactor. The agreement supports the plant's continued operation and relicensing, which was in danger of closing due to the expiration of zero-emission credits. The plant will continue to provide power to the regional grid, contributing to Meta's goal of 100% clean electricity.</p>

          <p>Mexican authorities have arrested three additional suspects in connection with the kidnapping and murder of five musicians from the band Fugitivo in Tamaulipas state, near the Texas border. The musicians had been hired for a performance in Reynosa but were kidnapped on May 25, with their bodies discovered several days later after ransom demands were made. Weapons, ammunition, cocaine, and methamphetamines were seized during the operation. The area has been plagued by violence since 2017 due to disputes among cartels vying for control of drug trafficking, human smuggling, and fuel theft.</p>

          <p>Portuguese and German authorities have initiated a new search in the Algarve region of Portugal for Madeleine McCann, who disappeared nearly two decades ago. The search is focused on 21 plots of land between the resort where Madeleine went missing and the location where the prime suspect, Christian BrÃ¼ckner, had been staying. BrÃ¼ckner is currently serving a sentence in Germany for a separate crime and is suspected of Madeleine's murder, though he denies involvement. The search is expected to continue until Friday, with German police leading the effort and Portuguese authorities providing support.</p>

Racism remains the most common form of discrimination, with over 3,800 reports last year, while gender discrimination reports have more than doubled in the past five years.

          <h2>Oxford-Cambridge Rail Line Classification Sparks Anger in Wales</h2>

          <p>A multi-billion pound project to build a railway line between Oxford and Cambridge has been classified as an England and Wales project, causing anger in Wales, as no tracks will be laid in Wales. This classification means Wales will not benefit from extra funding, leading to accusations that the project is like "HS2 all over again." Welsh politicians and rail unions are calling for a rethink, arguing that the classification undermines trust and deprives Welsh communities of needed funding for their own railways.</p>

          <p>The US State Department is intensifying its competition with China in Africa by introducing performance metrics for American ambassadors based on the number of business deals they secure. This shift is part of the US government's new "trade, not aid" approach. President Trump's administration has secured 33 deals worth US$6 billion across the continent within its first 100 days. The new strategy focuses on countries where US companies want to do business, contrasting with China's growing economic influence in Africa.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic examines the unpredictable nature of Donald Trump's policies during his second term, noting that many actions are often reversed or undone shortly after being announced. This pattern of "un-happening" creates uncertainty for businesses and investors, undermining Trump's pledge to reinvigorate American industry. The author argues that this approach is less like strategic chess and more like a denial-of-service attack on a functioning government.</p>

          <p>Vox explores the decline of deep reading and its potential impact on politics, drawing on the work of Walter Ong to examine the differences between oral and literate cultures. The article discusses whether the rise of digital media and the decline of book reading are leading to a reversion to a more tribal and less rational mode of thought. While acknowledging the potential concerns, the author questions whether the decline of deep literacy is the primary driver of illiberal politics and highlights the complexity of the relationship between reading, culture, and political attitudes.</p>
