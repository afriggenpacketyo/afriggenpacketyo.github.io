        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation into New York Attorney General Letitia James following a criminal referral alleging she misrepresented information to obtain favorable loan terms on real estate properties. A grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia issued subpoenas related to accusations that James misrepresented a single-family home in Virginia as her primary residence. James' attorney claims these allegations are baseless and politically motivated, suggesting they are retaliation from President Trump, who James has previously prosecuted. The investigation follows a criminal referral from the Trump administration's Federal Housing Finance Agency Director William Pulte, adding to the contentious history between James and Trump.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has adopted a more assertive approach to pro-Palestinian protests, as demonstrated by the recent intervention of campus security during a demonstration at Butler Library, resulting in arrests. This contrasts with the university's response a year prior, where a single public safety officer left the scene during a similar occupation. Acting President Claire Shipman praised the officers' efforts, stating that demonstrators crossed a line between legitimate protest and actions that endanger others, but the forceful response has drawn criticism from those who believe unarmed protestors should not be met with force. The university is also moving to tighten control of discipline, partly to meet demands from the Trump administration, which has cut research funding due to concerns about the protection of Jewish students.</p>

          <p>China's recent stimulus measures, including interest rate cuts and liquidity injections, have failed to significantly boost its stock market, as investors remain concerned about the ongoing trade war with the U.S. and its potential impact on the Chinese economy. While the measures align with economic priorities laid out in a Politburo meeting, analysts view them as a stopgap rather than a comprehensive solution. Investors are awaiting more targeted fiscal measures to boost consumer sentiment and support the real estate sector, as the current stimulus focuses more on industrial and social needs rather than direct market intervention. Unlike previous stimulus efforts, the central bank has not explicitly backed the stock market, leaving investors cautious.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors have added more charges in the sexual assault case against real estate brokers Oren and Tal Alexander, along with their brother Alon Alexander, with the indictment now including six victims, one of whom is underage. The brothers are accused of using force, fraud, or coercion to traffic the women and girl, with the scheme dating back to 2009. The case has sent shockwaves through the high-end real estate industry and led to the downfall of Oren and Tal Alexander, who were prominent figures in the field. Defense lawyers have dismissed the new charges as a "reheated version of the same case," while prosecutors maintain an ongoing investigation and encourage anyone with information to contact the FBI.</p>

          <p>A Silicon Valley investor, Josh Raffaelli, has filed a lawsuit against his former employer, Brookfield Asset Management, alleging fraud and attempted bribery. Raffaelli claims that Brookfield mistreated investors in his funds to compensate for losses in other areas of the company, including improperly limiting investments in a Musk-owned company. Brookfield denies the allegations, stating the suit is without merit and brought by a disgruntled former employee. The lawsuit also alleges that Brookfield exaggerated the capital levels of Pinegrove Capital Partners, a company it mostly owned, to attract investors, including pension funds and nonprofit organizations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has reportedly asked House Speaker Mike Johnson to include a tax increase on wealthy Americans in the upcoming fiscal package, proposing a new top income bracket for those making over $2.5 million per year with a 39.6% tax rate. This move would partially reverse the tax cuts enacted in 2017, which reduced the top rate to 37%. The proposed tax hike aims to offset the costs of continuing the 2017 tax cuts and to protect Medicaid spending, addressing concerns about the optics of cutting benefits for the poor while providing tax benefits to the rich. Republicans are also considering other tax hikes with a populist appeal, such as raising taxes on stock buybacks.</p>

          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis to boost economic growth and attract foreign investment. This potential shift signals a departure from India's protectionist policies, which have historically relied on high import duties. Experts suggest that while this move could benefit logistics companies and certain sectors, India will likely ensure that any deal does not harm domestic businesses. The U.S. remains India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $129 billion in 2024.</p>

          <p>Under the Trump administration's directive, West Point was ordered to remove course materials focusing on race, gender, or darker aspects of American history, leading to scrapped classes and resignations. The order, issued by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, aimed to eliminate ideologies deemed “divisive” and “un-American.” This has led to the removal of works by Black authors and restrictions on discussing atrocities against Native Americans. The move has shaken the academy, raising concerns about academic freedom and prompting some professors to resign in protest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The film “Pavements” uses an unconventional approach to capture the band's spirit, blending documentary footage, a jukebox musical, a gallery of ephemera, and a parody of an Oscar-baiting biopic. Director Alex Ross Perry aims to portray Pavement as the world’s most important and influential band, building a fictional world where their music inspires various cultural expressions. The film's approach includes staging a musical, creating a museum, and filming a biopic, all while intertwining these elements with the band's actual history. A B-side track, “Harness Your Hopes,” became the band’s biggest hit during the film's production, adding an unexpected twist to their story.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England is planning significant cuts to services, including diabetes care, rehab centers, and talking therapies, to address a nearly £7 billion budget shortfall. These cuts, described as "previously unthinkable," may also include staff reductions, with some NHS trusts halting overtime for doctors. NHS Providers, representing health managers, warns that these savings are "eye-watering." The Department of Health and Social Care has advised NHS services to prioritize cutting bureaucracy and improving productivity.</p>
