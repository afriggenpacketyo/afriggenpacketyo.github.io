          <p>ESPN host Stephen A. Smith forcefully condemned individuals celebrating the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, calling their actions shameful regardless of political differences. On his podcast, Smith expressed sorrow for Kirk's family and emphasized that violence is never an acceptable response to differing beliefs. He also praised the New York Yankees for holding a moment of silence in Kirk's honor, stating that such gestures are essential for maintaining civility. The article notes that several individuals have faced consequences for controversial comments, including an MSNBC analyst and a Carolina Panthers employee who were fired.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court panel has convicted former President Jair Bolsonaro on five counts related to an attempted coup, sentencing him to 27 years and three months in prison. The ruling found him guilty of trying to unlawfully remain in power following his 2022 election defeat, making him the first former Brazilian president convicted of such a crime. Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest, can appeal the verdict to the full 11-justice court. The decision has deepened political divisions in Brazil and drawn criticism from the U.S. Trump administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many Americans are struggling to get the new COVID-19 vaccine after the FDA restricted its approval to high-risk groups, such as those over 65 or with specific health issues. Unlike previous rollouts, the vaccine is no longer available to all, leaving many younger, healthy individuals unable to get a shot even if they want one to protect themselves or vulnerable family members. This policy shift by the Trump administration has led to confusion and frustration, with people being turned away from pharmacies or facing bureaucratic hurdles like needing a doctor's note. The situation is further complicated by delays in CDC recommendations and unclear insurance coverage.</p>

          <p>South Africa's highest court has overturned an apartheid-era law, ruling that men now have the right to take their wives' last names upon marriage. The Constitutional Court declared the previous legislation discriminatory on the basis of gender and described the tradition of women taking men's names as a "colonial import." The case was brought by two couples who challenged the Department of Home Affairs after being denied the right to hyphenate their names or for the husband to adopt his wife's name. The government has been given two years to amend the law to reflect the landmark decision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent significant gains in China's US$12 trillion stock market are testing the government's ability to manage a sustainable bull market without triggering excessive volatility. Beijing aims to establish the equity market as a stable source of household wealth to boost consumer spending and shift reliance away from the property market. After a recent pullback moderated the rapid ascent, regulators may be cautiously optimistic that the market is transitioning to a more measured pace.

          <p>Southern Water has prohibited tanker companies from delivering its water to the estate of U.S. billionaire Stephen Schwarzman after it was revealed the water was being used to fill a new lake during a local hosepipe ban. Residents filmed numerous tankers collecting water from standpipes in a drought-affected area and transporting it to the 2,500-acre Conholt Park estate. While the extraction was legal for construction purposes, the water company's managing director called the usage "appalling" and implemented an immediate ban. A spokesperson for Schwarzman stated the water was sourced legally and was only a small proportion of what's needed for the lake.</p>

Authorities have since recovered a high-powered, bolt-action rifle from a wooded area near the campus.

          <p>A Scottish couple has finally solved the mystery of a stranger who appeared in their wedding photos four years ago. After Michelle and John Wylie noticed the unknown man in pictures from their 2021 ceremony, they spent years asking family and friends to no avail. A recent appeal on social media finally identified the man as Andrew Hillhouse, who had accidentally attended the wrong wedding. Hillhouse explained he was running late for another ceremony two miles away and only realized his mistake when the bride, whom he did not recognize, walked down the aisle.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Argues Trump's Response to Kirk Killing Inaccurately Blames the Left for Political Violence</h2>

          <p>This article critiques President Trump and other conservatives for immediately blaming left-wing extremism for Charlie Kirk's assassination before facts about the shooter were known. It argues that this narrative is factually inaccurate, citing data showing that far-right extremists have perpetrated the majority of domestic terror attacks in recent decades. The author contends that Trump's rhetoric has frequently promoted or excused violence, creating a dangerous political environment. By selectively focusing on left-wing violence, the analysis claims Trump is shaping a story for his own political advantage while ignoring the broader context of rising extremism.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United has completed a £55m signing of striker Yoane Wissa, who has overcome significant personal trauma to reach the top tier of English football. In 2021, just before joining Brentford, Wissa was the victim of an acid attack at his home that could have ended his career and cost him his sight. His former manager and teammates praised his determination and resilience in recovering from the assault. Wissa's move to Newcastle was contentious, as he publicly pushed for the transfer, but his on-field performance, including scoring 19 non-penalty goals last season, made him a key target for the club.</p>

          <p>This article explores how Charlie Kirk became a highly influential figure, particularly among young conservatives, through his organization Turning Point USA. Starting as a high school student concerned with economic policy, he built a movement that resonated with young people who felt their conservative views were silenced on liberal-leaning campuses. Kirk's charismatic and relatable communication style allowed him to effectively brand the MAGA movement for a younger audience, making him a key ally to President Trump. His ability to blend controversial social stances with a folksy, no-nonsense delivery cultivated a loyal, cult-like following that is now devastated by his death.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have successfully voted to change chamber rules, a move often called the "nuclear option," to accelerate the confirmation process for President Trump's nominees. The change allows for non-cabinet level executive branch nominees to be approved in batches rather than through individual votes, overcoming Democratic efforts to slow the process. Majority Leader John Thune argued the measure was necessary to allow the president to assemble his team, while Minority Leader Chuck Schumer warned that Republicans would regret weakening the Senate's deliberative role. The rule change was immediately used to advance a package of 48 nominees for confirmation.</p>

          <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella admitted to employees that the company's leadership must work to rebuild trust following recent layoffs and a new return-to-office mandate. During an internal meeting, Nadella responded to an employee's question about a perceived lack of empathy, stating, "we can do better, and we will do better." The company has cut 9,000 jobs and is requiring employees near its headquarters to work in the office three days a week. While Wall Street has applauded Microsoft's financial performance and AI strategy, the changes have caused unease among some staff members.</p>

          <p>U.S. oil giant ConocoPhillips has announced it will lay off up to 25% of its workforce, a move that will impact thousands of employees. The decision comes amid falling oil prices, which have been affected by increased OPEC+ production and President Trump's tariff policies. While some industry experts predict a recovery by next year, the current downturn is forcing major producers to reduce budgets and cut drilling rigs. The layoffs highlight the volatility of the energy sector and the economic risks faced by workers and local economies dependent on the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has abruptly withdrawn a state bill that aimed to overhaul the city's voter-approved "mansion tax," known as Measure ULA. The proposed legislation would have reduced taxes on the sale of newly constructed commercial and apartment buildings to address what backers called unintended consequences slowing housing production. However, the bill faced strong opposition from supporters of Measure ULA, who argued it would cut crucial funding for homelessness programs. Bass stated the bill was pulled due to the need for additional amendments and plans to reintroduce an improved version in January.</p>
