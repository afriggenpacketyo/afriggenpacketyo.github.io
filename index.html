          <p>Israel has launched a major military operation in the Gaza Strip, dubbed Operation Gideon Chariots, aimed at pressuring Hamas to release the remaining hostages. Prime Minister Netanyahu has instructed the negotiating team to remain in Qatar for indirect talks with Hamas, with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff actively involved in brokering a ceasefire. The operation follows days of intensive strikes across the territory, resulting in numerous casualties, while the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to worsen due to an ongoing blockade. Aid organizations warn of rapidly dwindling supplies, leading to severe malnutrition among children, as negotiations for a ceasefire agreement continue amidst the conflict.</p>

          <p>A deadly explosion outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, is being investigated as an intentional act of terrorism by the FBI. The blast, which killed one person and injured at least four others, caused significant damage to surrounding buildings, shattering windows and scattering debris for blocks. Authorities have identified a person of interest but are not actively searching for a suspect, as the investigation focuses on determining the origin of the blast and whether the clinic was specifically targeted. The clinic has reported that its staff and reproductive materials were unharmed, and it expects to resume normal operations shortly.</p>

          <p>Two prominent figures from the far-right are reportedly planning to infiltrate the Reform UK party to promote extremist views and push a "pro-white" and anti-immigration agenda. David Clews, a conspiracy theorist, and Mark Collett, a Nazi sympathizer, have encouraged their supporters to become active members and organizers within Reform, seeking candidacy for various political positions. Reform UK has stated that these individuals are not welcome and a stringent vetting process is in place to prevent their influence. Collett believes Reform's success is shifting the boundaries of acceptable political discourse, while Clews claims sympathizers are already active within the party.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Walmart for blaming tariffs on increased prices, arguing that the company should absorb the costs instead of passing them on to consumers. Walmart had warned that prices on various goods could increase despite reduced tariffs on China. Trump stated that Walmart, which made billions last year, should "eat the tariffs" and not charge customers more, while a Walmart spokesperson responded that the company is committed to keeping prices as low as possible given retail margins. The president's remarks reflect the ongoing tension between his administration's trade policies and major American companies facing rising costs. </p>

          <p>A local government's promotion of a bridge as a prime spot for Mt. Fuji photos has backfired, leading to complaints from residents about illegal parking, noise, and trespassing. Despite efforts to manage the influx of tourists, the area known as "Mt. Fuji dream bridge" has become a nuisance for locals. Tourism experts criticize the government's response as insufficient, urging prioritization of residents' lives and the implementation of stricter measures. The situation highlights the growing challenges of overtourism in popular destinations and the need for sustainable solutions.</p>

          <p>The UK and EU are engaged in intense negotiations before their first bilateral summit since Brexit, focusing on security, trade, and defense. While both sides aim to strengthen cooperation amid global challenges, disagreements persist over issues like fishing rights and access to EU defense contracts. The summit is expected to yield a joint declaration on shared foreign policy priorities, a security and defense pact, and measures to reduce trade barriers. However, the extent of the economic reset remains limited by the UK's red lines against rejoining the customs union or single market.</p>

This is part of the latest Republican push in red states to promote ideologies sympathetic to Donald Trump. The revised curriculum standard comes at the behest of Ryan Walters, the state school superintendent, who has publicly voiced his support for Trump. The left has been pushing left-wing indoctrination in the classroom,” Walters said. “We’re moving it back to actually understanding history … and I’m unapologetic about that.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has settled litigation ending a ban on forced-reset triggers, devices that enable semiautomatic weapons to fire more rapidly. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the decision aligns with the belief that the Second Amendment is not a second-class right. Gun safety advocates have criticized the move, arguing it will allow firearms to be modified into virtual machine guns, increasing danger. Forced-reset triggers function similarly to bump stocks, which were banned under President Trump following a mass shooting in Las Vegas.</p>
