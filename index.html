          <p>A woman convicted of stowing away on a flight from New York to Paris has been sentenced to time served and one year of supervised release. The Russian citizen and U.S. permanent resident claimed she was forced to flee the United States because the military had poisoned her, a statement the judge acknowledged while emphasizing the danger of such actions. The judge imposed supervised release to ensure the woman receives mental health treatment. This incident was one of several stowaway attempts she made, leading to her eventual arrest and seven-month incarceration.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is set to become the largest shareholder in MP Materials, the owner of the only operational rare earth mine in the U.S., through a $400 million investment. This public-private partnership aims to expand domestic processing and magnet production, reducing U.S. reliance on China for critical minerals used in advanced military technology. Following the announcement, MP Materials' stock surged by approximately 50%. The deal includes building a new magnet facility and guarantees a minimum price for key rare earth oxides.</p>

          <p>Residents in rural Georgia are voicing concerns about the environmental consequences of the rapidly expanding data centre industry, which is drawn to the state for its resources. One homeowner near a Meta-owned facility in Mansfield believes its construction contaminated her well water, making it undrinkable, a claim the company disputes. Environmental groups also point to sediment runoff from data centre construction sites polluting local waterways. While tech companies highlight their investments in water stewardship, the incidents underscore the growing tension between the digital economy's infrastructure needs and local communities.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld the $5 million civil verdict against former President Donald Trump for the sexual abuse and defamation of writer E. Jean Carroll. The three-judge panel unanimously rejected Trump's appeal, stating he failed to demonstrate any judicial errors that would warrant a new trial. The original May 2023 verdict found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll in the 1990s and for defaming her when he denied the allegation in 2022. Trump is also appealing a separate, larger $83.3 million defamation verdict awarded to Carroll in a related case.</p>

          <p>American soccer defender Reggie Cannon has won his appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against his former Portuguese club, Boavista, over unpaid wages. The ruling overturns a previous FIFA decision and means the club owes Cannon approximately €400,000. Cannon terminated his contract with Boavista in June 2023 due to the payment dispute before signing with English club Queens Park Rangers. He expressed relief at the verdict, which vindicates his and QPR's position after a lengthy and mentally taxing legal battle.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and Palestinian activist, has filed a $20 million claim against the Trump administration, alleging he was falsely imprisoned and maliciously prosecuted. Khalil was detained by immigration authorities for over three months in connection with his prominent role in campus protests against the war in Gaza. His lawyers argue his detention was an unconstitutional effort to suppress his pro-Palestinian speech. Khalil, who was released last month and has not been charged with a crime, stated that any potential settlement money would be shared with others targeted for their activism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's proposal to impose a 50% tariff on imports from Brazil could significantly increase the cost of coffee for U.S. consumers. Brazil is the largest supplier of green coffee beans to the U.S., which relies heavily on imports to satisfy the nation's high demand. The potential tariff comes after years of already rising coffee prices due to global supply issues. Coffee companies would face higher commodity costs, which would likely be passed on to consumers, although the administration is reportedly considering exemptions for products like coffee.

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against California, seeking to nullify a state law that mandates cage-free conditions for egg-laying hens, pigs, and calves. The lawsuit claims that the voter-approved law, known as Proposition 12, violates federal regulations and has contributed to rising egg prices. California officials have vowed to defend the law, which was previously upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2023. Animal welfare advocates argue that overturning the law would disrupt the industry and harm farmers who have already invested millions to comply.</p>

          <p>Salvadoran journalist Mario Guevara remains detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) even after an immigration judge granted him a $7,500 bond last week.

His lawyer states that ICE has appealed the judge's bond decision, effectively blocking his release.

          <p>A San Francisco judge has ruled that former CNN anchor Don Lemon's lawsuit against Elon Musk and his social media company, X, can move forward to trial. Musk's legal team had attempted to have the case dismissed or moved to a different jurisdiction. Lemon sued for breach of contract after X abruptly canceled a partnership for a new show just hours after Lemon conducted a tense interview with Musk. The judge found that Lemon's legal team had plausibly alleged claims including fraud and the existence of an implied contract between the two parties.</p>
