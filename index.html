          <p>Cosmetics company E.l.f. Beauty is managing a recent decline in net income, partly due to tariffs, by focusing on long-term growth strategies. The company highlights its consistent sales growth over 26 consecutive quarters and its new $1 billion acquisition of Hailey Bieber's popular skincare brand, Rhode. This strategic move is expected to expand E.l.f.'s market presence, including entry into Sephora stores, despite the company taking on significant debt to finance the deal. Analysts are cautiously optimistic about the acquisition's potential to be highly accretive for the viral beauty brand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. consumer price index rose by 2.7% annually in July, holding steady from the previous month due to falling gasoline and grocery prices. However, economists point to concerning underlying trends, as the "core" inflation rate, which excludes food and energy, increased to its fastest pace since February. Many experts attribute this rise to the economic effects of the Trump administration's tariff and immigration policies, which are beginning to impact consumer goods prices and may become more pronounced later in the year.

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's decision to seize control of Washington D.C.'s municipal police and deploy the National Guard is a sheer exercise of power, not a response to an actual emergency. The author contends that crime rates in D.C. have significantly declined and that the pretext for the takeover is deliberately thin to demonstrate the administration's willingness to erode democratic norms. The move is framed as part of a broader pattern of challenging the legitimacy of Democratic-led cities and imposing federal will by force.</p>

          <p>Former Philadelphia judge Patrick Dugan has switched his party registration to Republican to challenge incumbent District Attorney Larry Krasner in the upcoming election. Dugan, who secured the Republican line through write-in votes, aims to run on a platform of addressing the city's crime rates, which he attributes to Krasner's policies. The move comes as President Trump heightens the national focus on urban crime by taking temporary control of the Washington, D.C. police force, a development Dugan's campaign anticipates Krasner will use against him.</p>

          <p>Following a temporary truce in the U.S.-China trade conflict, economists express skepticism about the likelihood of significant, long-term resolutions. While it is in the interest of both nations to prevent a re-escalation of tariffs, experts believe a comprehensive deal to resolve all outstanding issues remains difficult to achieve. The prevailing view is that negotiations will continue to be challenging, with future progress likely to involve a series of temporary extensions and adjustments rather than a definitive grand bargain between the economic superpowers.</p>

The milestone, reached after hundreds of arrivals on a single day, highlights the ongoing challenge for the government, which has pledged to stop the crossings. The situation is further underscored by a recent fatality, where a woman died attempting to board a boat, prompting criticism from opposition parties and humanitarian groups over the effectiveness and humanity of current border policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump has intensified his campaign against the Federal Reserve, threatening to allow a "major lawsuit" against Chairman Jerome Powell. The threat, posted on social media, focuses on the rising costs of renovating the Fed's headquarters, which Trump has frequently criticized. This move represents a dramatic escalation in the president's efforts to pressure Powell into immediately lowering interest rates, a demand the central bank has so far resisted throughout 2025, creating further tension between the White House and the independent institution.</p>

          <p>Amid a shifting interest rate environment, financial experts are advising savers on the differences between money market accounts and high-yield savings accounts. While both offer higher returns than traditional savings, money market accounts often provide check-writing and debit card access, sometimes with higher minimum balance requirements. High-yield savings accounts typically feature lower entry barriers and are recommended for building emergency funds or saving for short-term goals. The best choice ultimately depends on an individual's need for liquidity, their savings goals, and the specific rates and fees offered by financial institutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial experts are outlining several smart strategies for retirees who must take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from their retirement accounts but do not need the funds for immediate expenses. Options for the withdrawn money include reinvesting it in a tax-efficient brokerage account, often using exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for their lower tax implications. Another popular strategy for charitably inclined individuals is the qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which allows a direct, tax-free transfer to a nonprofit. For those focused on legacy planning, using the funds to contribute to a 529 college savings plan for family members is also a viable option. (not investment advice)</p>

This analysis argues that while direct government spending on the program will decrease, the financial burden will shift to other areas. Uninsured individuals will increasingly rely on federally qualified health centers and hospital emergency rooms for care, straining their already thin budgets. This leads to higher uncompensated care costs for hospitals, increased medical debt for individuals, and ultimately, negative impacts on the broader economy due to a less healthy workforce.</p>

Forecasters predict this large area of excessive heat will move eastward, bringing above-average temperatures across the country through the weekend.</p>

          <h2>General Testifies He Never Heard L.A. Protests Described as 'Rebellion' in Deployment Trial</h2>

          <p>During a trial over the legality of President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, a commanding general testified that he never heard the situation described as a "rebellion." The lawsuit, filed by California's governor, questions whether the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits domestic use of the military. The Trump administration justified the action under a law allowing troop deployment during a "rebellion." The general's testimony challenges this key justification as the court examines the military's role in responding to the protests.</p>

          <p>A former Maryland youth pastor, Thomas Pinkerton, has been arrested and charged with sexually abusing at least six teenagers between 2006 and 2010. The arrest warrant alleges that Pinkerton, known as Pastor Tommy, engaged in inappropriate touching and kissing at his church and home, telling the victims it was a normal religious practice. Pinkerton, who has since worked as a traveling evangelist, was extradited from Georgia and faces 24 felony and misdemeanor counts. Detectives believe there may be more victims and are asking anyone with information to come forward.</p>

This marks the end of a 16-year trading history for the firm, which became a symbol of China's property boom before its default in 2021 sent shockwaves through global financial markets and triggered a severe housing downturn in the country.

          <p>A US-brokered peace declaration between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which includes plans for a transit corridor dubbed the "Trump Route," has elicited a mixed reaction from neighboring Iran. The new route, connecting Azerbaijan to its exclave of Nakhchivan through Armenian territory, would offer a more direct trade link to Europe, potentially diminishing Iran's regional influence. While some hardline Iranian officials have vowed to block the corridor, President Masoud Pezeshkian has struck a more moderate tone, suggesting the plan considers Iranian interests and will not cut off its access to Armenia.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is expected to strengthen, potentially becoming the first hurricane of the Atlantic season later this week. The storm, currently located west of the Cabo Verde islands, is moving westward, and early models project it could become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, there is still uncertainty regarding its long-term path.

          <p>As President Trump prepares for a one-on-one summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, foreign policy experts and Ukrainian officials are warning that the meeting could be a strategic trap. This analysis suggests Putin, facing military setbacks and economic strain, aims to manipulate Trump's desire for a peace deal to secure concessions favorable to Russia, such as retaining conquered Ukrainian territory. Critics fear that a desperate Trump might agree to a one-sided deal, which, if rejected by Ukraine, could lead him to turn against Kyiv and undermine its ability to continue the war.</p>

Musk claims Apple is making it impossible for any AI company besides its partner, OpenAI, to achieve the top ranking, specifically citing his own Grok AI chatbot. This threat is the latest development in Musk's ongoing feud with OpenAI, a company he co-founded, and adds to the antitrust pressure Apple already faces, including a landmark lawsuit from the Department of Justice over its iPhone ecosystem.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent actions, including imposing steep tariffs on India and using incendiary rhetoric, are straining relations with key Asian partners and risk weakening the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad). The alliance, which includes the U.S., India, Japan, and Australia, is seen as a crucial counterweight to China's influence in the Indo-Pacific. However, Trump's confrontational approach, driven more by domestic politics than coherent strategy, has plunged U.S.-India relations to their lowest point in decades and created an opportunity for Beijing to exploit the divisions within the fragile coalition.</p>

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump will cause 2.4 million people to lose their food stamp benefits, according to a forecast by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. The cuts are the result of expanded work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which now apply to parents of older children, adults aged 55-64, and other groups. The CBO report indicates that while the bill will increase overall resources for middle and upper-income households, it will decrease them for households at the bottom of the income distribution.</p>
