          <p>A U.S. Marine, Lance Cpl. Jamel Clayton, was found guilty by a Japanese court of sexually assaulting a woman in Okinawa and sentenced to seven years in prison. The case sparked anger and safety concerns on the island, which hosts a large American troop presence. Judge Kazuhiko Obata deemed the victim's testimony highly credible, despite the defendant's denial of the charges. The Marine Corps spokesperson stated that Clayton's behavior does not reflect their values and confirmed that the U.S. cooperated fully with the investigation. The case highlighted ongoing frustrations in Okinawa regarding the U.S. military presence and calls for revisions to the Status of Forces Agreement. The Japanese government also revealed that prosecutors dropped cases against over 300 U.S. service members in the last decade, including a sexual assault case in Okinawa in 2020.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump stated that "great progress" is being made in negotiations to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. He also commented on recent U.S. air strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, claiming they caused "total obliteration" and set back Iran's nuclear ambitions by "decades." These remarks followed a CNN report suggesting the strikes failed to completely destroy Iran's underground facilities or eliminate its centrifuges and enriched uranium stockpile. Trump dismissed these reports as "fake news," asserting that the strikes would aid in the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza.</p>

          <p>NATO leaders are convening to release a joint statement on a proposed increase in collective defense spending, aiming to raise expenditure from 2% to 5% of each member nation's GDP by 2035. Despite general agreement, some members, like Spain and Belgium, are hesitant and seeking flexibility regarding the timeline and spending levels. President Trump has questioned NATO's collective defense tenet, emphasizing the need for allies to increase their defense contributions. Secretary General Mark Rutte reassured allies of the U.S.' commitment but stressed the expectation that European and Canadian members address the issue of insufficient spending. Some leaders expressed confidence in achieving unity, while others acknowledged potential challenges in reaching a consensus on the ambitious spending target.</p>

          <p>This commentary explores the propriety of age-gap relationships, drawing lessons from the relationships of famous men. The article starts with the controversy surrounding the relationship between Anna Camp, 42, and Jade Whipkey, 24, and goes on to address other relationships. The author notes problematic relationships with significant age gaps, such as Jerry Seinfeld's past relationship with a 17-year-old and Elon Musk's father's relationship with his former stepdaughter. The article concludes that while age gap relationships between consenting adults are generally acceptable, there are red flags to watch out for, especially when there is a large power imbalance.</p>

          <p>A newlywed man, Jake Rosencranz, died after being struck by lightning on a Florida beach during his honeymoon. The incident was considered unusual because the sky was clear and the storm was several miles away. Rosencranz's death is a grim reminder of Florida's high rate of lightning fatalities and strikes. Emergency responders attempted CPR and transported him to a hospital, but he passed away the following day. The article also notes that two golfers were indirectly struck by lightning on the same day, and advises people to seek shelter indoors when thunder is heard.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that nearly one in five food and beverage products in the U.S. contains synthetic dyes, with a significant portion found in products marketed to children. The study also found that products using synthetic dyes were significantly more likely to be high in added sugars and low in nutritional quality. Concerns are mounting over the potential neurological and behavioral effects of these additives, particularly in children. While some steps have been taken to ban or label synthetic dyes, consumers are still largely responsible for scrutinizing ingredient lists and marketing claims.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers, initially hesitant to engage in political issues, have committed $1 million to aid families affected by immigration raids in Southern California. The decision came after growing public outcry over the Trump administration's immigration policies and their impact on the Latino community. While the team's gesture was seen by some as insufficient and belated, it reflects the increasing pressure on sports organizations to address social and political issues. The Dodgers' response highlights the challenge of balancing business interests with community values in a highly polarized environment. The team's president expressed the organization's commitment to support and uplift the communities of Greater Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities has reduced the likelihood of restarting denuclearization talks with North Korea, according to analysts. North Korea may view a working nuclear deterrent as the only guarantor of security, making them less inclined to negotiate. Despite Trump's earlier optimism and attempts to engage with Kim Jong Un, the attack on Iran has reinforced North Korea's determination to maintain its nuclear program. The attack may also lead to increased military cooperation between North Korea and Iran. Some experts believe that North Korea may be willing to negotiate a freeze of its nuclear program, but not a rollback, which Trump may view as a retreat.</p>

          <p>C-SPAN, the non-profit organization providing live congressional coverage, faces financial challenges as cable TV subscriptions decline and consumers shift to streaming platforms. The service, funded by cable and satellite operators, has experienced a significant revenue loss, leading to a deficit. C-SPAN is seeking support from streaming services like YouTube TV and Hulu Live TV to carry its feeds and fill the budget gap. While YouTube offers some C-SPAN content for free, C-SPAN CEO Sam Feist emphasizes the value of its neutral approach in a partisan media landscape. President Trump has also expressed support for C-SPAN, praising its comprehensive coverage of political events.</p>

          <p>A tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Iran has slightly reduced the immediate threat of U.S. involvement in a larger conflict, but concerns remain about the potential for increased domestic authoritarianism. Experts warn that emergencies, whether real or exaggerated, can be exploited to accumulate power and erode civil rights. The situation is particularly relevant in California, where the Trump administration's immigration policies intersect with international tensions. The deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, despite local opposition, highlights these concerns, with experts cautioning against the invocation of the Insurrection Act and the potential targeting of Iranian American communities. The article urges vigilance and engagement to protect civil rights amidst these challenges.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Board of Education approved an $18.8-billion budget that delays layoffs for a year by reducing contributions to a retiree health benefits trust fund. The revised budget shifts $645 million over three years from retiree health benefits to potentially fund employee wage increases. Employee unions had criticized the original proposal to increase trust contributions, calling it a manufactured crisis. The budget also limits cuts to staffing at schools, but revenue is nearly $3 billion less than planned spending, requiring the district to draw down reserves. The district must also approve a fiscal stabilization plan to address a structural deficit.</p>

          <p>UC Berkeley law professors Erwin Chemerinsky and Claudia Polsky successfully fought against the Trump administration's cuts to research funding for UC arts, science, and medical researchers. A federal judge ordered the restoration of millions in UC grants and approved a class-action suit, opening it to UC researchers statewide. The judge found the government engaged in "quintessential viewpoint discrimination" by rescinding funding based on diversity-related keywords or generic agency letters. The lawsuit is one of many filed against the Trump administration over grant terminations, but this one came directly from researchers. The court's decision requires the government to restore grants discontinued after Trump's inauguration if projects were flagged over diversity-related topics.</p>

          <p>Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) has discontinued its Center for Transyouth Health and Development, citing increasing pressure from the Trump administration and potential repercussions. The decision, made without any new medical breakthroughs or court orders, affects approximately 2,500 patients. The hospital faced threats of severe repercussions, including scrutiny of financial records, if it continued to provide care for transgender youth. This move has been criticized as caving to blackmail and endorsing bigotry, raising concerns about the future of care for other marginalized groups.

          <p>The number of gray whales migrating along the California coast has continued to decrease, reaching levels not seen since the 1970s, with the population now estimated at fewer than 13,000.

This year, researchers observed very few calf births and increased whale deaths in the Baja California Peninsula wintering lagoons. Additionally, a record low number of calves were counted migrating north, and an unusually high number of whale deaths have been recorded along the U.S. Pacific coast, raising concerns about the species' ability to rebound.</p>

          <p>An initial classified assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) found that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months. The assessment indicates that the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities were sealed off, and the resumption of the enrichment program depends on the time it takes to clear the entrances and make repairs. However, some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was reportedly moved before the strikes. The White House disputes these findings, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt calling the assessment "flat-out wrong."

The payment triggered investigations into claims of vote-buying to secure Germany's bid to host the tournament. The DFB was previously ordered to pay over â‚¬20 million in back taxes related to 2006.

          <p>IVF patients are being warned about unregulated "concierge clinics" after Apricity Fertility, a popular online firm, went bust, leaving clients without treatment or refunds. These clinics act as middlemen between patients, donors, and doctors, but are not regulated by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). Syreeta Sandhu lost nearly Â£15,000 when Apricity ceased operations, and other patients have also been affected. The HFEA is calling for the law to be strengthened to protect patients using these services, and advises patients to research clinics and be cautious about paying upfront for multi-cycle packages. Those responsibilities mean that if an HFEA-licensed clinic closes, it has to give patients information and ensure they are supported. The clinic must also ensure all eggs, sperm and embryos that are in storage are kept safe.</p>
