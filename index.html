Johnson stressed the importance of the timeline for this "historic" bill and stated that the budget committee will reconvene to get it through committee, moving it to the rules committee by midweek and the House floor by the end of the week. The bill faces resistance from some Republicans concerned about Medicaid requirements and spending, as well as potential challenges in the Senate.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio disagrees with the intelligence community's assessment that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua is not a proxy force of NicolÃ¡s Maduro's government. Rubio argues that the gang is exported by the Venezuelan regime and has been operationalized to target opposition members in other countries. This disagreement is central to the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport suspected gang members. The Supreme Court is currently blocking the administration from deporting Venezuelan men detained in Texas under this act, pending legal challenges.</p>

The Jordan Brand, now a standalone division within Nike, generates approximately $7 billion annually.
