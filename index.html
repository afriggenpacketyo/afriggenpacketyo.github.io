          <p>The Food and Drug Administration plans to implement artificial intelligence in its drug approval processes to significantly increase efficiency, particularly in light of a Trump-driven reduction of nearly 2,000 employees.

This move reflects a broader trend of leveraging technology to streamline operations and maintain productivity amidst resource constraints. The FDA hopes that AI can help them maintain the quality of their work while still managing the demands of the industry. The adoption of AI is expected to lead to faster approvals and more efficient resource allocation. The future of the FDA's drug approval process could become more efficient and effective. </p>

          <p>Despite market volatility during President Trump's second term, investors' portfolio balances remain relatively stable, with the S&P 500 showing a positive annualized return of 1.58%. The market experienced several significant drops, but experts advise investors to remain calm during turbulent times, emphasizing that volatility does not predict direction. Other presidential terms, like those of Joe Biden and Barack Obama, saw larger returns in their early months, but Trump's second term outperformed George W. Bush's initial period. Investors are generally encouraged to maintain their market positions over the long term, navigating through different presidencies and economic cycles. Despite the market swings, long-term investment strategies have historically yielded positive results. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has warned that any protesters at the military parade in Washington, D.C., honoring the Army's 250th anniversary, will be met with "heavy force." The parade, coinciding with Trump's 79th birthday, will feature a large display of military vehicles and aircraft, with the President emphasizing the need to celebrate the U.S. military's victories in past wars. While the U.S. Secret Service is monitoring nine small planned protests, they do not anticipate violence. The National Guard will be activated but not armed, and progressive groups are planning additional protests against the Trump administration outside of Washington. Trump has characterized the protesters as people who hate the country, justifying the use of significant force. </p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles in response to immigration-enforcement protests is estimated to cost $134 million, according to a Pentagon official. Acting Pentagon Comptroller Bryn Woollacott MacDonnell stated that the estimate primarily covers housing, travel, and food expenses for the troops. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the deployment as necessary to ensure the safety of American citizens and the ability of ICE agents to perform their duties. The deployment, comprising 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines, is funded through the military's Operation & Maintenance accounts and is expected to last 60 days.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists warn that emperor penguin populations in Antarctica are declining faster than previously projected, with satellite images from 2009 to 2024 indicating a 22% decline in key regions. This decline, affecting 16 colonies representing a third of the global population, is attributed to climate change, which is thinning and destabilizing the ice used for breeding. Researchers are concerned about the speed of the declines, with some colonies experiencing complete chick loss due to ice collapse. The study suggests that penguin numbers have been falling since 2009, even before the major impacts of global warming on sea ice. While further research is needed, the findings highlight the urgent need to reduce planet-heating emissions to save the emperor penguin. </p>

The official Communist Party paper, People's Daily, warned that "disorderly 'price wars' squeeze profits across the chain." The head of Great Wall Motor drew parallels to China's struggling property sector and Evergrande, suggesting an "Evergrande-like" crisis could erupt in the automotive industry.

While high-yield savings accounts offer variable rates, short-term CDs provide guaranteed returns, making them attractive for savers seeking stability. However, high-yield savings accounts offer more flexibility, allowing access to funds without early withdrawal penalties.

          <p>South Africa is experiencing severe weather conditions, including heavy snow, rains, and gale-force winds, leading to multiple fatalities and widespread disruptions. A minibus carrying schoolchildren was swept away by floodwaters, and five people died in a road accident caused by a fallen tree. Nearly 500,000 homes are without electricity due to the extreme weather. Major roads have been closed in affected provinces to prevent further casualties. The severe weather underscores the impact of climate change, with heavier rainfall and flooding becoming more frequent in the region. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 13:30:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nottingham Forest has formally written to UEFA to express concerns over Crystal Palace's qualification for the Europa League, citing potential breaches of multi-club ownership rules. The issue centers on John Textor, who owns a 43% stake in Crystal Palace and a 77% stake in Lyon, both of whom have qualified for the competition. UEFA rules prevent any individual or entity from holding a majority of shareholder voting rights at two clubs in the same European tournament. If UEFA rules against Palace and Lyon, Lyon would get priority, potentially opening a Europa League spot for Forest. UEFA regulations aim to prevent collusion between clubs. </p>

An analysis by the Global Business Alliance estimates that the provision could cost the U.S. 360,000 jobs and $55 billion annually in lost GDP.

Christianity also grew but declined as a proportion of the global population. The religiously unaffiliated are now the third-largest group, particularly in Europe and North America, where many people raised Christian no longer identify with any religion.

          <p>The article examines how Adolf Hitler manufactured public security crises to advance his authoritarian agenda. He undermined constitutional protections for the Weimar Republic's states, imposing his will on the country. Hitler used the Reichstag fire to suspend civil liberties and suppress political opposition. Bavaria's minister president, Heinrich Held, recognized the threat to states' rights and attempted to resist Hitler's centralization efforts. Ultimately, Hitler's storm troopers seized control of Bavaria, forcing Held into exile and consolidating power. </p>
