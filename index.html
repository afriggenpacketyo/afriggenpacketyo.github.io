        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 4.1 magnitude earthquake shook parts of Tennessee, Georgia, and North Carolina on Saturday morning, with the epicenter located near Greenback, Tennessee. Residents in Atlanta and western North Carolina reported feeling tremors, and the USGS received over 23,000 reports from the public within the first hour. While there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries, the event served as a reminder of earthquake preparedness in a region more accustomed to tornadoes and floods. The Eastern Tennessee seismic zone is known to be one of the most active in the Southeast, with a 5% chance of a magnitude 4 or larger aftershock in the next week.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan initially agreed to a ceasefire on Saturday following escalating tensions, including recent missile strikes and militant attacks. President Trump announced the agreement, attributing it to U.S.-brokered talks, though Indian officials stated the deal was worked out directly between the two countries. However, the ceasefire was short-lived, with explosions reported in Indian-controlled Kashmir, as fighting resumed in Srinagar. Despite the renewed violence, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked Trump for his role in facilitating the initial agreement, emphasizing the importance of regional peace and stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an excerpt from his new memoir, "Who Knew," media executive Barry Diller discusses the importance of instinct over data in creative and business decisions. Diller emphasizes that while data can provide insights into past events, it cannot predict future success, and over-reliance on data can hinder innovative thinking. He recounts his experiences at ABC, where he championed the "Movie of the Week" and trusted his gut to identify compelling projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker." Diller argues that too much information can obscure the essence of a good idea, which should be evaluated based on its inherent merit and common sense.</p>

          <p>At least seven people have died in Mogadishu, Somalia, after heavy rains overwhelmed the city's drainage system, leading to widespread flooding. The rains, which lasted for approximately eight hours, caused houses to collapse and major roads to be cut off, trapping residents and disrupting public transport. Floodwaters also temporarily halted operations at Aden Abdulle International Airport, though flights have since resumed. The Somali Disaster Management Agency is assessing the extent of the damage, and the energy and water ministry has warned of potential flash floods in other regions.</p>

          <p>Google has agreed to pay nearly $1.4 billion to the state of Texas to settle allegations of violating residents' data privacy rights. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Google in 2022, accusing the company of unlawfully tracking and collecting users' private data. While Google did not admit any wrongdoing, the settlement resolves claims related to the Chrome browser's incognito setting, location history disclosures on Google Maps, and biometric data use in Google Photos. Google stated that it has already implemented policy changes related to these allegations and will continue to build robust privacy controls into its services.</p>

          <p>Charles Barkley has voiced strong disapproval of the NCAA's management of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals and the transfer portal, calling the organization "a bunch of idiots and fools." Barkley expressed concerns about the large sums of money being paid to college athletes and the frequency with which players can switch schools, stating it's unlike anything seen in the NBA. While he supports players getting paid, he questions the return on investment for schools offering multi-million dollar NIL deals, especially with players potentially staying for only one year. Barkley stated that he would rather donate his money to HBCUs and rebuild houses in his hometown of Birmingham.</p>

She ran a Ponzi scheme, using money from new investors to pay off earlier ones and funding a lavish lifestyle.

          <p>Climate change is altering the migration patterns of birds, impacting their ability to feed and breed successfully. Rising sea levels are affecting coastal stopover locations, while ocean acidification is reducing the availability of small crustaceans, a key food source for migratory birds. Extreme weather events are also posing a threat, and warmer temperatures are causing some birds to shorten their routes or abandon migration altogether. The article suggests supporting migratory birds by expanding protected areas and creating bird-friendly environments, such as reducing pollution and avoiding glass buildings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that traditional seasonal market indicators, such as "sell in May and go away," may be unreliable this year due to ongoing market volatility and policy uncertainty. Factors like trade wars, tax policies, and debt ceiling risks are skewing seasonal norms, making it difficult to predict market performance. While May typically sees gains in post-election years, current conditions make it hard to anticipate market trends. Experts advise investors to focus on broader economic and policy developments rather than relying solely on seasonal patterns.</p>

          <p>Stephen Miran, chair of President Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, defended the administration's trade policies, asserting that volatility in financial markets and economic data does not necessarily indicate long-term negative consequences. Miran emphasized that the president's actions have put American workers on fairer ground and that the administration is focused on creating a dynamic and healthy economy. He acknowledged potential disruptions but expressed confidence that American consumers are flexible and that the U.S. can source production from friendlier countries. Miran dismissed concerns about intellectual integrity, stating that the administration is focused on creating a robust economic boom for Americans.</p>

          <p>Billy Evans, the partner of convicted Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, is seeking funding for a new blood-testing startup called Haemanthus. The company, which aims to test pets before moving to human diagnostics, has drawn comparisons to Theranos due to its similar goals and the physical resemblance of its prototype device to Theranos's infamous machine. While Haemanthus claims to have no regulatory oversight from the USDA for its initial pet testing phase, the USDA stated that it does regulate vet diagnostics.

          <p>The Channel Islands, often called "California's Galapagos," are home to a rich underwater ecosystem that thrives due to marine protected areas (MPAs). These MPAs have fostered a diverse marine life, attracting researchers and divers from around the world. However, the California Fish and Game Commission is reviewing these MPAs, considering proposals to either expand or reduce protections, and the political tides are turning against conservation objectives. Despite the proven benefits of preservation, including increased biodiversity and benefits to the fishing industry, challenges remain in balancing conservation with commercial interests and addressing threats from climate change.</p>

          <p>Financial experts discuss the importance of owning stocks at any age, even in retirement, while tailoring a strategy to one's personal risk tolerance and liquidity needs. The article also defines "risk on" and "risk off" environments, describing how investor sentiment shifts between optimism and fear, impacting asset allocation. In a risk-off environment, investors tend to move away from riskier assets like tech stocks and into safer havens like cash, bonds, and defensive sectors. However, experts caution against making investment decisions purely based on risk-on or risk-off mindsets, emphasizing the importance of focusing on best-of-breed companies with solid long-term growth.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has surpassed $100,000 for the first time since February, driven in part by the rise of new crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

He cautions against leveraged and inverse bitcoin ETFs, suggesting they may not be suitable for retail investors. Edelman emphasizes that crypto is meant to be a long-term investment, similar to the stock market, and can serve as a diversification tool for portfolios.</p>
