          <p>The Israeli military has launched airstrikes targeting Yemen's main airport in Sanaa, which is controlled by the Houthis, claiming to have fully disabled it. This action follows a Houthi missile strike near Israel's main airport, prompting a response that included targeting civilian planes, the departures hall, the runway, and a military air base. The IDF alleges the Houthis were using the airport to transfer weapons and operatives, while also striking power stations and a cement factory in Sanaa, citing them as significant infrastructure for the Houthis. This escalation highlights the ongoing conflict and heightened tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>Senator Thom Tillis has announced his opposition to President Trump's nomination of Ed Martin for U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, citing Martin's support for criminal defendants in the January 6th Capitol riot cases. Tillis believes that anyone who breached the perimeter on January 6th should face imprisonment, a stance conflicting with Martin's views on the prosecutions. With Tillis's opposition, Martin's nomination faces significant hurdles in the Senate Judiciary Committee, potentially leading to a tie vote that would prevent the nomination from advancing. Tillis indicated that he would likely support Martin for a U.S. Attorney position in any district other than the one where the January 6th events occurred.</p>

          <p>Palantir shares experienced a significant drop of 12% despite the company exceeding revenue expectations and raising its full-year revenue guidance. Analysts expressed concern over a modest full-year revenue guidance increase, a sequential margin decline, and a year-over-year decline in international commercial revenue. While Palantir reported adjusted earnings of 13 cents per share on $884 million in revenues, a 39% increase from the previous year, the company's high software multiple makes it vulnerable as revenue growth slows. CEO Alex Karp remains optimistic, citing the company's 20 years of investment and a cultural shift in the U.S. as driving factors.</p>

          <p>Hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones anticipates the stock market will decline to new lows, even if President Trump reduces tariffs on China. Jones cites Trump's focus on tariffs and the Federal Reserve's reluctance to cut rates as factors detrimental to the stock market. He suggests that even with a tariff reduction, the economic impact would still resemble the largest tax increases since the 1960s, potentially reducing growth by 2% to 3%. Jones believes stocks have not yet bottomed out due to deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and expects the Fed to eventually move in response to the market's decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The federal government has resumed collecting on defaulted student loans, ending a five-year pause initiated during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Department of Education warns that borrowers who fail to pay on time could face damaged credit scores, wage garnishment, and seizure of tax refunds. Over one in five borrowers are at risk of defaulting on their loans, marking a significant increase from pre-pandemic levels. The Trump administration has criticized student loan forgiveness policies and implemented measures that limit access to loan forgiveness programs and repayment options, causing confusion among borrowers.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have reached a trade agreement after three years of negotiations, aimed at facilitating exports for UK firms and reducing taxes on Indian exports. The deal, described as a 'landmark' by Prime Minister Starmer, is projected to boost trade by Â£25.5 billion annually by 2040, and does not include any changes to immigration policy. Key benefits for UK consumers include lower tariffs on clothing, footwear, and food from India, while UK exports such as gin, whisky, and medical devices will see reduced levies. Indian Prime Minister Modi hailed the deal as an 'ambitious and mutually beneficial' milestone that will promote trade, investment, and job creation.</p>

          <p>Proposed budget cuts by the Trump administration could slash NASA's funding by 24%, potentially impacting major science projects and international collaborations, including the Artemis moon program. The cuts signal a shift in priorities from the moon to Mars, with a proposed $1 billion increase for Mars-focused programs. ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher has expressed concern over the potential repercussions of the changes and emphasized the importance of cooperation in space activities. The proposed budget would also phase out NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) program and Orion Spacecraft crew capsule.</p>

          <p>The Taiwan dollar experienced a pullback after a notable surge that led to multi-decade gains, driven by speculation about pressure from Washington to strengthen the local currency. Despite the recent weakness, the Taiwanese dollar remains up over 8% against the U.S. dollar this year. Experts attribute the currency's volatility to exporters converting U.S. dollar reserves and life insurers hedging their U.S. dollar debt holdings. While officials deny exchange rates were part of U.S. trade negotiations, analysts remain skeptical and suggest that currency realignment may be underway.</p>

          <p>The FBI has launched over 250 investigations into a violent online network known as '764' that preys on teenagers, coercing them into engaging in sexual assault and violent acts. Victims, some as young as nine, are pressured to create graphic pornography, harm pets, and self-mutilate, with the content shared among 764 followers. The FBI's Counterterrorism Division is treating 764 and similar networks as potential forms of domestic terrorism, coining the term 'nihilistic violent extremists' to describe the most heinous actors. Authorities have arrested at least 15 people on child pornography or weapons-related charges, accusing them of being associated with 764.</p>

          <p>American homeowners are increasingly utilizing HELOCs, but the risk of missing payments can lead to severe consequences. Missing payments can result in late fees, damaged credit scores, and ultimately, foreclosure. Cross-collateralization can further complicate matters, putting other financial agreements at risk. Experts advise contacting lenders immediately to explore options such as deferred payments, modified payments, or forbearance. It is crucial to understand the risks associated with HELOCs and take proactive steps to manage payments effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

The research indicates that individuals who received the vaccine experienced a 23% reduction in cardiovascular events, such as stroke and heart failure, for up to eight years. The protective effect was particularly pronounced in men, people under 60, and those with unhealthy lifestyle habits. While the study primarily focused on a live zoster vaccine, experts believe that the newer, non-live vaccine may also offer similar cardiovascular benefits.</p>
