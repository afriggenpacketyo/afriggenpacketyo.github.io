            <p>A report from the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China expresses concern that foreign firms are at risk of being marginalized as China pursues technological independence through its “Made in China 2025” initiative. While foreign companies are initially seen as valuable for their advanced technology, the report warns that once Chinese companies catch up, foreign firms may face market access restrictions and loss of market share. The chamber recommends that China focus on opening up and attracting foreign investment with clear metrics and accountability practices to avoid isolation and damage to its economy and global standing. The report underscores the growing unease among European businesses operating in China.</p>

            <p>A group of Pacific Palisades and Malibu residents, all over 70, are suing the city of Los Angeles and the Department of Water and Power (DWP), alleging negligence in preventing and containing a massive wildfire that destroyed their homes. The lawsuit claims that the city failed to ensure reservoirs were filled and fire hydrants were operational prior to the fire, which resulted in low water pressure when the fire spread. Plaintiffs include a Holocaust survivor and a former Navy pilot, who lost their homes and possessions in the blaze. The DWP declined to comment, and the plaintiffs are seeking compensation for property loss.</p>

            <p>A federal judge is evaluating whether Trump administration officials are in contempt of court for failing to secure the return of Kilmar Ábrego García, a refugee wrongly deported to El Salvador.

            <p>Wildlife rehabilitation centers in Southern California are overwhelmed with sick and starving brown pelicans, likely due to a toxic algae bloom. Hundreds of seabirds have been poisoned by domoic acid, a neurotoxin produced by the bloom, while an influx of malnourished baby pelicans are struggling to survive due to the illness or death of their parents. Officials believe runoff from the Los Angeles firestorm may have contributed to the bloom's severity, and climate change may also play a role. Rescue centers are working to care for the birds, but many have died.</p>

The US government indicated the license requirement addresses the risk that the covered products may be used in a supercomputer in China.

            <p>A study indicates that the popularity of disposable e-cigarettes or vapes has fallen in the UK ahead of a ban on their sale scheduled for June 1, 2025. Researchers believe vape users are switching to refillable and rechargeable vapes in anticipation of the ban. The percentage of people aged 16-24 who mainly use disposable vapes has dropped significantly in the last year. Overall vaping use stalled between January 2024 and 2025 in all adults over 16, after several years of significant growth.</p>

            <p>Amid trade tensions, the US faces challenges in competing with Asia in chip manufacturing, despite efforts to re-shore production. Experts cite a lack of skilled workers, high costs, and complex manufacturing processes as hurdles. While the US Chips and Science Act aims to incentivize domestic manufacturing, companies like TSMC and Samsung face challenges in their US investments. China's advancements and potential for innovation pose further competition, emphasizing the need for collaboration and long-term investment in the global chip industry.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is justifying the deportation of a Columbia University student, Mohsen Mahdawi, by claiming his activism could "undermine" the Middle East peace process. A memo from the secretary of state asserts that Mahdawi's pro-Palestinian protests threatened the US goal to "peacefully" resolve conflict in Israel and Gaza. Mahdawi was apprehended at an immigration services center while attempting to finalize his citizenship process. The justification is based on a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) allowing deportation of non-citizens.</p>

            <p>The Elsinore fault zone, one of the largest in Southern California, is capable of generating a magnitude 7.8 earthquake, posing a significant risk to the region. While relatively quiet in historical times, the fault's potential for devastation is high, particularly if it ruptures onto the Whittier fault, directing energy into the L.A. Basin. Experts emphasize the need for awareness and preparedness, as many communities lack adequate retrofitting plans for vulnerable buildings. The recent magnitude 5.2 temblor near Julian serves as a reminder of the fault's power.</p>

            <p>Nvidia anticipates a $5.5 billion charge related to export restrictions on its H20 graphics processing units to China and other destinations, following a U.S. government decision requiring licenses for such exports. This development highlights the impact of increased export restrictions on Nvidia's growth, driven by concerns about the use of these chips in military supercomputers. China is Nvidia's fourth-largest region by sales, and the company faces growing competition from Chinese firms like Huawei. The U.S. government told Nvidia that the license requirement for H20 chips would be in effect "for the indefinite future."</p>

This change expands access for other media outlets but reduces the wire services' ability to provide news to smaller newspapers, radio, and television stations. The decision follows a court order to restore Oval Office access to the Associated Press, which was excluded after refusing to comply with the president’s Gulf of Mexico name change.

Trump made the comments during a meeting with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, suggesting they should build more prisons to hold the "homegrowns." Legal experts argue that such a scenario would be unconstitutional, violating the rights of citizenship and potentially the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.
