          <p>The United States has revoked the visas of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and approximately 80 other officials, preventing them from attending the upcoming UN General Assembly. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio cited actions to undermine peace efforts and the pursuit of unilateral statehood recognition as reasons for the decision. This move, welcomed by Israel, raises questions about its compliance with the UN Headquarters Agreement, which generally requires the U.S. to facilitate travel for officials visiting the UN. The Palestinian Authority has condemned the action as a violation of international law.</p>

          <p>Violent protests in Makassar, Indonesia, have resulted in at least three deaths after demonstrators set a local council building on fire. The unrest was triggered by the death of a motorcycle taxi driver who was run over by a police vehicle. In response to the escalating anger, protesters torched vehicles and used Molotov cocktails, leading to the fatal blaze that trapped a civil servant and two council staff members inside. President Prabowo Subianto has promised a thorough investigation into the driver's death and urged for calm amid the growing crisis.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has fired a Department of Justice paralegal, Elizabeth Baxter, for making an obscene gesture and cursing at National Guard members in Washington, D.C. According to reports, Baxter boasted about her actions and was later seen on security footage repeating the gesture and shouting expletives. In a termination letter, Bondi stated that employees who disrespect law enforcement will no longer work at the DOJ, reinforcing the department's commitment to President Trump's agenda. This follows the recent dismissal of another DOJ paralegal for similar misconduct involving a federal officer.</p>

The Packers signed Parsons to a four-year, $188 million contract, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. In exchange, the Cowboys received two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark. Parsons expressed excitement about joining the historic franchise and aims to build a legacy similar to Packers legends like Reggie White, seeing the move as a fresh start after what he described as the "hardest four months" of his life.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Reveals Tactical Flaws in Ruben Amorim's System at Manchester United</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 02:10:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A tactical analysis of Manchester United under manager Ruben Amorim suggests his rigid 5-2-3 positional system is struggling to produce results, highlighted by a recent loss to Grimsby Town. The article details how Amorim's strategy, which relies on creating numerical overloads through specific passing patterns, is often nullified by opponents using man-to-man marking. The system's lack of encouragement for individual dribbling or player roaming makes United's attacks predictable. Defensively, the team's two-person midfield is frequently outnumbered, allowing opponents to control the game once the initial press is bypassed.</p>

          <p>North Korea has significantly increased its importation of Chinese wine, with volume more than doubling in the first seven months of 2025 compared to the previous year. According to customs data, the isolated nation purchased over 157,000 liters, making it the second-largest market for Chinese bottled wine by volume. This trend continues from previous years, as China does not restrict wine sales to its ally. Although the United Nations has banned luxury goods from entering North Korea since 2006, alcohol is not included on the prohibited items list.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has implemented new regulations allowing men between the ages of 18 and 22 to leave the country, a change from the previous ban on men aged 18-60.

Previously, many young men left before turning 18 to avoid potential conscription, as the draft age starts at 25. While officials hope this will encourage stronger ties with Ukraine, some experts fear it will accelerate brain drain.</p>

          <p>A 10-mile stretch of the Angeles Crest Highway has reopened just before Labor Day weekend after being closed for years due to extensive damage. The scenic route suffered from slope failures and rock slides caused by severe winter storms, with further damage from the 2024 Bridge fire. The $7.9 million repair project included installing new guardrails, retaining walls, and drainage systems. The reopening provides access to popular hiking trails and is expected to reduce overcrowding at other trailheads in the Angeles National Forest, restoring a beloved local landmark.</p>

          <p>Essex Police arrested three men on suspicion of violent disorder, assaulting an officer, and drink-driving during a protest in Epping. The demonstration took place outside The Bell Hotel after a Court of Appeal decision overturned an injunction, allowing 138 asylum seekers to continue being housed there. The ruling was a setback for the local council, which had sought to block the hotel's use for this purpose. The situation in Epping has been tense for months, particularly after an asylum seeker was charged with sexual assault, an accusation he denies.</p>
