        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation found that the fatal 2023 implosion of the Titan submersible was preventable, attributing the incident to significant safety failures by its owner, OceanGate. The report details how the company used "intimidation tactics" to evade regulatory scrutiny and operated with a "toxic" safety culture, ignoring critical warnings about hull damage. Investigators concluded that had CEO Stockton Rush survived, they would have recommended criminal negligence charges for his role in the deaths of the four other individuals aboard the vessel.</p>

          <p>The FBI released its annual Unified Crime Report, indicating a decrease across every major crime category in 2024, including violent and property crimes. The murder rate dropped for the second consecutive year, and motor vehicle thefts saw a record one-year decline, though aggravated assaults remain stubbornly high. While the overall trend is positive, the report notes that a violent crime still occurred approximately every 26 seconds, and hate crimes, particularly antisemitic incidents, remain a significant concern for law enforcement.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire is raging in the Corbieres hills of southwestern France, having already burned thousands of hectares and injuring at least two people. The blaze prompted authorities to shut down a section of the A9 motorway, a critical route connecting France and Spain, and to evacuate several campgrounds and a village. Over 1,200 firefighters, supported by water-bombing aircraft, are battling the rapidly spreading fire, which is being exacerbated by strong winds and dry conditions in the region.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Florida arrested a man found with a fully loaded AR-15 rifle and multiple knives in a rental car parked in a restricted area of Palm Beach County Airport. The airport is often used by President Trump, though he was not in Florida at the time of the incident. The suspect, identified as 41-year-old Michael Rodrigues, was taken into custody without incident, and law enforcement officials stated that no specific threats had been made. The investigation into the man's motive is currently ongoing.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has announced it will not pursue the death penalty against high-profile Mexican drug lords Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada and Rafael Caro Quintero. Both men, who have pleaded not guilty to extensive drug trafficking charges, are among Mexico's most infamous narcos, with Caro Quintero also charged in the 1985 murder of a DEA agent. The decision removes capital punishment as a possibility but leaves open the potential for life sentences, with attorneys for both defendants expressing hope for a swift resolution.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order naming himself as the chair of a new White House task force for the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. In his announcement, Trump stated he would use the military or National Guard if necessary to ensure the Games' safety, a comment that could create tension with local officials. This move signals a more hands-on role for the president in Olympic planning than is typical, positioning the event as a premier opportunity to showcase American strength on the world stage.</p>
