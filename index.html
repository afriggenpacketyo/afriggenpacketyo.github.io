        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced the commutation of former New York Republican Congressman George Santos' prison sentence for fraud, leading to his immediate release. Trump stated Santos had been "horribly mistreated" in prison, where he was serving an 87-month sentence for wire fraud and identity theft. Santos, who was expelled from Congress after a House Ethics Committee report found "substantial evidence" of law violations, expressed gratitude for a "second chance" and vowed to focus on prison reform. This controversial decision means Santos will no longer be required to pay restitution to his victims, drawing sharp criticism from some lawmakers who argue his crimes warrant a longer sentence.</p>

          <p>Female remains were discovered in a shallow grave behind an abandoned school in Philadelphia, two weeks after 23-year-old Kada Scott went missing. Police, acting on a "very specific" anonymous tip, found the remains in a heavily wooded area, though formal identification by the medical examiner is pending. Keon King, 21, was previously charged with kidnapping in connection with Scott's disappearance, identified as the last person in contact with her. This article highlights the ongoing police investigation into the tragic circumstances, as Scott's family remains in communication with authorities following the grim discovery.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans across all 50 states participated in "No Kings" protests, demonstrating against the Trump administration's perceived slide into authoritarianism and government overreach. The rallies, a follow-up to earlier large-scale protests, featured diverse crowds using signs, marching bands, and inflatable costumes to express widespread dissent. Organizers like Indivisible emphasized the pro-democracy message, while figures like Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson criticized federal interventions in cities. Republican leaders, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, dismissed the demonstrations as "hate America rallies," highlighting the deep political divisions surrounding this significant nationwide movement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has issued a stark warning about credible reports indicating that Hamas may be planning an imminent attack on Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip. This potential action would constitute a direct and grave violation of the recently brokered ceasefire agreement, which aims to stabilize the war-torn region after a two-year conflict. The U.S. did not specify details of the alleged attack but affirmed that measures would be taken to protect Gaza's population and preserve the ceasefire's integrity. This article also references a disturbing video showing armed Hamas fighters executing Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel, underscoring the complex and violent internal dynamics within Gaza.</p>

Local authorities reported an increase in adoption requests for black cats around this time, prompting the decision. While no cruelty incidents have been recorded in Terrassa itself, the city council emphasizes this "temporary and exceptional" precaution for animal welfare, reflecting a commitment to safeguarding vulnerable animals.</p>

          <p>The Indonesian island of Lombok is undergoing "Bali-fication," a government initiative to transform it into another major tourist destination, bringing both opportunities and challenges. While the tourism boom promises economic benefits and increased income for locals, it also leads to forced evictions, environmental concerns, and cultural shifts. Mandalika, designated as the tourism heart, has seen rustic coastlines replaced by glitzy resorts and a racetrack, displacing families with inadequate compensation. This article highlights the mixed feelings among islanders who appreciate the economic prosperity but lament the loss of natural beauty and traditional ways of life, as the island struggles to balance development with preservation.</p>

          <h2>U.S. to Repatriate Two Survivors of Caribbean Military Strike on Suspected Drug Vessel</h2>

          <p>President Trump announced that two survivors of a U.S. military strike on a suspected drug-carrying vessel in the Caribbean will be repatriated to Ecuador and Colombia for detention and prosecution. This article details that the strike, the sixth known in the region since last month, resulted in two deaths on board the "drug-carrying submarine." Trump justified these actions by asserting the U.S. is in an "armed conflict" with drug cartels, aiming to stem the flow of narcotics like fentanyl. The repatriation avoids legal questions for the administration regarding the survivors' status in the U.S. justice system, as these strikes continue to draw scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew's relinquishment of royal titles has significant implications for his family, particularly his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, who will now revert to her maiden name. This article explains that while their daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, retain their princess titles, their roles as non-working royals remain unchanged. Ferguson's own recent controversies, including an email referring to Jeffrey Epstein as her "supreme friend," are expected to have a greater impact on her charity and business ventures than the loss of her duchess title. Despite the ongoing scandals, the princesses are largely seen as untarnished and are expected to continue their independent lives, albeit under continued scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Moldova's LGBTQ+ community, particularly in Chisinau, is embracing hope for greater acceptance despite persistent homophobia and threats. The Queer Cafe, a visible meeting place, has faced vandalism and intimidation, reflecting societal contempt that has escalated into open anger and violence. This article explains that while homosexuality was legalized in 1995, discrimination remains widespread, with a 2024 study showing high rates of anti-queer sentiment. Despite political challenges, including pro-Russia parties linking the EU to "rainbow ideology," activists note slow but considerable progress in tolerance and an increase in queer initiatives, particularly after recent pro-European election results.</p>

          <p>Popular global food trends, including Dubai chocolate, matcha tea, and quinoa, are revealed to have significant environmental and social downsides. This article explains that the surging demand for pistachios, driven by Dubai chocolate, leads to intensive irrigation and monoculture farming, draining vital water resources in dry climates. Similarly, the global matcha craze causes shortages and price hikes, impacting traditional Japanese tea ceremonies and small farmers. The quinoa boom previously raised prices, making it unaffordable for local populations in Peru and Bolivia, while unsustainable farming practices destroyed farmland. Fair trade organizations advocate for diverse crop cultivation to mitigate these negative impacts, promoting more sustainable consumption.</p>

          <p>Rangers' interim coach Steven Smith openly questioned his team's mentality after a frustrating 2-2 draw with Dundee United, extending their dismal start to the season. Despite a much-improved first-half performance with numerous shots, the team's fragility returned after a tactical shift by the opposition. This article highlights intense fan frustration, displayed through banners criticizing the players, and Smith's disappointment over the team's inability to adapt and match aggression. The ongoing issue of the team's mental fortitude, a frequent criticism for nearly a decade, poses a significant challenge for the next permanent head coach, as vulnerability appears to be deeply rooted.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of protesters gathered across Southern California for "No Kings" demonstrations, portraying President Trump as an aspiring monarch amidst concerns of government overreach. In Grand Park, Los Angeles, protesters used an inflatable Trump figure and themed music to voice opposition to policies on immigration, education, and healthcare. This article highlights local perspectives, including concerns about challenges to First Amendment rights and the strategic use of inflatable costumes to signal nonviolence. Governor Gavin Newsom urged peaceful protest, emphasizing unity against perceived tyranny, as these regional rallies coincided with nationwide demonstrations and a major freeway closure, further fueling local discontent.</p>
