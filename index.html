This decisive move, in cooperation with France, Germany, and the US, aims to increase pressure on Russia and compel them to the negotiation table. The announcement follows discussions among European leaders regarding a €140 billion loan to Ukraine using these assets. Recent Russian missile and drone strikes in Ukraine, which killed two and injured 20, underscore the urgency of continued support and sanctions as highlighted in this article.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has begun issuing "reduction in force" (RIF) notices to over 4,000 federal workers across seven agencies, including Treasury and Health and Human Services, amid the ongoing government shutdown. President Trump stated the layoffs would be "Democrat-oriented," attributing blame for the shutdown to Democrats and calling for Congress to negotiate an end. Senator Susan Collins criticized OMB Director Russ Vought's decision, calling the layoffs arbitrary and harmful to public service and families. Unions, including the American Federation of Government Employees, have denounced the firings as "disgraceful" and "illegal," filing lawsuits to challenge the move.</p>

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old military horse from the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, has retired to the Horse Trust sanctuary after sustaining injuries during a bolting incident in central London last year.

While four other horses, Trojan, Tennyson, Vanquish, and Vida, have fully returned to duty, Quaker's welfare necessitated retirement. This article highlights the Horse Trust's role in providing a permanent home for former military horses, emphasizing their long-standing commitment to animal welfare and rehabilitation.</p>

          <p>Concerns are mounting in Silicon Valley about a potential AI bubble, with critics pointing to complex financial arrangements and "circular financing" among major players like OpenAI, Nvidia, and Microsoft. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged some "bubbly" parts of AI but maintained his company's growth is real. This article highlights warnings from institutions like the Bank of England and JP Morgan, noting AI-related enterprises account for 80% of US stock market gains this year. The intricate web of investments, including Nvidia's stake in OpenAI's supplier, raises questions about inflated valuations and the potential economic fallout if the bubble bursts.

          <p>AstraZeneca has reached a deal with the Trump administration to offer discounted prescription drugs to Medicaid patients and avoid threatened tariffs. Similar to a previous agreement with Pfizer, AstraZeneca will provide drugs at "most-favored-nation" prices, matching the lowest rates offered in other high-income countries, and list products on the "TrumpRx" website. This article highlights skepticism from health economists regarding the actual impact on US consumers, noting Medicaid already receives low prices. President Trump, however, claimed the deal could cut prices by up to 1,000%, a figure widely disputed as illogical by experts, tempering the perceived benefit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has confirmed the return of La Niña conditions, a climate pattern typically associated with drought in Southern California. This article warns that the region, still recovering from a previous dry winter, could face another period of below-average rainfall, significantly increasing fire risk. While a weak La Niña is predicted, studies suggest second-year La Niñas can intensify existing droughts. Climate scientists note that warming ocean temperatures due to human-caused climate change are magnifying La Niña's effects, making it behave stronger than its official classification suggests, raising concerns for the upcoming winter.</p>
