UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and Welsh First Minister Eluned Morgan praised him as a dedicated public servant and a powerful voice for his community. Gwent Police confirmed his death is not being treated as suspicious after he was found unresponsive at a property in Nelson. David was known as a popular and lively contributor to Senedd debates who was respected by colleagues from all parties.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to meet virtually with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and other NATO leaders before his upcoming summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. The meeting, convened by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, aims to ensure European and Ukrainian perspectives are considered amid concerns they might be sidelined in direct U.S.-Russia talks. Zelenskyy has stressed that Russia shows no signs of ending the war and that any peace negotiations conducted without Ukraine's involvement will not be effective. The discussions highlight allied anxieties over potential concessions to Russia and the future of Ukraine's sovereignty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a landmark antitrust ruling that found Google illegally monopolized the search market, the U.S. Department of Justice has proposed that the company be forced to sell its Chrome browser. In response, AI startup Perplexity has made an unsolicited offer of $34.5 billion to acquire Chrome, aiming to integrate it with its own AI-driven browser. The potential sale represents a significant threat to Google's business model, as Chrome is a vital gateway for data collection and its multi-billion dollar advertising revenue. The move reflects a renewed vigor in U.S. antitrust enforcement against major tech monopolies.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated there is currently "no sign" that Russia intends to end its invasion, urging allies to exert coordinated pressure for a just peace. His comments come as the White House prepares for President Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, which Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described as a "listening exercise." European leaders have expressed concern about being excluded from the high-stakes talks, prompting a series of virtual meetings between Zelenskyy, European officials, and President Trump to align strategies before the summit. Meanwhile, drone and missile attacks continue from both sides of the conflict.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indicated that ceasefire negotiations are now centered on a single, comprehensive deal for the release of all remaining hostages, moving away from a phased approach. This shift comes as a Hamas delegation engages in preliminary talks with Egyptian mediators in Cairo, who see a window of opportunity for a breakthrough. The development occurs amid escalating Israeli airstrikes on Gaza City and mounting domestic pressure on Netanyahu to secure the hostages' return. However, significant obstacles remain, as Israel's demand for Hamas to surrender control of Gaza clashes with Hamas's conditions for a permanent ceasefire.</p>

Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that U.S. Park Police, with assistance from the Metropolitan Police, have already cleared 70 encampments and will dismantle the final two this week. The hardline policy is part of President Trump's federal takeover of the city's law enforcement, which he initiated in response to what he describes as an uncontrolled crime wave. The move has drawn concern from advocates about the lack of adequate shelter space and punitive nature of the approach.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Australia have identified a new species of ancient whale that lived 26 million years ago, characterized by its small, dolphin-like size and a mouth full of sharp, slicing teeth. The discovery was made from a well-preserved skull fossil found on Victoria's Surf Coast in 2019 by a local resident, Ross Dullard, after whom the species was named Janjucetus dullardi. Researchers describe the creature as a fearsome predator and a distant, smaller relative of modern filter-feeding whales. This finding adds to the understanding of early whale evolution in a region that is proving to be a cradle for discovering unusual prehistoric marine life.</p>

          <p>A recent tax and spending law signed by President Trump includes significant cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), a key safety net for low-income families. This reduction in benefits is raising concerns not only for the households that rely on them but also for the independent grocery stores they frequent. These small businesses, which have already faced immense challenges over the past five years, depend on SNAP-related purchases for a substantial portion of their revenue. The article explores how the policy change could exacerbate food insecurity and lead to the closure of vital community grocers. (not investment advice)</p>

The flooding is caused by an annual glacial lake outburst from Suicide Basin, where meltwater builds up behind an ice dam before draining into the Mendenhall River. The National Weather Service predicts the river will crest at a new record height, surpassing previous floods that have destroyed homes and caused widespread damage in recent years.

The charity highlights that abuse often starts with subtle coercive control and escalates, behaviors that are frequently overlooked by authorities.

          <p>A recent dip in mortgage rates prompted a 23% weekly jump in home refinancing applications, the largest increase since last April. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, much of this demand was driven by homeowners opting for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which currently offer lower initial rates than fixed-rate loans but carry higher future risk. Applications for ARMs increased by 25% to their highest level since 2022, indicating that borrowers, particularly those with larger loans, are actively seeking ways to reduce their monthly payments despite the potential for future rate hikes.

While precise earthquake prediction remains impossible, this research aims to refine probabilistic forecasts, which are crucial for disaster preparedness in high-risk regions.

          <p>Chinese aircraft lessors are facing significant financial losses as a result of the Ukraine war, with multiple planes leased to Russian airlines being detained in Russia. One firm, AVMAX, disclosed it received a $23 million insurance payout for three aircraft that were never returned, highlighting a broader issue affecting Chinese assets. Another company, Airwork, incurred losses in the hundreds of millions after five of its six Boeing 757 freighters were permanently detained. These incidents have forced the companies to write off the assets and engage in complex and protracted insurance litigation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's demand for a $1-billion payment from UCLA is fundamentally different from pressures on private universities like Columbia because it targets a public institution funded by California taxpayers. The author, a UC professor, asserts that this move is not a genuine effort to address campus issues but a political attack on a state-run system that is a vital economic engine for California. The article calls for Californians across the political spectrum to resist what it frames as a federal seizure of state resources, urging them to defend the public university system.</p>

          <p>On the 90th anniversary of Social Security, this analysis argues that the greatest threat to the program is not its financial solvency but a long-term political project by conservatives to dismantle it. The author contends that recent efforts to cut staff and a new law creating private savings accounts are backdoor attempts at privatization, aimed at weakening public trust in the system. The piece asserts that solutions to the program's fiscal challenges, such as removing the cap on payroll taxes, are straightforward and popular. It concludes that the program's survival depends on public vigilance against political sabotage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the new school year begins, Los Angeles public schools are implementing unprecedented measures to protect students and their immigrant families from federal immigration raids. These efforts include establishing "safe zones" with police patrols near campuses, creating volunteer networks to monitor for ICE activity, and providing legal resources and preparedness guides for families. The proactive stance comes in response to heightened fear in the community and incidents like a 15-year-old boy being mistakenly handcuffed by federal agents near a high school. School officials have vowed to oppose any interference with the constitutional right of all children to an education.</p>

          <p>A campaign in Los Angeles called 'Save Our Services' is using the city's budget crisis to advocate for loosening short-term rental laws, but its connection to Airbnb is not disclosed on its materials. Fliers and canvassers for the campaign focus on preventing cuts to public services, proposing that allowing people to rent out second homes would generate millions in new tax revenue. However, critics, including city council members and housing advocates, call the campaign a deceptive tactic by Airbnb to increase its profits at the expense of the city's housing stock. Airbnb confirmed its involvement but did not disclose its financial contributions to the effort.</p>

          <p>The Wonderful Company, one of California's largest agricultural employers, is closing a large grape nursery in the Central Valley, a move that comes amidst a contentious unionization effort by the United Farm Workers (UFW). The company states the closure is a business decision driven by a downturn in the grape industry, but labor advocates and workers question the timing, as it follows a key legal victory for the union. The nursery, which is being donated to UC Davis, has been the site of traded accusations between the company and the UFW over organizing tactics. The closure will impact hundreds of workers who supported the union drive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Washington, D.C. to combat crime has put California officials on high alert, fearing similar actions in their state. Mayors in Los Angeles and Oakland have criticized Trump's characterization of their cities as factually baseless political fear-mongering. Legal experts note that deploying federal troops for domestic law enforcement without a governor's support is highly unusual and legally fraught, potentially violating the Posse Comitatus Act. There is particular concern about the use of federal forces for security during the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, an event for which Trump has already asserted leadership.</p>
