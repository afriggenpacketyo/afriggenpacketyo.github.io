          <p>China's leading on-demand delivery service, Meituan, has announced that its daily orders recently surpassed a new record of 150 million. This milestone highlights the company's success in a fiercely competitive market against rivals like JD.com and Alibaba. The achievement comes as Meituan's founder, Wang Xing, has pledged to invest 100 billion yuan to maintain market dominance and support merchants amid an escalating battle for control of the instant delivery sector. This growth signals robust consumer demand despite the intense competition.</p>

          <p>The upcoming earnings season is causing apprehension in financial markets, which have recently seen record highs in the U.S. and Europe.

Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions are also in focus as finance ministers prepare for a G20 meeting in South Africa, which has been recently targeted by new U.S. tariffs, casting a shadow over international cooperation.

          <p>The 2018 murder of Aileen Seiden in a Florida motel room revealed a complex and violent "throuple" relationship between her, Zachary Abell, and Christina Araujo. Investigators pieced together a history of abuse, jealousy, and control that culminated in Seiden's brutal death during a multi-state road trip. The case, which took nearly six years to go to trial, relied heavily on the testimony of Araujo, who took a plea deal and testified against Abell. Both were ultimately convicted of second-degree murder for their roles in the crime.</p>

          <p>Kindergartens across China are grappling with a severe economic downturn as a direct result of the nation's plunging birth rate. The number of enrolled children has fallen by over 25% since its peak in 2020, leading to the closure of more than 38,000 kindergartens. To survive, formerly exclusive institutions are now forced to recruit from the general public, while others face permanent shutdown. This trend reflects the broader demographic challenges confronting China and the significant societal and economic shifts that follow.</p>

          <p>Melissa Turner, a cosplay actor, was convicted of murdering her boyfriend, Matthew Trussler, after a neighbor's security camera captured audio of a violent argument at their Florida home.

Additional video from an in-home camera showed Turner following an unarmed Trussler shortly before his death. A jury found her guilty of second-degree murder, and she was sentenced to over 20 years in prison.</p>

Contrary to concerns that the dam would cause droughts downstream, data from two existing upstream dams show that water flows during the dry season have actually increased significantly. The study found that low flows in February rose by over 50%, suggesting that the dam's regulation could provide more stable and increased water supply to India when it is most needed, potentially altering the geopolitical dynamics of the region's water resources.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has reportedly fired at least 20 Justice Department prosecutors and support staff who were connected to former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigations into Donald Trump. According to sources, the dismissals were driven by the department's "weaponization working group," which identified the individuals. The move has reportedly created a climate of fear among the department's career employees, echoing earlier purges during the Trump presidency. Those fired include not only prosecutors but also litigation assistants and other support personnel.</p>

          <p>Hong Wang, a world-renowned Chinese mathematician and a leading contender for the prestigious Fields Medal, has become a target of criticism from cyber-nationalists in her home country. The backlash erupted online because she delivered a series of highly anticipated academic lectures at top Chinese universities in English rather than Mandarin. Despite her groundbreaking work and the packed attendance at her seminars, online commentators questioned her patriotism. Wang, a graduate of Peking University, is currently an associate professor at New York University and will soon join a prominent French research institute.</p>

          <p>The UK's Health Secretary, Wes Streeting, is set to meet with the British Medical Association (BMA) next week in an effort to prevent a planned five-day strike by resident doctors in England. The BMA has announced the walkout, scheduled from July 25th, over an ongoing pay dispute, arguing that a proposed 5.4% raise is insufficient to restore real-terms pay lost since 2008. The government has maintained that it cannot improve the offer, though it is reportedly open to discussing working conditions. The union insists the strike will only be called off if a credible new pay offer is made.</p>

          <h2>State Department Lays Off Over 1,300 Employees in Sweeping Reorganization</h2>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated widespread layoffs, cutting more than 1,300 civil and foreign service employees as part of a major reorganization under the Trump administration. The plan aims to reduce the department's domestic workforce by about 15%, closing or merging numerous offices to eliminate redundancies and refocus on core missions. Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the cuts will weaken America's diplomatic corps and undermine national security. The layoffs have notably impacted bureaus focused on human rights, refugee assistance, and foreign aid, sparking alarm among staff and advocacy groups.</p>
