          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has specified nearly 70 jobs across eight sectors that will qualify for a tax exemption on tipped wages, a key component of President Trump's recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." The preliminary list includes workers in industries such as food and beverage, hospitality, personal services, and transportation, aiming to provide financial relief and address the nation's affordability crisis. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated this measure is designed to benefit the bottom 50% of wage earners and create real wage increases. An official list will be released for public comment, but the move fulfills a significant campaign promise.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court decision ruling many of the Trump administration's tariffs illegal has created significant uncertainty for the shipping industry and raised questions about billions of dollars in collected duties. While the administration plans to appeal to the Supreme Court, businesses are now contemplating the possibility of receiving substantial refunds, a process that could be logistically complex. Industry experts note that shippers are currently maintaining a cautious stance, awaiting a final legal decision before altering their strategies. The outcome will have major implications for supply chains and the $142 billion in tariff revenue generated this fiscal year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Argentine authorities have placed the daughter of a former Nazi official and her husband under house arrest in connection with a missing 17th-century painting believed to have been looted during World War II. The artwork, "Portrait of a Lady," was stolen from Dutch-Jewish art dealer Jacques Goudstikker and was recently spotted in a real estate advertisement for a home owned by the official's daughter, Patricia Kadgien. When authorities raided the property, the painting was gone, leading to charges of obstructing the investigation and concealing theft in the context of genocide. The case highlights the ongoing efforts to recover art plundered by the Nazi regime.</p>

          <p>Salesforce's stock has fallen 25% this year, making it the second-worst performer in the Dow as its market value has dropped significantly below its rival, Oracle. Investors are concerned about slowing revenue growth, which has remained in the single digits for four consecutive quarters, and are looking for signs of a turnaround, particularly through AI initiatives like its Agentforce system. The company is also facing renewed pressure from activist investors to improve profitability and justify its recent $8 billion acquisition of Informatica. Upcoming quarterly results will be critical in determining if CEO Marc Benioff can restore confidence and steer the company back toward a high-growth trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Air Lease Corp., a major aircraft leasing firm founded by industry pioneer Steven Udvar-Házy, has agreed to be taken private in a $7.4 billion deal led by a consortium of investors including Japan's Sumitomo, SMBC Aviation Capital, Apollo, and Brookfield. The acquisition, valued at approximately $28.2 billion including debt, reflects a growing trend of consolidation within the aircraft leasing sector, which owns over half of the world's passenger jets. This move comes as the industry navigates record-high rental rates driven by aircraft shortages while also facing potential shifts in airline capacity planning. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

The agency stated that only state and local election officials will be permitted, citing the "administrative burden" of ensuring that third-party groups are nonpartisan. Civil liberties organizations like the League of Women Voters have condemned the decision, calling it an intimidation tactic that makes it harder for new citizens to exercise their right to vote.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When dealing with significant credit card debt, consumers often consider consolidation, which typically involves either a loan or a program. A debt consolidation loan combines multiple debts into a single new loan, often with a lower interest rate, which the borrower repays over a fixed term. In contrast, a debt consolidation program, usually offered by a debt relief company, involves working with the company to secure a loan to pay off creditors, with payments then made to the agency. The best option depends on an individual's credit score and financial situation, as loans often require good credit while programs may offer more flexibility for those with credit blemishes.

          <p>Taxpayers facing significant debt with the IRS have several options for resolution beyond immediate full payment. These methods include negotiating with a tax debt relief service, applying for an "offer in compromise" to settle the debt for less than the full amount, or arranging an installment agreement for manageable monthly payments. In cases of severe financial hardship, the IRS may grant a temporary delay in collection or consider a penalty abatement if there was a reasonable cause for late payment. Understanding these different avenues can help individuals navigate the complexities of tax obligations and avoid more severe consequences like liens or wage garnishment. (not investment advice)</p>

One path is negotiating a settlement with creditors, often through a debt settlement company, to pay a reduced lump sum in exchange for forgiving the remaining balance. However, this can negatively impact credit scores and may have tax implications. Other alternatives include debt consolidation loans, debt management programs that negotiate better terms, or, as a last resort, bankruptcy.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates in September, savers with Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts should avoid several key mistakes to maximize their returns. One common error is shopping around for the best rate for too long, as banks may preemptively lower their offers before an official Fed announcement. Another is failing to monitor the rate climate closely, as changes can happen suddenly. Finally, savers should avoid letting existing CDs automatically roll over upon maturity, as the new account will almost certainly have a lower rate, and instead should have a plan to reinvest the funds elsewhere.

          <p>With the price of gold approaching record highs near $3,500 per ounce, beginner investors may find it challenging to enter the market. However, there are strategic ways to get started without paying the top market price. These include investing through vehicles like gold ETFs or stocks, which have lower entry points, or purchasing fractional gold in smaller, more affordable amounts than the standard one-ounce measurement. Another effective strategy is dollar-cost averaging, which involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, allowing for gradual accumulation and mitigating the risk of a single large investment at a peak price.

          <h2>Federal Judge Prohibits Trump Administration from Using Military for Law Enforcement in California</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued an injunction barring President Trump from deploying the National Guard or other military forces to perform law enforcement duties in California. The ruling, from Judge Charles Breyer, found that the administration's recent deployment of troops in Los Angeles to address immigration protests willfully violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a federal law that prohibits using the military for domestic law enforcement. The judge warned that such actions could create "a national police force with the President as its chief." While the injunction is limited to California, it represents a significant legal setback to the administration's strategy of using military personnel in U.S. cities.</p>

          <p>After a scorching Labor Day weekend, California is now facing an increased risk of wildfires as a surge of monsoonal moisture brings thunderstorms and lightning across the state. The combination of dry conditions from the recent heat wave, high temperatures, and potential wind gusts up to 50 mph creates a dangerous environment for new fire starts. Meteorologists tracked dozens of lightning strikes per hour on Tuesday morning, raising concerns similar to the 2020 lightning storms that ignited several massive and destructive fire complexes. Flood watches have also been issued for several areas due to the potential for heavy downpours from the storms.</p>

          <p>In an open letter, nearly 600 economists, including several Nobel laureates, have condemned President Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, warning it threatens the central bank's institutional independence. The signatories argue that the move, based on unproven allegations, undermines the credibility of the U.S. financial system, which relies on a Federal Reserve insulated from short-term political pressure. The letter comes after Trump has repeatedly pressured the Fed to lower interest rates and publicly targeted both Governor Cook and Chair Jerome Powell. This collective action from the economic community represents a significant defense of the Fed's autonomy.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has begun calling up thousands of reservists as it prepares for a major ground offensive to conquer Gaza City, which it describes as a Hamas stronghold. The city is already under intense aerial and artillery bombardment, with dozens of Palestinians reported killed. The United Nations has warned that a full-scale assault would be "beyond catastrophic" for the nearly one million civilians who remain in the city, despite evacuation orders. Meanwhile, global food security experts have confirmed that a famine is already occurring in Gaza City, and the families of Israeli hostages are pleading with the government to prioritize a release deal over the military operation.</p>

          <p>In a highly critical op-ed, nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have accused Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of "endangering every American's health." The bipartisan group of former leaders claims his actions, including the recent firing of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez and the replacement of members on a key vaccine advisory committee, are undermining the nation's public health system. They argue that this political interference erodes trust and hobbles the agency's ability to protect Americans from health threats. The condemnation adds to the growing controversy surrounding the leadership and direction of the nation's top public health agencies.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin saw a slight increase on Tuesday, reclaiming the $111,000 level, while the broader stock market experienced a sell-off and gold surged to a new record high above $3,500 per ounce. The market divergence was driven by investor concerns over the legality of U.S. tariffs and their potential economic repercussions. Analysts suggest that while both gold and Bitcoin benefit from geopolitical uncertainty, Bitcoin's recent performance has been tempered by a significant rotation of capital into other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. The market is now closely watching for a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut, which could influence future trends. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a 25-basis-point interest rate cut in September, homeowners and buyers should not anticipate a major drop in mortgage rates. Experts suggest the impact will likely be muted because the modest cut may have already been priced into current mortgage offers by lenders. Furthermore, mortgage rates are influenced by multiple factors beyond the Fed's policy, including the 10-year Treasury yield and broader economic conditions. Therefore, while a rate cut is a positive signal for borrowers, it is unlikely to trigger the substantial rate decreases seen in previous years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A French anesthetist, Frederic Pechier, is set to go on trial for allegedly poisoning 30 patients, 12 of whom died, between 2008 and 2017. Prosecutors accuse the 53-year-old doctor of intentionally tampering with his colleagues' anesthesia pouches to trigger medical emergencies, which he would then heroically resolve to showcase his skills. The incidents involved suspicious cardiac arrests in otherwise low-risk patients at two clinics in the city of Besancon. Pechier, who faces life in prison if convicted, has denied all charges, claiming the events were the result of medical errors by others. The case has shocked the French medical community.</p>
