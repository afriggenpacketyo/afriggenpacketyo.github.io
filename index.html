          <p>A major explosion and subsequent fire at a fireworks warehouse in Yolo County, California, has left seven people unaccounted for. The incident, which occurred at the Devastating Pyrotechnics facility, also injured two people and sparked multiple grass fires across 80 acres. The company was reportedly operating without local licenses for fireworks storage on the agricultural property, which is a key focus of the investigation. Federal and state authorities, including the ATF, are now investigating the cause of the tragic blast while families await news of their missing loved ones.</p>

          <p>A Tennessee man, who was pardoned by President Trump for his involvement in the January 6th Capitol riot, has been sentenced to life in prison for a separate, unrelated case. Edward Kelley was convicted of conspiring to attack FBI agents and incite a "civil war" after creating a "kill list" of law enforcement personnel who had investigated him. Prosecutors argued that Kelley was remorseless and believed his actions were a patriotic duty. The presidential pardon he received for his January 6th offenses did not extend to this subsequent conspiracy conviction in Tennessee.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear two landmark cases concerning the participation of transgender athletes in women's and girls' sports. The cases, *Little v. Hecox* and *State of West Virginia v. B.P.J.*, were brought forward by former female NCAA athletes who are challenging the inclusion of biological males in their competitions. The court's future ruling will have a sweeping impact on the legality of state laws that aim to restrict sports participation based on biological sex. This decision will set a major precedent for Title IX and equal protection interpretations nationwide.</p>

The tour, which sold around 900,000 tickets, generated immense global excitement but also faced scrutiny over Ticketmaster's 'dynamic pricing' practices. Brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher, along with other former members, are performing a setlist rumored to include major hits like "Wonderwall" and "Champagne Supernova." The reunion marks a significant moment for fans, concluding years of speculation following the band's acrimonious split in 2009.</p>

          <p>One year after taking power with a significant majority, the UK's Labour government under Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing scrutiny over its key policy promises. BBC correspondents analyzed progress in six areas, noting mixed results. While net migration has fallen, this is largely due to policies from the previous government, and small boat crossings have increased. Economic growth has been modest, and the government has faced challenges with its pledges on teacher recruitment and welfare reform, including some notable U-turns. The assessment highlights the difficult balance between ambitious goals and the harsh realities of governing.</p>

          <p>As the Fourth of July approaches, experts from Canine Companions offer advice for keeping dogs safe and calm amidst loud fireworks, which can cause significant fear and anxiety for pets. The primary recommendation is to avoid taking dogs to fireworks shows and to exercise them earlier in the day to help them relax. For noise-sensitive dogs, creating a safe, comfortable space at home, using white noise or calming music, and offering engaging toys like a frozen Kong can help mitigate stress. These proactive measures are crucial for ensuring the holiday is not a traumatic experience for canine family members.</p>

          <p>Famed Mexican boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. has been arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Los Angeles and is facing deportation. U.S. officials stated that Chávez Jr. has an active arrest warrant in Mexico for alleged involvement in organized crime and is believed to be affiliated with the Sinaloa cartel. The arrest comes just days after his high-profile match against Jake Paul. His lawyer has denied the allegations, calling the arrest an attempt to terrorize the Latin community and stating they were unaware of such claims.</p>

          <p>Zarah Sultana, the MP for Coventry South, has announced she is resigning from the UK's Labour Party to establish a new political party, potentially alongside former leader Jeremy Corbyn. Sultana, who was suspended from Labour last year for defying the party line on a welfare vote, cited the government's stance on Gaza, growing poverty, and a "broken" political system as her reasons. She stated the new party would aim to challenge the political establishment and offer a true alternative. The move signals deepening fractures on the left wing of British politics.</p>

          <p>The Georgia chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans has filed a lawsuit against the state park that houses the nation's largest Confederate monument. The suit aims to block the park's plan to build a "truth-telling" exhibit detailing the site's historical ties to slavery, segregation, and the Ku Klux Klan. The group argues that the planned exhibit and the relocation of Confederate flags violate a state law that protects the monument. This legal battle represents the latest flashpoint in the ongoing national debate over Confederate memorials and the historical narratives they represent.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled 7-2 in favor of the Trump administration, permitting the deportation of eight noncitizens who have been held at a U.S. military base in Djibouti. The men will be sent to South Sudan, a country with which nearly all of them have no connection. This decision follows a previous ruling that allows for expedited deportations to third countries. The men, who were convicted of serious crimes in the U.S., had challenged their removal. Dissenting justices argued the ruling gives the administration special treatment and disregards the potential dangers the men face upon arrival.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This contributor article proposes a new model to make popular GLP-1 anti-obesity drugs more affordable for Americans with employer-sponsored health insurance. The author suggests eliminating the complex system of rebates and coupons, allowing insurers to purchase the drugs at the direct-to-consumer price of around $500 per month. Employers could then cover a portion of this cost, significantly lowering the out-of-pocket expense for employees. This approach would simplify the opaque pricing system, improve public health by increasing access, and align U.S. prices more closely with those in other nations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key provision in President Trump's newly passed legislative package introduces a significant, though temporary, tax change for tipped workers. The law will allow workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips from their annual taxable income, a measure that would cover the majority of tipped employees in the U.S. The tax exemption, which phases out in 2028 unless extended, was a major campaign promise. While proponents celebrate it as a win for working-class Americans, some tax experts note it will primarily benefit middle-to-upper-income earners and will not affect the lowest-income workers.

          <p>Despite narrow Republican majorities and internal party fractures, President Trump's landmark tax-and-spending bill successfully passed Congress, showcasing his significant influence. The path to victory was fraught with challenges, requiring late-night deals, direct presidential pressure, and targeted concessions to win over skeptical lawmakers. Holdouts were persuaded with benefits for their states, such as provisions for Alaska's whaling industry, and promises of future action. The contentious process culminated in a marathon session, overcoming conservative misgivings about the bill's impact on the deficit and social programs to meet Trump's July Fourth deadline.</p>

          <p>President Trump's signature domestic policy bill allocates approximately $170 billion to enhance federal immigration enforcement, aiming to detain and deport a record number of people. The legislation provides $45 billion for detention centers, $30 billion for ICE personnel and operations, and $46.5 billion to continue construction of the border wall. The bill also makes immigration more expensive by increasing fees for processes like asylum applications and appeals. Critics argue these measures will create insurmountable barriers for immigrants, while supporters contend they are necessary for national security and border control.</p>

Shelton, who had already missed three match points, was angered by the timing of the decision. The suspension means he must return the next day to complete what could be a single game, denying him a full day of rest before his next potential match.</p>
