          <p>In a high-stakes meeting at the White House, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly told President Trump that Canada would not become the 51st U.S. state, addressing Trump's repeated suggestions of acquiring Canada. Carney employed a real estate analogy, stating some places are 'not for sale,' a sentiment Trump countered with 'never say never.' Despite the tensions stemming from Trump's tariffs on Canadian goods, both leaders struck a conciliatory tone, with Trump praising Carney's recent electoral victory and both committing to further discussions on trade and security, although Trump indicated no immediate policy changes regarding tariffs. The meeting aimed to reset relations strained since Trump's re-election and his ongoing trade disputes with Canada.</p>

          <p>Super Micro Computer (SMCI) released weaker-than-expected guidance, citing macroeconomic headwinds and tariff impacts following President Trump's announcement of new tariffs on imported goods. The company's Q3 earnings and revenue fell short of analyst estimates, and Q4 guidance also disappointed, leading to a decline in the stock price. CEO Charles Liang noted that some customers delayed data center technology purchases, anticipating that these commitments would materialize in the following quarters. The company had faced scrutiny over the past year, including a short seller report and auditor resignation, but recently filed its annual report to maintain its Nasdaq listing.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed expectations, driven by a 36% surge in overall sales. The company's data center segment, fueled by demand for Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs, saw a 57% increase, while client revenue from laptop and PC chips jumped 68% due to strong demand for Zen 5 chips. Despite a 30% decline in gaming sales due to lower console chip revenue, AMD provided a robust forecast for the current quarter, anticipating approximately $7.4 billion in sales. The company also addressed the impact of U.S. export controls on AI chips, projecting $800 million in related costs.</p>

The Pakistani Army stated that other locations, including Bahawalpur and Kotli, were also attacked, coming shortly after India threatened punitive actions against Pakistan, including disrupting water flow, in response to the civilian deaths.

          <p>President Trump's efforts to minimize the focus on the nation's racial past are meeting resistance from those determined to preserve it, as seen with the Whitney Plantation in Louisiana initially having its federal grants rescinded, only to have them restored weeks later. The Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture also pushed back against claims it was returning artifacts to comply with the president's order. Despite the administration's attempts to control the narrative, historical sites dedicated to Black history and the visitors who still frequent them are ensuring that these stories continue to be told, challenging the administration's efforts to reshape historical narratives.</p>

          <p>Tesla's vehicle sales in Germany and Britain plummeted in April, reaching their lowest point in over two years, reflecting a broader trend of declining demand for the U.S. automaker across Europe. Registrations of new Tesla vehicles significantly decreased in several European countries, even as overall electric vehicle sales increased. Analysts attribute this decline to factors including the backlash against President Trumpâ€™s tariffs, European push to shun U.S. products, and consumer anger at Elon Musk's support for far-right parties. Meanwhile, Chinese-made electric vehicles are gaining popularity, and Volkswagen has seen a resurgence in demand for its electric cars.</p>

The policy, stemming from an executive order targeting active-duty and prospective service members with gender dysphoria, has been praised by the White House as restoring military focus on readiness, while advocacy groups argue it is discriminatory and unconstitutional. The policy's opponents argue it is discriminatory, and based on prejudice rather than military readiness.</p>

          <p>A new Apple TV show, "Your Friends & Neighbors," starring Jon Hamm, explores the unhappiness and lack of financial security among the hyper-affluent in Connecticut suburbs. Unlike other portrayals of the rich that evoke aspiration or judgment, this show eliminates any sense of aspirational identification by depicting its wealthy characters as unhappy and unfulfilled. The show suggests that even with millions, financial security is an illusion, and the pressures of keeping up appearances only magnify unhappiness. The show serves as a reassuring response to meritocratic status anxiety, portraying the rich world as a place where unhappiness is magnified and financial security is still an illusion.</p>

          <p>Collection debt carries a multitude of costs beyond the initial unpaid balance, including accruing interest, late fees, collection agency charges, and potential legal expenses. The damage to one's credit score from collection accounts can also lead to higher interest rates on future loans and credit cards, resulting in significant long-term financial consequences. To mitigate the cost of collection debt, individuals can negotiate settlements directly with collection agencies, request fee and interest waivers, seek professional help from debt relief companies, and explore available legal options. Taking proactive steps to address collection debt is crucial to rebuilding financial health and preventing the burden from spiraling out of control.</p>

The IMLS is the primary source of federal funding for public libraries, particularly benefiting small and rural libraries, and its dismantling would have had a significant impact on library services nationwide.</p>

The small, hidden galleries where these artifacts were found suggest that only certain members of ChavÃ­n society were invited to partake in these rituals, indicating controlled access and management of ritual activities.

          <p>A fencer's refusal to compete against a transgender opponent in a women's bout at a Maryland tournament has ignited a heated debate about transgender athletes in sports, leading to a congressional hearing. Stephanie Turner declined to participate against Red Sullivan, citing concerns about fairness, resulting in disqualification and a viral video. The incident has politicized the issue, drawing attention from conservative circles and prompting investigations. U.S.A. Fencing is now at the center of the debate, facing pressure to address inclusivity and fair play, while the Trump administration seeks to restrict transgender athletes from competing in womenâ€™s events at the 2028 Summer Olympics.</p>

          <p>President Trump declared that the United States would halt bombing the Houthis in Yemen, claiming the rebel group had pledged to cease attacks on U.S. ships in the Red Sea, with the Foreign Ministry of Oman confirming a ceasefire agreement. However, a Houthi official stated they would 'evaluate' the U.S. proposal, raising questions about the agreement's certainty. The U.S. began airstrikes against Houthi targets in March, and the recent conflict has involved costly attacks and threats, leading to a shakeup in Trump's national security team, which the administration has been trying to cover up ever since.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration surprised observers by asking a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit targeting the abortion pill mifepristone, a move seen as a defense of the drug. However, experts suggest this move preserves the administration's ability to attack abortion rights in the future, potentially through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The administration's legal strategy avoids revealing its plans for mifepristone, raising concerns that it may attempt to restrict access through regulatory changes or by eliminating the drug's approval, with one possibility being through telehealth restrictions.</p>
