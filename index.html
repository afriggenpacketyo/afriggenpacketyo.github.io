            <p>President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs for most countries, excluding China, where tariffs have been raised to 125%. Trump stated that countries not retaliating against US tariffs would face a blanket 10% tariff until July, citing concerns that "people were jumping a little bit out of line." This decision follows days of insisting on maintaining his aggressive trade strategy. The move aims to alleviate market instability while still applying pressure on China over trade practices.

            <p>The United States and Panama have formalized a new security agreement to bolster control over the Panama Canal, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth citing the need to counter China's growing influence in the region. The agreement reaffirms Panamanian sovereignty while outlining enhanced military cooperation, including a cost-sharing model for services provided to U.S. warships. Hegseth also mentioned a broader framework guaranteeing "first and free" passage for American naval vessels through the canal. This move signals a strategic effort to counter Chinese-controlled infrastructure in the canal area, though the Panamanian President denies China controls the canal.</p>

Construction is expected to begin next year, with an opening planned for 2031. Notably, a Harry Potter-themed area is unlikely due to existing exclusivity contracts with Warner Bros.</p>

            <p>Microsoft has abruptly suspended some services for clients in mainland China, including Sun Yat-sen University and BGI Group, a genomics company. The move has fueled speculation about increasing technological decoupling between the US and China. Microsoft has not publicly stated the reason for the suspensions. BGI Group has been a target of US authorities and placed on the Commerce Department's trade blacklist.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's trade war with China is escalating, with increased tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump aims to upend the global trade system centered on China. China's economic model is based on strong exports and a tightly protected domestic market. The situation depends on whether China negotiates and makes major concessions. The US may believe tariffs are beneficial for stimulating domestic investment and raising tax revenues.</p>
