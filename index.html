          <p>The upcoming week will be dominated by the global market response to U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, escalating geopolitical tensions. NATO leaders are scheduled to meet in The Hague, where President Trump is expected to pressure European nations to increase defense spending, particularly concerning the 5% of GDP target which some countries deem unreasonable. Simultaneously, the World Economic Forum's Meeting of New Champions, also known as Summer Davos, will take place in Tianjin, China, amid ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S. Investors will closely monitor these events for indications of economic and geopolitical stability, as well as the potential for further escalation or resolution.

          <p>Following the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iranian dissident groups have voiced their support and reiterated calls for the overthrow of the Islamic Republic. Reza Pahlavi, son of the last Shah, stated that the attacks resulted from the regime's pursuit of nuclear weapons at the expense of the Iranian people. Maryam Rajavi, president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, asserted that Khamenei must step down and advocated for a democratic, non-nuclear republic. These groups view the strikes as an opportunity for regime change and a move towards a more peaceful and prosperous future for Iran.</p>

          <p>The author reflects on the emotional journey of confronting the man accused of sexually assaulting and murdering her sister, Vickie, in 1979, a case that remained unsolved for decades. Enhanced DNA technology and her younger sister's determination led to the arrest of Andre Taylor, who was eventually convicted. The trial evoked painful memories, including the last time she saw Vickie at her wedding, and the author grappled with feelings of compassion and the pursuit of justice. Despite the guilty verdict and life sentence, the author expresses a lingering sense of loss and the absence of true peace.</p>

The Beta Technologies aircraft, piloted by CEO Kyle Clark, flew from East Hampton to JFK with four passengers on board, covering approximately 70 nautical miles in just over half an hour. This achievement demonstrates the practicality and potential of electric air travel, offering quieter and more cost-effective transportation options.

          <p>While California Governor Gavin Newsom received praise for his nationally broadcast speech criticizing President Trump's actions in Los Angeles, it is premature to overstate his prospects for a 2028 White House bid. Newsom's speech addressed a real crisis and demonstrated gubernatorial leadership, but he faces significant challenges, including rampant homelessness, a budget deficit, and vast income inequality. Additionally, California's social policies may not resonate with voters across the country, making it difficult for Newsom to overcome the perception of being a product of liberal San Francisco politics. The midterm elections in 2026 will play a crucial role in shaping the political landscape for 2028.</p>

          <p>The U.S. destruction of Fordow has significantly weakened Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, potentially marking the beginning of the end for his regime. Despite his long history of surviving crises, Khamenei's security pillars are reeling, and his intransigence has led to American bombing. Possible outcomes include a revolution led by ordinary Iranians, an internal coup, or a power grab by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). The removal of Khamenei could spark an uprising or lead to a smooth succession, but the country faces a moment of incredible volatility.</p>

Telehealth prescriptions and hotlines provide support, but legal and political challenges persist, highlighting the ongoing evolution of abortion access.</p>
