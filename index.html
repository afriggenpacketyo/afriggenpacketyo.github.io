Despite its growth and having over 100 million users, Notion faces significant competition from tech giants like Microsoft, which has launched a similar product called Loop.

          <p>School districts across the United States are grappling with severe budget shortfalls after the Trump administration temporarily froze nearly $7 billion in federal funding that was approved by Congress. Districts like Ashe County, North Carolina, which relies on federal money for 17% of its budget, were left scrambling to cover essential costs like teacher salaries and after-school programs. Although the funds were eventually released after a lawsuit and legislative pressure, the incident has created lasting uncertainty. School leaders now face the challenge of planning for future budgets under an administration intent on cutting education spending.</p>

          <p>During a joint press conference, President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer addressed several key global issues, revealing areas of both agreement and divergence. Trump criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin for the war in Ukraine but also indicated he is seeking to retake control of Bagram airbase in Afghanistan due to its proximity to China's nuclear facilities. While the leaders disagreed on the UK's impending recognition of Palestinian statehood, Starmer's firm stance against Hamas earned praise from Trump. The discussion also touched upon UK defense spending, online safety, and US trade tariffs.</p>

In a formal letter to the UN, he stated that Thai forces have forcibly evicted 25 families and erected barricades, escalating tensions just weeks after a deadly five-day clash. The accusation follows an incident where Thai police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Cambodian protesters. Thailand's army responded by stating the evicted residents were illegally occupying Thai territory and that its forces were responding to provocation from armed protesters.</p>

The sport traces its roots to the women who assisted soldiers during the Mexican Revolution, and it requires a deep bond between rider and horse, as well as extensive training and balance.

          <p>Following the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, President Trump announced his intention to designate Antifa as a "major terrorist organisation." Antifa, short for anti-fascist, is a decentralized, leaderless movement of far-left activists who oppose far-right and racist ideologies, sometimes through direct confrontation and violence. Experts question the legality and practicality of such a designation, as U.S. law is designed for foreign organizations and Antifa lacks a formal structure. Critics argue the term is often used broadly by conservatives to condemn various left-wing groups, while proponents point to violent incidents as justification for the label.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has implemented its first interest rate cut since December, reducing its benchmark rate by a quarter-point to a range between 4% and 4.25%. This move is expected to have varied effects on consumers, with immediate relief likely for those with home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) and a preemptive decline already seen in mortgage rates. However, the impact on high-interest credit card debt will be minimal, and savers may see reduced returns on high-yield savings accounts.

          <p>President Donald Trump expressed approval of ABC's decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show, calling the host untalented and citing poor ratings. The suspension followed comments Kimmel made about the murder of Charlie Kirk, which prompted FCC Chairman Brendan Carr to suggest regulatory action against the network. The incident has ignited a fierce political debate, with Democrats and former President Barack Obama condemning the administration's actions as a dangerous threat to the First Amendment. Democratic lawmakers have called for Carr's resignation and are introducing legislation to protect speech from what they see as government censorship.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the indefinite suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show by ABC represents a significant act of government censorship, prompted by threats from the Federal Communications Commission. The author contends that FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr's public warnings against the network constitute "jawboning," an illegal First Amendment violation where the government pressures a third party to silence speech. This event is framed as part of a broader, accelerating crackdown by the Trump administration on critical media voices, creating a chilling effect on free press and expression. The author warns that such actions undermine democratic principles by punishing speech the regime finds unflattering.</p>

          <p>Meta's Chief Product Officer, Chris Cox, has declared that smart glasses represent the future of computing, envisioning a shift toward more natural user interfaces. He described a future where people interact with computers through voice, gestures, and sight, similar to human-to-human communication. This vision was shared alongside the reveal of the new $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which feature an in-lens display controlled by hand movements via a neural wristband. Unlike previous models, these glasses allow users to see messages and watch videos, though a live demo experienced a technical glitch when answering a video call.</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian government has revised its martial law restrictions, now permitting men aged 18 to 22 to leave and re-enter the country freely. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated the policy change is intended to encourage more young men to remain in Ukraine by granting them greater freedom of movement, insisting it will not compromise national defense. The decision has sparked a debate within Ukrainian society, with some supporting the move and others viewing it as unfair to active soldiers. While border officials have not reported a significant surge in departures, the new rule allows young men to travel for work, study, or personal reasons.</p>

          <p>In her upcoming campaign memoir, "107 Days," Kamala Harris reveals her mortification as her running mate, Tim Walz, "fumbled" a key answer during the 2024 vice-presidential debate against JD Vance. Harris writes that Walz fell for Vance's strategy of feigned bipartisanship and failed to effectively counter a question about a past misstatement, instead pivoting to talk about biking in Nebraska. The book also discloses that her first choice for vice president was then-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, but she considered it too politically risky to select him, a decision she notes was made with "mutual sadness."</p>

          <p>A new paper in Nature Food proposes that the extreme suffering of chickens bred for rapid growth can be prevented for just pennies per hour of pain averted. Researchers at the Welfare Footprint Institute calculated that switching to slower-growing chicken breeds could eliminate about 33 hours of disabling pain per bird at a cost of around 45 cents per pound for producers. While this change would slightly increase consumer prices and may have a marginal environmental impact, the authors argue the immense animal welfare benefits are substantial. The study aims to introduce a "welfare footprint" metric into food policy discussions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut is lowering costs for conventional mortgages, its impact on reverse mortgages is more complex. Reverse mortgage rates are influenced by a broader range of factors than just Fed policy, including lender margins and investor appetite. However, lower rates can still benefit retirees by increasing their total borrowing capacity, as the formula used to calculate accessible equity is rate-sensitive. Retirees considering this option should compare quotes from multiple lenders and carefully choose between fixed-rate products for predictability and adjustable-rate options to potentially capture further rate declines.

While the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut is a positive signal, uncertainty remains regarding inflation, future employment data, and upcoming U.S.-China trade talks. The biggest short-term existential threat to the market, in his view, is a potential Chinese land invasion of Taiwan. (not investment advice)</p>

Drawing parallels to his own border security policies in the United States, Trump stated that it "doesn't matter what means you use" to stop migration, which he claimed "destroys countries from within." The advice came during the conclusion of Trump's second state visit to the UK, where the two leaders also announced a new technology partnership focused on artificial intelligence and discussed issues including the war in Ukraine and Palestinian statehood.</p>
