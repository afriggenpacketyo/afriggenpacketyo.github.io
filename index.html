          <p>Storm Amy has impacted large areas of the United Kingdom with severe winds and heavy rain, leading to one death in the Republic of Ireland and significant disruption. Tens of thousands of homes in Scotland and Northern Ireland lost power, with wind gusts reaching up to 96mph. The storm set a new record for the lowest atmospheric pressure in the UK for October. Transport services, including rail and ferry networks, experienced widespread cancellations, and authorities have issued warnings for potential damage and continued travel disruptions as the storm moves across the region.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) has officially installed Reverend Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, marking a significant milestone for the predominantly white denomination. Curry, formerly a regional bishop in Chicago, succeeds Rev. Elizabeth Eaton, the church's first female leader. His installation comes as the ELCA, like other mainline Protestant denominations, faces challenges including declining membership and theological debates. Curry aims to foster a more connected church, building on existing goals to create a welcoming and thriving community for all members.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested 355 individuals during a demonstration in Trafalgar Square for showing support for Palestine Action, a group proscribed by the government in July. The protest, organized by Defend Our Juries, proceeded despite calls from police and politicians to postpone it following a recent deadly synagogue attack in Manchester. Organizers stated the event was a vigil against genocide and that canceling it would mean letting terror win. The police deployed 1,500 officers, noting that the arrests were time-consuming as many protesters refused to cooperate and had to be carried away.</p>

          <p>Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin has demanded that Democratic attorney general candidate Jay Jones withdraw from the race after text messages from 2022 were revealed. In the texts, Jones made a violent comment about shooting former Republican House Speaker Todd Gilbert. Jones has since issued a public apology, expressing shame and stating he has reached out to Gilbert's family directly. The controversy has drawn sharp criticism from Republican groups, who have labeled the rhetoric as disqualifying for a candidate seeking to become the state's top law enforcement official.</p>

          <h2>Democrats Counter Republican Claims on Immigrant Healthcare Amid Shutdown Battle</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown continues, Democrats are actively refuting Republican claims that their funding proposals include 'free healthcare for illegals.' Democratic leaders emphasize that federal law already prohibits the use of programs like Medicaid and the ACA for undocumented immigrants, and their bill does not change this. Instead, their resolution aims to reverse healthcare cuts affecting lawfully present noncitizens, such as refugees and asylum seekers, and extend popular ACA subsidies. The debate highlights the different political strategies, with Republicans focusing on immigration and Democrats on protecting existing healthcare coverage for legal residents and citizens.</p>

          <p>The populist ANO party, led by billionaire former prime minister Andrej Babis, has won the parliamentary election in the Czech Republic but fell short of securing an outright majority. Preliminary results show ANO with nearly 35% of the vote, positioning Babis to lead coalition talks. He is expected to negotiate with two smaller right-wing, eurosceptic parties to form a government. Key policy alignments include opposition to certain EU Green Deal measures and the 2035 ban on new petrol and diesel cars, though disagreements on issues like an EU membership referendum could complicate coalition building.</p>

          <p>The luxury department store Harrods has set aside more than £60 million for a compensation scheme for individuals who allege they were victims of historical abuse by former owner Mohamed Al Fayed. The redress scheme, open until March 2026, is expected to handle claims from over 100 former employees, who could each receive up to £385,000. Multiple women have accused Fayed, who died in 2023, of sexual assault. The significant financial provision for the scheme contributed to Harrods reporting a £34.3 million loss in its latest annual accounts.</p>

He also played for the Indianapolis Colts and Washington before retiring in 2017. Jones was the older brother of former UFC champion Jon Jones and NFL Pro Bowler Chandler Jones, and was remembered by his alma mater, Syracuse, as a tremendous player and an even better person.</p>

          <p>A Chinese military journal has detailed the development of new unmanned underwater systems that are described as 'disruptive' and intelligent. According to an article, these systems operate at noise levels below 90 decibels, allowing them to evade enemy sonar detection effectively. The technology can be integrated with submarine-launched missiles and smart mines to create a sophisticated, multi-layered strike network. The report indicates a significant advancement in the PLA Navy's capabilities, showcasing new unmanned submersibles, surface vessels, and minelaying systems designed for modern naval warfare.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has left the national park system in a state of limbo, with thousands of employees furloughed and many parks operating with only a skeleton crew. While official plans state that trails and open-air memorials will remain accessible, facilities like visitor centers are closed, and services such as maintenance and trash collection are suspended. This has led to confusion for visitors and concern among park advocates, who recall the damage parks like Joshua Tree sustained during the last prolonged shutdown in 2018 due to vandalism and lack of oversight.</p>

          <p>Small U.S. college towns are facing economic strain as international student enrollment plummets, a trend exacerbated by the current administration's immigration policies. A 40% drop in new international students is expected this fall, driven by fears of visa revocations, increased vetting, and a hostile political climate. This decline represents a significant loss of revenue for universities and local businesses that depend on these students, who often pay full tuition. The economic impact is particularly severe in rural areas and states with less diversified economies that have come to rely on this income.</p>

Jon Godfread, North Dakota's Republican insurance commissioner, warns that the window is 'rapidly closing' ahead of the November 1 open enrollment deadline. If the subsidies expire, millions of consumers could see their monthly health insurance premiums more than double, potentially pricing them out of the market and destabilizing the insurance risk pool. The call for an extension has unanimous, bipartisan support from insurance regulators across the country.</p>

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has abruptly fired Jon Harrison, the Navy's chief of staff. Harrison, appointed in January, had been instrumental in the administration's efforts to reshape the Navy's policy and budget offices, reportedly working to limit the influence of the undersecretary role. His dismissal follows the recent confirmation of a new navy undersecretary and is part of a broader pattern of upheaval at the Pentagon under Hegseth. Since January, the administration has fired numerous top generals and ordered a significant reduction in the number of four-star officers.</p>
