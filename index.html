          <p>A collision between a pickup truck and a tour van near Yellowstone National Park in eastern Idaho resulted in the deaths of seven people and injuries to eight others. The accident occurred on a highway near Henry's Lake State Park, approximately 16 miles west of Yellowstone, with both vehicles catching fire upon impact. The van was carrying a tour group of 14 people, and the driver of the pickup was identified as a 25-year-old from Texas. The cause of the crash is currently under investigation, and the highway was temporarily closed as emergency responders worked the scene, highlighting the dangers of the busy tourist route.

          <p>An oil spill off the coast of Louisiana is raising concerns as former federal disaster response specialists warn that staffing cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) may hinder response efforts. The leak, originating from a capped well drilled in 1942, has contaminated marshlands and threatens wildlife habitats and fisheries. While the exact amount of oil leaked is unknown, the Coast Guard has collected over 30,000 gallons of an oily mixture. Concerns are mounting as NOAA has experienced significant personnel reductions, potentially impacting their ability to provide scientific support to the Coast Guard in coordinating the cleanup efforts and the incident highlights the long-term risks associated with abandoned wells in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly in discussions with Rwanda to establish an agreement for Kigali to accept deportees from the U.S., including Africans and other non-Rwandan nationals. These discussions involve potential financial compensation for Rwanda and are taking place concurrently with U.S. efforts to broker a peace agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has indicated that the administration is actively seeking countries to take in migrants expelled from the U.S., emphasizing a desire to send them far from America.

          <p>United Airlines will reduce its schedule at Newark Liberty International Airport by canceling 35 roundtrip flights daily, which is about 10% of its Newark hub schedule, due to ongoing air traffic controller staffing shortages and technology problems with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). CEO Scott Kirby expressed disappointment, citing that 20% of Newark's air traffic controllers had recently stopped working after technology failures. The airline is urging the FAA to implement flight restrictions similar to those at other congested airports. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy acknowledged the outdated technology and vowed to address the issues, and the Trump administration is pledging to invest in fixing aging air traffic control infrastructure.</p>

The election serves as a test of the P.A.P.'s popularity, with the opposition gaining traction due to voter discontent over the rising cost of living. Opposition rallies have been well-attended, with the Workers' Party emphasizing the need for a more balanced political system. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who recently took office, faces the challenge of navigating the trade war and U.S.-China tensions, and the P.A.P. emphasizes its track record of stability and prosperity, though many Singaporeans no longer feel prosperous.</p>

The college president, Valerie Smith, stated that the protesters vandalized campus property and ignored requests to vacate the encampment, violating the student code of conduct. Swarthmore College is one of 60 schools under investigation for alleged antisemitic harassment on campus, and this action is part of a broader trend of crackdowns on pro-Palestinian protests by the Trump administration.</p>

Judge Beryl Howell stated that the directive sent the message that lawyers must adhere to the party line or face consequences, violating the First, Fifth, and Sixth amendments. Perkins Coie, which represented Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election, had its security clearances suspended and faced limitations on accessing federal buildings and government workers. The ruling is a significant victory for Perkins Coie and a rebuke of the president's actions, as the judge deemed the executive order a deliberate means of harming the firm.</p>

          <p>The remains of two domestic cats discovered in a 500-year-old Spanish shipwreck, the Emanuel Point II, may represent the earliest evidence of the species in what is now the United States. The cats likely accompanied sailors on ships to control rat and mice infestations, according to a new study. Chemical analysis suggests that the adult cat primarily consumed fish and domestic meat, not relying solely on rats for food. Cats are not native to the U.S. and were likely brought to the Americas by Europeans for pest control, and the study suggests that the cats on the Emanuel Point II may have been cared for by the Spanish sailors.</p>

          <p>The blood of a US man, Tim Friede, who intentionally injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades has resulted in the creation of an "unparalleled" antivenom, according to scientists. Antibodies found in Friede's blood have demonstrated protection against fatal doses from a wide range of snake species in animal tests. Friede's 18-year mission could be a significant advancement in finding a universal antivenom against all snakebites, which kill up to 14,000 people annually and leave many more with permanent disabilities. Researchers identified two broadly neutralising antibodies that could target two classes of neurotoxin, and the resulting antivenom cocktail protected mice from fatal doses of 13 of 19 venomous snake species.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Influence Looms Over Australian National Election</h2>

          <p>President Trump's influence is significantly impacting the Australian national election, with the center-right Liberal-National Coalition's support plummeting since he took office. Opposition leader Peter Dutton's campaign, mirroring Trump's messaging, has been unpopular among the Australian public. Despite an economic downturn threatening Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's prospects, his moderate approach to Trump has boosted his chances. Australia's close security relationship with the U.S. through AUKUS is also a key factor, but Trump's trade policies and tariffs have caused distrust, with only 36% of Australians expressing trust in the U.S. to act responsibly.</p>

          <p>President Trump's family's net worth has reportedly increased by $2.9 billion due to crypto investments, as his administration loosens regulations on the digital currency industry. The increase is attributed to the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, and a stake in World Liberty Financial, a Trump family-affiliated crypto exchange. An Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions in World Liberty Financial, further boosting the family's wealth. The SEC has paused investigations into crypto companies since Trump's inauguration, raising ethical concerns, and Trump has expressed his desire for the U.S. to become the "crypto capital of the world."

Chinese officials propose special envoys appointed by Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, but the U.S. prefers direct negotiations between Trump and Xi, an approach China deems too risky. A key obstacle is the dispute over China's role in producing ingredients used in fentanyl manufacturing, which prompted Trump to impose tariffs on Chinese goods. Beijing hopes to leverage fentanyl cooperation as a catalyst for trade talks or a bargaining chip, while Trump's team seeks a goodwill gesture ahead of negotiations.</p>

          <p>Wall Street stocks experienced a rebound, recovering from losses incurred after President Donald Trump's imposition of global tariffs. Major US indexes, including the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Industrial Average, saw gains, driven by a better-than-expected jobs report and increasing hopes for US-China trade talks. The Department of Labor reported that US employers added 177,000 new jobs in April, outpacing analysts' predictions, and Beijing indicated consideration of Washington's offer to hold trade talks. The jobs figures tempered recession fears following data showing a contraction in the US economy, though some experts cautioned that the full impact of Trump's tariffs remains uncertain.</p>
