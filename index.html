          <p>The UK government, led by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, plans to end the recruitment of care workers from abroad as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration. The government aims to require firms to hire British nationals or extend visas of overseas workers already in the country. The changes are expected to cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled visas over the next year and will include raising the threshold for skilled visas and narrowing exceptions for temporary shortage visas. These changes are intended to encourage training and employment of UK residents.</p>

Donald Trump reports "great progress" in high-level trade talks with China, although tariffs remain a point of contention. In South Korea, former minister Kim Moon Soo will run as the conservative party's presidential candidate. The new Pope, Leo XIV, reportedly garnered over 75% of votes in the conclave.

          <p>This article discusses the Trump administration's selective embrace of freedom of choice, prioritizing consumer options while restricting political and intellectual freedoms. The administration is expanding consumer choices through deregulation, while limiting options in other spheres such as political expression and voting rights. This disjunction is creating a new form of authoritarianism that still pays homage to libertarianism, but only in the realm of consumer choice. This approach marks a break from the historical link between consumer and political choice in liberal democracies.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has nominated Casey Means, a wellness influencer and medical doctor with an inactive license, as his second pick for US Surgeon General.

The poem reflects on the speaker's mother, who found and buried her own among the slaughtered, and offered her longing as sustenance. It delves into the connection between the speaker and a lover, and their ability to transcend time and see the infinite longing beyond beginnings and ends.</p>

By proposing talks without an immediate ceasefire, Putin is signaling to the Trump administration that he is a man of peace while potentially prolonging the war. The Kremlin may be calculating that this offer will create divisions within the Western coalition backing Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China are meeting in Geneva for a second day of high-stakes negotiations aimed at easing tensions from President Trump's trade war. The talks have major implications for the global economy, which has been disrupted by tariffs imposed by both countries. While Trump has hailed the initial conversations as a success, economists remain skeptical about a quick deal. Ahead of the meetings, Trump suggested lowering tariffs to 80 percent, but China would have to make concessions for the tariffs to be reduced.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is conducting an unprecedented smear campaign against Ukraine, urging citizens to vote against its EU accession, fueled by domestic political challenges. The campaign portrays Ukraine as a hub of drug trafficking and organized crime that will threaten Hungary's security and economy if it joins the EU. This is a response to growing opposition led by Peter Magyar, who is challenging Orban's power. This is also to cater to revisionist sentiments and to maintain loyalty to Putin and Trump.</p>

          <p>This article examines the relationship between Donald Trump and the US media, arguing that despite Trump's claims of "fake news," some outlets have appeared to bend to his will. Examples include billionaire owners allegedly interfering to avoid upsetting Trump, executives settling lawsuits, and potential meddling in editorial content. Some critics suggest that these actions are driven by financial considerations, as media owners seek to maintain favorable relationships with the administration. However, journalists have largely resisted these pressures, continuing to investigate the administration's actions.</p>

While extreme preppers receive media attention, the article argues that the behavior is constitutive of being American. The trend is fueled by inadequate government responses to disasters, leading individuals to take responsibility for their own safety through consumption choices.</p>

Research also indicates that personality traits associated with birth order don't hold up in well-conducted studies. The research suggests that parents are sometimes poor judges of their own children, affecting their development, and that genes versus environment is too simplistic a binary.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Andy Hill, a former UCLA basketball player under John Wooden, created the plus-minus stat, now widely used in basketball to measure a player's impact on the team's score while on the court. Hill developed the concept in 1976 while coaching at Santa Monica College, seeking a way to reward players who contributed to winning beyond scoring. Coaches such as Mick Cronin and Lakers coach JJ Redick use plus-minus to assess player performance, though some, like Ken Pomeroy, caution against overreliance on the stat. Hill credits his concept to Wooden's emphasis on teamwork and doing the little things right.</p>
