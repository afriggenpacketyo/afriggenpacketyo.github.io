          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, News Corp, and Wall Street Journal reporters. The suit alleges the newspaper published a false and malicious article claiming Trump sent a "bawdy" birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which included a hand-drawn naked woman. Trump's legal action targets what he calls a "FAKE NEWS 'article'" and seeks to hold the media organization accountable for its reporting. The lawsuit was filed in the Southern District of Florida, naming multiple parties involved in the story's publication.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has announced it will no longer use engineers based in China to provide technical support for its U.S. defense clients' cloud services. This policy change follows a ProPublica report detailing the Pentagon's reliance on Chinese engineers, which raised national security and cybersecurity concerns. The new practice is intended to ensure that no China-based teams offer technical assistance for Department of Defense cloud services, including the Azure platform. The move addresses potential vulnerabilities in a system where U.S.-based "digital escorts" with less technical expertise oversaw the work of the overseas engineers.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is facing ridicule after promoting a story about a woman allegedly kidnapped by ICE, which federal authorities have now labeled a hoax. The Department of Homeland Security publicly called out the mayor after a 41-year-old woman was charged with conspiracy and making false statements regarding her supposed abduction. Bass had posted about the incident, framing it as an example of harsh immigration enforcement, but the Justice Department alleges the woman fabricated the story. The incident has drawn criticism from Republican groups and diverted significant law enforcement resources to the investigation.</p>

          <p>A trilateral agreement has resulted in the release of 10 Americans wrongfully detained in Venezuela. The deal involved the US, Venezuela, and El Salvador, which repatriated over 200 Venezuelan migrants who had been deported from the U.S. and held in El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison. In exchange, Venezuela freed the American citizens and a number of Venezuelan political prisoners. The complex diplomatic maneuver was confirmed by officials from all three countries, with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announcing that every American who had been wrongfully detained in Venezuela is now free.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are predicting a significant increase in the UK's wasp population this summer, attributing the boom to a very warm and dry spring. While official data is not yet available, pest control services report a higher-than-usual number of callouts for large nests appearing early in the season. Although often disliked, scientists emphasize that wasps are vital apex predators in the ecosystem, acting as natural pest controllers. While the common wasp appears to be thriving, experts remind the public that most of the UK's 9,000 wasp species are solitary and not a nuisance to humans.</p>

          <p>A new theatrical production in Liverpool, "The Legend of Rooney's Ring," reimagines the lives of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen as a fantasy saga inspired by "The Lord of the Rings." The comedy, written by Helen Serafinowicz of "Motherland" fame, is a satirical homage to the famous couple, drawing from an urban myth about Coleen's lost engagement ring. The play is presented as an affectionate and silly tribute rather than a critique, celebrating the couple as heroic figures who have endured public scrutiny.

          <p>Researchers have discovered a specific interaction between gut bacteria and a genetic variant that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The study, published in Science Immunology, found that a molecule produced by certain gut bacteria overactivates an immune protein called STING in individuals with a faulty version of a regulatory gene. This unchecked immune response leads to chronic inflammation in the colon. The findings help explain the unpredictable nature of the disease and could pave the way for more precise, personalized therapies targeting this specific pathway.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's recent six-day trip to China demonstrates Canberra's effort to stabilize relations with Beijing while navigating pressure from its key ally, the United States. During the visit, Albanese held high-level talks with Premier Li Qiang and participated in a CEO roundtable, signaling a reset in diplomatic and economic ties after a period of tension. According to analysts, Australia's approach reflects a broader regional challenge of balancing relationships with the two superpowers. The visit is seen as a sign of Canberra's determination to pursue its own interests amid the escalating great power rivalry.</p>

          <p>This article details the Trump administration's internal struggle over how to handle the public and political furor surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein case. Initially, President Trump resisted calls for more transparency, frustrated that his MAGA base would not let the issue go despite his assurances. However, the strategy shifted dramatically after a Wall Street Journal report on an alleged letter from Trump to Epstein, prompting the president to order the Justice Department to seek the unsealing of grand jury testimony. The saga reveals Trump's difficulty in managing his own supporters' conspiracy-driven demands and the political complexities of his past association with Epstein.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's successful push to rescind roughly $9 billion in previously allocated federal funds will have significant consequences for public media and foreign aid programs. The bill, passed by Congress, claws back $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, threatening the existence of many local NPR and PBS affiliates. The majority of the cuts, $7.9 billion, target foreign aid, including funds for disaster relief and international peacekeeping. The move reflects a broader effort by President Trump to assert executive control over congressional spending powers, a tactic that has raised concerns even among some Republican lawmakers.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's attempts to move on, his supporters remain deeply invested in the Jeffrey Epstein case, viewing it as the ultimate proof of a corrupt global elite. This NPR segment explores the disconnect, noting that the case and its surrounding conspiracy theories are central to the MAGA movement's narrative. The base's continued pressure on Trump's own Justice Department to release all related files highlights a rare instance where the president's influence has failed to quell a fervor he once helped encourage. This fixation demonstrates the powerful and enduring grip of the "deep state" theory on his most ardent followers.</p>

The Trump administration had initially slated Taiwan for a 32% tariff rate but paused the implementation for 90 days to allow for negotiations with key trading partners. Analysts believe the fact that talks are ongoing is a positive sign, suggesting both sides are working toward a manageable solution. Taiwan, a major supplier of advanced semiconductors to American tech firms, maintains a substantial trade surplus with the U.S., which is the primary driver of the tariff threat.</p>

Paramount is also seeking federal approval for a merger with Skydance Media, whose owner has ties to Trump.

This review describes the film as a random collection of gags, songs, and platitudes, driven by a needlessly complex plot involving cosmic guardians and multiverse-hopping that mimics current superhero trends. Despite a voice cast including Rihanna and John Goodman, the movie is seen as a weapon of mass distraction rather than an enchanting story.

This behavior, termed the "Vote Yes/Hope No Caucus," allows lawmakers to avoid political backlash while enabling President Trump's efforts to expand executive authority, as outlined in plans like Project 2025.
