          <p>A recent Japanese government study reveals that over half of women in local assemblies have experienced harassment, significantly more than their male counterparts.  The most common harassers were identified as fellow assembly members, candidates, and voters.  This disparity highlights the challenges women face in male-dominated political environments and underscores the need for addressing unconscious gender bias. The study also notes that this bias is a barrier to increased female participation in politics.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge denied the release of Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, despite a previous ruling against the Trump administration's efforts to detain him on national security grounds. The government now seeks to detain him based on alleged misrepresentations on his green card application.  Khalil's lawyers argue this is a pretext to punish his activism.  The decision prolongs Khalil's detention, preventing him from being with his newborn son.</p>
