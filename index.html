          <p>Susan Monarez has been ousted as the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention just weeks after her Senate confirmation. The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed her departure without providing a clear reason, though sources indicate friction with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over vaccine policies. The move coincides with the resignations of at least three other senior CDC leaders, who cited the "weaponizing of public health" and the rise of misinformation as reasons for leaving. This leadership shakeup occurs during a period of significant turmoil for the public health agency.</p>

          <p>A woman arrested for spitting at a police officer was mistakenly held in a D.C. jail for a week due to a series of administrative failures by federal and local authorities. Despite the Justice Department not seeking pretrial detention, Kristal Rios Esquivel remained incarcerated because of an erroneous warrant "hit" in the corrections system database. A federal judge described the situation as "false imprisonment," highlighting systemic issues that prevent timely releases. The incident has raised concerns about the handling of justice in the district amidst the ongoing federal takeover.</p>

One victim, "Rachel," expressed guilt for not reporting her assault sooner, fearing the second attack could have been prevented. The close timing of the assaults highlights the confidence of Zou, who was sentenced to life in prison in the UK for assaulting 10 women in the UK and China. Since his trial, 24 more women have come forward, revealing the extensive scale of his predatory behavior.</p>

          <p>Renowned author Jacqueline Wilson is releasing "Picture Imperfect," an adult sequel to her acclaimed 1999 children's book, "The Illustrated Mum." The new novel revisits the character Dolphin, now 33, as she continues to care for her mother, Marigold, who lives with bipolar disorder. Wilson describes the book as both the "easiest and the hardest" she's written, balancing her affection for the characters with the challenge of depicting their realistic, and often difficult, adult lives. The article explores Wilson's commitment to portraying uncomfortable truths about mental illness and messy family dynamics in her work.</p>

          <p>Documents from the UK's data regulator reveal that Ministry of Defence staff had been warned about sharing spreadsheets with hidden data before a major leak exposed the details of nearly 19,000 Afghan relocation applicants. The leak, which occurred when an official sent an email with a hidden spreadsheet tab, is estimated to cost around £850m. Internal communications from the Information Commissioner's Office show staff questioned why the MoD was not fined for the breach. The incident is one of 49 separate data breaches within the unit handling Afghan applications over the past four years.</p>

          <p>In a provocative political move, California Republicans have proposed a resolution to split the state into two, separating the liberal coastal areas from the more conservative inland regions. The "two-state solution" is a response to a Democratic-led ballot initiative that seeks to redraw congressional districts, which Republicans argue would silence rural voices. While the proposal is highly unlikely to succeed, it serves as a messaging tool for the GOP to rally opposition against the redistricting plan ahead of a special election in November. Democrats have dismissed the idea as a political "stunt" and a form of gerrymandering itself.</p>

Despite the positive results and a projection of over 50% revenue growth for the next quarter, the company's stock declined in after-hours trading. The dip was attributed to data center revenue falling slightly short of analyst estimates for the second consecutive quarter. The report confirms the central role of Nvidia's technology in the global AI infrastructure boom, with the company expecting trillions in spending by the end of the decade.

          <p>Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair participated in a White House meeting with President Donald Trump to discuss future plans for Gaza after the current conflict. A US envoy confirmed that a "very comprehensive" plan for the "next day" in Gaza is being developed, though few details have been released. Blair previously served as a Middle East envoy focused on Palestinian economic development and a two-state solution. The meeting took place as the Israeli military warned of an "inevitable" evacuation of Gaza City, where a famine was recently declared, raising humanitarian concerns.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has taken formal steps to repeal the "Roadless Rule," a 2001 regulation that protects 58.5 million acres of undeveloped national forest land from road construction and logging. The Department of Agriculture announced its intent to roll back the rule, stating it would enable better fire risk management and timber production. Environmental groups have strongly condemned the move, arguing it will destroy critical wildlife habitats, increase erosion, and harm water quality. The rule protects 4.4 million acres in California alone, and its rescission is part of the administration's broader effort to loosen environmental regulations.</p>

While Sheinbaum vowed to prosecute any corrupt officials, her comments were met with skepticism from critics who point to a long history of narco-political ties. The issue is particularly sensitive as the U.S. considers potential unilateral actions against cartels in Mexico.</p>

These include purchasing a vehicle outside one's financial means, relying solely on dealership financing without securing a preapproved loan, and trading in a car with negative equity. The report also advises working with a dealership's internet sales team for better pricing and considering certified pre-owned vehicles to avoid the steep depreciation of a new car. With a record number of buyers committing to monthly payments over $1,000, these strategies are crucial for long-term financial health. (not investment advice)</p>
