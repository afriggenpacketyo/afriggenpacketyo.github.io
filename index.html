        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia is investing $1.1 billion to develop and deploy a fleet of underwater attack drones, known as "Ghost Sharks," with the first delivery expected in January. Defense Minister Richard Marles emphasized Australia's leading role in autonomous underwater military capabilities, noting that these drones will enhance undersea warfare capabilities and complement the country's future fleet of U.S. nuclear-powered submarines. The Ghost Sharks will be used for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and strike operations, and can be launched from both the shore and surface ships, bolstering Australia's defense strategy amid concerns over sea route security and China's growing naval presence in the region. The drones are designed to operate in increasingly congested undersea environments and are expected to provide a capability advantage for allies and partners.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to maintain its interest rates, citing ongoing economic uncertainty influenced by U.S. tariffs. The key deposit facility rate remains at 2%, consistent with the previous decision, as the ECB adopts a data-dependent approach without pre-committing to future rate adjustments. ECB President Christine Lagarde acknowledged that while recent trade agreements have reduced some uncertainty, the trade policy environment remains volatile, potentially impacting exports, investment, and consumption. Economists are divided on whether further rate cuts are likely, with some suggesting that tariffs and a stronger euro could warrant additional easing later in the year, while others believe the easing cycle has concluded due to the eurozone's resilient economy.

          <p>This article presents a timeline of events surrounding the disappearance of George Smith IV during his honeymoon cruise in 2005. Smith was last seen alive on July 4, 2005 and the next morning passengers discovered a large blood stain on the metal canopy of the ship. Passengers interviewed included Josh Askin, Rusty Kofman, Greg Rozenberg, and Zach Rozenberg, who claimed to have partied with Smith and escorted him back to his cabin. However, inconsistencies in their accounts and the discovery of blood in Smith's cabin led his family to suspect foul play, leading to an FBI investigation that has remained unresolved for years.

          <p>Peter Mandelson has been removed from his position as the UK's ambassador to the US following the resurfacing of his connections to Jeffrey Epstein. Appointed in December 2024 by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Mandelson was tasked with fostering relationships with the Trump administration due to his networking abilities. However, his past association with Epstein, which continued even after the latter's conviction, led to his dismissal, marking another setback in his career. Mandelson's career has been marked by both success and scandal, including previous resignations due to financial impropriety and allegations of misconduct. Optimism score for this article is 30.</p>

          <p>An activist group sending a flotilla of aid boats to Gaza, the Global Sumud Flotilla, reported that a second vessel was attacked by a drone while docked in Tunisia, one day after a similar strike. The group shared a video clip that they say shows the moment of the second attack, which appeared to show a fireball hitting the deck of the boat from above. Tunisian officials are investigating the incidents, with the Ministry of the Interior considering the second attack a deliberate act.

          <p>Kashmiri artisans are feeling the bite of Trump's tariffs on India, with concerns over reduced orders for Christmas and potential job losses. The US imposed tariffs of up to 50% on a range of Indian products, impacting the demand for Kashmiri handicrafts. US customers could turn to countries like Italy, where the US tariffs are capped at 15%. Experts warn that the new tariffs could cut exports by half and threaten between 500,000 and 700,000 artisanal jobs across India. Optimism score for this article is 35.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the recent military parade in Beijing was a missed opportunity for the EU and China to build bridges. The absence of many European leaders at the parade, which marked the 80th anniversary of victory against the Japanese invasion, represents a strategic miscalculation. EU leaders could have used the occasion to confront Putin and present a unified engagement plan for Ukraine. By refusing to engage, key European leaders missed a crucial opportunity to confront Putin. Optimism score for this article is 40.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes Trump's economic policies, describing them as a mix of Reaganite principles, state capitalism, and erratic interventions. The author argues that Trumponomics is less about economics and more about Trump's desire to control everything around him. Trump's formula involves declaring emergencies, making threats, and demanding tribute. The author suggests that Trump's personalist style of politics thrusts America back to the late 19th century and the Gilded Age, when corruption was rampant.
