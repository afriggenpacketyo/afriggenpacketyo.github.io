          <p>Elon Musk declared that SpaceX would immediately decommission its Dragon spacecraft due to President Trump's threat to cancel government contracts with Musk's businesses. This announcement came amid a growing dispute between Musk and Trump after Musk criticized the president's tax bill. Dragon is the only U.S. spacecraft capable of delivering crew to and from the International Space Station, and SpaceX has been developing a replacement. SpaceX has received over $20 billion in contracts from NASA and the Air Force since 2008, and the company was testing its Starship rocket, which recently exploded during its May launch. </p>

The judge warned that if such behavior continued, he would consider excluding Combs from the courtroom. Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges including racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, and prosecutors claim he used his business to abuse women and other individuals.</p>

Quintana, who ran the Instagram account @privatemeetz, faces at least a decade in prison. The charges represent a novel approach to target people involved in the racing scene who aren’t drivers, following an incident where a 24-year-old died at one of the events. The prosecution aims to curb street racing and related crimes in Southern California.</p>

The military alliance looks set to satisfy US President Donald Trump's demands to commit to a massive increase in defense spending. NATO head Mark Rutte proposed a plan that would total 5% of gross domestic product in defense investment. However, increasing military spending to 5% of GDP would be an enormous strain on public finances, particularly as Europe's major economies face tough times.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has blocked Mexico's lawsuit against U.S. gun manufacturers, which sought to hold them accountable for violence by drug cartels. The case centered on whether the Mexican government could sue U.S. manufacturers over claims that they shared blame for violence by drug cartels. The decision marks a significant setback for Mexico's efforts to address gun violence.</p>
