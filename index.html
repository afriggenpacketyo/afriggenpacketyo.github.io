          <p>As U.S. and Russian leaders prepare to meet in Alaska without Ukrainian representation, soldiers on the front lines remain focused on their daily battles. A Ukrainian Marine Corps Colonel stated that speculation about a ceasefire is premature, as the intensity of Russian attacks has not diminished. Ukrainian forces continue to depend on crucial military support from the U.S. and European allies to defend their positions. The sentiment among troops is that the war continues regardless of high-level diplomatic talks.</p>

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called on Tokyo to confront its historical actions and adopt a clear stance on Taiwan. Wang emphasized that international documents from the post-war era confirm Taiwan as a territory stolen from China, making its return a required outcome of the war. He criticized factions in Japan that attempt to glorify past aggression and distort history. The statement underscores the ongoing geopolitical tensions between the two nations over historical memory and regional sovereignty.</p>

          <p>South Korea's president announced intentions to restore a 2018 military de-escalation agreement with North Korea to ease tensions along their shared border. The plan involves ending certain military activities and re-establishing buffer and no-fly zones that were part of the original pact, which dissolved amid rising hostilities. The South Korean leader stated his government has already taken steps like halting propaganda broadcasts and leaflet balloon launches. He expressed hope that North Korea would reciprocate these efforts to rebuild trust and resume dialogue.</p>

The incident involved flights bound for Paris and Gibraltar, and passengers from both aircraft were safely disembarked. An eyewitness on the Gibraltar flight described feeling a significant shudder, comparing the impact to a car crash. Flights at the airport were briefly suspended for a safety assessment before resuming normal operations, while replacement aircraft were arranged for the affected passengers.</p>

This move signals a notable shift from founder Ray Dalio's previously bullish stance on investing in the country, reflecting weakening investor confidence in the Chinese market.

          <p>International talks in Geneva aimed at creating a landmark treaty to combat plastic pollution have ended in a deadlock without an agreement. Negotiators from over 100 nations were unable to resolve a fundamental split between countries advocating for caps on new plastic production and oil-producing states focused on waste management and recycling. This failure marks another setback in the effort to address the global plastic crisis, which scientists warn poses significant risks to both environmental and human health. The lack of consensus means the world falls further behind its goal of establishing a legally binding solution.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has formally requested that the prime minister allow him to appoint peers to the House of Lords, citing a "democratic disparity." In a letter, Farage argued that his party's significant vote share in the last general election and subsequent local election successes warrant representation in the upper chamber. He pointed out that parties with fewer votes and MPs, such as the Green Party and Plaid Cymru, currently have peers, while Reform UK has none. Downing Street responded that appointments follow established conventions.</p>

The company reported a dip in second-quarter sales volumes, consistent with industry-wide trends.

          <p>Surrey Police have launched a campaign called "Jog On" to combat the street harassment of female joggers. The initiative involves plain-clothed female officers running in targeted areas, with uniformed colleagues nearby to intervene when catcalling or other forms of harassment occur. One undercover officer reported being honked at twice within a short period, highlighting the prevalence of the issue. The campaign was prompted by a local survey where 94% of female residents reported experiencing harassment, yet nearly half never reported it to the police.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has started accepting commercial bookings for missions to Mars, with Italy's space agency, ASI, becoming the first confirmed client. ASI plans to send scientific experiments, including a plant growth module and a weather station, on one of SpaceX's initial commercial flights. The announcement comes despite the fact that SpaceX's Starship, the massive rocket essential for Mars missions, has yet to complete a successful orbital test flight. This move signals a new phase in the commercialization of interplanetary travel, though a timeline for the first launch has not been provided. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) stating that governments have a legal obligation to protect the environment from emissions is putting financial markets on notice. The ruling, described as the most significant climate development since the Paris Agreement, found that fossil fuel production and subsidies may constitute an "internationally wrongful act." According to an Allianz board member, this creates a new legal risk that requires prudent investors to re-evaluate assets tied to fossil fuels, as some national courts are likely to follow the ICJ's guidance.

          <p>The security firm Vectus Global, founded by former Blackwater head Erik Prince, is set to deploy nearly 200 international personnel to Haiti. The one-year contract aims to help the Haitian government combat rampant gang violence and reclaim territory controlled by armed groups. This development raises concerns about the use of private military contractors in the fragile nation, which is already struggling with a U.N.-backed mission. The move underscores the severity of Haiti's security crisis, where gangs control vast areas and violence has displaced over a million people.</p>

          <p>The upcoming summit between U.S. and Russian leaders carries high stakes for the war in Ukraine, focusing on several critical issues. Key among them are territorial disputes, with Russia occupying about a fifth of Ukraine and Kyiv unwilling to concede more land. Another major point is security guarantees, as Ukraine seeks protection while Russia demands neutrality and demilitarization. The discussion will also likely cover the lifting of economic sanctions on Russia, accountability for war crimes, and the release of thousands of prisoners of war held by both sides.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a crackdown on homeless encampments in Washington, D.C., as part of its "Making D.C. Safe and Beautiful Task Force." The operation involves National Guard troops and federal officers clearing out sites near prominent federal buildings, displacing individuals who have been living in tents. Those affected describe the experience as frightening and persecutory, feeling they are being treated like eyesores. Advocacy groups and local religious leaders have criticized the move, emphasizing that the people being removed are human beings in need of support, not just problems to be cleared away.</p>

          <p>China's economy showed signs of faltering in July, with key data on retail sales and industrial output falling short of expectations. Retail sales grew 3.7% year-over-year, missing forecasts and slowing from the previous month, while industrial output also rose less than anticipated. The slowdown is attributed to persistent weak domestic demand, an unpredictable external environment, and government efforts to curb excess industrial capacity. Fixed-asset investment also decelerated, with the contraction in the property sector worsening, raising concerns about achieving the full-year growth target. (not investment advice)</p>

The meeting's primary goal is to find a path to end the war in Ukraine, though Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is not attending.

The guidelines also reaffirm the importance of limiting sodium to 2,300 mg daily, ideally 1,500 mg. Additionally, clinicians are now encouraged to recommend lifestyle changes for stage 1 hypertension, an earlier intervention than previously advised.</p>
