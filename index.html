          <p>Hurricane Erick, the fifth named storm of the Eastern Pacific hurricane season, has rapidly intensified into a Category 2 storm and is projected to become a major hurricane as it approaches southern Mexico. The National Hurricane Center issued warnings for potentially destructive winds and life-threatening flash floods across portions of southern Mexico. The storm is expected to bring significant rainfall, leading to dangerous flooding and mudslides, particularly in areas with steep terrain. Acapulco, which was previously devastated by Hurricane Otis in 2023, is in the projected path of Erick, raising concerns about further damage and displacement, with preparations to protect life and property being rushed to completion. Optimism surrounding the situation is low due to the potential for widespread destruction and loss of life.</p>

          <p>Mohamed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national, is accused of using Molotov cocktails in Boulder, Colorado, injuring 12 people. During a preliminary hearing, the FBI testified that Soliman used Israeli flags to identify and target individuals he considered Zionists. Investigators found the number "1187" on clothing items in his car, which they believe refers to the year Israel was liberated by Muslims. Soliman's attorney argued that his client differentiated between Zionists and Jews, and that the number 1187 could refer to other significant dates, but the judge found probable cause for the case to move forward, leaving the final decision to a jury.</p>

          <p>The British government is expanding the Warm Home Discount scheme, providing Â£150 off energy bills to millions more households this winter. The change scraps the previous qualification based on property size and energy score, allowing 2.7 million additional homes, including nearly a million with children, to benefit. Energy companies will fund the expansion, potentially leading to a slight increase in bills for all customers through the Standing Charge. While debt charities and energy groups welcome the move, some argue the scheme still excludes vulnerable individuals on non-means tested benefits, and Simon Francis from the End Fuel Poverty Coalition suggests the discount should be even higher given current energy costs.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate, continuing a "wait-and-see" approach while evaluating the impact of economic policies. The central bank anticipates inflation to rise in the coming months but still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the economy's relative strength, citing a low unemployment rate and improved sentiment, while also acknowledging that tariffs could increase inflation and slow economic growth. The Fed's decision reflects a cautious approach amid mixed economic signals and ongoing trade developments (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for terminating a specialized LGBTQ+ suicide lifeline option within the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) announced that the "Press 3 option" would be discontinued to focus on serving all help seekers, though it's unclear if staff for the specialized line will be affected. Advocates like Jaymes Black, CEO of The Trevor Project, condemned the move as devastating, arguing it removes a crucial resource for LGBTQ+ youth. Senator Tammy Baldwin also criticized the decision, calling it a step back during Pride Month that tells LGBTQ+ kids they don't matter.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of murdering her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe, in a retrial, nearly a year after her first trial ended in a mistrial. The jury acquitted her of second-degree murder, manslaughter, and leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death, but found her guilty of operating under the influence of liquor, for which she received one-year probation. Prosecutors alleged Read hit O'Keefe with her car after a night of drinking and left him to die in a blizzard, while the defense argued O'Keefe was attacked and beaten by others. Read thanked her supporters and stated that no one fought harder for justice for John O'Keefe than she did.</p>

Military experts suggest that multiple strikes would be needed, and even then, the extent of the damage would be uncertain.

However, the drug's high cost, roughly $28,000 a year, could limit access, particularly in countries with the highest HIV burden.

          <p>President Trump's decision on whether to involve the U.S. in the conflict between Israel and Iran has revealed deep divisions among his supporters. While Trump has often criticized "stupid endless wars," he has also maintained that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. This dilemma has pitted the isolationist and hawkish wings of his party against each other, with figures like Tulsi Gabbard expressing doubt about Iran's nuclear plans and others advocating for intervention. The situation highlights the complex challenges Trump faces in balancing his foreign policy priorities and managing conflicting views within his base.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans largely support President Trump's handling of the conflict between Iran and Israel, trusting his judgment on whether the U.S. should get involved. Trump has stated he will decide at the last moment whether to intervene, a stance that has divided his MAGA base. While some Republicans advocate for the use of force if diplomacy fails, others emphasize Trump's campaign promise to avoid foreign wars. Democrats are urging Trump to de-escalate the conflict and seek congressional approval before taking military action, reflecting a broader debate on the U.S.'s role in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>As tensions escalate between Israel and Iran, the U.S. is considering military involvement, potentially using "bunker buster" bombs to target Iran's underground nuclear facilities. These bombs, designed to penetrate deep below the surface before exploding, include the GBU-57 MOP (Massive Ordnance Penetrator), which only the U.S. possesses. Experts believe the GBU-57 could cause significant damage to facilities like Fordo, but the effectiveness in halting Iran's nuclear program is debated. Concerns also exist about the potential release of radioactive material if such a strike occurs.</p>

When the team's general manager attempted to deflect the question, Trump continued to press the issue.

          <p>Experts suggest that if the U.S. were to strike Iran's Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, the risk of widespread radioactive contamination is low. The plant primarily processes uranium in the form of uranium hexafluoride, a heavy gas molecule that is unlikely to travel far. Edwin Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists notes that the uranium isotopes found at the facility are at the low end of hazard, and any environmental release would likely result in relatively low-level contamination. However, the gas can react with water in the air to form hydrofluoric acid, an acutely hazardous material.</p>
