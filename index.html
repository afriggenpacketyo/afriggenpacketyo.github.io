          <p>An aid flotilla, including activist Greta Thunberg and actor Liam Cunningham, has departed for the Gaza Strip to deliver humanitarian supplies and challenge the Israeli blockade. The convoy aims to bring attention to the dire conditions in Gaza, where food experts have warned of famine amid the ongoing conflict. This mission follows previous attempts by activists to reach the territory, some of which were intercepted by the Israeli military, underscoring the high risks involved in their effort to provide relief.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington D.C. has issued a temporary restraining order, preventing the U.S. government from deporting ten unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The ruling came after advocacy groups filed a legal challenge, arguing the removals would violate federal laws that provide specific protections for vulnerable minors. The judge's 14-day block allows for a hearing on the matter, pausing a policy that was part of a broader immigration crackdown and providing a brief reprieve for the children involved.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has reported the death of an infant from whooping cough, marking the first such fatality in the UK this year. The baby's mother had not been vaccinated against the illness during pregnancy, a key measure recommended to protect newborns from the severe bacterial infection. This tragic event highlights growing concerns among health officials about declining vaccination rates for childhood diseases and increased vaccine hesitancy, which have left communities more vulnerable to preventable outbreaks.</p>

The raids occurred as the group increased security following an Israeli airstrike that killed the Houthi prime minister and several other senior officials. This action is the latest in a series of Houthi crackdowns on international aid organizations operating in the war-torn country, further complicating already critical humanitarian efforts and escalating regional tensions.</p>

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore stated he is focused on "fighting for my communities," not engaging in a personal fight with President Donald Trump over crime in Baltimore. The dispute escalated after Trump criticized the city and threatened to send in the National Guard, an offer Moore described as "performative." While acknowledging ongoing challenges, Moore highlighted recent progress in reducing crime and argued for more federal support for local law enforcement instead of what he views as cynical political criticism.</p>

          <p>EU foreign ministers are considering several new measures to support Ukraine, including the possibility of secondary sanctions on Russia's trading partners to weaken its war machine. Other proposals discussed include establishing Ukrainian arms production facilities on EU soil as a "safe haven" and finding ways to utilize frozen Russian assets to aid Kyiv's reconstruction. The brainstorming session also touched on shifting the EU's military training mission onto Ukrainian soil post-ceasefire, reflecting a long-term strategic adjustment to the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Dr. Céline Gounder, a CBS News medical contributor, has raised concerns about a significant leadership vacuum at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after the recent ouster of its director and other key officials. In an interview, she explained that these departures affect crucial public health functions, including vaccine policy, which she says is now being driven by political influence rather than a transparent scientific process. Gounder warned that this shift is already causing confusion and could undermine long-standing vaccination programs.</p>

          <p>Musician John Fogerty, who recently turned 80, has released a new album of re-recorded hits from his time with Creedence Clearwater Revival. After a long and painful legal battle where he lost control of his own songs, Fogerty was encouraged by his wife to buy back the rights and re-record the music with his sons. In an interview, he reflects on the difficult period where he stopped performing his own classics and how this new project has allowed him to reconnect with his legacy.</p>

          <p>Two climate activists were arrested after smearing red and black paint on Barcelona's iconic Sagrada Familia basilica. The protest, organized by the group Futuro Vegetal, was intended to highlight government inaction on the climate crisis, which they link to the devastating summer wildfires that have swept across Spain. The group alleges that a significant portion of the fires are related to livestock farming and that the government is complicit in the environmental destruction, using the landmark to draw global attention.</p>

          <p>Germany is marking the ten-year anniversary of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous declaration, "wir schaffen das" ("we can do it"), which opened the country's borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees in 2015. The policy profoundly changed German society and politics, and a decade later, the nation is taking stock of both its successes and challenges. While data shows nearly two-thirds of refugees from that wave are now employed, issues of integration and a surge in support for the far-right continue to dominate the conversation.</p>

          <p>Following a disappointing 14-7 season-opening loss to Ohio State, Texas quarterback Arch Manning took responsibility for his performance, stating it was "ultimately not good enough." Manning, the highly anticipated nephew of NFL legends Peyton and Eli Manning, completed 17 of 30 passes with one touchdown and one interception. Head coach Steve Sarkisian defended his young quarterback, criticizing the "out of control" external expectations and urging patience, saying, "let's finish the book before we judge it."</p>
