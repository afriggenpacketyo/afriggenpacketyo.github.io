          <p>Marco Rubio has become the head of four government bodies, including Secretary of State, acting administrator of U.S.A.I.D., acting archivist for the National Archives, and interim national security advisor. This unprecedented accumulation of titles raises concerns about his ability to effectively manage all responsibilities, especially given President Trump's unconventional governance style. While supporters cite Trump's trust in Rubio and his relationship with chief of staff Susie Wiles, critics question potential conflicts of interest and practical challenges in fulfilling all duties. The article also mentions historical precedents, such as Henry Kissinger holding two similar roles, and notes the controversy surrounding Rubio's appointments, particularly the firing of the head archivist. The article highlights the debate around Rubio's expanded influence and its implications for the administration's effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party secured a narrow victory in a parliamentary special election in Runcorn and Helsby, signaling a potential shift in British politics. Sarah Pochin, Reform's candidate, won by a mere six votes, seizing a seat previously held by the Labour Party. This outcome marks a significant win for Reform, potentially leading to further gains in mayoral and local council elections. The article notes that the victory was driven by anti-incumbent sentiment, dissatisfaction with the economy, and tensions over immigration, particularly concerning a local hotel housing migrants. The article also mentions the potential impact on Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the Labour Party, as well as the vulnerability of the Conservatives.</p>

Inspired by Monica L. Miller's book on Black Dandyism, the exhibition will examine how tailoring has shaped Black identities and challenged social hierarchies. The event will be co-chaired by figures like Colman Domingo, Lewis Hamilton, and Pharrell Williams, with a host committee including Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. The article also revisits iconic Met Gala moments from past years, such as Rihanna's papal-inspired ensemble and Doja Cat's feline transformation.

          <p>The Secure 2.0 Act brings a significant change to 401(k) catch-up contributions in 2025, allowing workers aged 60 to 63 to contribute up to $11,250, an increase from the standard $7,500 for those 50 and older. This "super funding" opportunity aims to help older investors boost their retirement savings. However, some retirement plans may not have added this feature, and many workers may not be able to afford to maximize their contributions. Financial experts emphasize the higher catch-up as a valuable tool, especially for higher earners seeking tax deductions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California State Senator Tony Strickland is advocating for policy reforms following the planned early release of an illegal immigrant convicted of DUI manslaughter in 2021. The senator believes changes are needed to programs like the in-prison credit system that may have allowed Oscar Eduardo Ortega-Anguiano to be released early. Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's office stated that California will coordinate with ICE to transfer Ortega-Anguiano before his release. Strickland argues that the plan for early release is a disservice to the victims' families and emphasizes the need for accountability in the criminal justice system.</p>

The appointment follows Michael Waltz's departure as national security adviser.

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street expectations, though profits declined compared to the previous year due to falling oil prices. Volume growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana, combined with cost-cutting measures, helped offset the impact of weaker oil prices. The company's global production business saw an increase in earnings, while U.S. production segment profits soared. The article notes that Exxon returned $9.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway investors are eagerly anticipating Warren Buffett's guidance at the company's annual shareholder meeting, as tariffs and economic uncertainty shake markets. The meeting marks the 60th anniversary of Buffett leading the company and the second without Charlie Munger. Investors are keen to hear Buffett's perspective on the economy, his strategy for deploying Berkshire's large cash pile, and his rationale for reducing the company's Apple stake. Many view Buffett as a "north star" for navigating turbulent economic times. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As debates intensify over President Donald Trump's policy agenda, changes to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction could benefit higher earners. The $10,000 limit on the federal SALT deduction, enacted in 2017, is set to expire after 2025 unless Congress acts. While Trump previously enacted the $10,000 SALT cap, he has since expressed support for reform. Lawmakers are considering various updates, including a complete repeal or a higher deduction limit. The article highlights the potential impact on taxpayers in high-tax states.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic analyzes the true horror in Ryan Cooglerâ€™s film 'Sinners' as not the supernatural, but the economic realities of Jim Crow South. The film follows twin gangsters trying to strike it rich in Mississippi, but the article argues that the economics of segregation drive every event in the plot. The author explores how the strict separations of the Jim Crow economy, including labor arrangements like convict leasing and sharecropping, make upward mobility nearly impossible for Black people, ultimately exposing the twins to supernatural horror.</p>

          <p>American cities, particularly in California, are increasingly adopting tiny homes and stricter laws to address homelessness, following a Supreme Court ruling that allows cities to enforce anti-camping bans. These cities are expanding "interim housing" options, like tiny house shelters and motel rooms, to move people more quickly off the street. Critics worry this creates a two-tiered housing system, but officials see it as a faster and cheaper solution than permanent supportive housing. This approach is gaining traction nationally, with discussions around using Housing Choice Vouchers to fund interim housing.</p>

          <p>Rebecca Patterson, a former chief investment strategist at Bridgewater, cautions that many foreign investors are becoming wary of investing in America, not only due to the Trump administration's tariff policy but also broader concerns about the potential weaponizing of capital markets. She suggests that these investors are gradually reducing their exposure to U.S. assets, which could have a significant impact on U.S. markets. Even a small reduction in global participation could present a problem for U.S. markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chevron's stock price fell after the oil major reported a decline in profit, influenced by the steep drop in oil prices this year. The company plans to repurchase a smaller amount of its own stock in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Chevron's U.S. production business experienced a decrease in profit due to higher operating expenses and lower commodity prices. While the U.S. refining business swung to a profit, its earnings declined significantly due to lower margins on refined product sales.</p>
