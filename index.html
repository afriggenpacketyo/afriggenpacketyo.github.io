          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed reinstating an "asset test" for low-income and disabled Medi-Cal applicants, requiring them to prove their assets total less than $2,000 to be eligible. This proposal aims to address rising costs associated with Medi-Cal, which have increased significantly in recent years due to enrollment surges and higher pharmacy costs. The asset test would include the value of a person's primary home, vehicle, or retirement fund. Health and disability advocates are criticizing the proposal, arguing that it would force vulnerable populations into extreme poverty and result in people losing healthcare coverage.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas is experiencing a decline in casual tourism due to inflation and higher prices, even though convention traffic remains strong. Hotel occupancy has slipped, and international visitors, who tend to spend more, are visiting less frequently. Tourists are also dealing with heavy traffic due to construction and road closures. While some visitors are still spending on concerts and events, the city is working to remain resilient and attract visitors during the summer.</p>

          <p>A US-Israeli backed Gaza aid plan, operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), has faced chaotic scenes and criticism. The GHF aims to bypass the UN as the main supplier of aid, but it has been condemned and boycotted by aid agencies. Distribution centers have been overrun by desperate civilians, with reports of gunshots and projectiles being thrown. Concerns have been raised about the disorganization, lack of communication, and military control over aid operations, undermining faith in aid efforts.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is investigating a near collision between United Airlines and SkyWest Airlines planes at San Francisco International Airport. The incident occurred on May 13 when a United flight veered into the path of a SkyWest flight during takeoff without authorization. The United jet reportedly made a sharp turn to the left instead of turning right, coming within 0.4 nautical miles horizontally and 280 feet vertically of the SkyWest plane. United Airlines stated that it is reviewing the incident.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the US will double its current tariff rate on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%, starting on Wednesday. Speaking at a rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Trump said the move would help boost the local steel industry and national supply, while decreasing reliance on China. Trump also said that $14 billion would be invested into the area's steel production through a partnership between US Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel. The announcement is the latest turn in Trump's rollercoaster approach to tariffs since re-entering office in January.</p>

Critics argue her past association with El Chapo should disqualify her, but she defends her role as providing an adequate technical defense for a human being. She is one of 19 "high risk candidates" due to her past work with a cartel, with concerns that she could be pressured to show loyalty.
