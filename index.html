          <p>A 27-foot Chris-Craft boat capsized on Lake Tahoe due to a large swell, resulting in the deaths of six adults. Two other individuals were rescued and hospitalized, while a search was initiated for two additional missing people. The Coast Guard suspended the search on Sunday morning after covering over 390 square miles, pending further developments. ALERTCalifornia cameras showed clear skies before a storm system brought snow to the area around 3 p.m., with winds reaching 40-45 mph, before the skies cleared again an hour later.

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is gaining renewed attention as Japan faces the potential absence of giant pandas for the first time in over half a century. Amidst escalating Sino-U.S. tensions, Beijing might use panda loans to stabilize relations with Tokyo, often revealing such decisions during high-level bilateral talks. Despite the pandas' historical role as symbols of friendship and economic drivers through tourism, their diplomatic weight may be diminishing. Experts suggest that China's agreement with Tokyo to resume importing Japanese marine products signals an effort to improve relations, potentially supported by a new panda allocation during a future meeting between Japanese and Chinese leaders.</p>

          <p>A Tennessee judge ordered the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation has become a focal point in immigration debates, as he awaits a federal trial on human smuggling charges. However, it is expected that ICE will take him into custody, potentially leading to deportation before his trial. The judge acknowledged the likely ICE detention but emphasized the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair determination of custody pending trial. Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty, and his attorneys argue the smuggling charges are an attempt to justify the initial deportation mistake, with his lawyers pointing out that a 2019 order prevents his deportation to El Salvador due to gang threats.</p>

          <p>As the use of artificial intelligence expands rapidly, researchers are uncovering more instances of potentially harmful responses, including hate speech, copyright infringements, and sexual content. The emergence of these issues is exacerbated by insufficient regulations and inadequate testing of AI models. Researchers suggest evaluating risks in AI through practices like red teaming, where individuals test AI systems to uncover potential harm. They advocate for opening testing to third parties, such as users, journalists, and ethical hackers, and adopting standardized AI flaw reports to better understand and manage the risks posed by AI tools.</p>

          <p>The Islamic State is suspected to be behind a deadly suicide bombing at a Greek Orthodox church in Dweil'a, near Damascus, resulting in at least 22 deaths and 63 injuries. The attack commenced with the perpetrator opening fire on worshipers before detonating an explosive device. Syrian Interior Ministry spokesman Noureddine Al-Baba suggested ISIS was the likely culprit following a preliminary investigation, emphasizing that the security of places of worship is a red line. The Syrian foreign ministry echoed this sentiment, condemning the attack as a desperate attempt to undermine national coexistence and destabilize the country.</p>

Wong highlighted that the action was a unilateral move by the U.S., and Australia joins other nations in calling for Iran to resume discussions. The Australian government has closed its embassy in Tehran and suspended bus evacuations from Israel following the U.S. strike. There are approximately 2,900 Australians in Iran and 1,300 in Iraq seeking to leave, and Australia has deployed two defense planes to the Middle East to assist with civilian evacuations.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) experienced a record-low result in Sunday's Tokyo assembly election, seen as a prelude to July's House of Councillors race. This outcome further strains his minority government in national politics. Tomin First no Kai, a regional party established by Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, secured the most seats, indicating the popularity of her public welfare and child-rearing policies.

          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships reveals that parents who avoid defiance in their children do not use threats, bribes, or harsh consequences. Instead, they use language that encourages cooperation by honoring a child's autonomy while maintaining boundaries. Phrases such as "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," and "Stop crying. You're fine" can trigger a child's fight-or-flight response. The study suggests alternative phrases that foster respect, emotional safety, and involvement, leading to children who are more trusting, self-regulating, and emotionally resilient.</p>

          <p>Concerns are rising about possible Iranian retaliation following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, including the potential for Iran to block oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Hormuz, a crucial trade passage connecting the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman, facilitates the transit of millions of barrels of oil and petroleum products daily. Iran controls the northern side of the strait, making it a vital oil "chokepoint" globally. Disruptions to oil flow through the strait could severely impact international energy markets and economies, potentially driving up oil and gas prices.</p>

          <p>New satellite photos reveal the aftermath of the U.S. military strike on Iran's Fordo nuclear facility and two other key locations. The mission, dubbed "Operation Midnight Hammer," involved dropping multiple 30,000-pound "bunker-buster" bombs on Fordo and hitting Natanz and Isfahan. The satellite images show damage to the mountainside where the underground nuclear site at Fordo is buried, including large diameter holes and blocked tunnel entrances. At Isfahan, satellite images show extensive building damage, and at Natanz, a crater is visible over part of the underground military complex.</p>

          <p>Iran launched a wave of missiles at Israel on Sunday morning, wounding at least 21 people, after the U.S. joined Israel's attacks on Iranian nuclear sites. Iranian missiles impacted four sites across Israel, and searches are underway for people believed to be trapped under the rubble of a collapsed building in Tel Aviv. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported that Iran launched about 30 missiles at Israel. Israel later responded with fighter jet strikes in Iran, targeting missile and drone sites.

          <p>President Trump's decision to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities was based on his belief that Iran is close to being able to make the ultimate weapon, despite his intelligence agencies' assessment that Iran suspended its nuclear-weapons program in 2003. CIA Director John Ratcliffe has laid out what the intelligence agencies know, particularly about Iran’s uranium stockpiles, and said Iran was clearly trying to build a nuclear weapon. Senior administration officials take little comfort in Khamenei’s decades-old halt to the nuclear-weapons program, with Trump believing that Iran is actively pursuing everything it would need to build a weapon.</p>
