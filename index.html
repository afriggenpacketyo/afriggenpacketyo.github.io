          <p>A Connecticut law that allows towing companies to sell towed vehicles just 15 days after seizure is facing criticism for being predatory and targeting working-class communities. Residents shared stories of losing their cars over minor issues like expired registrations because they couldn't afford the high fees in such a short time. An investigation by CBS News observed one company, MyHoopty.com LLC, actively targeting apartment complexes. The company's owner defended the practice as enforcing the rules of the properties.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed into law a major legislative package that makes his 2017 tax cuts permanent while also enacting significant federal spending cuts. The bill, which passed Congress on a narrow margin, allocates increased funding for border security and defense but reduces spending on social safety-net programs like Medicaid. Critics, including the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, project the law will add over $3 trillion to the national debt, raising concerns among Democrats about its long-term fiscal impact.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to some claims, the new tax and spending bill does not eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits for most recipients. Instead, the legislation introduces a new temporary "bonus" tax deduction for seniors, which can lower their overall taxable income. Policy experts note this is different from repealing the tax on benefits and that the primary beneficiaries will be higher-income seniors, not those who already pay no federal income tax. The measure could also place additional financial pressure on the Social Security trust fund. (not investment advice)</p>

The legal battle centered on whether the migrants had a right to contest their deportation by raising fears of torture or death in the destination country.

These creatures gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the ocean's surface in Antarctica before migrating to the deep sea, where they effectively lock away vast amounts of carbon. Scientists estimate this seasonal migration sequesters as much carbon as the annual emissions of 55 million cars. This discovery underscores the critical but often overlooked importance of these small organisms in the planet's climate regulation system.</p>

          <p>Germany started its Women's Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory over Poland, thanks to goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. However, the win was overshadowed by a potentially serious knee injury to captain Giulia Gwinn, who left the pitch in tears during the first half. Gwinn has a history of two prior ACL injuries, creating significant concern about her ability to continue in the tournament. While the team secured a crucial three points, the loss of their captain could be a major blow for the eight-time champions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order that will change policies at U.S. national parks, including charging foreign tourists higher entry fees. The order also mandates preferential treatment for U.S. residents in lotteries or permit systems for recreational access. Additionally, the directive revokes a 2017 memorandum that promoted diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts within the management of public lands. The move aligns with the administration's broader policy of ending DEI programs across the federal government.</p>

          <p>The article explores the dynamic between India and China within Global South alliances like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and Brics. Both organizations require consensus for decision-making, a rule that often allows India to act as a check on China's influence. A recent SCO defense ministers' meeting highlighted this tension, as the members failed to release a joint statement due to a lack of consensus over language concerning terrorism. This reflects the ongoing strategic rivalry between the two nations for leadership within these key geopolitical blocs.</p>
