          <p>A large explosion and fire struck the Shahid Rajaee port in southern Iran, resulting in eight fatalities and over 750 injuries. The incident occurred amidst ongoing nuclear negotiations between Iran and the United States in Oman, adding to regional tensions. While Iranian officials denied any connection to the oil industry, reports suggest the blast may have involved a shipment of "sodium perchlorate rocket fuel" intended for Iran's missile program, potentially linked to attacks on Israel. The incident is under investigation, with social media footage indicating a possible chemical compound involvement, raising concerns about safety protocols at the strategically important port.</p>

          <p>The arrest of Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan by the FBI has ignited a political firestorm, with Republicans demanding her removal and Democrats decrying executive overreach.

          <p>The Cleveland Browns selected Shedeur Sanders, ending a remarkable and unexpected slide in the NFL draft. Sanders, a highly touted quarterback from Colorado and son of NFL legend Deion Sanders, was projected as a first-round pick but fell to the fifth round. Concerns about his size and the potential media circus surrounding him contributed to his drop. He now joins a quarterback room that includes Dillon Gabriel, creating competition for the starting role following Deshaun Watson's injury. The Browns are hoping Sanders can prove his worth and overcome the doubts that led to his draft day fall.</p>

          <p>Shedeur Sanders, once considered a top NFL prospect, experienced a surprising drop in the draft before being selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round. Despite his impressive college career at Jackson State and Colorado, concerns about his size, arm strength, and the media attention surrounding his father, Deion Sanders, may have contributed to the slide. Sanders will now compete for a quarterback position with the Browns, who had already drafted Dillon Gabriel earlier in the draft. This marks a new chapter for Sanders as he seeks to prove his talent and overcome doubts at the professional level.</p>

          <p>Analyst Craig Moffett casts doubt on Apple's plans to shift iPhone assembly to India, citing the continued reliance on Chinese-made components. Moffett argues that moving assembly alone won't significantly reduce costs associated with tariffs and that Apple's supply chain will remain heavily anchored in China. He also suggests that potential backlash against Apple in China due to U.S. tariffs could negatively impact iPhone sales. Moffett recently lowered his price target for Apple, expressing concerns about valuation and potential deceleration in consumer demand. (not investment advice)</p>
