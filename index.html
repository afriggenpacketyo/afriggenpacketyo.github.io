          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' former assistant, identified as "Mia," concluded her testimony in the ongoing sexual assault and sex trafficking trial, facing intense cross-examination from Combs' defense attorney, Brian Steel. Mia recounted instances of alleged torment and sexual assault during her employment, while the defense challenged her credibility by presenting affectionate text messages and social media posts she sent to Combs. Prosecutors sought to reinforce her testimony by highlighting that her social media posts were curated for professional purposes and did not reflect the alleged abuse she endured. The trial continues with further witnesses and evidence being presented. Optimism regarding the outcome of the trial is uncertain given the conflicting narratives presented. The prosecution aims to demonstrate a pattern of coercion and abuse, while the defense seeks to discredit the witnesses and challenge the evidence.</p>

          <p>A demonstration in Boulder, Colorado, organized by Run for Their Lives, a group advocating for the release of Israeli hostages, was attacked, resulting in injuries to twelve people. The attacker, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, confessed to planning the attack for a year, motivated by a desire to kill "all Zionist people." He used Molotov cocktails and yelled "Free Palestine" during the assault. The incident has heightened concerns about antisemitism and tensions surrounding the Israel-Hamas war in the United States. Despite the attack, organizers have vowed to continue demonstrating, emphasizing their focus on humanity and raising awareness of the hostages' plight.</p>

          <p>In the Karen Read murder trial, text messages sent by the lead homicide detective, Michael Proctor, have become a focal point, potentially impacting the state's case. These messages, revealed during the trial, contain crass remarks about Read and express early opinions on the investigation, raising concerns about potential bias. Proctor has since been fired from the Massachusetts State Police for sharing sensitive information about the case, but the defense opted to introduce the texts through a different witness. The defense aims to show that Proctor reached a premature conclusion about O'Keefe's death, possibly overlooking other evidence. The impact of these messages on the jury's perception of the case remains to be seen.</p>

          <p>The upcoming Tokyo metropolitan assembly election on June 22 is being viewed as a crucial test for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's long-term political prospects. The outcome of this local race could significantly impact national politics, potentially leading to Ishiba's resignation if his party performs poorly. Ishiba's waning popularity stems from concerns about his economic policies and attempts to curb rising rice prices, which have faced criticism even within his own party. The election's historical significance as a bellwether for national sentiment adds pressure to Ishiba's administration, especially amidst declining cabinet approval ratings and challenges in tariff negotiations with the United States. This political climate presents a formidable challenge for Ishiba as he navigates domestic and international pressures.</p>

          <p>Due to rising prices caused by tariffs, Geng Xiaoyun, a restaurant owner in Beijing, has had to remove American chicken feet from the menu, a once-popular delicacy. The tariffs have increased the price of American chicken feet by 30% since March, making them unaffordable for his restaurant. While Geng has found alternative sources in Brazil and Russia, he believes they do not match the quality of the American product. Geng hopes that the situation will improve and that he can once again serve American chicken feet, contingent on changes in the global political landscape. This situation illustrates the real-world effects of international trade policies on local businesses and consumers.</p>

Scholten aims to make the race a referendum on President Trump's trade policies, particularly their impact on Iowa soybean farmers. While Iowa's House seats are considered competitive, Democrats face an uphill battle in winning a Senate race in the state.

The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell to 48.3, signaling a decline in foreign demand due to prohibitive U.S. tariffs. New export orders dropped to their lowest level since July 2023, and total new orders also contracted. The job market remained weak, with employment shrinking at the fastest rate since January.

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department is increasing pressure on California school districts to prohibit transgender athletes from participating in school sports, threatening legal action for non-compliance. Assistant Atty. Gen. Harmeet Dhillon argues that allowing transgender athletes to compete violates the rights of cisgender girls, citing constitutional concerns. The warning follows the success of a transgender athlete at the state high school track and field championships, despite previous threats from President Trump. California officials are reviewing the letter and remain committed to defending the rights of all students, including transgender students, to be free from discrimination and harassment. The situation highlights the ongoing debate and legal battles surrounding transgender rights in sports.</p>

          <p>Lee Jae-myung, the opposition party leader in South Korea, is projected to win the country's snap presidential election, according to a Gallup poll cited by Yonhap. A win for Lee would determine the trajectory of South Korea's trade negotiations with the U.S., and policies on China and North Korea. Lee's eligibility for the presidency was in doubt after he was charged with breaching election laws, but a final ruling on the case had been postponed until after the election. Goldman Sachs notes that both Lee and his rival share similarities in their goals, including economic growth, stable financial markets and improving housing affordability. (not investment advice)</p>
