          <p>A powerful storm system brought tornadoes and flash flooding to the South and Midwest, resulting in at least 16 fatalities. The severe weather caused widespread destruction, including entire neighborhoods being wiped out, and prompted numerous tornado and flash flood warnings across multiple states.  The extreme flooding has also impacted interstate commerce, potentially leading to shipping and supply chain delays, particularly in major cargo hubs like Louisville and Memphis. The National Weather Service anticipates continued rising waterways and major flood stage conditions at numerous river locations, further exacerbating the already dire situation. The disaster comes amid concerns about staffing shortages at NWS forecast offices, potentially hindering response efforts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jonathan Turley argues that the Justice Department has been reluctant to investigate Hunter Biden's alleged influence peddling, even as evidence emerges suggesting he acted as a foreign agent during his father's vice presidency.  Turley points to a letter from Hunter Biden seeking assistance from the U.S. ambassador to Italy for a Ukrainian energy company as evidence that should have triggered scrutiny under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).  He contrasts the Justice Department's handling of the Biden case with its aggressive pursuit of FARA charges against Trump associates during the Mueller investigation. The author contends that the Justice Department's inaction constitutes a corruption scandal, further compounded by Joe Biden's sweeping pardon of his son.</p>

          <p>A White House internal investigation revealed that Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg was mistakenly added to a Signal group chat discussing US strike plans in Yemen due to a series of unlikely errors. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz inadvertently saved Goldberg's number under a different contact after a prior email exchange.  Trump initially considered firing Waltz over the incident but ultimately decided against it to avoid giving the media satisfaction.

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has announced a temporary halt to all shipments to the United States in response to newly imposed tariffs. The decision comes as the company evaluates how to address the new trading terms, including a 25% levy on car imports. The US is a critical market for JLR's luxury brands, and the company is taking short-term actions to mitigate the impact of the tariffs while developing longer-term strategies. Other automakers, such as Nissan and Stellantis, are also adjusting their operations in response to the new trade environment, signaling widespread disruption in the global automotive supply chain.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose tariffs on trading partners has triggered a global market meltdown and growing recession fears in the United States.  While Trump believes tariffs will revitalize American manufacturing, analysts predict rising inflation and slower growth.  The move has drawn criticism from both domestic and international actors, with trading partners announcing retaliatory measures.  The tariffs have already impacted the cost of flying goods into the US and led to factory closures, creating widespread anxiety among Americans.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is increasingly concerned that China's regular large-scale joint combat drills around the island could escalate into a real attack by the People's Liberation Army (PLA).  The PLA's strategy of gradually eroding buffer zones raises concerns about Taiwan's military's ability to respond quickly enough. A former Taiwanese air force commander warned that warplanes could reach Taipei within minutes of crossing the median line, leaving insufficient time for a response. The PLA has conducted numerous large-scale exercises simulating amphibious landings and precision strikes, heightening tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>An advice columnist addresses a reader's dilemma about combining finances with her higher-earning fiancé, questioning whether accepting his offer to cover more expenses is a betrayal of feminist principles. The columnist challenges the illusion of complete independence, arguing that humans are inherently interdependent and that true love requires embracing vulnerability.  She distinguishes between real and felt financial dependence, suggesting that if the reader has her own job and could readily return to the workforce, her fear is not about finances but about facing the reality of interdependence.  Ultimately, the columnist encourages the reader to trust her partner and accept interdependence, or risk impoverishing herself emotionally.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the growing class divide in America and the disconnect between the "comfort class" and the majority of the population. The author argues that systems of education, credentialing, hiring, housing, and electing officials are dominated by members of the comfort class, who often lack understanding of the financial struggles faced by most Americans. This disconnect contributes to political polarization and resentment, as policies and rhetoric often fail to address the real-life concerns of working-class individuals.

          <p>The US dollar weakened after President Trump's tariffs triggered recession fears, leading investors to seek safe-haven currencies like the yen and Swiss franc. While tariffs were initially expected to boost the dollar, concerns about the US economy's ability to withstand maximum tariffs have overwhelmed any positive benefits. The ICE US Dollar Index fell sharply after the tariff announcement, reflecting market uncertainty. Some analysts remain hopeful for a long-term gain, but market confidence has been shaken.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new tariffs are likely to disproportionately harm small, heavily indebted countries in the global south, potentially exacerbating existing debt crises.  Countries like Cambodia, Bangladesh, and Laos face punitive tariff rates, despite benefiting from preferential trade schemes designed to promote development. The tariffs, based on the size of the US trade deficit with each country, are not reciprocal and threaten to squeeze the incomes of small farmers and factory workers.  The social and economic consequences could be profound, leading to mass layoffs and increased pressure for debt write-offs.</p>

          <p>Two Labour MPs were denied entry to Israel while on a trip to visit the occupied West Bank, sparking criticism from UK officials. Israeli authorities claimed the MPs intended to "spread hate speech" against Israel, while the MPs stated their intention was to witness the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory. The UK Foreign Office has expressed concern, while Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch defended Israel's right to control its borders. The incident has raised questions about freedom of speech and the ability of parliamentarians to scrutinize the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>A white Afrikaner expresses bewilderment at the offer of special refugee status in the US, prompted by claims from Trump and Musk that Afrikaners are a threatened species facing "genocide." The author argues that these claims are false, highlighting South Africa's progressive constitution, independent judiciary, and open society. While acknowledging the country's challenges, including corruption and slow economic growth, the author asserts that these are problems affecting all citizens and do not warrant foreign intervention. The author suggests that Trump's interest stems from a critique of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in South Africa, reflecting a broader narrative of endangered white minorities.</p>

          <p>The used electric vehicle (EV) market is experiencing significant growth, driven by budget-conscious consumers seeking affordable clean energy options. Used EV sales increased by over 60% from 2023 to 2024, with a used EV expected to be sold every minute in the US. Factors contributing to this growth include uncertainty about a federal rebate, the return of leased EVs, and decreasing battery prices. This trend is contributing to a cleaner, greener planet by making EVs more accessible to a wider range of drivers.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover Automotive is pausing shipments to the United States as it assesses the impact of President Trump's 25% tax on vehicle imports. The company is taking short-term actions while developing longer-term plans to address the new trading terms. Analysts anticipate similar actions from other British carmakers facing declining demand and the transition to electric vehicles. The UK's car industry, heavily reliant on exports, is struggling with the increased tariffs, prompting calls for accelerated trade discussions.</p>
