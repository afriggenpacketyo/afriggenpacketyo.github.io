          <p>A debate has erupted in China over the reinstatement and promotion of officials who were previously disciplined for misconduct. The case of Xie Qin, a township party chief disciplined for a drinking spree, has sparked public frustration, with many questioning the decision to reward officials for their past actions. This practice is part of Beijing's effort to motivate officials amid an economic downturn and President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Turkey is experiencing a significant increase in obesity rates, particularly among children, which experts attribute to poverty, malnutrition, and unhealthy food options. High food price inflation limits access to nutritious foods, leading many to rely on cheap, processed alternatives. Studies show that a majority of children in Turkey primarily consume bread and pasta, contributing to malnutrition and obesity. The Health Ministry has launched a campaign to combat obesity, but critics argue it overlooks broader economic issues and the need for better food regulations. Experts advocate for free school meal programs and stricter regulations on unhealthy food production.</p>

          <p>The Football Association's (FA) ban on transgender women playing in women's football has commenced, impacting numerous registered players. Following a UK Supreme Court ruling, the FA now permits only biologically female individuals to participate in women's football at all levels. This decision has forced players like Billie Sky to stop playing competitively for her team, London Galaxy. While some support the ban to protect the integrity of women's football, others argue it is discriminatory and limits inclusion. The FA has acknowledged the complexity of the issue and the wider debates surrounding fairness and safety in women's sports.</p>

          <p>A British man, John Miller, has been indicted in the US for allegedly attempting to smuggle "sensitive American military technology" to China. Miller, along with a Chinese man named Cui Guanghai, faces charges related to conspiracy, smuggling, and violations of the Arms Control Act. The men are accused of discussing ways to export devices used for encryption and decryption, and of harassing an anti-Chinese government protester. Both men were arrested in Serbia and could face extradition to the US. If convicted, Miller could face up to 20 years in prison.</p>

          <p>Japan, a skateboarding powerhouse, has welcomed the new Olympic age limit restricting competition to athletes 14 and older, despite its potential impact on medal prospects. World Skate instituted the limit to address the increasing risk of severe injuries among younger children attempting complex tricks. Japan's head coach Daisuke Hayakawa supports the decision, citing concerns about the physical immaturity of younger athletes. While the age limit applies to the Olympics and other international tournaments, domestic competitions in Japan may remain open to younger skaters.</p>

          <p>Japan has implemented an amendment to the Penal Code, prioritizing rehabilitation efforts in prisons for the first time in over a century. Imprisonment is no longer categorized by labor requirements, and prison work is no longer mandatory, allowing more time for guidance and education. The revised law includes tailored programs based on an inmate's age, characteristics, and other factors, such as curricula for elderly inmates and addiction recovery programs. This shift aims to reduce recidivism and provide inmates with the support needed for successful reintegration into society.</p>

The two main candidates have been largely silent about gender equality, a polarizing subject that helped Yoon gain power in 2022 by vowing to defend men who felt sidelined. A third candidate, popular among young men for his anti-feminist stance, has been making headlines, symbolizing a new fight for many young South Korean women. These women fear that their voices are being erased, despite their efforts to improve the world through their participation in anti-Yoon rallies.</p>

          <p>As Nayib Bukele marks six years as El Salvador's president, critics say he has consolidated power by eroding democratic checks and balances. While his crackdown on crime has reduced gang violence, it has also led to mass incarcerations and the suspension of constitutional rights. Critics also point to alleged back-door dealings with gangs and a recent law taxing foreign donations to NGOs, further silencing dissent.
