          <h2>UK Government Considers Policy Responses to Trump's Tariffs</h2>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is reportedly considering industrial policy measures to shield British businesses from the impact of newly imposed US tariffs under President Donald Trump. The tariffs include a 10% baseline tariff on all imports into the US and a 25% tariff on car imports, significantly affecting the UK's largest export to the US, which is cars and auto parts. Potential responses include relaxing electric vehicle sales targets for car manufacturers and re-imposing safeguards to prevent the diversion of goods destined for the US into the UK market. The government also plans to accelerate investment announcements in UK industry and infrastructure to address the situation's urgency.</p>

          <p>Pam Bondi, President Trump's attorney general, indicated that Trump would "probably" leave the White House after completing a second term.

          <p>ESPN's Jay Williams likened Luka Doncic's performance after his trade to the Los Angeles Lakers to the stock market's recent struggles following President Trump's tariffs.

He emphasized the need for Doncic to be prolific offensively to compensate for defensive liabilities. Doncic responded with a 35-point game after Williams' comments, and the Lakers are currently third in the Western Conference standings, aiming for their best finish since 2020.</p>

          <p>Despite market turmoil and international calls for de-escalation, Trump administration officials defended the newly imposed tariffs on imports. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplayed concerns about a recession, describing the situation as an "adjustment process." Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick insisted that the tariffs, including those on tiny Antarctic islands, would remain in place. Economic advisor Kevin Hassett claimed that over 50 countries have contacted the administration seeking negotiations. Indonesia and Taiwan have stated they will not impose retaliatory tariffs, while China plans to impose a 34% tariff on all US imports.</p>

Court orders have led to the reinstatement of many of these workers, but their long-term employment status remains uncertain. Some agencies have placed reinstated employees on administrative leave, while others have offered deferred resignation packages.

Stock indices plunged by nearly $5tn (£3.9tn) last week, with markets in the UK and US experiencing losses not seen since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, as investors took cover from the opening salvoes of Trump’s trade war.

With no sign of the Trump administration rowing back on its so-called “liberation day” tariffs, analysts warned of persistent market turbulence and an increased risk of all-out recession in the US, UK and EU.</p>

          <p>“He’s definitely a very, very, very good player,” the Washington Capitals’ director of amateur scouting, Ross Mahoney, told reporters on the night of the NHL entry draft in June 2004. He was talking about Alex Ovechkin, who the team picked first overall that night. “How good will he be?” Mahoney asked. “Time will tell.” Now, nearly 21 years later, time has had its say. On Sunday afternoon in a game against the New York Islanders, Ovechkin scored his 895th goal, passing Wayne Gretzky’s all-time NHL scoring record, a tally that had stood since 29 March 1999 and that few believed would ever be broken.</p>

          <p>Sgt. Joe Harris lived a beautiful life.

He sailed to earth on numerous missions as a member of the U.S. Army’s first all-Black paratrooper battalion during World War II, the 555th, aptly nicknamed the “Triple Nickles.”

At his funeral service on Saturday, friends, families and uniformed members of the military danced and sang to honor Harris, believed to be oldest paratrooper veteran when he died March 15.

Cynthia Barren, who is part of an organization that is involved in the history of the 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion, claps along with music during a memorial service for World War II veteran Joe Harris, at Lewis Metropolitan CNE Church, on Saturday.</p>

          <p>Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip killed at least 32 people, including over a dozen women and children, local health officials said Sunday, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu headed to the United States to meet with President Donald Trump about the war.

Israel last month ended its ceasefire with Hamas and renewed its air and ground offensive, carrying out waves of strikes and seizing territory to pressure the militant group to accept a new deal for a truce and release of remaining hostages. It has also blocked the import of food, fuel and humanitarian aid for over a month to the coastal territory heavily reliant on outside assistance.

          <p>Liverpool's unbeaten run has come to an end but - barring a remarkable collapse - they will end the season as Premier League champions.

Defeat at Fulham was the Reds' first in 26 league games and just their second of the campaign.

But with seven games remaining, Arne Slot's side require a maximum of 11 points more to secure the title.

"If you look at the goals we conceded, I think all three, we could have prevented them," Slot told BBC Match of the Day.</p>

          <p>Dodgers starting pitcher Blake Snell, who struggled at times against the Atlanta Braves on April 2 at Dodger Stadium, has been placed on the injured list.

The Dodgers placed starting pitcher Blake Snell on the injured list Sunday, in what was the first blow to their starting rotation this season.

The team said Snell has left shoulder inflammation, and backdated his IL stint to April 3. While the severity of his injury wasn’t immediately clear, the $182-million offseason signing will be out at least through the end of next week’s homestead.</p>

          <p>Senior officials within Donald Trump’s administration officials gave conflicting messages on Sunday about the US president’s global tariffs that have caused a meltdown in stock markets, prompted warnings of a world recession and provoked rare expressions of dissent from within his Republican party.

Cabinet members fanned out across Sunday’s political talk shows armed with talking points on Trump’s 10% across-the-board tariff on almost all US imports, with higher rates targeted at about 60 countries. If the intention was to calm nerves with a clear statement of intent, then it backfired as top officials gave starkly contrasting signals.</p>

The estimates place the film's earnings well above its reported production budget of $150m.

The film, based on the wildly popular video game, was heavily delayed but finally hit the big screen on Friday.

A Minecraft Movie has proven to be a box office success, bringing in an estimated $300m (£233m) globally during its opening weekend.</p>

          <p>Southampton's season has been troubled from the start.

They lost eight of their opening nine games this term, and after 23 games had just one victory to their name.

After replacing Russell Martin in December, Juric oversaw six straight defeats and has just one win in his 14 league games at the helm.

Saints were nine points adrift of safety when he came in, but 22 points now separate them from Wolves, who won 2-1 at third-bottom Ipswich on Saturday.</p>

          <p>A person with a confirmed measles infection may have exposed Amtrak passengers on a train to Washington, D.C., earlier this month, officials at the D.C. Department of Health said.

Health officials said Monday in a statement that the agency "was notified of a confirmed case of measles in a person who visited multiple locations in D.C. while contagious." Others who were at the same locations — an Amtrak train, a D.C. train station and an urgent care center — could potentially have been exposed at those times.

The measles patient rode the southbound Amtrak Northeast Regional 175 train on March 19, from 7:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m., arriving at Union Station, the city's main train station, the health department said.</p>

          <p>Trump administration officials and lawmakers are considering aid for farmers as retaliation looms against U.S. tariffs. China and Canada have already levied duties on some of the top U.S. agricultural exports. During Trump's first term, farmers got $23 billion after an earlier round of tariffs.

Trump administration officials and lawmakers have begun exploring a relief package for U.S. farmers as agricultural trade groups warn of economic repercussions from tariffs.

That’s as retaliation against President Donald Trump’s sweeping import taxes could harm U.S. exports of farm products.</p>
