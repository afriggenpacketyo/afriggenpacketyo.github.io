          <p>Neil Hopper, a 49-year-old vascular surgeon from Cornwall, has been sentenced to two years and eight months in prison for insurance fraud and possessing extreme pornography. The court heard that Hopper, who had a sexual interest in amputation, intentionally froze his own legs with ice, leading to their necessary medical removal in 2019. He then fraudulently claimed over £466,000 from insurers, falsely attributing the injuries to sepsis. The case also revealed his connection to the 'EunuchMaker' website, from which he purchased videos of body mutilation, leading to the pornography charges.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a lawsuit against Southern California Edison, seeking over $40 million for costs associated with the destructive Eaton Fire. The lawsuit alleges that the fire, which resulted in 19 deaths and burned a significant portion of the Angeles National Forest, was ignited by the utility's faulty power infrastructure. This legal action is part of a pattern, as the DOJ is also suing the company for damages from the 2022 Fairview Fire. The government aims to recover funds spent on fire suppression and rehabilitation, emphasizing the need for corporate accountability for alleged negligence.</p>

          <p>A recent federal appeals court ruling found that President Trump unlawfully imposed sweeping tariffs on foreign goods, potentially making American businesses eligible for tens of billions of dollars in refunds. The court determined the president lacked the authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act for these specific levies. However, the Trump administration has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, creating ongoing uncertainty for businesses regarding pricing and financial planning. If the ruling is upheld, the government will need to establish a process for refunding the collected tariff revenue, which could be complex. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nadine Dorries, a former Conservative minister and close ally of Boris Johnson, has announced her defection to the Reform UK party. Dorries, who previously served as Culture Secretary, declared that the Conservative Party is "dead" and urged its members to consider their political future elsewhere. Her move marks another significant defection from the Conservatives to Reform UK, following other notable figures like former Welsh Secretary David Jones. This trend highlights the growing challenge Reform UK poses to the Conservative party's traditional voter base and internal stability.</p>

          <p>Salesforce shares fell by more than 5% after the company issued a weaker-than-expected revenue forecast for the upcoming fiscal third quarter. Despite reporting second-quarter sales and earnings that surpassed analyst estimates, the guidance of $10.24 billion to $10.29 billion fell short of expectations. This decline contributes to a 27% drop in the stock's value for the year, making it the worst performer among large-cap tech companies. While CEO Marc Benioff remains optimistic about the role of AI in the company's future, Wall Street expresses concerns about challenges in its marketing and commerce divisions.

          <p>The chief executive of Pride in London, Christopher Joell-Deshields, has been suspended pending an internal investigation into multiple allegations, including bullying and financial misconduct. He is accused of using vouchers donated by a sponsor to purchase luxury personal items like perfumes and electronics. Current and former volunteers have also raised concerns about a toxic and bullying culture within the organization. The allegations and suspension come at a precarious time for Pride events across the UK, with many volunteers fearing this could damage the organization's credibility and financial support.</p>

          <p>In a recent video call, European leaders pressed President Trump to specify the level of military and financial support the United States will provide to Ukraine. Following a summit in Paris, leaders of the "coalition of the willing" are seeking concrete security guarantees for any potential peacekeeping force, with their own commitments partially dependent on the scale of US aid. The diplomatic push comes amid European concerns that Trump might reduce American involvement following his summit with Vladimir Putin. While some US arms deliveries have been funded, Europe remains anxious for a clear and robust long-term strategy from Washington.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's higher education regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), has suggested that university tuition fees could be tied to the quality of teaching in the future. The proposal for "differential fee levels" is being considered as a potential incentive for universities to improve educational standards. Currently, most universities charge a standard undergraduate fee of £9,535, but this could change based on institutional rankings such as gold, silver, or bronze. The idea has sparked debate among university leaders, who worry about implementing quality improvements with already strained financial resources.</p>

The lower court had voided the fine, ruling that it violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against "excessive fines." However, the court upheld the original finding by Judge Arthur Engoron that Trump and other defendants had committed business fraud by inflating asset values to secure favorable financial terms. James is now taking the case to the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, seeking to have the massive financial penalty reinstated.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has officially designated two Ecuadorian gangs, Los Lobos and Los Choneros, as foreign terrorist organizations, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This move grants the U.S. government expanded powers to combat these groups, including targeting their finances and sharing intelligence with Ecuador's government. The designation comes amid a surge in gang-related violence in Ecuador, which has been exacerbated by the influence of powerful Mexican drug cartels. The action is part of the Trump administration's broader strategy to crack down on narco-terrorist organizations in Latin America.</p>

          <p>Michael Schill has announced his resignation as president of Northwestern University after a turbulent three-year tenure. His leadership was marked by significant challenges, including congressional hearings on campus antisemitism and the Trump administration's decision to freeze nearly $800 million in federal research funding. These financial pressures forced the university to implement a hiring freeze and lay off hundreds of employees. In his resignation message, Schill cited these extraordinary challenges and stated that it is the right time for new leadership to guide the institution's next chapter.</p>

          <p>In a tense Senate hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. accused the recently fired CDC Director, Susan Monarez, of lying.

When questioned by senators, Kennedy flatly denied the accusation, stating that Monarez was lying to the American people.

The fund divested from Caterpillar and several Israeli banks due to concerns over their connection to the conflict in Gaza, citing an "unacceptable risk" of contributing to human rights violations. A U.S. State Department spokesperson called the fund's reasoning illegitimate and confirmed that the government is engaging directly with Norway on the matter.

          <p>An editorial analyzes the recent military parade in Beijing, where Xi Jinping stood alongside Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un, as a clear statement of China's intent to reshape the global order. The display of military might and the guest list of autocrats were designed to project an image of an unstoppable China leading a new axis of power. The article argues that while China's rise is a significant force, its relationships with Russia and North Korea are a strategic alignment rather than a solid alliance. It suggests that Western nations should heed this statement of intent but not mistake it for an unchangeable fact, as the future global landscape is still being written.</p>

          <p>Israel's Shin Bet security agency has arrested a cell of Hebron residents who were allegedly plotting to assassinate National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. The suspects planned to use an explosive-laden drone to attack the minister during a visit to Hebron's Cave of the Patriarchs. According to the investigation, the cell received funding from Hamas operatives based in Turkey to purchase the drones and other materials for the attack. The plot was reportedly abandoned after a test run of the explosive UAV was only partially successful, leading to the eventual discovery and arrests.</p>

          <p>This article delves into The Atlantic's long and complicated history with puns, showcasing examples from the magazine's co-founder Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. to the present day. Despite frequent denunciations of the pun as a low form of humor, the magazine's pages have been filled with wordplay for over a century. The piece humorously traces the rise and fall of the pun's popularity, from the high regard it held in the 19th century to its modern status as a "wise-crack" that elicits groans. It even unearths some surprisingly durable puns from the 1860s, proving that this form of wit, for better or worse, is a persistent feature of language.</p>

          <p>While a majority of Americans still support requiring children to be vaccinated to attend school, public opinion has shifted significantly over the past few decades, particularly among Republicans. Recent polls show a widening partisan gap, with Democrats far more likely than Republicans to view childhood vaccinations as extremely important. This trend coincides with Florida's plan to become the first state to eliminate all such mandates. Analysis of survey data suggests that for those who oppose mandates, concerns about parental choice and personal freedom are more prominent than fears about vaccine safety, reflecting a broader political polarization of public health issues.</p>

Parubiy, a key figure in the 2014 Maidan Revolution, was shot and killed in a planned attack that authorities have linked to Russian intelligence services. Experts believe such acts are part of Russia's hybrid warfare strategy to destabilize and demoralize Ukrainian society by targeting symbolic figures.

          <p>Deciding when to claim Social Security is a critical retirement decision with significant financial consequences. While benefits can be claimed as early as age 62, doing so results in a permanently reduced monthly payment. Waiting until full retirement age (66-67) provides the standard benefit, but delaying until age 70 maximizes the monthly payout, with benefits increasing by about 8% for each year of delay. The optimal choice depends on individual circumstances, including health, other income sources, and immediate financial needs, but strategic planning can allow retirees to secure a much larger guaranteed income for life.
