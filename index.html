          <h2>Maui County Council Advances Bill to Convert Vacation Rentals into Housing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 06:36:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to a severe housing shortage worsened by the 2023 Lahaina wildfire, a Maui County Council committee has passed a bill to phase out thousands of short-term vacation rentals. The legislation aims to convert these units, which comprise 21% of the county's housing, into long-term residences for local families, potentially adding over 6,000 units to the housing stock. While supporters see it as a crucial step for community stability, opponents worry about the economic impact on small businesses and tourism, predicting a 15% drop in visitor spending. The mayor supports the bill as part of a broader strategy to prioritize local housing needs.</p>

          <p>Major League Soccer club Los Angeles FC has formally expressed its interest in signing Tottenham Hotspur's captain, Son Heung-min, and is expected to make a formal bid. Son, who has one year remaining on his contract, is a legendary figure at the London club, but his future is uncertain under the new manager, Thomas Frank. LAFC has a recent history of signing high-profile Spurs players, having acquired Hugo Lloris in 2023. The potential move would present a significant decision for the 33-year-old South Korean forward amid changes at his longtime club.</p>

          <p>Mhairi Black, the former deputy leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) at Westminster, has officially left the party, citing significant disagreements over its policies. Black, who became the UK's youngest MP in 2015, stated that the SNP had "capitulated" on issues important to her, particularly trans rights and its stance on Palestine. Having already stepped down as an MP due to the toxic political environment, she expressed that her views are now more left-wing than the party's current direction. An SNP spokesperson responded by emphasizing the party's unity under its current leadership.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady in its upcoming meeting, despite public pressure from President Donald Trump for a significant cut. Trump has argued that high rates are harming families and businesses, while Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated that rate cuts have been delayed due to inflation risks from the administration's tariff policies. The current rate has been stable at 4.25% to 4.5% since December, and markets predict any potential cut is more likely in September. This decision directly impacts consumer borrowing costs for credit cards and loans, though its effect on mortgage rates is less direct. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A prolonged and record-breaking heatwave is affecting Finland's northern Lapland region, with temperatures hovering around 30°C (86°F) for over two weeks. The extreme weather is impacting local tourism, with visitors unprepared for the heat, and causing distress to the region's famous reindeer, which are fleeing to roads to escape mosquitoes. Scientists attribute the event's intensity to climate change, noting the Arctic is warming four to five times faster than the rest of the planet.

          <p>During President Trump's first visit to the Federal Reserve in two decades, he engaged in a tense, public dispute with Chairman Jerome Powell over the costs of the Fed's building renovations. Trump, who has been pressuring Powell to lower interest rates, claimed the project was significantly over budget, a charge Powell immediately refuted. The confrontation, which involved Trump producing a document from his pocket, underscores the highly politicized and strained relationship between the White House and the independent central bank.

While Starmer has called statehood a right, the government's official position is to wait for a moment of "greatest impact."

Historically, home teams in MLS won around 60% of the time, but this has dropped to the mid-40s, comparable to the Premier League's average. This article suggests the change is not a sign of decline but of maturity, driven by improved travel logistics like charter flights, better refereeing with VAR, and more sophisticated away-game tactics.

          <p>Observers note that President Trump appears to be employing a familiar political strategy of distraction to divert public attention from the controversy surrounding his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Facing pressure from his base, Trump has recently initiated several culture war battles, including claims about Coca-Cola's formula and threats over the Washington Commanders' team name. This tactic of creating "shiny objects" to shift the narrative has been effective for him in the past, such as during the 2016 campaign. However, some analysts suggest this time the strategy may be less effective as the Epstein issue strikes at his core political identity as a "slayer of the deep state."</p>

          <h2>Fear of Immigration Raids Exacerbates Dangers of Extreme Heat for Undocumented Californians</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details how the fear of immigration enforcement is compounding the health risks of extreme heat for undocumented workers and their families in Southern California. Agricultural workers, facing reduced crew sizes due to raids, are forgoing necessary water and shade breaks to keep up with work demands. Families are isolating themselves at home, avoiding public cooling centers, parks, and even clinics out of fear of deportation, leading to higher electricity bills and mental distress. This creates an impossible choice between risking their health in the heat or risking their families' safety by going out in public.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it is eliminating the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development (ORD), a move that will cut nearly 4,000 jobs. The ORD has been the scientific backbone of the EPA since 1970, providing the research that underpins federal environmental regulations. Experts warn this will leave the public more vulnerable to hazards like industrial chemicals and wildfire smoke, and shifts the responsibility for scientific assessment onto individual states. California, with its robust Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, is seen as better positioned than most states to bridge the research gap.</p>

          <p>Southern California Edison has announced a new program to directly and quickly compensate victims of the destructive Eaton fire, aiming to avoid lengthy and costly litigation. The plan, which would be open to insured and uninsured victims, has been met with caution from lawyers representing residents, who worry victims might waive their rights for less compensation than they could win in court. State officials and utility watchdogs show tentative support, as the program could reduce the strain on California's $21 billion wildfire fund, which is at risk of being exhausted by claims from this single fire. Details of the program have not yet been released.</p>

          <p>A dispute has intensified between the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the Office of Inspector General (OIG), the county's primary watchdog. Inspector General Max Huntsman alleges his staff has been repeatedly denied or given limited access to the scenes of fatal deputy-involved shootings and in-custody deaths, undermining their ability to conduct independent investigations. The conflict came to a head after OIG staff were allegedly barred from entering a home where a deputy fatally shot a man in June. The clash raises serious concerns about transparency and oversight within the nation's largest sheriff's department.</p>

          <p>A commentary in the Los Angeles Times argues that President Trump's executive order to address homelessness by forcibly clearing streets and using "civil commitments" is based on a flawed understanding of the crisis. The author contends that the order focuses on addiction and mental illness while ignoring the primary driver for many, especially seniors: poverty and the inability to afford housing. The piece highlights a surge in homelessness among those over 65 in Los Angeles, a trend linked to economic factors rather than substance abuse. The author concludes that the president's grandstanding will do nothing for those in need.</p>

Crowder has a history of similar arrests, including incidents in 2023 that involved "peeping" and lewd acts in bookstores.

His discovery has renewed scrutiny of the delayed evacuation orders in his neighborhood, which were issued nearly 12 hours after the fire started.

          <p>A recent study from the University of Chicago explored human interactions with robots exhibiting different personalities, finding that people perceived extroverted robots as more enjoyable. However, participants found a robot programmed with neurotic traits—such as being tentative and worried—to be more human-like and relatable. This contrasts with most industry research, which has focused on developing confident, extroverted personalities for service robots. While a neurotic personality might not be desirable in an autonomous vehicle, the findings suggest it could make robots in other roles, like companions or comedians, feel more empathetic and understandable.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the growing connection between climate change and the formation of sinkholes around the world, from Brazil to Turkey. Researchers explain that extreme weather patterns, intensified by climate change, are a major factor. Prolonged droughts lower the water table, weakening subterranean support, and subsequent heavy rainfall adds sudden weight, causing the ground to collapse. This phenomenon is exacerbated in "karst terrains" with soluble bedrock and in areas where excessive groundwater is pumped for agriculture or urban use. Experts are using technologies like satellite sensing to detect and mitigate these increasing hazards.</p>

While the panel, convened by FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, focused on low-risk local therapies, some critics called the process "theater," noting it bypassed the FDA's typically more rigorous evaluation procedures.</p>
