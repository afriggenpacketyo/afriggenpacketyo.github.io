          <p>A federal judge ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its AI model, Claude, constitutes "fair use" and is "transformative." The judge stated that Anthropic's large language models do not reproduce the creative elements or expressive style of individual authors. This decision is a significant victory for AI companies facing legal battles over the use of copyrighted material in AI development and training. The ruling begins to establish legal boundaries for the AI industry regarding the use of copyrighted works. The judge likened the AI's learning process to that of a reader aspiring to become a writer. </p>

This stance raised concerns among other nations regarding the U.S.'s dedication to mutual defense within the alliance.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson contends that the War Powers Act is unconstitutional, arguing it infringes on the president's authority under Article 2 of the U.S. Constitution. He asserted that President Trump's strikes on Iranian nuclear targets were within his constitutional powers. Johnson stated that a pending resolution to bar U.S. military action in Iran under the War Powers Act is unlikely to pass the House. The Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war, but presidents have historically taken military action without congressional approval. </p>

          <p>Beginner gold investors should consider strategic decisions before investing, given gold's role as an income protector rather than producer. As July 2025 approaches, potential investors should decide whether to wait for a price drop, determine how much of their portfolio to allocate to gold, and assess their portfolio's specific needs. Investors should consider speaking with a financial advisor to determine the right amount of gold for their portfolio. Gold can serve as a portfolio diversifier and inflation hedge, but its suitability depends on individual goals and current market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

Brittany is a major agricultural region in France, and the use of nitrate fertilizers and runoff from pig farms has led to massive algae blooms.
