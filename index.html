          <p>This article analyzes the Trump administration's increasing disregard for ethical norms and legal guardrails, highlighting the acceptance of a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One and later for his presidential foundation. The article details other instances, including the enrichment of the Trump family through a meme cryptocurrency, the auctioning of access to the President, and the extraction of money from tech and media companies via settlements and deals. These actions demonstrate an unprecedented openness in leveraging the presidential position for personal benefit, raising concerns about conflicts of interest and the erosion of traditional standards of propriety in public service. The article provides context by referencing historical examples of similar behavior from both parties, but emphasizes the unique scale and brazenness of the current situation. </p>

          <p>Sussan Ley has been elected as the first female leader of Australia's Liberal Party, succeeding Peter Dutton after the party's historic election loss. Ley, from the moderate faction, defeated Angus Taylor by four votes. The article notes that the Liberal-National coalition suffered a significant defeat in the recent election, with many attributing the result to polarizing leaders and policies that alienated women and young people.

          <p>House Republicans have proposed sharp restrictions on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), seeking to limit its funding and benefits as part of a broader effort to advance President Trump's tax cuts.

          <p>Gold prices have surged by over 40% in the past year, reaching record highs due to factors such as US trade policy unpredictability, geopolitical uncertainty, and fears of inflation. The article explores whether gold's reputation as a stable asset is justified, noting that while it offers a hedge against inflation and exists outside the banking system, it is not immune to price fluctuations. Central bank buying and a fear of missing out (FOMO) are also contributing to the surge. The article cautions that past surges in gold prices have been followed by significant falls, raising the question of whether a market bubble is forming. (not investment advice)</p>
