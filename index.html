          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil on bail, more than three months after his detention by ICE. Judge Michael Farbiarz determined that Khalil was not a flight risk or a threat to the community, despite arguments from Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The government accused Khalil of failing to disclose information on his residency application, but the judge expressed skepticism about the government's reasons for keeping him detained. Khalil's attorneys argued that his free speech rights were being violated, and the ruling allows him to be reunited with his family while his case continues in court. The White House maintains Khalil engaged in fraud and misrepresentation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered Secretary of State Marco Rubio, acting as the archivist, to collect any Signal messages belonging to top Trump officials that could be at risk of deletion and refer them to the Department of Justice for review. Judge James Boasberg's order came in response to a lawsuit filed by a watchdog group after the Atlantic published a story revealing the officials' Signal chat discussing plans to conduct airstrikes against the Houthis in Yemen. Boasberg said the Trump officials neglected their duties under the Federal Records Act by allowing the messages to auto-delete. American Oversight indicated it was prepared to sue again if the Trump administration failed to comply with the order.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested he may fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, criticizing him for not lowering interest rates faster. Trump called Powell a "Total and Complete Moron" and questioned his own decision to appoint him, though it's unclear if he is legally allowed to fire Powell before his term ends in May 2026. Powell has stated he will not resign if asked, and the Fed declined to comment on Trump's remarks. Trump's criticism stems from the Fed's interest rate policies, which he believes are hindering economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

Vance's visit came as demonstrations calmed down in the city following clashes between protesters and police after immigration raids across southern California. Newsom's spokesperson called Vance's claims false, and Newsom himself responded to the misidentification of Padilla, suggesting it was not accidental.</p>

Araghchi said Iran was ready to consider diplomacy only once Israel's "aggression is stopped," and that Iran would continue to "exercise its legitimate right of self-defence."

          <p>The United States failed to reach a tariff deal with Japan, a key Pacific Rim ally, and has threatened to notify multiple countries of new duty rates on imports. Analysts suggest these developments weaken the US position and could embolden China to take a harder line in trade negotiations with Washington. The US had previously raised duties on Chinese imports, but those were put on hold pending trade negotiations. Chen Zhiwu, chair professor of finance at the University of Hong Kong, said the US threats show desperation and should strengthen the hand of Chinese negotiators. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Diplomacy will have a "last shot" within the next two weeks to end the Israel-Iran conflict, according to American and European diplomatic officials, as President Trump decides whether to involve the U.S. in Israel's offensive. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European foreign ministers in Geneva amid Israel's ongoing bombing campaign. While U.S. expectations for a breakthrough are low, the meetings may produce some indication of whether Iran is still open to direct talks with the U.S., according to one U.S. official.</p>

          <p>Former colleagues and supporters of Zia Yusuf, the former chairman of Reform UK, have described his leadership style as demanding and lacking empathy. Some have noted his "Goldman Sachs-like mentality" made it difficult for some people to work with him. Yusuf abruptly quit as party chairman last week, and Farage acknowledged some people found it difficult to work with him. Former employees of Velocity Black, the company Yusuf co-founded, have said his controlling behavior and harsh sackings of staff had direct echoes of how he behaved running the concierge company.</p>

          <p>The upcoming Nato summit at The Hague will focus on increasing defense spending by European allies to appease President Donald Trump. Secretary General Mark Rutte has worked to ensure the summit avoids a row with the US, but divisions on trade, Russia, and the Middle East remain. While some European nations are boosting their defense spending, many will struggle to meet the new target, and some may have little intent of reaching it by 2032 or 2035. The focus on defense spending is also driven by Nato's defense plans in response to a potential attack by Russia.</p>
