            <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, convicted of murdering two of her children, is currently on trial in Arizona for conspiring to kill her fourth husband. Daybell is representing herself, arguing that the shooting was a "tragic family event" and self-defense, while prosecutors contend it was a premeditated murder for financial gain and to be with Chad Daybell. The prosecution presented evidence of text messages and religious beliefs to support their claim that Daybell conspired with her brother, Alex Cox, to kill Charles Vallow. The jury is deliberating the verdict after the state presented multiple witnesses, and Daybell did not call any witnesses in her own defense.</p>

            <p>The United States has finalized tariff levels on solar cells and panels imported from Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam, following a trade case brought by American manufacturers. The American manufacturers allege that their overseas rivals are flooding the market with unfairly cheap goods. The Commerce Department calculated dumping duties ranging from 6.1% to 271.28%, and anti-subsidy countervailing duties between 14.64% and 3,403.96%, depending on the company and country. These tariffs aim to protect billions of dollars in investments in U.S. solar manufacturing.</p>

            <p>Former US President Donald Trump stated that providing trials for everyone the US wants to deport is impossible, claiming it would take 200 years. This statement comes amid increasing deportations of Venezuelan migrants from the United States, many without criminal records.

            <p>The Canadian federal election is prioritizing fossil fuels over climate concerns, with the top candidates proposing new energy infrastructure. Liberal leader Mark Carney aims to make Canada a superpower in both conventional and green energy, while Conservative Pierre Poilievre seeks to invigorate the oil and gas sector and eliminate the industrial carbon tax. This marks a shift from the 2021 election when the environment was a top voter concern, influenced by factors like rising prices, energy costs, and the war in Ukraine. The election's key issue is determining who can best manage relations with the combative US president, particularly concerning energy tariffs.</p>

            <p>A federal court in Denver heard arguments regarding the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants, with immigrants' rights groups challenging the short notice given to those facing deportation. The ACLU argues that 24 hours' notice is insufficient for detainees to challenge their deportation orders, and that the government is trying to expedite deportations without judicial review. The Supreme Court issued a rare weekend ruling temporarily halting the Trump administration's plan to deport more Venezuelan migrants.

Cramer noted that Apple is caught in the crosshairs of the trade war, with the White House pressuring the company to manufacture its products in the U.S. or nowhere. Cramer trimmed positions in these stocks because he believes it's possible the Trump administration could rollback some of its more punitive policies if things get even worse.

The move is seen as a sign of the increasing mercenary nature of college sports, where loyalty and ethics are being sacrificed for talent and financial gain.

The suit claims the administration is trying to control academic programs and is retaliating for Harvard protecting its constitutional rights. Harvard President Alan Garber says the funding freeze will impede critical research and diminish innovation. The Trump administration previously demanded Harvard change policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for viewpoint diversity.</p>
