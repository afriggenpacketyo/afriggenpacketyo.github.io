          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility in East L.A. resulted in the deaths of three deputies from the Arson Explosives Detail. The blast, which occurred Friday morning, represents the department's largest single loss of life since 1857. While the investigation is ongoing, senior officials indicated the deputies were working to render safe a grenade that had been recovered from a Santa Monica garage the previous day. Federal agencies, including the ATF and FBI, are assisting in the investigation, and officials have stated there is no ongoing threat to the public.</p>

          <p>Jemima Goldsmith, former wife of imprisoned ex-Prime Minister Imran Khan, has accused Pakistan's government of threatening to arrest their sons if they participate in upcoming nationwide protests for their father's release. A government adviser warned that the sons, who reside in the UK, would be dealt with according to the law if they engaged in political activity. Khan's PTI party is organizing the protests, but political analysts are skeptical about the sons' potential impact, suggesting their involvement could be more symbolic than effective in securing Khan's freedom. The situation highlights ongoing political tensions and human rights concerns in Pakistan.</p>

          <p>China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) summoned representatives from Alibaba, Meituan, and JD.com to address concerns over an escalating delivery price war. The meeting was intended to promote rational competition and ensure a healthy market for consumers, merchants, and platform operators. The regulator emphasized that these companies must comply with e-commerce and anti-unfair competition laws. In a separate meeting, the SAMR also addressed food safety issues in the live-streaming e-commerce sector, noting instances of excessive additives and pesticide residues in some products.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced visa revocations for Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes and his family, citing a "political witch hunt" against former President Jair Bolsonaro. The action follows court orders restricting Bolsonaro's movement and communication, including placing him under an ankle monitor, over allegations he plotted a coup. This move escalates tensions, as President Trump had previously threatened 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods to pressure officials to drop the case. Bolsonaro denies the allegations, calling the judge a "dictator" and the court's orders a "supreme humiliation."</p>

          <p>The Syrian presidency announced it will deploy a new military force to stop deadly clashes between Bedouin and Druze communities in the southern Suweida province, which have reportedly killed nearly 600 people. The move comes amid accusations that government troops previously deployed had committed extrajudicial killings of Druze civilians. Following Israeli military strikes that forced a government troop withdrawal, the US ambassador to Turkey announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Syria, though this remains unconfirmed by either nation. The UN has reported widespread human rights violations, and Syria's interim president has vowed to hold perpetrators accountable.</p>

          <p>Italy is facing a severe demographic crisis, with its population shrinking and the national birth rate falling to a historic low of just 1.18 babies per woman. Small towns like Fregona are seeing schools close due to a lack of children, threatening the viability of entire communities. Despite government incentives like cash bonuses and tax breaks, many Italians find the support insufficient to overcome challenges like the high cost of living and a lack of affordable childcare. Some private companies are creating their own solutions, like workplace creches, but experts argue that systemic changes and potentially increased immigration are necessary to address the long-term economic strain.</p>

          <p>A new study by Chinese researchers has found that chemotherapy, while effective at treating primary tumors, can sometimes awaken dormant cancer cells, potentially accelerating the spread of cancer to other organs. The findings help explain why some breast cancer patients experience metastasis in places like the lungs even after their initial tumors are successfully treated. The research team also identified that using specific drugs alongside chemotherapy could inhibit this process in mice. A clinical trial based on these findings is now underway with human breast cancer patients, offering a potential strategy to improve treatment outcomes.</p>

This decision is part of broader staffing cuts that have reduced the EPA's workforce by about 22% under the Trump administration.

          <p>Scientists at the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Engineering University have proposed a new "X-railgun" design that could significantly increase the power of electromagnetic weapons. The concept involves cross-stacking two railguns, which they claim could nearly double the firing force compared to the existing naval version. This increased power would allow the weapon to fire heavier projectiles, potentially up to 30kg at Mach 7, overcoming a key limitation of the current technology. The researchers noted in a paper that the navy's current railgun, while a technological achievement, lacks the power needed for effective military application in warfare.</p>

Trump's lawsuit vehemently denies this, labeling the story as false and malicious. A spokesperson for Dow Jones, the Journal's publisher, affirmed their confidence in the reporting's accuracy and stated they will vigorously defend against the suit.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died from injuries sustained after being pulled into an MRI machine at a facility on Long Island, New York. According to Nassau County police, the man was wearing a large metallic chain and entered the MRI room while a scan was in progress, defying orders to stay out. The powerful magnet drew the chain, and consequently the man, into the machine, causing severe injuries. Medical experts stress that strict safety protocols are in place for MRI scans due to the extreme danger posed by metallic objects. While such incidents are rare, they can be catastrophic.</p>

After returning home and struggling with PTSD, Harrison decided to make his vision a reality. He spent 26 years restoring a broken-down carousel and hand-carving new animals for it. In 2010, he opened the "Carousel of Happiness" in Nederland, Colorado, a nonprofit that has since brought joy to over a million visitors.

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, creating the first significant regulatory framework for cryptocurrency in the United States. The bipartisan legislation specifically governs stablecoins, which are digital currencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar, and establishes consumer protections. At the signing ceremony, Trump hailed the law as a step toward an "exciting new frontier," suggesting it could be the greatest revolution in financial technology since the internet. The act allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins, a move supporters believe will strengthen the dollar and modernize the financial system.

He noted that the borderless and pseudonymous nature of these digital tokens could complicate efforts to combat money laundering and fulfill know-your-customer requirements.

While the provision includes a mechanism for reimbursement if travelers comply with their visa conditions, such as not overstaying, the process is unclear.

          <p>President Trump was recently diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs, according to his White House physician. The condition, described as "benign and common" in people over 70, occurs when veins struggle to transport blood effectively, causing it to pool in the legs. Medical experts note that CVI affects about one in three U.S. adults and is often managed with lifestyle changes like exercise, leg elevation, and compression stockings. The president's doctor stated that there were no signs of more serious cardiovascular issues and declared Trump to be in "excellent health."</p>

The ruling addresses concerns from Byron Black's attorneys that the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator could repeatedly shock him as the lethal injection drug stops his heart, potentially causing extreme pain and suffering. The order requires medical professionals to be on hand to disable the device moments before the execution. Black was convicted for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend and her two young daughters, and his attorneys are also pursuing claims that he is intellectually disabled.</p>
