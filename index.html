          <p>Two police officers in Milwaukee were shot and critically injured while responding to a call about a person with a weapon. Authorities described the incident as an ambush, stating that officers were fired upon as they approached an alley. A 32-year-old officer is in critical condition, while a 29-year-old officer sustained non-life-threatening injuries. The Milwaukee Police Association released a statement decrying the event as a sign of out-of-control violence in the city, as officials launch a manhunt for at least one suspect and urge them to surrender.</p>

          <p>Counter-terrorism police have arrested four individuals in connection with a break-in at RAF Brize Norton, a major UK airbase in Oxfordshire. The incident, claimed by the pro-Palestinian group Palestine Action, involved activists spraying paint on military aircraft. Three of the suspects were arrested on terror-related charges, while a fourth was arrested for assisting an offender. In response, the UK government has announced its intention to proscribe Palestine Action, making it illegal to be a member or support the group, as officials order a security review of all military bases.</p>

          <p>Japan has carried out its first execution since 2022, hanging Takahiro Shiraishi, who was dubbed the "Twitter killer." Shiraishi was convicted of murdering and dismembering nine young people, mostly women, whom he contacted on the social media platform X after they posted about suicide. He lured his victims by offering to help them with their plans, but instead committed sexual assault and robbery before killing them. His case shocked the nation and highlighted the dark side of social media, prompting a debate on capital punishment, which Japan continues to practice.</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin offered a stark critique of her party, describing it as a "solar system with no sun" due to its internal divisions and lack of teamwork. Speaking at the Center for American Progress, she argued that the party is split between those who see a second Trump term as an existential threat and those who view it as survivable. Slotkin urged Democrats to refocus on fundamental "pocketbook" issues affecting the shrinking middle class, such as job creation, affordable housing, and healthcare, proposing this as a unifying strategy to regain voter trust.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the recent departure of American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten from the Democratic National Committee exposes the deep political integration of teachers' unions with the Democratic Party. The author contends that these unions function as a political extension of the party, funneling member dues into Democratic campaigns in a quid pro quo relationship that prioritizes political agendas over educational needs. The piece calls for greater school choice and for teachers to opt out of unions that engage in partisan politics, citing the Janus v. AFSCME Supreme Court decision.</p>

          <p>A new report from Coldwell Banker indicates a growing split in the luxury real estate market, driven by economic uncertainty. Ultra-wealthy buyers, with a net worth over $30 million, continue to make large, all-cash purchases, seeing property as a stable asset. In contrast, less wealthy but still affluent buyers are more cautious and sensitive to high interest rates, leading to a slowdown in some segments of the market. This divergence highlights how different tiers of wealth are navigating the current economic climate, with cash-rich investors leveraging their position while others pull back.

Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall announced that planned cuts to disability and sickness benefits will now only apply to future claimants, protecting current recipients. The climbdown was made to avoid a potential defeat in the House of Commons and has been cautiously welcomed by rebel leaders.

          <p>Leicester City has confirmed the departure of manager Ruud van Nistelrooy by mutual agreement, more than two months after the club was relegated from the Premier League. The Dutchman's tenure saw the team win just five of 27 matches, culminating in an 18th-place finish. The prolonged nature of his exit has been described as messy, leaving the club without a manager as it prepares for the upcoming Championship season. The club is also facing a potential points deduction for alleged financial rule breaches, adding to the uncertainty surrounding its future.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Wimbledon draw has produced several challenging matchups for British players, including an all-British first-round clash between Emma Raducanu and teenage wildcard Mimi Xu. Raducanu, who narrowly missed being seeded, faces a difficult path that could see her play the 2023 champion in the second round and the world number one in the third. Meanwhile, British men's number one Jack Draper also has a daunting draw, with a potential quarter-final against seven-time champion Novak Djokovic. The tournament features 23 British players in the singles draws, the most since 1984.</p>

This balancing act is expected to continue, as Gulf states perceive a weakened Iran but have no interest in a regime collapse that could bring regional chaos.

While the overall unemployment rate remains low, the gap between it and the rate for new graduates is at a record high. Despite these headwinds, some sectors like healthcare and engineering continue to show strong hiring. (not investment advice)</p>

Unlike his first "Tracks" collection, this sequel organizes the songs into seven distinct albums that were considered for release but ultimately shelved. The project aims to reshape the narrative around Springsteen's career, suggesting he was more ambivalent about stardom in the 1980s and more experimentally prolific in the 1990s than previously understood.

          <p>Authorities have arrested one of two men suspected of stealing 85 koi fish from an outdoor pond at the Oak House Restaurant in Yucaipa, California. Security footage captured the suspects using buckets to methodically remove the fish, which are valued at thousands of dollars, under the cover of darkness. The restaurant's owner, who had been raising the koi for over 20 years, views them as beloved pets and expressed dismay at the theft. While the motive is unknown, valuable koi can be sold to collectors, though only a few of the stolen fish have been recovered.</p>

          <p>Video footage from downtown Los Angeles shows four plainclothes federal agents tackling a 23-year-old protester, who then appears to convulse and struggle for breath. The incident, which occurred during an immigration sweep targeting street vendors, has sparked outrage and questions about the aggressive tactics being used. The man, a U.S. citizen, was charged with assaulting a federal officer, though his family claims he was blinded by pepper spray and acted unintentionally. Critics, including a former ICE official, warn that these at-large arrests create chaos and a high risk of injury.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Zohran Mamdani's Mayoral Primary Win Signals a Populist Revolt in the Democratic Party</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 06:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>This opinion piece compares the political appeal of Zohran Mamdani, the winner of the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, to that of Donald Trump. The author argues both are charismatic outsiders who have successfully tapped into voter frustration with the political establishment by running on an economic populist agenda. The article suggests that Mamdani's victory reflects a broader desire among voters for authenticity and for leaders who challenge the status quo. It posits that this is a "Tea Party moment" for Democrats, where the party's base is revolting against its traditional leadership.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Reverses Freeze on Federal HIV Prevention Funding</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following significant backlash from health organizations and Democratic lawmakers, the Trump administration has restored federal funding for HIV prevention and surveillance programs. The initial freeze had threatened to cut nearly $20 million in annual funding for Los Angeles County alone, which experts warned could lead to a spike in new HIV infections. Health advocates expressed relief but noted that the President's budget proposal for the next fiscal year still aims to eliminate this funding entirely, signaling that the fight to protect these critical public health programs is ongoing.</p>
