          <p>The Trump administration has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all Brazilian imports, a significant escalation from a previously announced 10% rate. The move is framed as a response to Brazil's "witch hunt" against former President Jair Bolsonaro and its policies affecting U.S. tech companies, including court rulings on content moderation. Brazilian President Lula da Silva has vowed to reciprocate any tariff hikes, warning against interference in the nation's sovereign judicial matters. This action is part of a broader wave of tariff announcements targeting numerous countries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has confirmed that a 50% tariff on copper imports will take effect on August 1, citing a national security assessment. The administration argues the measure is necessary because copper is a critical material for defense systems, semiconductors, and other key industries, and aims to bring domestic production back to the U.S. This tariff aligns copper with similar duties already placed on steel and aluminum imports. The U.S. currently imports nearly half of its copper, primarily from Chile. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has maintained its key interest rate at 2.5%, an almost three-year low, in a widely anticipated decision. The move comes as the nation's economy faces challenges, including a minor contraction in the first quarter of the year due to weak construction and slowing export growth. South Korea also confronts potential economic pressure from the Trump administration's recent threat to impose 25% tariffs on all of its imports. The country's stock market saw a slight rise following the central bank's announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lulu Simon, daughter of musician Paul Simon, has publicly expressed her anger towards actor Richard Gere. She claims Gere purchased her childhood home in New Canaan, Connecticut, with a promise to preserve the land, but instead sold it to developers. The property is now slated for demolition to make way for nine new houses. In a series of social media posts, Lulu Simon shared her frustration, stating that Gere never moved into the home and broke his word. Gere had purchased the property for $10.8 million in 2022 and sold it in 2024 for a similar price.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that life expectancy in California has not fully rebounded since the COVID-19 pandemic, remaining nearly a year lower in 2024 than in 2019. While the virus was the initial cause of the decline, the persistent gap is now primarily driven by drug overdoses and cardiovascular disease. The recovery has been particularly slow for Black and Hispanic residents, exacerbating pre-existing racial and income-based disparities in health outcomes.

          <p>Ukraine's Air Force reported that Russia launched its largest single-day drone attack of the war, firing over 700 drones along with 13 missiles. While most were intercepted, the strikes killed at least eight civilians in eastern Ukraine and targeted airfields in the country's northwest. The attack occurred as President Trump pledged more weapons for Ukraine and issued his sharpest criticism of Vladimir Putin yet, which the Kremlin publicly dismissed. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy said the assault underscores the need for greater international pressure and support for his country.</p>

          <p>A tentative agreement has been reached between the city of Philadelphia and the union representing 9,000 municipal employees, potentially ending a multi-day strike. The workers, including sanitation employees and 911 dispatchers, had walked off the job to demand higher pay. The strike caused disruptions to city services as employees picketed for a fair contract. Details of the tentative agreement have not yet been released, but it marks a significant step toward restoring normal city operations and resolving the labor dispute.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's fluctuating policy toward Ukraine is causing "whiplash" among European allies, creating confusion and undermining coordinated efforts. Allies were blindsided by a sudden Pentagon halt of military aid, only to be followed days later by President Trump's pledge for more weapons and harsh words for Putin. This unpredictability is compounded by a lack of communication from Washington and concerns over a looming review of U.S. troop presence in Europe. The inconsistency has eroded the optimism felt after the recent NATO summit, leaving allies uncertain about America's commitments.</p>

          <p>The Greek government has announced it will suspend processing asylum applications for at least three months for migrants arriving on its shores from Libya. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis stated the measure is a "necessary temporary reaction" to a recent surge of over 2,000 migrants to the island of Crete. He added that any migrants entering illegally will be arrested and detained, sending a message to smugglers.

The piece connects the film's box office struggles to the possibility that fear within the Latino community is depressing movie attendance.

Victims are now calling for an independent inquiry, citing a culture of ignoring abuse and protecting predators within the institution.
