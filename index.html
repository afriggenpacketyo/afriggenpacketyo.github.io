          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 23:43:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Federal Communications Commission has officially approved the $8 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media. The approval followed Skydance's commitments to the agency, which included ensuring unbiased journalism at CBS and ending diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. This decision has drawn criticism, particularly from the FCC's sole Democratic commissioner, who suggested the deal was linked to Paramount's recent legal settlement with Donald Trump and would erode press freedom. The merger places iconic media brands like CBS, Paramount Pictures, and MTV under new ownership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice has initiated a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its sanctuary laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. This legal action follows the recent shooting of an off-duty Customs and Border Patrol officer, allegedly by an undocumented immigrant. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the lawsuit is necessary for public safety, while immigrant advocacy groups argue that sanctuary policies are crucial for building trust between communities and local law enforcement. The Adams administration noted it has previously urged the City Council to re-examine the laws.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and Australia have agreed to a 50-year treaty to deepen their collaboration under the AUKUS security pact, which also includes the United States. This long-term commitment focuses on developing nuclear-powered submarine programs and is expected to generate significant economic benefits, including up to £20 billion in British exports. The move reinforces the trilateral alliance amid growing concerns over China's military activities in the Indo-Pacific and signals a strengthened partnership as the U.S. reviews its own long-term role in the agreement.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell engaged in a public disagreement during a tour of the Fed's headquarters renovation project. Trump criticized the project's ballooning costs, while Powell corrected the president's figures, clarifying they included a separate, previously completed building. During the visit, Trump reiterated his demand for lower interest rates but stated that firing Powell was not necessary at this time. The exchange highlights the ongoing political pressure on the Federal Reserve's independence regarding monetary policy and its internal operations.</p>

          <p>A research team from China's Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics has made a scientific breakthrough by becoming the first to directly observe quantum friction between solid materials. Using folded graphene, they discovered that friction did not uniformly increase with thickness and, in some cases, thicker layers slid more easily. This unexpected finding is attributed to how bending the material altered electron movement, restricting energy conversion into heat. The discovery could have significant implications for designing ultra-efficient, low-wear nanodevices and advanced quantum materials.</p>

          <p>An employee at a Chuck E. Cheese in Tallahassee, Florida, was arrested while in full mascot costume on charges of debit card theft. Police confronted the 41-year-old suspect at the restaurant after a customer identified him from security footage using her stolen card at other businesses. The arrest report details officers escorting the costumed character out in handcuffs as children watched. The suspect allegedly used the card for multiple purchases before the victim's own detective work led police to him during his shift.</p>

          <p>Three former federal immigration judges have spoken out after being abruptly fired by the Justice Department, calling their terminations an "attack on the rule of law." The judges, who collectively handled thousands of cases in Boston and Chicago, claim they were given no reason for their dismissal and allege they had previously faced pressure on how to rule in certain cases. Their accounts add to a growing number of reports about firings and transfers within the immigration court system, which currently faces a backlog of nearly four million cases.</p>

The successful appeal of Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, who argued they were wrongly prosecuted for normal commercial practices, has paved the way for these new legal challenges.</p>

          <p>A DACA recipient from El Salvador is being detained and faces deportation after he says he accidentally drove into Mexico while working as a rideshare driver in San Diego. The man, who has lived in the U.S. since he was 14, was arrested by border officials when he tried to re-enter and was classified as having "self-deported." His attorney argues the incident was a genuine mistake and that his client's DACA status should be considered, but the government is proceeding with an expedited removal.

Figures like Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom have recently appeared on non-traditional platforms, including podcasts popular with conservative or non-political audiences. This shift in media strategy is seen as an attempt to reach new voters and signal a move toward the political center following the party's 2024 loss. The appearances also serve as an early audition for party elites and donors in a developing leadership vacuum.</p>
