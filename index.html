The report stated Madani received foreign currency and cryptocurrency for the information, and that he was arrested in 2020.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that the Israeli military has "eliminated" Hamas's Gaza chief, Mohammed Sinwar. Mohammed Sinwar was the target of an Israeli strike on the courtyard and surrounding area of the European hospital in Khan Younis on May 13. Hamas has neither confirmed nor denied Sinwar's death. Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, was killed by Israeli troops last October.</p>

          <p>Steven Greenhouse of The Guardian analyzes the Supreme Court's dilemma in confronting the Trump administration, highlighting the court's fear of appearing weak by either defying or enabling the president. The article suggests the court's conservative justices often side with Trump to avoid his ire, citing examples such as granting broad immunity from criminal prosecution. The author advocates for the court to uphold the law and resist becoming complicit in Trump's actions, even if it risks presidential defiance. The article cites specific cases where the court has both challenged and yielded to the administration, questioning the court's commitment to constitutional principles.</p>

          <p>The Mozartfest Würzburg explores the friendships of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, examining whether he had genuine connections beyond music. The festival's artistic director, Evelyn Meining, emphasizes that true friendship requires trust and understanding, something not replaceable by social media followers. Mozart's family was focused on his talent, leaving little time for peer relationships. The festival also highlights artistic friendships among performers and aims to dispel clichés about Mozart's supposed rivalries with composers like Salieri and Bologne.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has criticized President Trump's spending bill, claiming it undermines the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk, who leads DOGE, said the bill increases the budget deficit despite DOGE's efforts to reduce wasteful government spending. He contrasted the bill with DOGE's cost-saving initiatives, including government layoffs and cuts to foreign aid. While Trump and Republicans argue the bill reduces spending in key areas and will generate enough growth to compensate for tax reductions, the Congressional Budget Office projects it will increase the federal budget deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next 10 years.</p>
