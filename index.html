          <p>Uber is requiring employees, even those with prior remote work approvals, to return to the office three days a week starting in June, citing the need for collaboration and creativity. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi emphasized the importance of moving faster and taking smarter risks. The company is also extending the eligibility for its one-month paid sabbatical program from five to eight years of employment, citing that the original program was created when Uber was a much younger company. This move comes as more tech companies are cutting costs and reassessing remote work policies in response to investor pressure after over-hiring during the pandemic.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has stated that Boeing and Chinese airlines are both victims of US tariff policies, signaling that Beijing does not blame Boeing for the trade war's effects. The ministry expressed willingness to support normal commercial cooperation between companies in both countries and hopes the US will create a stable environment for trade. This statement follows Boeing's confirmation that some Chinese clients have stopped receiving new jets due to the ongoing trade tensions.

          <p>SoFi CEO Anthony Noto announced that the fintech bank will reintroduce cryptocurrency investing this year, citing a "fundamental shift" in the regulatory landscape under the Trump administration. SoFi had previously discontinued crypto investing to secure a bank charter amid heightened regulatory scrutiny of digital assets.

          <p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is facing potentially drastic cuts under the Trump administration, leading to uncertainty about consumer protection efforts. The agency could be reduced to a 200-person staff, significantly impacting its ability to enforce consumer protection laws and resolve complaints. Efforts to cap bank overdraft fees and regulate payment apps are now in doubt, and lawsuits against financial institutions have been dropped. Experts warn that the cuts will result in a vastly different agency, potentially leaving consumers with fewer protections and unresolved complaints.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's policies and rhetoric, including tariffs and threats of annexation, have significantly altered the course of the Canadian election. Initially facing a likely defeat, the Liberal Party, now led by Mark Carney, has gained ground due to growing anti-American sentiment among Canadians. Trump's comments about Canada becoming the 51st state and imposing tariffs have angered voters, leading to boycotts of American products and increased support for the Liberals. Carney, perceived as capable of navigating challenges posed by Trump, has garnered support, while Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has struggled to adapt his campaign.</p>

Volvo Cars cited a drop in wholesale volume, adverse currency effects, and automotive industry turbulence as reasons for the decline.

          <p>Economists are raising concerns about President Trump's economic policies, stating that his trade, immigration, and spending initiatives have failed to boost economic growth and are contributing to a contraction in activity. The imposition of tariffs on key trading partners has been challenging for businesses, leading to potential disruptions and increased consumer prices. While the White House claims its policies are delivering economic relief, critics argue that tariffs are driving up prices and harming economic efficiency. Concerns are also growing about the possibility of a recession due to the impact of the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party is expected to win enough seats to form a government in Canada, though short of a majority. Carney will remain prime minister, having taken over from Justin Trudeau in March. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre is projected to have lost his seat. The Liberals are leading in 168 seats, while the Conservatives are set to remain in opposition with 144 seats. Increased support for the two largest parties has come at the expense of smaller parties.</p>
