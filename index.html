          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones after reporting urinary symptoms. The cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9, was detected after Biden saw a doctor for these symptoms. Biden and his family are currently reviewing treatment options, with doctors noting the cancer is hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management. The announcement has prompted discussions about Biden's health and future endeavors, given his previous concerns about age during his presidency.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick revealed that he spent $5,000 on special milk requested by Antonio Brown for Tom Brady during Brown's brief stint with the New England Patriots. The milk, intended to support Brady's nutrition-oriented lifestyle and foster a good relationship with Brown, went bad due to a mix-up in the mailroom. Belichick authorized the expense to avoid ruining the relationship between the two players. While Brown's time with the Patriots was short-lived, he and Brady later won a Super Bowl together with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p>

Three of the ten escapees have been recaptured, and authorities have increased the reward for information leading to the capture of the remaining fugitives. The inmates, ranging in age from 19 to 42, face charges including aggravated assault, domestic abuse battery, and murder. Officials believe the escape was facilitated by defective locks and outside help.

          <p>Exit polls indicate Portugal's ruling Democratic Alliance (AD) is likely to win the most votes in Sunday's election, but is expected to fall short of a full majority. The AD is projected to secure between 29% to 34% of the vote, less than the 42% needed for an outright majority. This election, the third in as many years, was triggered by the collapse of the center-right minority government after a failed confidence vote.

          <p>The Supreme Court is considering a case, Trump v CASA, that could redefine birthright citizenship based on the 14th Amendment. The issue is whether the amendment's citizenship clause applies to children of undocumented immigrants and temporary visa holders. The court's decision could reshape American citizenship and the limits of judicial power. Donald Trump issued an executive order that claims the clause was never intended to apply to children of undocumented immigrants and temporary visa-holders.</p>

          <p>New York City and federal officials have launched an investigation into the deadly crash of a Mexican tall ship into the Brooklyn Bridge, which killed two people and injured at least 19 others. The Mexican navy training ship CuauhtÃ©moc was departing for Iceland with 277 aboard when it reportedly lost power and drifted backward, colliding with the bridge. Senator Schumer questioned whether cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency may have played a role in the incident, citing a potential dysfunction in Coast Guard operations.</p>
