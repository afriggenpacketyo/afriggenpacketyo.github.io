          <p>Austin Drummond, the 28-year-old suspect in the killing of four family members in Tennessee, has been apprehended following a weeklong manhunt. Authorities located and arrested him in a vacant building in Jackson, Tennessee, without incident. The investigation began after a baby was found abandoned, leading police to discover the bodies of the child's mother, grandmother, uncle, and the uncle's partner. While a motive has not been disclosed, officials have recovered firearms and are continuing to investigate the case, which gained significant public attention and a substantial reward for information leading to the arrest.</p>

Despite this, AMD's data center and client/gaming segments showed strong year-over-year growth.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning a pilot program to cover popular but expensive weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound under Medicare and Medicaid. This move could significantly expand access for millions of Americans and be a major financial win for pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. The plan revives a similar proposal from the Biden administration, addressing the significant barrier of cost and spotty insurance coverage for these GLP-1 drugs. The pilot is anticipated to begin in 2026 for Medicaid and 2027 for Medicare, with pricing and patient eligibility parameters yet to be finalized.</p>

While daily active users exceeded forecasts, the lower-than-expected ARPU was attributed to a flawed advertising platform update, the timing of Ramadan, and trade policy changes. CEO Evan Spiegel noted that the ad platform issue has since been corrected. Despite the miss, Snap provided a third-quarter revenue forecast that was ahead of analyst estimates, indicating potential for recovery in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has accused major banks of "debanking," a practice where financial institutions close accounts based on political beliefs, claiming he was personally targeted by JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. The issue has become a point of contention for some conservatives, though banks maintain that account closures are based on risk assessments and regulatory compliance, not political bias. While there is no comprehensive data tracking politically motivated debanking, the president is reportedly preparing an executive order to address the issue. Financial institutions involved have stated they do not close accounts for political reasons and welcome regulatory clarity.</p>

          <p>Byron Black, a 69-year-old inmate, was executed in Tennessee despite legal challenges concerning his implanted heart defibrillator. His attorneys argued that leaving the device active during the lethal injection could cause unnecessary pain, but the state's supreme court overturned a lower court's order to deactivate it. Black was convicted for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend and her two young daughters. Witnesses reported that he expressed being in pain shortly after the execution began, raising further questions about the procedure's humanity and the state's handling of the complex medical issue.</p>

          <p>In a significant move, President Trump has fired five of the eight members of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico. This board was established by Congress to help the U.S. territory navigate its severe fiscal crisis and manage its debt restructuring. A White House official stated the board had been run "inefficiently and ineffectively," and the firings were intended to restore "common sense leadership." The dismissals come amid ongoing legal battles over the island's public utility debt and criticism of the board's performance from various political figures, creating uncertainty about the future of Puerto Rico's financial recovery.</p>

          <p>Actor and director Justin Baldoni is escalating the legal battle surrounding his film "It Ends With Us" by suing the movie's insurance companies. The lawsuit accuses three insurers of breach of contract for refusing to cover the legal fees from a lawsuit filed by his co-star, Blake Lively. Lively's original suit alleges sexual harassment and retaliation on set, which Baldoni has denied in a countersuit. This new legal action aims to force the insurers to honor their policies and cover the mounting costs of the high-profile Hollywood dispute, adding another complex layer to the ongoing saga.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent comments have intensified speculation about who will next lead the Federal Reserve, with prediction markets moving quickly in response. In a CNBC interview, Trump spoke favorably of both Kevin Hassett, his National Economic Council Director, and Kevin Warsh, a former Fed Governor, referring to them as "both Kevins." Following the interview, wagers on the prediction market Kalshi gave Hassett and Warsh equal chances of being nominated.

          <p>The political standoff in Texas has escalated significantly, with U.S. Senator John Cornyn formally requesting FBI assistance to locate and arrest the Democratic state lawmakers who fled to prevent a vote on redistricting. In a letter to the FBI director, the Republican senator argued that federal resources are necessary to find the legislators, who he claims are violating the law. This move follows the issuance of civil arrest warrants by the Texas House Speaker and threats from the state's Attorney General to have the absent lawmakers removed from office, deepening the national political confrontation over the issue.</p>

          <p>A high-stakes political battle is unfolding in Texas, where Democrats have fled the state to block a Republican plan to redraw congressional maps in a way that could secure their U.S. House majority. This move, prompted by Donald Trump, could create five new Republican-leaning districts, a significant number given the narrow partisan divide in Congress. The confrontation in Texas is threatening to set off a national "arms race," with Democratic-led states like California and New York considering their own aggressive gerrymandering in response. The outcome could profoundly impact the balance of power in Washington and the political landscape for the next decade.</p>
