          <p>The Trump administration has blocked Harvard University from enrolling international students, citing concerns about antisemitism and alleged coordination with the Chinese Communist Party on campus. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered the revocation of Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, which allows colleges to enroll foreign students. Harvard, which has a significant international student population, denounced the move as unlawful and retaliatory, threatening serious harm to the university and the country.

          <p>Billionaire investor Ray Dalio expressed concerns about the soaring U.S. debt and deficits, cautioning investors to be wary of the government bond market. Dalio highlighted that the U.S. deficit is unsustainable, potentially leading to a critical situation within the next few years. Rising financing costs, increased spending, and declining tax receipts have contributed to the national debt exceeding $36 trillion. Dalio also expressed pessimism about politicians' ability to address the debt issue, noting that bipartisan efforts often result in increased deficits. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent article in Vox critiques the "No Tax on Tips Act," arguing it primarily benefits businesses by incentivizing lower wages for tipped workers. The article suggests that the focus should instead be on eliminating the subminimum wage, which is currently $2.13 per hour, as the real issue for tipped workers is low wages, not high taxes. Data indicates that tipped workers in states without a subminimum wage have lower poverty rates. The article proposes alternative solutions like expanding the standard deduction or increasing the minimum wage to provide more meaningful support for low-wage workers.</p>

          <p>A new White House report identifies ultraprocessed foods, chemical exposures, lack of physical activity, stress, and excessive prescription drug use as key factors contributing to a crisis of chronic disease among American children. Led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the report calls for more research into the causes of disease and prevention strategies, criticizing corporate influence in federal policymaking. The report suggests the overmedicalization of children is driven by pharmaceutical industry capture of the biomedical apparatus. While it acknowledges the benefits of vaccines, it also calls for further inquiry into their links to chronic disease.</p>

          <p>The Navy has reversed its decision to remove 381 books from its libraries, after a Pentagon review using standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) titles found that only about 20 books required further review. The initial ban included titles like "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" and "How to Be an Antiracist". The reversal follows a Pentagon memo that set a deadline for military services to remove books touching on diversity, race, and gender issues. The Navy has identified and sequestered library materials potentially incompatible with the military's core mission, pending the Defense Department's formal review.</p>

          <p>The Senate voted to revoke three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a controversial move opposed by Democrats and some government watchdogs. The waivers set stricter vehicle emissions standards, including the EV mandate requiring all new vehicle sales in California to be zero emissions by 2035. Republicans argue that the Congressional Review Act allows Congress to overturn the waivers, while Democrats claim the vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. California's Attorney General has vowed to legally challenge the decision.</p>
