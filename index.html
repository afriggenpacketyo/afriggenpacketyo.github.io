          <p>Shares of Pop Mart, the company behind the popular Labubu figurines, experienced a significant drop after Chinese state media advocated for stricter regulation of "blind box" toys and Morgan Stanley removed the stock from its focus list. The People's Daily criticized the speculative nature of blind boxes, particularly concerning children's spending on collectible cards. Additionally, Chinese customs officials have been actively preventing the entry of counterfeit Labubu products. Despite a year-to-date gain of over 160%, Pop Mart's stock is on track for its first negative week since early May, with losses exceeding 13%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering military action to disable Iran's Fordo nuclear site, citing concerns about the rapid development of nuclear weapons capabilities. While attack plans have been approved, a final decision is pending, contingent on potential negotiations with Iran to abandon its nuclear program. Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts are underway, involving the U.K. and other European nations, to find a resolution and offer Iran a take-it-or-leave-it deal. Intelligence reports suggest Iran is close to possessing nuclear weapons, though some congressional committees maintain that no order to weaponize has been given.</p>

          <p>The FIFA Club World Cup is experiencing low attendance despite memorable moments and upsets, such as Paris Saint-Germain's loss to Botafogo. The tournament, which is the largest and most lucrative global club competition in soccer history, has seen nearly half the seats empty in the early going. Factors contributing to the low attendance include the timing of the competition between European seasons and the hot summer weather. FIFA has slashed ticket prices in response to the slow sales, but the competition still struggles to gain traction with fans and players.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has extended its block of a judge's order that would have directed President Trump to return control of California's National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom. The 9th Circuit sided with the president, stating that he likely lawfully exercised his authority to federalize the National Guard under Title 10 due to concerns of a "rebellion or danger of a rebellion" during demonstrations against immigration raids. Newsom expressed disappointment, vowing to continue challenging Trump's use of military soldiers against citizens. The court's decision allows the continued deployment of approximately 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles.</p>

While Europe has developed regulations emphasizing environmental preservation and cooperation, it lags in investment compared to China. This investment gap, coupled with increasing global demand for lithium, poses a challenge to Europe's ambitions in the clean energy sector.</p>

          <p>The Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument is at risk of removal due to a legal opinion allowing presidents to revoke or shrink certain national monuments. This potential action is part of a movement against diversity, equity, and inclusion, with some land being considered for mineral extraction. Proposed budget cuts for the National Park Service could also force the closure of the monument, which commemorates the story of Emmett Till and the civil rights movement. Advocates are working to expand the monument, not remove or shrink it, emphasizing the importance of preserving this history.</p>
