          <p>Tesla plans to add xAI's Grok chatbot to its vehicles and is expanding its robotaxi service in Austin, with potential for a Bay Area launch pending regulatory approval. The announcements come amid a turbulent period for CEO Elon Musk, who has been in public disputes with President Trump, leading to significant drops in Tesla's stock value. These developments follow the recent resignation of X CEO Linda Yaccarino and ongoing backlash over controversial content generated by the Grok AI.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines has reinstated its 2025 profit forecast, causing its shares to surge by 12%, as the company anticipates a stronger summer travel season than expected. CEO Ed Bastian noted that while bookings have stabilized after a previous dip, they remain below initial 2025 projections, leading to surgical capacity cuts after the peak season. The airline's positive performance was driven by strong sales of premium seats and its American Express partnership, offsetting a decline in main cabin revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire intends to issue a preliminary injunction to block President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. The judge will also certify a class action lawsuit to include all children affected by the order, which challenges the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause. The ruling, which the judge called "not a close call," cites the irreparable harm of denying U.S. citizenship and is part of a broader legal battle against the administration's policy across multiple states.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has engineered its own cooling equipment, called the In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX), to manage the immense heat generated by next-generation Nvidia AI processors. The company determined that commercially available liquid cooling solutions were insufficient for its massive scale, so it developed a custom solution that can be integrated into its existing data centers. This move allows AWS to offer services based on Nvidia's powerful GB200 NVL72 systems, reinforcing its position as the world's leading cloud infrastructure provider.</p>

          <p>President Trump has named Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy as the interim administrator of NASA, a move that comes weeks after he withdrew the nomination of billionaire and Elon Musk ally Jared Isaacman. Duffy, a former congressman with no space background, will hold both cabinet-level positions simultaneously. The appointment occurs as NASA faces a potential existential crisis due to proposed budget cuts that would slash its science programs by billions and have already prompted an exodus of hundreds of employees from the agency.</p>

          <p>A report from the UK Parliament's intelligence and security committee has warned that Iran poses a "rising, persistent and unpredictable" threat to British national security. The inquiry highlighted a sharp increase in physical threats, including at least 15 attempted murders or kidnappings of UK-based individuals, primarily opponents of the Iranian regime, since early 2022. The committee accused the government of focusing too much on crisis management and urged a better-resourced, long-term strategy to counter Iranian espionage, cyber attacks, and physical threats.</p>

          <h2>Planned Parenthood Affiliates Navigate Confusion After Trump Signs Bill to Block Medicaid Funding</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's signing of a bill that blocks Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funds for one year, some regional affiliates began rejecting the insurance, causing patient confusion. Although a federal judge has temporarily frozen the provision, the situation remains chaotic, with some clinics having to cancel and then reschedule appointments for low-income patients. The "defunding" measure, which abortion rights advocates call a backdoor ban, would force the closure of hundreds of health centers that provide services like cancer screenings and birth control to Medicaid recipients.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency has arrested four people in connection with the disruptive cyber-attacks on retailers M&S and the Co-op. The suspects, aged 17 to 20, were apprehended on suspicion of blackmail, money laundering, and other offenses after the hacks caused significant operational chaos, including empty shelves and stolen data. M&S has estimated the attack will cost it £300 million in lost profits, with its chairman telling MPs the incident felt like an attempt to destroy the business.</p>

          <p>Nepal is witnessing a dramatic surge in electric vehicle adoption, with the number of EVs growing from 250 in 2020 to over 13,000 in 2024. This shift is driven by favorable government policies, including lower taxes on EVs, and a public desire to escape high fuel costs and reduce the severe air pollution that plagues cities like Kathmandu. The government has set ambitious targets for EV adoption, aiming to leverage the country's abundant clean hydropower to create a sustainable transportation system and improve public health.</p>

          <p>The Coney Beach Amusement Park in Porthcawl, Wales, a seaside staple for over 100 years, has announced it will close permanently in October. The closure marks the "end of an era" for the family-run funfair, which opened in 1918. The site is part of a major waterfront redevelopment plan that includes new homes, shops, and restaurants, leaving local business owners concerned about the potential negative impact on tourism and the loss of a cherished community landmark.</p>
