          <p>Officials from the United States and China are scheduled to meet in London to address ongoing disputes related to tariffs and supply chains. The talks aim to resolve differences that have jeopardized the fragile truce established between the two nations, which is crucial for global economic stability. Both sides are looking to find common ground on trade practices and policies to prevent further escalation of the trade war. Successfully navigating these discussions could ease market anxieties and foster a more predictable international trade environment. Optimism surrounding the meeting is tempered by past difficulties in reaching lasting agreements. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's export growth experienced a slowdown in May, hitting a three-month low due to decreased shipments to the United States following tariff impositions. Exports to the U.S. fell nearly 12% from April, as revealed by customs data released just before U.S. and Chinese officials were set to meet in London for trade talks. Despite overall exports rising 4.8% year-on-year, this figure is lower than the 8.1% increase seen in April, with U.S. imports also dropping by 7.4%. The upcoming talks occur amidst U.S. concerns over China's slow export license approvals for essential elements. </p>

          <p>Geely Auto, a leading Chinese car manufacturer, has announced it will cease building new car plants due to significant global overcapacity.

          <p>China's export growth in May fell short of expectations, primarily due to a significant drop in shipments to the United States. Exports to the U.S. experienced their steepest decline in over five years, plummeting 34.5% year-on-year, while imports from the U.S. decreased by over 18%. Despite this, overall exports rose by 4.8%, bolstered by increased shipments to Southeast Asia, the European Union, and Africa. The trade surplus increased by 25% to $103.2 billion, but the decline in U.S. trade highlights the impact of ongoing trade tensions. </p>

The piece emphasizes the importance of peaceful protests and the role of federal courts in resisting what it describes as an emerging tyranny.

          <p>President Trump's new travel ban, impacting citizens from twelve countries primarily in Africa and the Middle East, has officially gone into effect.

Unlike the initial 2017 ban, this iteration is broader and expected to withstand legal challenges.

It criticizes Trump for invoking a rarely used provision of the U.S. Code on Armed Services, arguing that no rebellion is underway.
