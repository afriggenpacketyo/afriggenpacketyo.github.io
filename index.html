          <p>Several legacy media outlets and DC journalists are now reporting on scandals that previously rocked the Democratic Party, echoing concerns raised by conservatives years prior. The New York Times, for example, recently published a piece on Hunter Biden's dealings with Burisma, years after other outlets covered the story. Additionally, media veterans are investigating the origins of COVID-19 and President Biden's mental decline, topics previously highlighted by conservatives. This shift in media focus has sparked debate about the timing and motivations behind these investigations.</p>

          <p>Despite a video reposted by President Trump that seemingly endorsed the idea of crashing the stock market, his top economic advisor, Kevin Hassett, denied that this was the administration's strategy. Hassett claimed the goal was to create a "golden age" for the American worker, while respecting the Federal Reserve's independence, even as Trump continued to pressure the Fed to lower interest rates.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' decision to accept an invitation to visit President Trump at the White House has drawn criticism, with some arguing it contradicts the team's values and legacy. Columnist Hernández argues that by normalizing Trump's rhetoric, the Dodgers are undermining their commitment to social progress. While the team claims the visit is about celebrating their World Series win, critics view it as a political act that betrays the values of Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>Under the Trump administration, billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are wielding unprecedented influence over US national security. Their companies, SpaceX and Blue Origin, are playing significant roles in placing spy satellites into orbit, potentially making the intelligence community beholden to their interests. This shift marks a radical change in US spy operations, traditionally controlled by career government officials and established defense contractors.</p>
