          <p>The Washington Department of Natural Resources has used a firefighting helicopter to haul abandoned boats off an uninhabited island in Puget Sound. The agency removed 14 vessels, its largest operation of its kind, to prevent further environmental disruption. The boats were found in hard-to-reach coves and mud, making an airlift the best option, and the federal grant allowed the state to clean up boats on Squaxin Island, which is of particular cultural importance to the Squaxin Island Tribe.</p>

Researchers studied feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period. The study suggests that the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift was essential to the evolution of birds, and most feathered dinosaurs did not have the same ability to fly.</p>
