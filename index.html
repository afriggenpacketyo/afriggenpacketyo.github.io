          <p>At least 41 people have died and 27 remain missing in southeastern Mexico due to severe flooding and landslides triggered by heavy rainfall. The extreme weather has heavily impacted 117 municipalities across five states, damaging tens of thousands of homes and critical infrastructure. Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum has deployed thousands of soldiers to assist with relief operations as some communities remain cut off. The rainfall is attributed to tropical cyclones in the Pacific, with more precipitation forecasted in the coming days.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked the on-street deployment of National Guard troops in the Chicago area amid ongoing protests at Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. While upholding a lower court's decision to keep troops off city streets, the ruling allows them to remain under federal control to protect federal personnel and property. This decision marks a victory for Illinois and Chicago officials in their legal dispute with the Trump administration over the use of federalized forces for local law enforcement.</p>

          <p>As China drafts its 15th five-year plan, analysts anticipate a potential shift in the country's infrastructure development strategy. For decades, massive public works projects drove economic expansion but also saddled local governments with substantial debt. While infrastructure spending is expected to remain a priority, future projects will likely focus more on technology-driven and people-centric initiatives to foster sustainable growth and mitigate the financial risks associated with past investment models.
