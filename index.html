          <p>A jury has found Ryan Routh guilty on all charges, including the attempted assassination of Donald Trump at a Florida golf course in September 2024. The 59-year-old, who defended himself during the trial, was apprehended after a Secret Service agent spotted his rifle in the bushes. Following the verdict, Routh attempted to harm himself in the courtroom before being subdued by U.S. Marshals. He is scheduled for sentencing in December and faces a potential life sentence for the planned attack.</p>

          <p>In a notable shift, President Trump stated he believes Ukraine can win back all its territory from Russia, describing Russia as a "paper tiger" facing significant economic trouble. During a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump also affirmed that NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft that violate their airspace, a significant statement amid recent incursions. Separately, the article notes that Senate Democrats have launched a probe into White House border czar Tom Homan. This collection of updates points to a more assertive foreign policy stance.</p>

          <p>During a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, President Donald Trump sharply criticized European countries for their immigration policies, claiming they are being "invaded by a force of illegal aliens." He argued that these nations are "destroying" themselves by being politically correct and failing to control their borders, drawing parallels to the border situation in the United States. Trump asserted that the UN should be focused on preventing such "invasions" rather than financing them, urging all countries to defend their sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. has released the first trailer for "The Bride," a new take on the Frankenstein story directed by Maggie Gyllenhaal and set in 1930s Chicago. The film stars Jessie Buckley as the titular Bride and Christian Bale as her creator, Frank, who enlists a doctor, played by Annette Bening, to create a companion for him. The trailer suggests a dark and edgy romance, described in the official synopsis as a story involving murder, possession, and a radical cultural movement.

          <p>Consumers are rushing to purchase electric vehicles to take advantage of federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used EVs before they expire at the end of September. The credits, part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, are being phased out by the Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." This deadline has fueled a surge in EV sales, with dealerships offering additional incentives to clear inventory. While September is expected to be a record sales month, experts express concern about a potential decline in demand once the incentives are gone.</p>

A large 2024 Swedish study found the link disappeared when genetic and environmental factors were accounted for by comparing siblings.

          <p>Authorities have confirmed that two 25-year-old elk hunters, Andrew Porter and Ian Stasko, were killed by a lightning strike in Colorado's Rio Grande National Forest. The men were caught in a severe storm while trying to return to their vehicle. After an extensive search, their bodies were discovered, and the coroner determined the lightning likely killed them instantly as they stood under a large tree. The fiancée of one of the men described the event as a "bizarre horrific act of nature," noting the men were experienced outdoorsmen who were tragically in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, the strongest storm of the year, has caused a mountain lake in eastern Taiwan to burst its banks, resulting in two deaths and trapping hundreds of people. The barrier lake's collapse sent a surge of water into the township of Guangfu, submerging cars and washing away a bridge. The typhoon is now barreling towards southern China, where authorities in Guangdong province have evacuated 370,000 people in preparation for what they warn could be a "catastrophic" event. Hong Kong has issued its maximum-level typhoon warning, with significant disruptions expected.</p>

          <p>Health organizations worldwide, including the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization, are forcefully rejecting President Trump's claims that acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy is linked to autism. Officials stated that available evidence does not support a causal link and that acetaminophen remains a crucial and safe option for treating pain and fever in pregnant women. The U.K.'s health secretary explicitly advised the public to disregard Trump's medical statements. This global pushback underscores the scientific consensus against misinformation.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has ruled that Rex Heuermann, the man accused in the Gilgo Beach serial killings, will be tried for all seven alleged murders in a single trial. Heuermann's defense team had requested to split the cases, arguing that combining them would create a risk of the jury being unable to properly segregate evidence. Prosecutors successfully argued that the cases were linked by the defendant's modus operandi and familiarity with the locations where the remains were found. A deadline for further pretrial motions has been set for January 2026 in the long-running case.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball has approved the use of an Automated Ball/Strike (ABS) System, commonly known as robot umpires, starting in the 2026 season. The system will be implemented through a challenge format, where human umpires will still make the initial calls, but teams will be allowed two challenges per game to have a call reviewed by the ABS technology. This move, which follows extensive testing in the minor leagues, is expected to increase accuracy and reduce on-field arguments and ejections related to ball and strike calls. The decision marks a significant technological advancement for the sport.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has highlighted a potential massive aircraft order from China as a primary reason for his optimistic outlook on Boeing's stock. Reports suggest that the U.S. and China are in the final stages of negotiating a deal for hundreds of Boeing jets, a development tied to broader trade discussions led by the Trump administration. Cramer notes that Boeing has become a tool in the administration's trade policy, with multiple countries including large aircraft orders in their trade agreements with the U.S. This trend forms the basis of the analyst's recommendation.
