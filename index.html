            <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has kept its loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged, with the 1-year LPR at 3.1% and the 5-year LPR at 3.6%, amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. This decision comes as China reported better-than-expected economic data, including a 5.4% GDP growth in the first quarter. Despite encouraging GDP figures, consumer prices in China remain in deflationary territory, with the CPI reading in March showing a 0.1% year-on-year decrease, but the PBOC is prioritizing yuan stability over easing measures.

            <p>As the economic war between the U.S. and China escalates, Beijing recognizes that America's strategic goal extends beyond trade rebalancing to impeding China's economic rise. China is preparing for a protracted struggle, focusing on resolving its domestic economic weaknesses, especially the fragmentation of its domestic market. Despite U.S. restrictions on semiconductor exports, China remains a key market for American products, but China is digging in for a long fight and could use fiscal stimulus to mitigate the impact and buy time.</p>

            <p>Many parents in Britain are facing difficulties finding nursery places, despite the government's rollout of "free hours" scheme, which aims to provide 30 hours of childcare per week for eligible working parents. Deprived areas are disproportionately affected, with some regions identified as "childcare deserts" where demand far outstrips supply. Private nurseries, which provide most early years places, are facing rising operating costs and are unhappy with the current situation, while local authority-run nurseries are continuing their long-term decline.</p>

These options help overcome deposit challenges and increase borrowing capacity, but require careful consideration of affordability and eligibility criteria.</p>

            <p>A study reveals that men are less likely than women to visit doctors, dentists, or use pharmacies, often delaying medical attention until symptoms become severe. Societal expectations of masculinity, including self-reliance and not showing vulnerability, contribute to this reluctance. The NHS survey data suggests that many men feel pressured to "tough it out" when it comes to health issues. Experts suggest redesigning healthcare services to better meet men's needs, focusing on actions rather than just talking.</p>
