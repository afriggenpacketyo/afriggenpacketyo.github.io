          <p>In this New York Times opinion piece, Rachel Feintzeig discusses her complicated relationship with zombie shows, particularly HBO's "The Last of Us." Despite finding the show terrifying and disruptive to her sleep, she can't stop watching it. Feintzeig posits that the horror genre provides a distraction from real-world anxieties by presenting a fictional, albeit frightening, alternative. She recounts how horror movies helped her cope with personal grief in the past, but acknowledges that "The Last of Us" is pushing her limits, even as she anticipates the next terrifying alternate reality to escape to after the season ends.</p>

          <p>Several countries are launching programs to attract scientific talent from the U.S. as the Trump administration cuts federal funding for research. Programs like "Canada Leads" and France's "Safe Place for Science" promise academic freedom and competitive salaries to researchers potentially affected by budget cuts in the U.S. While it's too early to determine the extent of a potential 'brain drain,' institutions abroad are reporting increased interest from U.S.-based scientists, particularly in fields like AI and astrophysics. However, practical hurdles such as language barriers and differences in pension programs may deter some from relocating.</p>

The Observer reports that the government plans to scrap the two-child benefit cap, while the Sunday Telegraph claims Nigel Farage intends to challenge Starmer by committing to the same and reinstating full winter fuel payments. Additionally, the Sunday Mirror and Daily Mail report on a possible Kremlin connection to arson attacks linked to Starmer, sparking security concerns. The Sunday Times leads with accusations that the government's compensation scheme for Post Office scandal victims is a "quasi kangaroo court."</p>

The move aims to end 30 years of fragmentation and save up to £150 million in compensation fees. Four operators were already taken under public control due to poor performance, but this marks a shift toward a fully nationalized system.</p>

          <p>A group of Japanese physicians and social workers is denouncing the continued COVID-19 restrictions at hospitals, arguing that they violate human rights. Despite Japan downgrading COVID-19 to the same risk category as seasonal influenza, many hospitals still maintain strict visitation policies. This prevents families from seeing hospitalized loved ones, even those who are terminally ill. Doctors are calling for the abolition or curbing of these restrictions, arguing there's no scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness in preventing infections.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Scientific Reports indicates that dog owners who ruminate about work stress may inadvertently pass their anxiety on to their dogs. The research found that dogs of owners with higher job stress exhibited more stress-related behaviors. This connection is driven by "work-related rumination," where owners mentally take work home, affecting their pets' well-being. This stress transfer may occur due to emotional contagion or changes in the owner's care routine.</p>

          <p>New York City beaches have opened for the season, but are facing a lifeguard shortage with only 280 certified lifeguards available. The city is implementing strategies to recruit more lifeguards, including increased hourly wages, signing bonuses, and improved facilities. Despite the shortage, officials expect staffing to increase as summer progresses. Last year, the city had certified over 900 lifeguards by July 4th. This year, the city has loosened requirements for some pools and held lifeguard exams in more boroughs.</p>
