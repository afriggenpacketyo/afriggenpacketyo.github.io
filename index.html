          <p>President Trump announced that the United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities in Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, calling it a "spectacular military success" aimed at destroying Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity. Defense officials confirmed that B-2 Spirit bombers were used to strike Fordo, while Tomahawk missiles targeted Natanz and Isfahan, with no initial reports of returned fire from Iran. The U.S. communicated to Iran that the strikes are the extent of their planned action, with no intention of regime change, but warned against retaliation. The international community and U.S. lawmakers have shown mixed reactions, while Homeland Security is monitoring for potential reprisals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senator John Fetterman, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, publicly supported President Trump's decision to strike three Iranian nuclear sites, stating it was the "correct move" as Iran is a leading sponsor of terrorism that should not possess nuclear capabilities. Trump declared the operation a "very successful attack" on key nuclear sites, including Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, emphasizing that all planes safely exited Iranian airspace. The strike follows increasing tensions in the Middle East and Israeli military operations against Iranian targets. Fetterman's support highlights a bipartisan perspective on addressing Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p>

          <p>A Kyodo News survey reveals that most people in Japan are worried about how the war in the Middle East could impact their daily lives, given the country's dependence on the region for oil. The poll indicates that 83.7% of respondents have concerns about the repercussions of the escalating Israel-Iran war. The public approval rating for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet has fallen, while there is divided opinion on the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's plan to distribute 20,000 yen to ease inflation's impact. The survey also touches on other issues such as consumption tax, same-sex marriage, and distrust in politics.</p>

          <p>Subway surfing in New York City continues to claim young lives, with six deaths reported last year, and arrests for the dangerous practice are up 70% from the previous year. The activity, often fueled by social media trends, involves riding on top of moving subway trains, mainly in Brooklyn and Queens. Despite warnings and campaigns like "Ride Inside, Stay Alive," young people are still engaging in subway surfing, prompting officials to seek ways to hold social media companies accountable for promoting such content.

          <p>The author reflects on the experience of being among the small percentage of Americans who have never owned a smartphone, transitioning from feeling ashamed to experiencing a sense of smugness as the downsides of constant online connectivity become more apparent. The author argues that while there are inconveniences to not having a smartphone, they have avoided the negative effects of constant connectivity, such as decreased attention spans and social atrophy. The author also suggests that the ubiquitous use of smartphones has led to a decline in real-world engagement and an increase in social isolation.</p>

Cass believes that the pursuit of consumption as the primary goal has not led to human flourishing and that a more conservative approach is needed.
