        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated he anticipates future jobs reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will be more accurate. His comments came shortly before the release of a sluggish August hiring report and followed President Trump's firing of former BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer last month. Lutnick suggested the removal of "holdovers from the Biden administration" would lead to an agency that is on the president's side and focused on producing correct numbers. The subsequent report showed nonfarm payrolls grew by only 22,000, significantly below expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With global equities at all-time highs, financial strategists are advising investors to consider defensive portfolio adjustments to protect their recent gains. The weak August jobs report has increased expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut, but experts warn this could signal broader economic trouble. Analysts suggest that portfolios are likely over-concentrated in mega-cap tech stocks, which represent a significant risk. They recommend reallocating some capital into undervalued sectors like healthcare, industrials, and materials to hedge against potential market downturns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Germany, advice centers for conscientious objectors are reporting a significant increase in inquiries from young people concerned about the potential reintroduction of military service. The government recently passed a law requiring young men to complete a questionnaire about their willingness to serve, a move seen as a precursor to reinstating the draft to meet NATO obligations. While polls show overall support for conscription, younger generations are more opposed, citing a desire for autonomy and concerns over societal militarization. Peace organizations are now training new advisors to handle the surge in requests for guidance on legally refusing service.</p>

The investigation found that M23 rebels, allegedly supported by Rwanda, have committed summary executions, torture, and systematic sexual violence. The report also holds Congolese armed forces and allied militias accountable for grave violations, including gang sexual assault and the killing of civilians. The UN emphasized that both the DRC and Rwanda bear responsibility for supporting abusive armed groups and failing to protect civilians.</p>

          <p>Private investment platform Yieldstreet has notified customers to expect significant losses on a series of defaulted marine loans totaling $89 million. The company reached a $5 million settlement with the borrowers, but stated this amount will not be passed on to investors as it does not cover Yieldstreet's own extensive legal expenses. The soured deals, which date back to 2018 and 2019, involved loans for dismantling ships for scrap metal where the collateral vessels were lost track of.

          <p>British actor John Alford, known for his roles in "London's Burning" and "Grange Hill," has been found guilty of sexually assaulting two teenage girls. The incidents occurred at a friend's house in April 2022, when the victims were 14 and 15 years old. The prosecution stated that both girls were intoxicated during the attacks, which Alford denied, claiming he never touched them. Alford, whose real name is John Shannon, reacted with distress in the courtroom as the guilty verdict was announced by the jury at St Albans Crown Court.</p>

          <p>Donna Adelson, a 75-year-old grandmother, has been convicted of first-degree murder, conspiracy, and solicitation for orchestrating the 2014 murder-for-hire of her former son-in-law, law professor Daniel Markel. Prosecutors argued Adelson and her son, Charlie Adelson, arranged the killing to resolve a bitter custody dispute involving her daughter, Wendi. Adelson was arrested in 2023 while attempting to flee to Vietnam and was scolded by the judge for an emotional outburst after the verdict was read. Her son and other co-conspirators are already serving sentences for their roles in the crime.</p>

The data, which included downward revisions for previous months, indicates a sharp slowdown in hiring and increases the likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. Despite the weak job creation, average hourly earnings saw a modest increase, though the annual gain of 3.7% was slightly below forecasts. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece argues that while rampant social media speculation is unhelpful, the White House's lack of transparency and the mainstream media's reluctance to investigate rigorously create an information vacuum.

A recent budget bill eliminated the $200 tax on suppressors and short-barreled firearms, a major shift that these groups are now following up with lawsuits aiming to strike down the remaining registration requirements entirely.

Once the baby turtles hatch, they are carefully released onto the sand to make their way to the Arabian Sea. During this critical crawl, conservationists and sometimes tourists watch over them, protecting them from threats like crabs and seagulls.

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its military campaign against drug cartels in the Caribbean by deploying 10 F-35 stealth fighter jets to Puerto Rico. This move follows a deadly U.S. missile strike on a boat suspected of carrying Venezuelan drug traffickers and a warning from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that more such attacks would occur. The deployment is part of a broader military buildup in the region, which includes at least eight warships. The actions have heightened tensions with Venezuela, which the U.S. accuses of leading drug trafficking operations and which has in turn accused the U.S. of seeking regime change.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to issue an executive order creating a formal designation for state sponsors of wrongful detention, allowing the U.S. to impose penalties on countries that use American citizens as political leverage. This measure, similar to the state sponsors of terrorism designation, will provide the State Department with tools to punish nations and potentially restrict U.S. passport use in those areas. The move is intended to deter hostage-taking and secure the release of currently detained Americans. The order follows several high-profile prisoner swaps with countries like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela.</p>

          <p>Israel's military is advancing a large-scale offensive into Gaza City, claiming to have operational control of 40% of the urban center and leveling entire neighborhoods. The assault, aimed at dismantling Hamas, has displaced thousands of Palestinian families who have nowhere safe to go, as the entire city has been declared a combat zone. U.N. aid agencies are warning of a deepening humanitarian catastrophe, with famine already declared in the city due to Israeli restrictions on aid. Despite international calls for a halt to the operation, the Israeli government is determined to expand the war, which has already killed over 64,200 people.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that any foreign military forces deployed in Ukraine would be viewed by Moscow as "legitimate targets." His comments came as European leaders discussed providing a potential peacekeeping force as part of post-war security guarantees for Ukraine. Putin dismissed the need for such a force, asserting that Russia would adhere to any peace treaty. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, however, indicated that thousands of Western troops could be part of a future security arrangement. The exchange highlights the deep divisions over the terms required to ensure a lasting peace in the region.</p>

          <p>An internal Department of Homeland Security memo shows that a naval station in Illinois will be used as a staging area for an upcoming immigration enforcement crackdown in the Chicago area. The memo, obtained by CBS News, details a request for the Pentagon to accommodate approximately 250 federal agents and 140 vehicles at Naval Station Great Lakes. The base will serve as a command post and tactical operations center for what are described as "removal operations" targeting undocumented immigrants. This use of military facilities for domestic immigration enforcement represents a significant expansion of the military's role under the second Trump administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump has commented on the New York City mayoral election, stating he would like to see incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa drop out of the race. This would create a direct contest between the front-running Democratic socialist nominee, Zohran Mamdani, and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent. Trump expressed his opposition to a "communist" becoming mayor, and recent polls suggest Cuomo's best chance is in a one-on-one race. The comments have fueled speculation that the White House may be trying to influence the election to prevent a Mamdani victory.</p>

The board argues the plan is necessary to retain and incentivize Musk's leadership through a pivotal growth period.
