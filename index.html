            <p>A U.S. District Judge threatened to hold the Trump administration in contempt of court for allegedly defying an order to return migrants en route to El Salvador, potentially leading to a confrontation between the executive and judicial branches. The judge, citing a "willful disregard" for court orders, suggested the administration used an 18th-century law inappropriately to deport Venezuelans to a Salvadoran prison. The administration denies violating the order and intends to appeal, while legal experts debate the likelihood of criminal charges or the appointment of a private attorney to prosecute the case. The judge has given the government an opportunity to rectify the situation by taking the migrants back into U.S. custody.</p>

            <p>A recent CDC study reveals that autism rates have risen to 1 in 31 children, sparking debate about the causes and implications of this increase. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggests an "epidemic" driven by environmental toxins, while experts emphasize improved screening and broadened definitions of autism. The study also notes higher prevalence among Asian, Black, and Hispanic children, potentially linked to disparities in preterm birth and lead poisoning. The CDC's report was released amid controversy, with the agency delaying its publication and barring experts from media briefings.</p>

            <p>The White House insists that Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran man mistakenly deported to a mega-prison in El Salvador, will not be allowed to return to the U.S., despite a court order to facilitate his release. The press secretary accused Mr. Ábrego García of being a member of MS-13 gang and a "woman beater", citing a restraining order filed by his wife. Senator Chris Van Hollen was denied access to visit Mr. Ábrego García in prison, while another US member of Congress was allowed by Salvadoran authorities to enter the prison. The White House press secretary was joined at Wednesday's briefing by the mother of a Maryland woman who was murdered in August 2023 by an alleged illegal immigrant from El Salvador.</p>

            <p>A Saturday Night Live sketch parodying Aimee Lou Wood's character in 'The White Lotus' has ignited a debate about the line between funny impressions and offensive mockery. Wood criticized the sketch as "mean and unfunny" due to its exaggerated portrayal of her teeth, prompting discussions among comedians about the ethics of impersonation. Some argue that comedy requires overstepping boundaries, while others believe in "punching up" rather than making fun of someone's appearance. The controversy highlights the evolving sensitivities surrounding comedy and the impact of impressions on their subjects.</p>

            <p>Japan's export growth in March was a modest 3.9%, missing economists' expectations, following a larger rise in February, as the country braces for the impact of new tariffs. While exports to the U.S. saw a slight increase, the data doesn't fully reflect the impact of President Trump's tariffs on auto imports and steel/aluminum. The trade data arrives amidst ongoing trade negotiations between Japan and the U.S., with Trump indicating "big progress" in talks covering tariffs and trade fairness. Japan's trade deficit narrowed but remained wider than anticipated.</p>

While this is the strongest evidence yet for life beyond our solar system, researchers caution that further data is needed to confirm these results and rule out non-biological explanations.

The proposal has triggered a 30-day public comment period and is expected to face legal challenges. The move aligns with the administration's broader efforts to reduce regulations and promote economic growth.</p>

            <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advises consumer companies to lower prices despite the pressure from new tariffs, arguing that consumers are already resistant to high prices. He cites LVMH's recent sales decline as evidence that high-end retailers will struggle to maintain their price points. Cramer suggests that companies are hesitant to lower prices due to concerns about gross margins, but the alternative may be mergers to create cost-cutting opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Observations by the James Webb space telescope of a planet called K2-18 b appear to reveal the chemical fingerprints of two compounds that, on Earth, are only known to be produced by life. Detection of the chemicals, dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) would not amount to proof of alien biological activity, but could bring the answer to the question of whether we are alone in the universe much closer. Others are more sceptical, with questions remaining about whether the overall conditions on K2-18 b, are favourable to life and whether DMS and DMDS, which are largely produced by marine phytoplankton on Earth, can be reliably regarded as biosignatures.</p>

Krebs stated that he was leaving to fight back against Trump's efforts to target corporate interests and relationships.

            <p>Astronomers are debating the potential signs of life detected in the atmosphere of distant planet K2-18b, with some hailing it as a revolutionary moment and others urging caution. Researchers have spotted chemical signatures that could be dimethyl sulfide or dimethyl disulfide, gases only produced by life on Earth. However, more observations are needed to confirm the presence of these gases and rule out non-biological explanations. The findings highlight the challenges of interpreting data from distant planets and the need for a community effort to analyze the results.</p>

With tensions rising in the region, strategies range from bolstering military capabilities to considering the development of nuclear deterrents. China is using the retreat of the US as a stable economic partner as an opportunity to bolster its relations with its neighbours. The rising threat posed by China is felt more deeply in Taiwan than anywhere else.</p>

Despite winning the Champions League three times with the club, Ancelotti is facing scrutiny after Real Madrid failed to mount a comeback against Arsenal. Spanish football expert Guillem Balague suggests that Real Madrid is at a crossroads and needs a squad refresh. The defeat to Arsenal has confirmed the need for a reset, and for Ancelotti the message will be clear - it's time to move on.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has effectively shut down the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, an agency that coordinates homelessness policy across the federal government. The agency's employees have been placed on administrative leave. The move is part of an executive order on whittling parts of the federal bureaucracy to the "maximum extent" allowed by law. Critics say that shutting down the agency will make it easier for Trump to shift homelessness policy away from a housing first policy.</p>
