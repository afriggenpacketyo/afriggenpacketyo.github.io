          <p>Tesla is carefully considering its entry into the Indian market, according to CFO Vaibhav Taneja, citing high import tariffs and luxury taxes that could double the price of Tesla vehicles sold in India. Despite India's potential as a large market with a growing middle class, the company is hesitant due to protectionist policies. Recent discussions between Elon Musk and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi suggest interest in Tesla establishing a base in the country, but tariff-related obstacles remain a significant challenge for the electric vehicle manufacturer.</p>

          <p>Chinese state-backed energy firms may need to renegotiate long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) contracts with U.S. providers due to escalating trade war tariffs, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights. Trade flows of U.S. LNG to China have halted since February, following Beijing's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, including a 140% tariff on LNG. While the U.S. supplied a small percentage of China's LNG imports, Chinese buyers hold significant long-term procurement contracts with U.S. producers, potentially leading to the resale of contracted volumes to other markets in the short term.</p>

Research indicates that users can create accounts using fake birthdays and still be exposed to sexualized content, hateful comments, and recommendations for adult accounts. Meta, the owner of Instagram, claims its new accounts have built-in protections, but the 5Rights Foundation found that the platform's algorithms continue to promote harmful content.

          <p>China has sent a letter to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba urging coordinated action against U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies, as trade tensions escalate between the world's two largest economies. Japan is also considering expanding tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice as part of negotiations over higher levies imposed by Washington. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said his government will help reduce gasoline prices and energy costs for households as part of inflation relief steps. The International Monetary Fund sharply downgraded its outlook for global growth due to U.S. President Donald Trump's series of tariff announcements.</p>

The case revolves around whether public schools unconstitutionally burden parents' First Amendment right to exercise their religion freely when they require children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality that violate the families' religious beliefs. Several justices expressed skepticism about the school board's refusal to allow opt-outs, given that the county allows parents to request their children be excused from other areas of instruction.</p>
