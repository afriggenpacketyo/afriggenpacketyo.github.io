          <p>China's Minister of Transport has called for a global effort among shipping companies to combat what he terms "unilateralism and protectionism" from the United States. This statement follows the US administration's imposition of significant port fees on Chinese-built and operated vessels, a move that prompted Beijing to enact retaliatory tariffs on US ships. The minister emphasized that these measures are necessary to protect China's shipping industry, which holds a dominant share of the global shipbuilding market, highlighting the escalating trade tensions between the two economic powers.

          <p>Two former FBI agents involved in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing investigation have condemned New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani for campaigning with Imam Siraj Wahhaj.

The agents described Mamdani's association as "foolish" and ignorant of history, while other critics expressed concern that it normalizes extremist ideology and alienates moderate Muslims.</p>

The article details the contentious divorce, the investigation that led to Holbrook, and an exclusive interview where Snyder addresses suspicions about her involvement and her decision to invoke the Fifth Amendment during Holbrook's trial.</p>

          <p>The Louvre Museum in Paris was forced to close after a significant robbery occurred shortly after its opening. France's Interior Minister stated that several items of "inestimable" value, primarily jewels from the Apollon Gallery, were stolen by at least three suspects. The thieves reportedly used a construction ladder to gain access and fled on motorcycles in an operation that lasted approximately seven minutes. The incident prompted a large police response and an ongoing investigation, leaving visitors locked out of the world-famous museum.</p>

          <p>Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, once a staunch loyalist of the MAGA movement, has recently taken several surprising positions that break from her party's line. She has sided with Democrats on issues like extending Affordable Care Act subsidies and has criticized Republican leadership and foreign policy regarding Ukraine and Gaza. This newfound independence has drawn praise from unlikely sources and sparked speculation about her motives, though she maintains she is staying true to her populist roots and has not directly criticized the president.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Democratic-led states should consider "fiscal disobedience" as a strategy to resist what the author describes as the Trump administration's weaponization of federal power. The proposal suggests blue states could create state-administered escrow accounts to temporarily hold federal tax revenues, releasing them only when constitutional obligations are met and punitive actions cease. The author posits that this form of state-level civil disobedience, if coordinated through an interstate compact, could create material leverage against an authoritarian federal government and force a constitutional confrontation.</p>

          <p>A joint investigation has uncovered a campaign by major soft-drink and snack-food corporations aimed at undermining public health efforts to curb the consumption of soda and ultra-processed foods. The campaign, led by the American Beverage Association, reportedly uses a network of Republican-tied strategists and pollsters to create a narrative that pits supporters of the "Make America Healthy Again" movement against the MAGA base. This strategy involves funding polls, using industry front groups, and paying social media influencers to argue that restricting soda purchases with federal benefits betrays working-class voters.

Approving drugs that haven't been proven effective can give false hope and expose patients to unknown risks.

The attack caused a fire and partial damage to the facility, which is one of the world's largest of its kind. This strike is part of Ukraine's escalating campaign targeting Russian energy infrastructure to disrupt fuel supplies and economic resources funding the war. The attack follows a recent large-scale Russian missile and drone assault on gas facilities within Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Nexperia China, the Chinese unit of the Dutch semiconductor firm, has openly revolted against its parent company, instructing its employees to disregard orders from the head office in the Netherlands. In a public letter, the Chinese management declared the local entity "independent" and asserted that employees should only follow instructions from Nexperia China. This move represents a significant escalation in the struggle for control between Dutch authorities and the company's Chinese owner, Wingtech Technology, which acquired Nexperia in 2019.</p>

          <p>An Ohio man was arrested after he stormed the stage at a Wikipedia conference in New York City, brandished a gun, and threatened to take his own life. The 27-year-old man was also wearing a sign that identified him as a "non-offending pedophile." Conference organizers quickly intervened and tackled the man, disarming him before police arrived. No injuries were reported, and the man now faces charges including criminal possession of a weapon. The conference canceled its events for the day but resumed the following day.</p>

          <p>A long-running investigation, aided by a 2016 secret BBC filming, has led to the conviction of 14 people involved in a £28 million timeshare fraud. The scheme, run by a company called Sell My Timeshare, targeted over 3,500 elderly timeshare owners who were desperate to exit their contracts. Victims were subjected to high-pressure sales tactics and tricked into buying useless "credits" instead of having their timeshares sold, funding a lavish lifestyle for the company's owners. The final sentences were handed down recently, bringing a close to the complex case.</p>

          <p>Fred Done, the co-founder of betting company Betfred, has warned that a potential tax hike on the gambling industry could force the closure of all 1,287 of his shops, putting 7,500 jobs at risk. The warning comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves considers increasing taxes on gambling firms to ensure they pay a "fair share." Done claims that any significant increase would eliminate profitability, echoing similar concerns from other major betting companies who argue that such a move would push customers to unregulated offshore markets.

For Vietnam and Laos, the ties offer a way to engage with a fellow single-party state, though the economic benefits are limited due to North Korea's isolated and sanctioned economy.</p>

          <p>For four decades, China has been successfully pushing back the Mu Us Desert in the Ningxia region, protecting the city of Yinchuan and the vital Yellow River.

This long-term project has been critical in safeguarding local agriculture and livelihoods from the threat of desertification, with only a small portion of the original dunes now preserved for research purposes.</p>
