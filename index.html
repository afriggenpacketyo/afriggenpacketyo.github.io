          <h2>Medical Expert Warns Binge-Watching Television Can Negatively Impact Brain Health</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 18:38:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychiatrist and brain imaging specialist is cautioning against the common habit of staying up late to binge-watch television shows. According to the doctor, sacrificing sleep for entertainment prevents the brain from performing its essential nightly "cleaning" process, which can impair memory and decision-making skills the following day. He stresses that prioritizing an adequate amount of sleep is crucial for improving focus, energy, and overall cognitive function. The expert also notes that pre-bedtime screen exposure can suppress melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep and increasing stress levels.</p>

          <p>Jannik Sinner secured his first Wimbledon title, demonstrating remarkable resilience after a painful loss at the French Open just weeks prior. The 23-year-old Italian defeated his rival Carlos Alcaraz, avenging a previous final where he had lost after holding championship points. Sinner's victory is a testament to his mental fortitude, as he overcame both the emotional weight of his past defeat and a mid-tournament elbow injury to triumph. His coaches praised his positive attitude and ability to bounce back, solidifying his position as the world's number one ranked player.</p>

          <p>A gunman fatally shot two women and injured two other parishioners at a church in Lexington, Kentucky, after a violent crime spree. The incident began when the suspect shot and wounded a state trooper during a traffic stop, then carjacked a vehicle and fled to the Richmond Road Baptist Church. Law enforcement pursued the suspect to the church, where he opened fire on the congregation before being shot and killed by responding officers. Authorities believe the suspect had a connection to individuals at the small, tight-knit church.</p>

When her husband commented that he "looked fat," she confirmed his observation, stating "Well, you are fat," noting his BMI is over 40. She defended her response by saying she shouldn't have to lie to spare his feelings, as he must be aware of his own size. Most online commenters, however, suggested that while she wasn't wrong, her delivery lacked kindness and she could have been more supportive and tactful.</p>

          <p>A fast-moving wildfire has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge on the park's North Rim, a cherished landmark known for its rustic architecture and stunning views. The blaze, one of two currently burning in the area, also consumed the visitor center, a gas station, and other park facilities, forcing the seasonal closure of the entire North Rim. The fire also damaged a water treatment plant, releasing chlorine gas and prompting evacuations from the inner canyon as a safety precaution. No injuries have been reported, but the loss of the iconic 1930s-era lodge is a significant blow to the national park.</p>

The suspects, a man and a woman, were tracked to the Kyiv region and were killed after resisting arrest. The victim, Colonel Ivan Voronych, was reportedly involved in covert operations in Russian-occupied territories and was shot five times in a parking lot. This event is the latest in a series of high-profile killings and attacks that both Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of orchestrating since the full-scale invasion began in 2022.</p>

          <p>A Senate committee report has condemned the U.S. Secret Service for a "cascade of preventable failures" leading to the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Pennsylvania. The investigation found that significant communication gaps, both within the agency and with other law enforcement, were a primary cause of the security lapse. For instance, information about a suspicious person was not relayed to Trump's detail in time to prevent him from taking the stage. The report also highlighted organizational errors, such as a countersniper team having an obstructed view of the shooter's location, and revealed that requests for additional security resources had been denied.</p>

Cramer pointed to factors like deregulation, a favorable environment for mergers, and the deflationary impact of artificial intelligence as forces that could continue to propel stocks higher, regardless of inflationary tariff policies.

          <p>To be among the top 10% of wealthiest American households, a net worth of at least $2 million was required, according to the Federal Reserve's 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances. This figure is significantly higher than the median household net worth of $192,900, which represents the midpoint of all American families. The article notes that due to market gains and inflation since 2022, the threshold to enter the top 10% is likely closer to $2.2 million today. This data highlights the vast wealth disparity in the country and provides a benchmark for financial standing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom experienced its final day of a significant heatwave, with temperatures reaching over 30°C (86°F) in parts of England, Scotland, and Wales. While millions flocked to beaches and parks to cool off, the hot weather also led to several water-related fatalities and an extreme wildfire warning in Scotland. Amber heat health alerts remained in effect for central and southern England. The heatwave is expected to break with the arrival of heavy rain and cooler temperatures, though hosepipe bans remain in place in some regions due to the preceding prolonged dry spell.</p>

          <p>A child being treated at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool has died after contracting measles, according to BBC reports. The hospital has seen a surge in seriously unwell children with the highly contagious virus, treating 17 patients since June. Officials attribute the rise in cases to a decline in MMR vaccine uptake in the region, which is well below the 95% coverage rate recommended by the World Health Organization. This tragic death highlights the severe risks of the disease, which can lead to serious complications and, in rare cases, can be fatal, especially for infants and immunocompromised individuals.</p>

Their story, shared on Reddit, prompted numerous responses from others who have experienced similar buyer's remorse. Many advised the couple to prioritize their happiness over the financial loss, with several commenters recommending that people rent in a new city before committing to a home purchase to avoid such situations.</p>

          <p>Muhammadu Buhari, a former president and one-time military ruler of Nigeria, has died in a London hospital at the age of 82 after a prolonged, undisclosed illness. A polarizing figure, Buhari first led the country in the 1980s after a coup, a period marked by a repressive anti-corruption drive. He later returned to power as a democratically elected president from 2015 to 2023, a term that began with high hopes but was ultimately characterized by economic decline and widespread insecurity. Despite a fraught legacy, he maintained a loyal following, particularly in Nigeria's north.</p>

          <p>Senator Lindsey Graham announced that a bipartisan sanctions bill is nearing completion, which he described as a "sledgehammer" that President Trump can use to pressure Russia to end the war in Ukraine. Co-sponsored by Senator Richard Blumenthal, the bill would allow the president to impose massive tariffs on countries like China and India that support Russia's economy by purchasing its oil and other goods. Graham stated that after months of leaving the door open for diplomacy with Putin, Trump is now at a turning point. The legislation is designed to give the president maximum flexibility to target those propping up Russia's war machine.</p>
