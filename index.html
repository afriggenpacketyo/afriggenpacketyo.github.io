        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO has unveiled a new strategy to more deeply involve the commercial space industry in its defense initiatives. This comes as the alliance pushes members to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, with a portion specifically allocated for security infrastructure like cyber and intelligence capabilities. The move is expected to create significant opportunities for defense and space companies, particularly in areas like communication, navigation, and surveillance. This strategic shift also occurs amid discussions in Europe about reducing reliance on commercial providers like Elon Musk's Starlink for critical infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report from the Royal United Services Institute reveals a dramatic increase in car thefts across the U.K., driven by sophisticated organized crime groups. These gangs can steal and ship vehicles, including common models like the Ford Fiesta, out of the country within 24 hours. The surge in thefts has cost the British economy approximately Â£1.77 billion annually and contributed to a significant rise in car insurance premiums. The report highlights vulnerabilities in U.K. ports and the complex international networks that facilitate this high-value, low-risk criminal enterprise.</p>

Over the first five months of the year, cumulative profits for major industrial firms were down 1.1%.

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) has lifted movement restrictions at nine state prisons, two weeks after a statewide lockdown was implemented. The "modified program" was initiated on June 12 at 21 facilities due to a surge in inmate violence and suspected drug overdoses. During the lockdown, investigators conducted extensive searches, uncovering 169 weapons and 310 cellphones. While nine prisons have returned to normal operations, twelve others remain under restricted conditions as the CDCR continues its efforts to curb contraband and violence within the system.</p>

          <p>A 25-year-old British man, Kai West, has been charged by U.S. authorities for allegedly leading a major international hacking scheme. Operating under the alias "IntelBroker," West is accused of stealing and selling sensitive data online, causing millions of dollars in damages to over 40 victims, including a healthcare provider and a telecommunications company. West was arrested in France in February, and the U.S. is now seeking his extradition. If convicted on charges that include computer intrusion and wire fraud, he could face a prison sentence of up to 20 years.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers made a series of trades to move up in the second round of the NBA draft, ultimately selecting forward Adou Thiero from Arkansas with the 36th pick. To acquire the pick, the Lakers traded their 55th pick and cash to the Chicago Bulls for the 45th pick, then sent that pick and more cash to Minnesota. Thiero, a 6-foot-6 wing known for his athleticism, averaged 15.1 points and 5.8 rebounds for the Razorbacks last season. The team hopes he will provide athletic depth alongside stars like LeBron James and Luka Doncic.</p>

          <p>The NFL has suspended former Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker for 10 games for violations of the league's Personal Conduct Policy. The suspension follows an investigation into sexual misconduct allegations made by more than a dozen massage therapists. The suspension will begin on August 26, regardless of whether Tucker is signed to a team roster. Tucker, who was released by the Ravens in May, has consistently denied the allegations but has reportedly been advised to accept the resolution to close the matter.</p>
