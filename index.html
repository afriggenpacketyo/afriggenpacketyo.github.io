        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>BYD's Hong Kong-listed shares experienced a nearly 8% drop after the electric vehicle manufacturer reported a significant decline in its June quarter profits. The Chinese company recorded 6.4 billion yuan ($891 million) in profit, a 30% decrease from the previous year, despite expanding its overseas sales. This downturn is attributed to an aggressive price war within China's domestic EV industry, impacting the company's financial performance. The market reacted negatively to these results, reflecting investor concerns about the competitive landscape.</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing sector unexpectedly returned to growth in August, with a private survey showing the fastest expansion in five months. The RatingDog purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 50.5, surpassing economists' estimates of 49.7, driven by increased new orders and a recovery in export business. This positive trend was partly attributed to a trade-war truce with the U.S. However, China's official manufacturing PMI still indicated contraction for the fifth consecutive month, albeit with a slight improvement to 49.4.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed trading on Monday as investors analyzed China's August manufacturing data and broader regional developments. While China's private RatingDog PMI showed unexpected growth, the official manufacturing PMI remained in contraction. Additionally, market sentiment was influenced by a U.S. federal appeals court ruling on reciprocal tariffs and discussions between Indian and Chinese leaders at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, where they affirmed their partnership. Major indices like Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose, while Japan's Nikkei 225 saw declines.</p>

          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied Guatemalan migrant children without a formal deportation order. This decision came as planes carrying children were prepared for takeoff, following lawyers' alerts about a rushed government effort to repatriate hundreds of minors. The court aims to ensure these children receive legal protections, including the opportunity to apply for humanitarian protection, amid concerns they could face abuse upon return. The government claimed the repatriations were for family reunification, but attorneys disputed this.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holdings' Hong Kong-listed shares surged by nearly 19% following better-than-expected net income in the June quarter, driven by accelerated sales in its cloud-computing unit and a revival of its e-commerce business. While overall revenue missed estimates, net income increased significantly due to equity investment gains and asset disposal. The company's cloud division saw a 26% revenue growth, fueled by robust AI demand, making AI-related products a substantial part of external customer revenue. Alibaba continues to invest heavily in AI and competitive instant commerce, balancing growth with market competition.</p>

Gold trimming now adorns the ceiling, door frames, and fireplace, with even cherubim sculptures painted gold, along with an increase in gold trophies and vases. While a White House spokesperson stated the gold was personally funded by Trump, the decor has drawn mixed reactions, with some calling it a symbol of a new golden age and others deeming it vulgar. This reflects a long tradition of presidents personalizing the office, though Trump's aesthetic choices have been particularly distinctive.</p>

          <h2>US Reportedly Suspends Visa Approvals for Most Palestinian Passport Holders</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 19:28:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has reportedly suspended visa approvals for almost all Palestinian passport holders, extending beyond previous restrictions on visitors from Gaza. This new measure, reported by The New York Times, would hinder Palestinians from traveling to the U.S. for medical treatment, education, and business. The State Department previously halted visitor visas for Gazans and confirmed denying/revoking visas for PLO and PA members ahead of the UN assembly. Critics argue this aligns the Trump administration further with Israel's right-wing government and undermines prospects for peace, despite the U.S. commitment to allowing the Palestinian mission to attend the UN.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The final phase of England's largest-ever publicly funded childcare expansion has begun, offering thousands of working parents 30 hours of government-paid childcare per week for children aged nine months to four years. While Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed it as a landmark moment, parents report long waiting lists and nurseries warn of staff shortages limiting availability. The sector needs an estimated 35,000 more staff, and funding rates for providers are often lower than actual costs, leading to increased charges for parents. This creates a dilemma for families struggling to secure places despite the increased funding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A global surge in matcha popularity, driven by its superfood reputation and social media trends, is causing supply shortages and price hikes in Japan. Demand has skyrocketed, with Japan's green tea exports quadrupling in a decade, primarily to the U.S. Japanese tea producers struggle to meet this demand due to labor-intensive cultivation of tencha (matcha's base) and an aging farming population. The government is considering subsidies to encourage more tencha farming, but record heatwaves threaten future harvests. Retailers are rationing supply, and the industry faces a bottleneck in milling and production capacity.</p>

Former U.S. diplomat Jim Lewis highlights the unprecedented scale and brazenness of these operations under President Xi Jinping, who prioritizes control over China's own people, including expatriates.

          <p>Two high school seniors from New Orleans, Calcea Johnson and Ne'Kiya Jackson, achieved a remarkable mathematical feat by independently developing a new trigonometric proof for the Pythagorean Theorem. This problem had been considered impossible to solve using only trigonometry for over two millennia, with only one other documented proof existing. Their groundbreaking work, presented at an American Mathematical Society conference, garnered global attention and challenged preconceived notions about who can achieve such intellectual milestones.

          <p>China is rapidly expanding its navy, now boasting the world's largest fleet by number of vessels, significantly outpacing the U.S. in shipbuilding capacity. This growth is fueled by massive investments in shipyards, with China handling over 60% of global orders this year. While the U.S. Navy still holds advantages in overall tonnage and advanced carriers, the gap is narrowing, raising concerns in Washington and among China's neighbors. Beijing's naval buildup is driven by a desire to safeguard national security and overcome historical humiliations, with satellite imagery showing significant expansion of naval bases and the development of new unmanned underwater drones.</p>
