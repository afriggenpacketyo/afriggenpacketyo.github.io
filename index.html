          <p>The Spanish soccer league, La Liga, has officially canceled its plan to host a regular-season match between Barcelona and Villarreal in Miami this December. The decision follows significant opposition from players, some clubs, and fans within Spain who argued it would compromise the fairness of the competition. While the league expressed regret over the missed opportunity for international expansion, game promoter Relevent cited insufficient time to properly execute the event. This move marks a setback for La Liga's efforts to grow its presence in the strategic U.S. market.</p>

          <p>China's unemployment rate for individuals aged 16 to 24, excluding students, experienced a modest decline to 17.7% in September from 18.9% in August. Despite this slight improvement, the figure remains high, reflecting ongoing challenges for young job seekers in the country's competitive labor market. The data was released following a record graduation season, with many recent graduates reporting significant difficulty in securing employment, particularly in the sought-after public sector. The situation highlights persistent economic pressures facing China's youth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a BBC Panorama undercover investigation that exposed racism and misogyny at a London police station, over 300 people have come forward with similar allegations against police forces across England. Many complaints center on the mistreatment of women reporting domestic abuse and sexual violence, with some victims stating the police response felt like a repeated trauma. The National Police Chiefs' Council acknowledged the issues, stating it is working to improve vetting and build a culture of integrity. The wave of new allegations underscores a deep-seated crisis of public trust in policing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has publicly insisted that the focus of the national inquiry into grooming gangs will not be "watered down" or changed. Her statement comes after three abuse survivors resigned from their advisory roles, expressing fears that the inquiry's scope was being broadened to include wider child abuse issues, which they felt would dilute its specific purpose. The survivors also raised concerns about delays and the suitability of candidates to chair the inquiry. Mahmood acknowledged the frustration but assured that the inquiry will explicitly examine the ethnicity and religion of offenders as planned.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protestors gathered in New York City after federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted raids in Manhattan's Chinatown, reportedly targeting the sale of counterfeit goods. The operation, which involved numerous armed agents and an armored vehicle, resulted in an unknown number of arrests and drew widespread condemnation from onlookers and local officials. Critics, including city council members and the mayor's office, described the federal action as aggressive and fear-inducing. The NYPD stated it had no involvement in the operation, which focused on criminal activity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new California state law, Assembly Bill 476, is set to take effect next year to combat the surge in copper wire theft that has left many communities without power for streetlights. The law places greater responsibility on junk dealers and recyclers who purchase scrap metal, requiring them to verify the seller's identity and lawful ownership of the materials. The legislation also increases penalties for recyclers who knowingly buy stolen public property, such as wiring from streetlights. The measure is a response to widespread theft that has incurred millions in repair costs.</p>

In an interview, McCarthy criticized Democrats for not passing a "clean" continuing resolution to fund the government at existing levels without additional policy provisions. He contrasted the current situation with the 2013 shutdown, where Republicans sought to attach policy riders. Democrats are currently pushing for extensions to health insurance subsidies, while Republicans insist those negotiations should only happen after the government reopens.</p>
