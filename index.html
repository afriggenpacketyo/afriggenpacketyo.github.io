        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A leaked memo revealed that Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner had suggested tax increases to Chancellor Reeves, including raising corporation tax on banks, extending the freeze on the threshold for the 45% tax rate, and scrapping the tax-free allowance on dividends. The memo also called for reinstating the lifetime pensions allowance. Chancellor Reeves did not implement these proposals, opting instead for welfare cuts. Conservatives have criticized the suggestions, urging the Chancellor to rule out tax increases in the Autumn budget, while a government spokesperson declined to comment on the leak.</p>

          <p>Indian writer Banu Mushtaq won the International Booker Prize for her short story anthology, 'Heart Lamp,' the first book written in the Kannada language to receive the award. Translated into English by Deepa Bhasthi, the book poignantly captures the hardships of Muslim women living in southern India through twelve short stories written between 1990 and 2023. Mushtaq's work reflects the challenges faced by women due to religious conservatism and patriarchal societies, drawing from her own experiences and observations. The win highlights the value of attention to lives lived at the edges and the strength it takes to persist.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to push a massive budget package containing his legislative priorities, urging them to support the bill and threatening to unseat those who don't. House Speaker Mike Johnson faces challenges in securing enough votes, as conservative and moderate factions have conflicting demands. The Rules Committee met late into the night to advance the legislation, with conservatives seeking deeper spending cuts and moderates resisting changes to Medicaid and state and local tax deductions. Trump emphasized the need to cut waste and fraud but said there would be no meaningful cuts to Medicaid.</p>

          <p>Scientists warn that a 1,000-foot-tall ‚Äúmega-tsunami‚Äù could potentially devastate America's West Coast if a strong earthquake hits the Cascadia subduction zone, a fault stretching from Northern Vancouver Island to Cape Mendocino, California, within the next 50 years. A study estimates a 15 percent chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting the region, potentially sinking coastal land by as much as 6.5 feet and causing waves up to 1,000 feet high. Unlike gradual climate-driven events, this earthquake would happen within minutes, leaving no time for adaptation or mitigation, with the most severe effects expected in southern Washington, northern Oregon, and northern California.</p>

          <p>Delaware Governor Matt Meyer signed the End-of-Life Options Act into law, making Delaware the 11th state to legalize physician-assisted suicide for terminally ill patients. The law allows mentally capable adults with six months or less to live to request a prescription to end their lives. Patients must be presented with other end-of-life care options, undergo two waiting periods, and obtain a second medical opinion before obtaining a prescription for lethal medication. The law is intended to provide compassion, dignity, and control to those facing their final moments.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that the United States' export controls on artificial intelligence chips to China were ‚Äúa failure,‚Äù as companies are turning to locally-developed cutting-edge technology. He underpinned that companies would use the "second best" option if they couldn't get chips from the American AI leader. The US curbs have forced Chinese companies to buy semiconductors from local designers like Huawei, pushing China to aggressively invest and develop an independent supply chain. Huang added that Nvidia's share of China's AI chip market had plummeted from nearly 95 percent to 50 percent.</p>

          <p>Japan's Farm Minister, Taku Eto, resigned following criticism over his remark about not needing to buy rice due to receiving it as gifts from supporters, a comment deemed insensitive given soaring rice prices affecting the public. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted the resignation, appointing Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister. The controversy arose ahead of a crucial national election, adding pressure to Ishiba's government already struggling with public dissatisfaction over rising rice prices. The government has been releasing rice from emergency stockpiles, but prices remain high, leading some supermarkets to sell cheaper imported rice.</p>

Retailers claim to enforce age restrictions, but young people report easy access.

          <p>Online grooming and exploitation of children are on the rise, with social media platforms, messaging apps, and multiplayer games becoming common avenues for abusers. A study estimates that about 830,000 young people worldwide are at risk of social exploitation and abuse every day. The Online Safety Act will be implemented in Britain on July 25, with safety rules for platforms to protect young people from harmful content, online abuse and sexual material. Open conversations with children, tech regulation, and awareness are crucial to prevent online abuse and protect mental health.</p>

It will initially be available at about 50 American research institutes and hospitals specializing in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. The process takes roughly 30 minutes from drawing the blood to diagnosis and will be available at a fraction of the cost of a PET scan, making new Alzheimer‚Äôs treatments more accessible.</p>

          <p>The world's tropical forests disappeared faster than ever recorded last year, with fires overtaking land clearances from agriculture as the main cause. Researchers estimate that 67,000 sq km of these forests were lost in 2024, an area nearly as large as the Republic of Ireland, with the Amazon faring particularly badly amid record drought. This record loss released 3.1 billion tonnes of planet-warming gases, roughly the same as the emissions of the European Union. However, South East Asia bucked the trend, with government policies helping to reduce forest loss.</p>

Mr. Trump has said the project will cost $175 billion, although the Congressional Budget Office said it would likely cost far more, as much as $542 billion.

          <p>A new report reveals that record-breaking global temperatures contributed to a catastrophic surge in forest loss worldwide in 2024, with wildfires responsible for nearly half of the destruction.

Some 2.8 million hectares of old-growth forest were wiped out, with two-thirds of that loss due to fires sparked primarily by human activity.
