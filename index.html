          <p>Police Scotland's national child abuse investigation unit has altered its tactics in apprehending suspected paedophiles, now employing a "soft" approach to minimize disruption and trauma, especially to families. This shift is in response to a surge in online offending since the Covid pandemic, with offenders making direct contact with children within seconds. The unit conducts approximately 700 child sexual abuse investigations annually, safeguarding hundreds of children, and executes 15 to 20 search warrants weekly across Scotland. Offenders come from various professional backgrounds, and the unit prioritizes cases based on the risk to children, emphasizing the relentless nature of this crime. The team seizes devices for forensic examination, hoping to make a difference in protecting children online.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump claimed that Canada is considering an offer to become the 51st U.S. state in exchange for free protection under the "Golden Dome" missile defense system, a claim that has been repeatedly refuted by Canadian officials. Trump stated on Truth Social that Canada would otherwise have to pay $61 billion for the missile defense system. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has firmly stated that Canada is not for sale, and King Charles III appeared to reject the idea in a speech before the Canadian Parliament. Active discussions are ongoing between the U.S. and Canada regarding security programs, including the "Golden Dome."</p>

The Met stated that the "discriminatory comments" were "entirely unacceptable" but the outcome of the misconduct process had been "subject to a thorough review."

          <p>Japan's parliament has enacted a law mandating 300 to 400 major firms to participate in a carbon emissions trading system starting in April 2026. The revised law targets companies producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually across various industries, accounting for nearly 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Companies will be allotted a maximum emission allowance and must purchase carbon credits for emissions exceeding that threshold from companies with a surplus. This system aims to incentivize emissions reduction, although companies may pass on decarbonization costs to consumers through price increases.</p>

Israel, not a participant in the negotiations, fears Trump may allow Iran to keep its uranium enrichment facilities in his eagerness for a deal.

          <p>Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban is accused of using a spy row with Ukraine to undermine his political rival, the Tisza party, ahead of the 2026 elections. The dispute involves accusations of Ukrainian citizens spying for Hungary and subsequent diplomatic expulsions. Orban's government has also distributed questionnaires rejecting Ukraine's EU membership, further straining relations. Critics suggest Orban's actions are an attempt to discredit the opposition, particularly Roland Tseber, who assisted the Tisza leader in delivering medical aid to Ukraine, leading to accusations of Tseber being a "Ukrainian spy."</p>

King Charles' visit to Canada emphasized the country's sovereignty and resilience amid political tensions. Additionally, London Mayor Sadiq Khan's call for decriminalizing cannabis has sparked debate, contrasting with the Home Office's opposition to such reforms.</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's IPO is notable not only for being one of the first significant cryptocurrency companies to go public in the U.S., but also for its high level of insider selling. In the IPO, existing shareholders are selling 60% of the shares, which is unusually high for a tech IPO, similar to Facebook's 2012 IPO. This may be due to the extended period of meager returns for venture capital firms and a strong desire by early investors to gain liquidity. Circle is profitable and has significant cash reserves, making the high level of insider selling a peculiar aspect of the IPO. (not investment advice)</p>
