          <p>Sarah A Boardman, the artist behind Donald Trump's official portrait displayed in the Denver State Capitol Gallery of Presidents, reports that Trump's public lambasting of her work is negatively impacting her business.

The portrait was eventually removed, and Boardman states that her business is now at risk of not recovering due to the president's comments. The artist is now concerned about her livelihood and the future of her artistic career.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 10% tariff on imports has commenced, triggering market volatility and countermeasures from China. The UK Prime Minister is consulting with foreign leaders amidst concerns of a damaging trade war. Canada's high commissioner criticized the tariffs as illogical, predicting economic harm to the U.S. Experts call this a seismic shift in global trade, with expectations of evolving negotiations and potential for countries to secure lower rates over time. The tariffs have already wiped out trillions in stock market value and sent investors fleeing to safe-haven assets.</p>
