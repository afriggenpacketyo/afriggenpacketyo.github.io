          <p>Amazon Web Services experienced a significant outage, causing disruptions for numerous major websites and internal Amazon services. The outage began early Monday morning, with users reporting issues across various platforms like Disney+, Lyft, and Reddit. AWS cited DNS problems with its DynamoDB service as the initial cause, leading to increased error rates for customers trying to launch new instances. The company worked to restore services, confirming the outage affected Amazon.com and its customer support operations. This event underscores the reliance on a few major cloud providers and the widespread impact of technical faults in centralized software. </p>

          <p>A 49-year-old man was arrested at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport after allegedly threatening to "shoot it up" in social media posts. Police were alerted by the man's family, who reported his possession of a semi-automatic assault rifle. Officers found an AR-15 with ammunition in his truck, and the suspect, a felon with mental health challenges, was taken into custody. Authorities believe the man intended to use the weapon inside the crowded terminal, averting a potential tragedy through community and law enforcement collaboration. </p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is seeking to dismiss his criminal case, arguing it's a "vindictive and selective" prosecution stemming from personal animus by President Trump. Comey's lawyers claim Trump ordered the Justice Department to prosecute him due to past criticisms, forcing the resignation of an interim U.S. attorney. They also challenge the appointment of Lindsey Halligan, Trump's former personal lawyer, as acting U.S. attorney, arguing her appointment was unlawful. Comey faces charges related to Senate testimony, and his legal team asserts the indictment is a nullity due to constitutional and statutory defects. </p>
