          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is intensifying over the central Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center anticipate it will strengthen into a hurricane by this weekend but is expected to remain over open waters. While no watches or warnings are currently in effect for land, the storm's center is projected to pass near Bermuda early next week. Swells generated by Gabrielle are likely to affect the U.S. East Coast and Atlantic Canada, creating potentially dangerous surf conditions.</p>

          <p>A unique spaghetti recipe has gone viral on TikTok, sparking a debate among food enthusiasts online. Content creator Sabrina Burke shared her "secret ingredient" for spaghetti and meat sauce: canned cranberry sauce, which she claims adds a sweet and tangy flavor that elevates the dish. While some followers praised the unconventional addition and shared their own secret ingredients like grape jelly or brown sugar, others were less convinced, with some calling it an offense to Italian culinary traditions. The article highlights the polarizing reactions to this creative twist on a classic comfort food.</p>

          <p>While deadly flooding in the U.S. Southwest has subsided, forecasters warn that monsoonal moisture could bring a renewed risk of flash floods to Southern California and Arizona this weekend. This threat follows recent severe weather that resulted in a fatality in Barstow, California, after a child was swept away by floodwaters. Meanwhile, in the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Gabrielle continues to strengthen and is expected to become the season's second hurricane. Although not a direct threat to the U.S. mainland, Gabrielle will generate dangerous surf and rip currents along the East Coast.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a law making it the first state to prohibit on-duty law enforcement officers, including federal agents, from wearing masks that hide their identities. The "No Secret Police Act" is a direct response to recent immigration enforcement actions where masked federal agents detained people, which critics described as terrorizing communities. While the law includes exceptions for riot gear or undercover work, its enforceability on federal agents is legally uncertain and faces strong opposition from law enforcement groups who cite officer safety concerns. The legislation reflects a growing conflict between California and the Trump administration over immigration policy.</p>

          <p>Efforts to engage China in trilateral nuclear arms reduction talks with the United States and Russia have reached a stalemate. A push by the Trump administration for these "denuclearization" discussions was firmly rejected by Beijing, which deemed the proposal unrealistic and unreasonable. China maintains that its nuclear arsenal is kept at the minimum level required for national security and that it does not participate in arms races. This impasse raises concerns about the future of arms control agreements like the New START treaty and the potential for a renewed nuclear arms race.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a new $100,000 fee for companies seeking to hire high-skilled foreign workers through the H-1B visa program. This executive order has been criticized by some immigration advocates but praised by others who argue the program has been exploited to replace American workers with cheaper labor. The move creates a significant challenge for major tech companies like Amazon and Microsoft, which rely heavily on the program and have recently been attempting to build a better relationship with the president. The policy change highlights the complex and often tense relationship between the tech industry and the current administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A right-wing demonstration in the Netherlands turned violent as rioters clashed with police, set a police car on fire, and vandalized a political party's office in The Hague. The unrest occurred just weeks before the country's general election. Police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowd, which had blocked a major highway to protest the country's asylum policies. Political leaders, including caretaker Prime Minister Dick Schoof, condemned the violence, calling it "completely unacceptable" and an act of intimidation against the democratic process.</p>

They contend the prison is cost-effective, has available space, and offers numerous rehabilitation programs. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation cited high infrastructure costs and an aging facility as reasons for the closure.</p>

          <p>The Indian government has officially responded to the new $100,000 fee for U.S. H-1B skilled worker visas, stating the measure will have significant "humanitarian consequences" by disrupting families.

The White House has clarified that the fee applies only to new applicants, not current visa holders or renewals. This development adds another layer of tension to U.S.-India relations, which are already strained by recent trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to social psychologist Sara Nasserzadeh, a lack of respect is a major red flag in a relationship that can severely damage a person's self-esteem over time. In her book "Love by Design," she explains that disrespect can manifest in various ways, from small actions like ignoring a partner's presence to larger issues like devaluing their priorities or identity. Nasserzadeh emphasizes that respect is a fundamental ingredient for a thriving partnership. She advises addressing these behaviors through conversation but notes that if a partner is unwilling to change, it may be a sign the relationship is not viable.</p>

State laws in these jurisdictions limit local law enforcement's cooperation with federal immigration agents, often requiring a judicial warrant.
