          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is reportedly considering closing two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its restructuring plans, according to a company source. The plants in question are Nissan's main Oppama plant in Yokosuka and the Shonan plant of its subsidiary Nissan Shatai Co. in Hiratsuka. These plants account for approximately 30 percent of Nissan's domestic production capacity. The decision to close the plants remains uncertain, as the company has yet to hold talks with labor unions, parts makers, or municipalities. The company is grappling with poor sales in the United States and China.</p>

          <p>Israel's military has initiated a major offensive, named "Operation Gideon's Chariots," aimed at defeating Hamas and securing the release of remaining hostages in Gaza. The Israeli Defense Forces have mobilized troops to seize strategic areas within the Gaza Strip. Hamas-run officials report that Israeli attacks have resulted in approximately 250 deaths since Thursday. Israel imposed an aid blockade on the Gaza strip after the breakdown of a two-month ceasefire. The operation signifies a failure of previous efforts to resume ceasefire talks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former White House lawyers and foreign affairs experts have criticized Donald Trump's acceptance of overseas gifts and targeted investments as "unprecedented." Concerns are raised about potential conflicts of interest and the perception that American foreign policy is being influenced by foreign largesse. One example cited is Qatar's offer to give the U.S. Department of Defense a $400 million Boeing 747-8. Experts also point to a $2 billion investment from UAE-controlled funds into a Trump-linked stablecoin, incentivizing the president to favor Abu Dhabi. Critics argue this behavior violates the emoluments clause of the constitution.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's plan for tariffs on the world, announced on April 2nd, 2025, dubbed "liberation day" by his administration, quickly unraveled.

After a 90-day pause, tariffs were reinstated on China, but later reduced.

Reagan's budget featured increases for the Pentagon and cuts to social safety nets, alongside historic tax cuts.

The article also notes the presence of an unelected official with significant power, similar to Elon Musk's role in Trump's administration, with David Stockman serving as Reagan's budget director. The article also delves into the origins of budget reconciliation, tracing it back to the Congressional Budget Control and Impoundment Act of 1974.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department under President Trump is focusing on voter fraud, with assistance from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Recent charges have been brought against individuals accused of illegal voting, including non-citizens who mistakenly believed they were eligible. While Trump and his allies have claimed widespread non-citizen voting, evidence suggests these are isolated incidents. State audits have found minimal instances of non-citizen voting. The Justice Department press releases credit DOGE with assisting with the investigations into Jamiel and the Demydenkos, but it is not clear what role DOGE played, or whether DOGE also assisted with the arrest of Wallace.</p>

DOGE staffers, some with limited government experience, are conducting meetings with these organizations to review their operations and finances.

At the brief meeting, the two sides agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners each soon. The bus was struck by a Russian Lancet drone just outside of Bilopillia, which sits a few miles from the Russian border and had a prewar population of roughly 15,000 people.</p>

          <p>Germany's Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has voiced skepticism regarding a potential ban on the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Merz stated that he is wary of procedures that ban political parties, viewing them as a means of eliminating political opponents. The AfD has been classified as a "confirmed right-wing extremist endeavor" by Germany's domestic intelligence agency, but Merz believes it must be proven that the party is actively working against the democratic order. The AfD polls around 20%, but major political parties refuse to form a coalition with the party.</p>

          <p>A bronze statue of Melania Trump, erected near her hometown of Sevnica, Slovenia, has been stolen. The statue was chopped off at the feet, and police are investigating the theft. Residents suspect the statue was either vandalized or melted down for cash. The statue, which replaced a wooden version set on fire in 2020, had been criticized for its unesthetic appearance. The statue was originally made of wood, it was hacked from a linden tree and unveiled in 2019 by an artist who used a chain saw to create a very, very rough likeness of the first lady.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone attack on a civilian minibus in north-eastern Ukraine has resulted in the deaths of nine people, according to local officials. The attack occurred in Bilopillia, Sumy, as the bus traveled to the regional capital near the Russian border. This attack happened just hours after Russia and Ukraine held their first direct peace talks since 2022, though no breakthrough was achieved. Ukraine's president condemned the attack as a "deliberate killing of civilians," while Russian state media claimed forces had hit a "military staging area" in Sumy.</p>

          <p>Two North Korean fishermen who "accidentally defected" to South Korea are stuck in limbo, as Pyongyang refuses to communicate with Seoul. The fishermen were picked up by a South Korean naval patrol in March after their boat was washed south of the maritime boundary. Despite repeatedly expressing their desire to return home, North Korea has not responded to South Korea's attempts to contact them. The situation is attributed to strained relations between the two Koreas and North Korea's designation of South Korea as a "hostile state."</p>
