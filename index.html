          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new set of genome editing tools called programmable chromosome engineering (PCE) systems. Published in the journal Cell, this breakthrough makes large-scale DNA editing more efficient and precise, particularly in complex organisms like plants. The Chinese Academy of Sciences states this technology could revolutionize crop improvement and the treatment of genetic diseases. It may also accelerate the creation of artificial chromosomes, advancing the field of synthetic biology.</p>

          <p>Shanghai's nighttime economy is experiencing a significant boost driven by Gen Z's enthusiasm for live theater and performances. Young residents are dedicating a substantial portion of their expenses to attending multiple shows weekly, fostering a vibrant cultural scene. The city government has launched the "Wonderful Night Shanghai" initiative to support this trend by streamlining approval processes and enriching entertainment options. This focus on the night economy is part of a broader strategy to stimulate domestic consumption amid deflationary pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ahead of a planned summit between the U.S. and Russian presidents in Alaska, key European allies have jointly insisted that any peace negotiations must include Ukraine. Leaders from the UK, France, Germany, and others stressed that international borders cannot be altered by force and that Ukraine must determine its own destiny. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated that any agreements made without Kyiv's participation would be "dead decisions," reacting strongly to suggestions of territorial exchanges. European leaders also expressed concern about being excluded from talks that directly impact their continent's security.</p>

          <p>Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has publicly questioned UEFA's tribute to former Palestinian international player Suleiman al-Obeid, pointing out that the statement omitted the cause of his death. The Palestinian Football Association reported that al-Obeid was shot and killed by Israeli forces while waiting for humanitarian aid in Gaza. In a social media post, Salah directly asked UEFA to clarify how, where, and why the footballer died. This follows Salah's previous calls for increased humanitarian access to Gaza and highlights a growing trend of football figures speaking out on the conflict.</p>

Police responded to the incident at Spaulding and Queensberry Avenues, discovering four male and two female victims. The child was shot in the hand with non-life-threatening injuries, while a 38-year-old man is in critical condition following surgery. According to Police Commissioner Richard Worley, it appears a gunman opened fire on a group of people who were gathered outside. Homicide detectives are involved due to the severity of one victim's injuries.</p>

His death follows that of another boxer, Shigetoshi Kotari, who died on Friday from injuries suffered in a separate bout on the same fight card. Both athletes had undergone surgery for subdural hematomas, a severe condition involving bleeding between the skull and the brain.</p>

          <p>Following his tragic death in a car accident, former Liverpool and Portugal forward Diogo Jota is being remembered for his profound humility and deep connection to his roots. Despite his rise to stardom, Jota maintained a simple lifestyle, even living in his former youth team's dormitory long after turning professional. Friends, former coaches, and teammates recall him as an ordinary person in a world of superstars who never forgot those who helped him. For his wedding, he requested donations to local charities instead of gifts, embodying a spirit of gratitude that left a lasting mark on everyone he met.</p>

          <p>Wang Xingxing, the founder of Chinese robotics company Unitree, predicts that the robotics industry could experience its "ChatGPT moment" within the next one to two years. He defines this milestone as a robot's ability to autonomously perform a novel task, like cleaning a room, in an entirely new environment. Speaking at the World Robot Conference in Beijing, Wang noted that while hardware is sufficiently advanced, the "AI for embodied intelligence" is the main bottleneck. He suggested that text-to-video generation might be a more promising path for advancing robot motion control.</p>

          <p>A small, round piece of a bathroom door lock proved to be the crucial piece of evidence in solving the murder of Alexandra Pennig, a 32-year-old nurse from Minnesota. Initially, Matthew Ecker, who was with Pennig when she died, claimed she had shot herself after locking herself in the bathroom. However, investigators found the metal lock piece underneath Pennig's body, suggesting the door was forced open before she was shot. This contradicted Ecker's story and led to his conviction for second-degree murder, for which he was sentenced to 30 years in prison.</p>

          <p>Officials in Los Angeles are pleading with residents of Porter Ranch and Granada Hills to cease all water usage, including flushing toilets, due to a major service outage. The crisis began when a critical water control valve broke, affecting approximately 9,200 households during a severe heatwave and prompting a boil water advisory. Although some service was restored, officials warned that continued consumption is depleting pressure in the system's main tank, delaying complex underground repairs. A subsequent blowout of a temporary pipe has further complicated efforts to restore normal service.</p>

          <p>Northern China, including Beijing, has once again been struck by severe and deadly floods during its traditional rainy season.

The recent storms, which arrived in late July, primarily impacted the northern areas of the capital. This contrasts with the severe floods in 2016 and 2023, which were concentrated in the city's southern districts, indicating variability in the impact zones of these recurring events.</p>

The piece highlights the normalization of nuclear weapons as offensive tools and the collapse of arms-control agreements as catastrophic trends.
