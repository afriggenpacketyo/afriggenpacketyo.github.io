          <p>Ten Americans, including a former Navy SEAL, have been freed from Venezuelan detention following a complex prisoner exchange involving the United States, Venezuela, and El Salvador. The deal saw El Salvador repatriate 252 Venezuelan nationals who had been deported from the U.S. in exchange for the American citizens and dozens of Venezuelan political prisoners. U.S. officials described the negotiations as tense and "down-to-the-wire," with the swap representing a significant diplomatic maneuver. The release marks the freedom of all known wrongfully detained Americans in Venezuela.</p>

          <p>The new Postmaster General, David Steiner, has publicly stated his opposition to privatizing the U.S. Postal Service, aiming to quell concerns raised by his background as a former CEO of Waste Management and board member of FedEx. In his first message to employees, Steiner affirmed his belief in the USPS's current structure as a self-financing, independent entity. While he plans to assess the ongoing "Delivering for America" reorganization plan, his initial statements have provided some reassurance to union leaders. This stance contrasts with previous administration proposals to sell off the agency's services.</p>

          <p>Operations at Vancouver International Airport were temporarily suspended after a pilot stole a small Cessna 172 aircraft from a nearby airport and flew it into YVR's airspace. The pilot, identified as 39-year-old Shaheer Cassim, allegedly threatened a flight instructor before taking the plane. Air traffic was halted for 39 minutes, causing nine flights to be rerouted before the pilot landed safely and was apprehended. Authorities suggest the pilot had an "ideological motive" aimed at disrupting air traffic, and he now faces a hijacking charge.</p>

          <p>President Trump recently alleged that files related to Jeffrey Epstein were doctored by the previous administration, but many of the documents have been publicly available for years. The records, which mention Trump and other prominent figures, stem primarily from a 2015 civil lawsuit that concluded in 2017, with documents being unsealed in stages since 2019. This article fact-checks the president's claims, noting that no substantive new filings occurred during the period he referenced. The White House defended the administration's handling of the files, directing further questions to the Department of Justice.</p>

          <p>A prisoner exchange that freed ten Americans from Venezuela was facilitated by El Salvador, highlighting the growing relationship between Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele and the U.S. administration. El Salvador repatriated about 250 Venezuelan nationals, who were being held in its maximum-security CECOT prison after being deported from the U.S., in return for the American citizens and Venezuelan political prisoners. Bukele, who has backed the U.S. policy of deporting migrants to his country, framed the deal as the result of months of negotiations. U.S. officials expressed deep gratitude for Bukele's crucial role in the successful exchange.</p>

          <p>The abrupt cancellation of 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' by CBS highlights the precarious state of the late-night television format in the modern media landscape. This article analyzes the business decisions behind the move, pointing to declining linear TV viewership, high production costs, and the shift of audiences to streaming and online clips. Despite Colbert's show being the highest-rated in its time slot, it was reportedly losing significant money for the network. The cancellation reflects a broader industry trend where the cultural and financial value of traditional talk shows is diminishing.</p>

          <p>The recently signed GENIUS Act represents the first major federal law to govern cryptocurrencies in the U.S., specifically targeting stablecoins. This article explains that the law creates a regulatory framework with consumer protections for these digital assets, which are typically pegged to a stable currency like the U.S. dollar. By establishing clear rules, the act allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins, potentially facilitating faster and lower-cost transactions. The legislation is seen as a critical step in legitimizing and integrating a part of the crypto market into the traditional financial system.</p>

          <p>Lloyd Howell, the executive director of the NFL Players Association, has resigned following an investigation that reportedly found he expensed multiple strip club visits to the union. According to ESPN, one receipt from a Miami club totaled over $700, while another from an Atlanta club was for over $2,400 and was listed as a "Player Engagement Event." This news comes amid other scrutinies of Howell's leadership, including his handling of collusion grievances and a potential conflict of interest.

          <p>A CBS News investigation found that TikTok's platform made hundreds of videos promoting extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery easily accessible to an account registered for a 15-year-old user. This occurred despite TikTok's own guidelines that restrict such content for users under 18. After interacting with a few such videos, the platform's algorithm began recommending more content with harmful messages, such as promoting severely restrictive diets and idealizing unhealthy body types. In response, TikTok stated the findings were based on a limited sample and do not reflect the experience of most users.</p>

The move came shortly after a report of a lewd letter allegedly bearing Trump's signature was found among Epstein's belongings. While Bondi stated the DOJ is ready to move forward, releasing such transcripts is rare and requires court approval. Critics argue that the testimony would only represent a fraction of the total evidence and may not satisfy calls for full transparency.</p>
