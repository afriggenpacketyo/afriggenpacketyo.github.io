          <p>Japan and the United States have committed to accelerating tariff negotiations, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement potentially by June, signaling progress in expanding bilateral trade relations. Following discussions in Washington, both nations plan to hold intensive ministerial talks starting in mid-May, addressing contentious issues at the working level. While Japan emphasizes protecting its national interests, the agreement seeks to deepen cooperation on non-tariff barriers and economic security. Prime Minister Ishiba and President Trump may discuss the deal during the G7 summit in Canada in June, with Japan considering increased purchases of US corn and soybeans to aid in trade balance.</p>

          <p>The film "Rust" is finally being released in theaters four years after the tragic accidental shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins by actor Alec Baldwin with a prop gun containing live ammunition. The Western drama, about an outlaw helping his grandson, faced numerous legal battles and controversy, with some criticizing the release as insensitive. A Hulu documentary, "Last Take: Rust and the Story of Halyna," focuses on Hutchins' life and the emotional impact of her death. Baldwin, initially charged with involuntary manslaughter, had the charges dropped, while the film's armorer was convicted. Matt Hutchins, Halyna's widower, reached a settlement with producers and became an executive producer, dedicating the film to his late wife.</p>

          <p>Jeopardy! host Ken Jennings, who famously competed against IBM's Watson in 2011, voiced his skepticism about current artificial intelligence, stating that while modern LLMs would outperform Watson at Jeopardy!, he still prefers content created by human minds. Jennings highlighted the fear of AI replacing creatives in Hollywood, a concern that was prominent during the writers' and actors' strikes of 2023. He also relayed musician will.i.am's sentiment that artists who focus on creative expression rather than chasing algorithms have little to fear from AI, as AI is best suited to mimic existing creations.</p>

          <p>India will include caste details in its next census, a move expected to have major socio-economic and political consequences. The decision, announced by Information Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, signals a commitment to the values and interests of the society and country. This count is likely to lead to demands for increased quotas in government jobs, college admissions, and elected offices for lower and intermediate castes, known as Other Backward Classes (OBCs). The announcement comes months before a crucial election in Bihar, where caste is a key issue, and follows similar surveys already released by two other states.</p>

          <p>China is considering U.S. overtures for trade negotiations but insists on the removal of all unilateral tariffs as a condition for talks. Senior U.S. officials have reached out multiple times hoping to start negotiations, but Chinese authorities emphasize that failure to remove tariffs would indicate a lack of sincerity. President Trump has imposed 145% tariffs on imported Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory levies of 125% from China. While Beijing appears ready to engage in talks, analysts caution that reaching a comprehensive deal will be complex and time-consuming, hinging on both sides' strategic priorities and economic red lines.</p>

The change, effective for shipments from mainland China and Hong Kong, subjects packages worth less than $800 to tariffs, potentially raising prices for consumers and affecting small businesses. The administration cited concerns about the loophole being used for fentanyl trafficking and harming U.S. jobs in warehousing and logistics. While supporters say the move helps U.S. manufacturers, opponents argue it increases prices and disrupts trade.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to eliminate the de minimis rule, which allowed tax-free entry of goods under $800, is unraveling the trade relationship between China and the United States. This policy change has enabled American shoppers to buy inexpensive goods directly from Chinese factories, leading to a surge in e-commerce trade. Now, with most packages from mainland China and Hong Kong subject to tariffs, American shoppers are facing higher prices, and Chinese exporters are struggling to find new buyers. The trade tensions pose a significant challenge for China's export-driven economy, with potential job losses and factory closures.</p>
