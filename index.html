            <p>US shares have rocketed after US President Donald Trump said he would suspend steep tariffs on goods from most countries, and instead impose a 10% import tax rate. The White House said it was backing off on higher levies for trade partners that had agreed to negotiate, although Trump said he would raise tariffs on goods from China even further, to at least 125% "effective immediately". The S&P 500 soared 9.5% in the biggest one-day rally since 2008, following days of turmoil sparked by the tariffs. Optimism score: 70 (not investment advice)</p>

Even with the recent moderation, Trump's trade policy is still more radical than what was considered a worst-case scenario prior to his inauguration. Optimism score: 45 (not investment advice)</p>
