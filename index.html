          <p>Following a classified briefing, several Senate Democrats expressed skepticism regarding the Trump administration's claims that recent U.S. strikes had "obliterated" Iran's nuclear program. Senators like Chris Murphy and Mark Warner suggested the president was misleading the public, arguing that the attacks only set back Iran's capabilities by months, not years, as knowledge and some equipment likely remain intact. The briefing, which included top intelligence and military officials, failed to provide what Democrats considered a coherent long-term strategy to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, leaving significant questions unanswered about the true extent of the damage.</p>

This article's review notes that the movie borrows heavily from classics like "The Terminator" but maintains a shaggy sense of humor, focusing on the blend between biological and synthetic beings.

          <p>A plan to convert a shuttered prison in California City into the state's largest immigrant detention center has drawn strong opposition from advocacy groups. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has partnered with private prison contractor CoreCivic for the 2,500-bed facility, fueling concerns about the expansion of a system critics say profits from suffering. At a recent city council meeting, opponents argued that such facilities harm communities and separate families.

          <p>President Trump's proposed "Trump Card," a $5 million visa for wealthy immigrants, has generated significant interest but faces substantial legal and practical challenges, according to immigration attorneys. The plan would need congressional approval to alter the existing EB-5 visa program and, more critically, to change U.S. tax law to exempt cardholders from taxes on their worldwide income. While the administration touts high sign-up numbers, experts suggest the actual market is much smaller than projected. Key questions about vetting applicants, tax loopholes, and estate tax implications remain unanswered, causing many potential clients to adopt a wait-and-see approach. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a period of decline, interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have recently ticked up, but homeowners may see relief later this summer. This article outlines three key dates when variable HELOC rates could potentially fall. The first is the release of the June inflation report on July 15, as a favorable reading could encourage lenders to lower rates. The other two opportunities are the Federal Reserve meetings in late July and mid-September, where the central bank could either cut its benchmark rate or provide strong signals about future reductions, influencing the broader rate environment.
