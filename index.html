According to the city's military administration, this was a direct hit on a civilian structure in the Sviatoshynskyi district. The overnight strikes hit 27 different locations across the capital, injuring at least 52 individuals, with nine children among those hospitalized. Ukrainian officials condemned the attack as brutal, noting that rescue efforts were underway for people potentially still trapped under the rubble.</p>

          <p>The crew of China's Shenzhou-19 mission revealed that their record-setting spacewalk included an unexpected and challenging repair task. Astronaut Cai Xuzhe explained that a payload adaptor, a critical docking mechanism for external experiments, became jammed during a cargo installation procedure outside the Tiangong space station. Lacking specialized tools for the unforeseen problem and operating under tight time constraints, the astronauts had to improvise a solution in real-time. They successfully collaborated with the ground control team to resolve the issue, showcasing their resourcefulness in a high-pressure environment.</p>

          <p>A military pilot was able to eject safely before an F-35 fighter jet crashed in a field near Naval Air Station Lemoore in Fresno County, California. Officials confirmed the incident occurred on Wednesday evening, and no other personnel were harmed. The aircraft was part of the VFA-125 "Rough Raiders" squadron, a unit dedicated to training F-35 pilots. The crash ignited a small grass fire that burned approximately a dozen acres before being contained by Cal Fire. An investigation into the cause of the crash is currently underway.</p>

          <p>With an August 1st deadline set by the Trump administration, global trade dynamics remain tense as numerous countries face the prospect of increased tariffs on exports to the United States. While the US has secured framework deals with eight partners, including the EU and Japan, these involve higher rates than before and significant concessions. Other major trading partners like Mexico, Canada, and India have yet to reach agreements and face steep potential levies. The situation is further complicated by political factors and a pending court decision on the president's authority to impose these tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

With the series already secured, Blair Kinghorn will start on the left wing, replacing James Lowe, while James Ryan comes into the second row for Ollie Chessum. The selection emphasizes cohesion, with eleven players starting all three Tests in the series. The bench features a six-two split between forwards and backs, including the versatile Ben Earl and Jac Morgan, as Farrell prioritizes winning the final match over rotating the squad for experience.</p>

          <p>Shares of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean jumped over 16% to a multi-year high following the announcement of a new trade deal between the United States and South Korea. The agreement sets a 15% tariff on South Korean exports, a rate seen as favorable for the industry. The stock surge was also fueled by a strong second-quarter performance, where operating profits reversed from a loss a year ago, and the announcement of new orders. Hanwha is expected to expand its U.S. operations at the Philly Shipyard, contributing to the revitalization of American shipbuilding. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At least 30 Palestinians were killed by Israeli gunfire while waiting for humanitarian aid in northern Gaza, according to the Hamas-run civil defence agency. The incident, which also reportedly wounded around 300 others, occurred near the Zikim crossing. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) stated they fired "warning shots" after a crowd gathered around aid trucks but were unaware of casualties from their fire. This event adds to a growing number of fatalities during aid distributions, with the UN human rights office reporting over 1,000 such deaths since late May amid warnings of famine conditions in the territory.</p>

          <p>Arkansas State Police have arrested a suspect in the killing of a couple at Devil's Den State Park. James Andrew McGann, 28, has been charged with two counts of capital murder for the deaths of Clinton and Cristen Brink. The couple was found dead over the weekend while hiking with their two young daughters, who were unharmed in the attack. Authorities had previously released a composite sketch of a person of interest who they believed had sustained an injury during the crime. Officials praised the multi-agency collaboration that led to the arrest of the suspect.</p>

          <p>Ford has revised its forecast for the financial impact of tariffs, now expecting them to cost the company approximately $2 billion in the current year. The automaker, which manufactures most of its vehicles in the US, reported already paying an extra $800 million in duties in the last quarter alone. The increased costs are attributed to sustained high tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, where Ford has facilities, as well as levies on steel and aluminum. This announcement underscores the significant financial pressure President Trump's trade policies are placing on major American corporations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a controversial bill into law that increases penalties for soliciting 16- and 17-year-olds for sex. The new law, AB 379, allows prosecutors the discretion to charge an offender with a felony on a first offense if they are at least three years older than the minor. This "wobbler" provision aims to target older predators while avoiding harsher charges for all younger offenders. The bill faced controversy and amendments after some Democrats raised concerns that it could be used to unfairly target minorities and that its loitering provision was too vague.</p>

A source close to Harris indicated that while she seriously considered the run, she concluded she could have a greater impact on the national stage and that her heart wasn't in the gubernatorial race. This decision keeps the door open for a potential presidential run in 2028, though she has reportedly not yet decided on that possibility.</p>

The three individuals had been missing since the facility exploded on Tuesday.

The blast, which shook nearby homes, tore off the plant's tower and ignited a persistent fire that hampered rescue and recovery efforts. The cause of the explosion is under investigation.</p>

          <p>A significant diplomatic split has emerged between the United States and its key allies, including the UK, France, and Canada, over the future of Gaza. These nations have announced plans to recognize a Palestinian state, a move the Trump administration opposes and boycotted at a recent UN conference. This divergence marks a departure from the previous administration's principles for a post-war Gaza, which included a Palestinian-led governance structure. The Trump administration's current strategy appears to align more closely with Israel's, leaving a strategic vacuum that European and Arab nations are now attempting to fill.</p>

          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered tsunami alerts across the Pacific, but the risk for the United States has largely passed without major damage. The powerful quake generated waves that prompted initial warnings and evacuations in Hawaii and along the U.S. West Coast, but these were later downgraded to advisories and then canceled. While some minor flooding and small waves were observed, the worst-case scenarios were avoided. However, alerts and evacuations remained in effect for some coastal areas in South American countries like Chile, as the series of powerful waves continued to travel across the ocean.</p>

The move comes after residents of the fire-ravaged community raised concerns that building additional density under the state's SB 9 housing law would worsen evacuation dangers in future wildfires. While officials have blocked new SB 9 projects, they have actively encouraged the building of accessory dwelling units (ADUs) to aid in reconstruction.

The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter new runway that would avoid the costly and disruptive process of rerouting the M25 motorway. The company claims its proposal would reduce risk, avoid spiraling costs, and could be fully operational by 2035 for under £25 billion. This marks the first time the government is considering competing bids for the long-debated third runway project, a move Arora praised as a common-sense approach.</p>
