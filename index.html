          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 08:29:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Unregulated mining for rare earth metals in Myanmar is causing severe environmental pollution in neighboring Thailand. Rivers like the Kok and Sai, crucial for local communities, are now contaminated with hazardous materials, including arsenic at levels far exceeding WHO safety limits. This pollution affects drinking water, agriculture, and local ecosystems, with activists and experts blaming the global demand for rare earths, largely driven by China. The situation is exacerbated by the ongoing civil war in Myanmar, leaving the mining areas in a lawless state with little hope for regulation.</p>

          <p>Rescue teams in Central Texas are continuing their search for more than 170 people who remain missing after catastrophic flash floods. The death toll has risen to at least 122, with the majority of fatalities occurring in Kerr County, including at a girls' summer camp on the Guadalupe River. A federal disaster has been declared, enabling FEMA support, but ongoing storms have complicated recovery efforts. The article also details the scrutiny over the adequacy of weather warnings and the lack of a local siren system, which are now subjects of official review.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly contemplating the authorization of new funding for Ukraine, a potential shift in policy since taking office. Diplomatic sources suggest this move could be a strategic message to Russia following its recent intensified attacks on Ukrainian cities. President Trump has recently expressed disappointment with Vladimir Putin and hinted at sending more defensive weapons, despite previous criticisms of aid levels. The funding could potentially come from leftover presidential drawdown authority or seized Russian assets, as the administration also pushes European allies to increase their support.</p>

          <p>Scientists express concern that promising mRNA-based cancer research could be jeopardized by political backlash against COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. As some U.S. officials and regulators restrict mRNA shots and cut funding, there is fear that therapeutic cancer vaccines for diseases like pancreatic cancer and melanoma will be negatively impacted. Researchers highlight that this technology, which has been in development for over a decade, holds tremendous potential to revolutionize treatment for many diseases. The article notes the "tremendous uncertainty" created by these political actions could stall critical progress and discourage future research projects.</p>

          <p>This article argues that modern society increasingly restricts children's free, unstructured movement, to their detriment. While wild animals and, historically, children engage in ample physical play, today's youth are often sedentary, which can negatively impact physical health, cognitive skills, and mental well-being. The author consults with injury-prevention experts who suggest that activities like climbing trees and wrestling build "movement quality," making children more physically robust and less prone to injury later in life. The piece advocates for parents to embrace a degree of risk, allowing for the kind of free play that is crucial for neurological and physical development.</p>

While acknowledging the societal pressure and "pretty privilege" that drive this spending, Tassin advocates for a "hot girl detox" to evaluate these expenses.

          <p>Conservationists are raising alarms about the declining osprey population around the Chesapeake Bay, a key habitat for the species. Biologist Bryan Watts has documented that osprey pairs are failing to fledge enough chicks to maintain their numbers, with many young birds starving in their nests. He attributes this trend to the decline of menhaden, a nutrient-rich fish that is a critical part of the osprey diet and is also heavily harvested by the fishing industry. While the industry disputes the link, regulators are now considering new management approaches to address the issue and protect the iconic raptor.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the essential role of summer camp in fostering bravery and resilience in girls, viewed through the lens of the recent tragic deaths at Camp Mystic in Texas. The author, whose mother ran a Girl Scout camp, recalls camp as a safe space for girls to face small challenges, build confidence, and learn to be okay with discomfort. The piece acknowledges the "worst nightmare" scenario that occurred but hopes it won't lead parents to prevent their children from having these life-changing experiences. It argues that camp is purposeful preparation for life's trials, making the loss of life there all the more poignant.</p>

          <h2>New Polling Indicates Potential Political Risks for Republicans Over Trump's Trade Policies</h2>

          <p>A recent poll suggests that President Trump's aggressive trade and tariff policies could pose a risk to his support, even among his own voters. The survey reveals that about one in four 2024 Trump voters believe his tariffs are harming trade negotiations, and they are divided on whether he should have the unilateral power to impose them. While many supporters back tariffs on China, a significant portion only do so if it doesn't lead to higher consumer prices. The findings highlight a potential vulnerability for Republicans, as the economic uncertainty of trade wars could alienate voters concerned about inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has once again delayed imposing steep tariffs on nearly 60 trading partners, pushing the deadline from July 9 to August 1. While this move provides more time to finalize trade agreements with partners like the European Union and India, sources indicate the president's patience is wearing thin and this could be the final extension. The chaotic rollout and use of tariffs as a bargaining tool have left some foreign officials skeptical of the deadline's firmness. However, the pressure has forced concessions, such as the EU dropping its digital tax plan, as countries try to avoid global economic turmoil. (not investment advice)</p>

This article argues that the backlash is overblown, as Superman has always been an immigrant from the planet Krypton. The film itself reportedly emphasizes all-American values, showing that Clark Kent's heroism is shaped by his upbringing in Kansas, not just his alien origins. The analysis points out that while the character's story is one of an outsider, it has rarely delved into the politics of immigration in the U.S.</p>
