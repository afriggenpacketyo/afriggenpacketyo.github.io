          <p>Sony Group shares saw a rise of over 2% amidst volatile trading following the announcement of a 250 billion yen share buyback. The company's operating income for the last three months surpassed analyst estimates, though it decreased by 11% compared to the previous year. Sony also detailed plans for a partial spinoff of its financial unit, with shareholders receiving over 80% of the shares through dividends. While the outlook for the current financial year was somewhat lackluster due to anticipated impacts from trade policies, Sony clarified that recent trade deals could significantly alter the actual tariff impact.

Family offices face competition from banks, private equity firms, and hedge funds for top talent, and they often prioritize trust over other qualifications when hiring.

          <p>British businesses are expressing concerns that the UK government's plans to tighten immigration rules on foreign workers will lead to labor shortages in key sectors. The government aims to prioritize British workers and boost domestic skills, but businesses fear that Brits are either unable or unwilling to fill the gaps, particularly in sectors like health and social care. Care England warns that ending overseas recruitment for social care visas could have serious consequences for a sector already facing immense pressure, with 131,000 vacancies. Industry leaders acknowledge the importance of boosting training among British workers but emphasize the need for a controlled immigration system to support investment.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, potentially leading to their release after over three decades for killing their parents in 1989. Judge Michael V. Jesic cited letters from corrections officials documenting the brothers' support and rehabilitation in prison as influencing his decision. While the judge reduced their sentences, the final decision rests with Gov. Gavin Newsom and the state parole board, with a hearing scheduled for June 13. The brothers expressed remorse and took responsibility for their actions, while the Los Angeles district attorney opposed resentencing, arguing they hadn't fully acknowledged their crimes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has approved a potential sale of over $1.4 billion in helicopters and F-16 fighter jet parts to the United Arab Emirates, coinciding with President Donald Trump’s visit to the Middle Eastern nation. The proposed sale includes $1.32 billion for CH-47 F Chinook helicopters and $130 million for F-16s parts. This decision comes as Trump is scheduled to visit the UAE as part of his four-day trip to the Middle East, with previous criticism from lawmakers who cite concerns over the UAE's involvement in conflicts and potential misuse of the weapons.</p>

          <p>Amidst increasing pressure to end the war in Ukraine, President Zelenskyy has challenged President Putin to meet him in Istanbul for peace talks after Putin demanded negotiations occur there. This move follows unsuccessful attempts by Ukraine and European allies to secure a ceasefire, with Putin undermining these efforts by proposing direct talks. President Trump has weighed in, urging Ukraine to accept Putin's offer, leading Zelenskyy to raise the stakes by calling for a personal summit with both Trump and Putin. Shaun Walker from The Guardian suggests Putin's attendance is unlikely, as both Russia and Ukraine primarily aim to secure Trump's support.</p>

          <p>A charter plane carrying 59 white South Africans arrived in the U.S. after being fast-tracked by President Trump under a new program for refugees allegedly suffering from racist policies. Trump claimed they were fleeing a "genocide," but experts and South African officials deny any persecution of white Afrikaners or a threat of land theft. Critics argue Trump's move is based on false narratives and serves to position himself as a savior of white privilege, further straining relations between the U.S. and South Africa, which have been tense due to South Africa's ties with BRICS nations and its lawsuit against Israel.</p>

          <p>U.S. retail egg prices experienced a decrease in April, marking the first decline in months, yet they remain near record highs due to a persistent outbreak of bird flu.

Despite this decrease, egg prices are still significantly higher than the previous year, and experts predict that prices may continue to fluctuate depending on the progression of the bird flu virus.

As U.S.-China tensions escalate, utilities are preparing for potential bans on Chinese inverter manufacturers, with some attempting to source equipment from elsewhere.

          <p>Casandra Ventura, known as Cassie, testified in the federal sex-trafficking and racketeering trial of Sean Combs, detailing drug-fueled sex sessions with male prostitutes that she described as "disgusting" and "humiliating." Ventura recounted participating in these sessions, known as "freak-offs," for years to please Combs, who allegedly dictated her sex acts and appearance. She claimed that Combs orchestrated the sessions, specifying details such as nail color and demanding constant application of baby oil. Ventura stated she stayed in the relationship out of fear of Combs's power over her career and potential blackmail with videos of the sessions.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Uganda have observed wild chimpanzees using medicinal plants in various ways to treat wounds and injuries, adding to evidence that primates self-medicate in the wild. The researchers documented instances of chimps applying plants to their own wounds and occasionally to others, building on previous findings that chimps eat certain plants for their healing properties. This research also highlights the capacity for empathy among wild chimpanzees, as they tend to the wounds of unrelated individuals. The study compiled decades of scientific observations, revealing hygiene habits and other behaviors related to self-care.</p>

In contrast, Japan ranked first in physical health and 12th in academic and social skills.
