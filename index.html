          <h2>Green Party Calls for Withdrawal of Single-Sex Space Guidance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 11:04:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Green Party is urging the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to retract its interim guidance on single-sex spaces, deeming it "ill-considered and impractical." Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer expressed concerns that the guidance, issued following a UK Supreme Court ruling defining 'woman' under the Equality Act, could lead to discrimination against transgender individuals, especially in workplaces. The guidance addresses the use of facilities in places like hospitals and restaurants, suggesting trans women should not be permitted in women's facilities but should also not be left without options. The Green Party emphasizes the need for more thoughtful guidance that considers the voices of all affected parties, particularly trans people.</p>

Trump suggested that "freeing up China" for U.S. companies would be a major win, but acknowledged that China may be unwilling to fully open its markets.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on President Gerald Ford's decision to welcome 130,000 South Vietnamese refugees to the United States after the fall of Saigon, despite public opposition and economic concerns. Ford believed the U.S. had a "profound moral obligation" to those who supported the alliance with America. Initially relying on public assistance, these refugees eventually became contributors to American society, including federal judges and an Oscar-winning actor. The article concludes that Ford's decision was both morally right and strategically smart, highlighting the strength derived from diversity in a nation of immigrants.</p>

          <p>Recent data center project cancellations by major tech companies like Microsoft and Amazon have sparked concerns about a potential bust in the AI data center boom. However, industry experts suggest this is more of a "pause" for strategic reallocation, not a retreat from demand. Factors like evolving AI market dynamics, geopolitical concerns, and the scarcity of resources like power and land are driving this reshuffling. Long-term enterprise adoption of AI is expected to fuel continued data center demand for the next decade, with major players planning significant capital expenditures on AI infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Despite Trump administration policies hindering new wind energy projects, the U.S. onshore wind industry is experiencing a "repowering" era, replacing aging turbines with more efficient models. This trend is boosting market leaders like GE Vernova, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa, who have reported revenue increases. Repowering existing wind farms offers economic benefits, such as avoiding property acquisition and increasing electricity output, but faces limitations regarding permitting and public opposition. The repowering trend is also invigorating the turbine recycling industry, addressing the challenge of decommissioning old components.</p>

          <p>As the Real ID deadline approaches, travelers are reminded that they may not be able to board flights without it. Fortunately, alternative forms of identification, such as a valid U.S. passport, passport card, or trusted traveler cards, can be used. Experts recommend arriving at the airport at least 1.5 hours before a flight due to potential delays at security checkpoints. While approximately 19% of travelers still lack Real ID-compliant identification, workarounds are available to ensure travel plans are not disrupted.</p>
