          <p>Apple announced third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by a 10% increase in overall revenue, its largest quarterly growth since late 2021. iPhone sales saw a significant 13% year-over-year rise, largely due to the popularity of the new iPhone 16 model. While the Mac business also grew impressively by nearly 15%, sales for the iPad and the wearables division, which includes Apple Watch and AirPods, both experienced declines. The company also noted a 4% sales increase in the greater China region, reversing a downward trend from the previous two quarters.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported second-quarter results that beat analyst estimates for both earnings and revenue, with sales growing 13% year-over-year to $167.7 billion. The company's cloud unit, Amazon Web Services, saw revenue climb 18%, though this growth rate trailed that of competitors Microsoft and Google. Despite the strong performance, Amazon's stock fell in after-hours trading due to a weaker-than-expected operating income forecast for the upcoming quarter. This guidance has raised investor concerns about the immediate returns on the company's substantial investments in artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>A recent high-profile meeting in France involving LeBron James, his business partner Maverick Carter, and Nikola Jokić's agent was reportedly about a new $5 billion international basketball league. The proposed venture, inspired by LIV Golf and Formula One, would feature touring men's and women's teams and offer players equity stakes, which is currently prohibited in the NBA. This development comes as the NBA is pursuing its own European expansion plans in partnership with FIBA. The new league would likely require a full-time commitment, positioning it as a direct competitor rather than a complementary entity.</p>

Forecasters warned of intense rainfall, with some areas potentially receiving up to 3 inches per hour and isolated totals reaching 5 to 8 inches. Officials urged residents to avoid travel if possible, as the severe weather was expected to create hazardous conditions during the evening commute. The combination of saturated ground and heavy downpours has increased the risk of flash floods and landslides throughout the region.</p>

The administration stated the revival is part of its "make America healthy again" initiative, aiming to champion the physical wellness and vitality of the American people. The President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition will also be re-established to oversee the program, which will be administered by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>

          <p>A plush monster doll named Labubu has become a viral fashion accessory and collectible in the United States, leading to "astronomical" growth for its Chinese parent company, Pop Mart. Originally popular in China, the toy's U.S. success has been fueled by social media trends and celebrity endorsements, with sales in North America surging over 550% between 2023 and 2024. This trend has significantly boosted Pop Mart's stock and drawn a new wave of American consumers to its broader range of collectible products. Analysts describe the Labubu as a status symbol and a "gateway drug" to the larger world of Pop Mart toys.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell has revealed that the modern potato evolved from a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago through an ancient hybridization event. Scientists have long been puzzled by the potato's origins, and this research solves the mystery by showing how two key genes combined to create the starchy tuber. A gene from the ancient tomato, SP6A, instructs the plant to form tubers, while a gene from a wild potato relative controls their growth. This discovery demonstrates how interbreeding between different species can spark the evolution of entirely new traits and organisms.</p>

In their statement, the family questioned what the president knew about the criminal activities of Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who they say targeted the then-16-year-old Giuffre. This development adds to the ongoing scrutiny of Trump's past relationship with Epstein, while the White House maintains the president kicked Epstein out of his club for inappropriate behavior.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article traces the origins of the modern "attention economy" back to the 19th century and the rise of the daily newspaper. It argues that contemporary anxieties about technology's impact on our minds are not new, citing historical figures like Henry David Thoreau who warned against the constant stream of news. The essay suggests that each new medium—from newspapers to radio, television, and now AI—has sparked similar fears about diminished intellect and shortened attention spans. While humanity has largely adapted, the author ponders whether today's AI-driven content generation represents a final stage where human intellectual labor becomes redundant.</p>

          <p>A renovation of the White House Rose Garden, which involves paving over a portion of the lawn to install a concrete patio, has gone viral and is drawing criticism on social media. The project, reportedly modeled after President Trump's Mar-a-Lago property, is one of several changes he has made to the White House grounds. While the iconic rose bushes remain, before-and-after pictures have prompted many online commentators to lament the loss of green space. The renovation is being funded by the Trust for the National Mall and is expected to be completed in early August.</p>

          <p>As homeowners increasingly tap into their home's equity, this article outlines several costly mistakes to avoid, particularly in the current economic climate with firm interest rates. Experts warn against opting for a variable-rate HELOC if predictable payments are needed, as future rate hikes could make them unaffordable. Another key pitfall is borrowing more than necessary, which increases interest costs and financial risk if home values decline or income changes. Finally, homeowners are advised to look beyond the interest rate and carefully compare all closing costs and hidden fees to understand the true cost of the loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has announced it is imposing sanctions on the Palestinian Authority (PA) and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which will include denying visas to their officials. The State Department justified the move by accusing the organizations of taking actions to "internationalize" their conflict with Israel through international courts. The U.S. also cited long-standing complaints about the PA providing payments to the families of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Palestinian leaders described the sanctions as "revenge" for the growing international movement to recognize Palestinian statehood, while Israel welcomed the U.S. action.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh has defended the court's process for handling the increasing number of emergency appeals, many of which come from the Trump administration. Speaking at a judicial conference, Kavanaugh suggested that as presidents use more executive orders to bypass Congress, it inevitably leads to more legal challenges that require the court's intervention. He acknowledged criticism that the court doesn't always fully explain its reasoning in these emergency cases but stated that internal processes have been changed to "try to get the right answer." He emphasized that despite disagreements, the collegiality among the justices remains strong.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is conducting a major legal review of President Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose broad tariffs on U.S. trading partners. During arguments, several judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sharply questioned the administration's claim that the law grants the president such authority. Judges noted that IEEPA has never before been used to assess tariffs and that the president's actions represent a "wholesale revision" of the trade framework established by Congress. The case is a significant test of a central piece of Trump's economic agenda and is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>In a rare public appearance, a group of federal judges detailed a significant increase in threats and harassment they have faced, particularly after issuing rulings against the Trump administration. The judges described receiving credible death threats, being "swatted," and being targeted by "pizza doxxing," where unsolicited pizzas are sent to their homes in the name of a murdered judge's son. They attributed the rise in hostility to inflammatory rhetoric from political leaders who attack the judiciary when they disagree with a decision. The judges urged leaders to tone down the personal attacks and respect the rule of law.</p>

The minister's comments reflect growing international pressure on Israel, as several Western countries have recently moved toward recognizing a Palestinian state. The visit also comes as the U.S. announced sanctions against Palestinian officials and threatened Canada over its stance on the issue.</p>

          <p>Tata Steel has been fined £1.5 million for safety failures that led to the death of a contractor, Justin Day, at its Port Talbot plant in 2019. The 44-year-old was crushed by a large steel beam after re-entering a work area that had been partially reactivated without his knowledge. The judge ruled that the company's systems were not "sufficiently adhered to" and that it "fell short of the appropriate standard." The victim's family expressed that their lives have been "shattered" by his death and criticized the company for a lack of support following the tragedy.</p>
