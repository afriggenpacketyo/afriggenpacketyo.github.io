          <p>Paramount Global's decision to settle President Trump's $16 million lawsuit against CBS's 60 Minutes is being viewed by critics as another instance of a major media company bowing to political pressure. The lawsuit, which legal experts largely considered meritless, alleged election interference and emotional harm over an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. This settlement follows similar actions by Disney and Meta, fueling concerns among press freedom advocates that corporate interests are leading news organizations to capitulate rather than defend independent journalism against powerful figures.</p>

          <p>Bad Bunny's latest album and short film, "DebÃ­ Tirar MÃ¡s Fotos," uses the endangered Puerto Rican crested toad, or sapo concho, as a symbol for cultural resilience in the face of displacement. The project has resonated with communities worldwide facing gentrification and cultural erosion, from Hawaii to Palestine. The film portrays a surreal, gentrified version of Puerto Rico where local culture and language are disappearing, arguing that political and economic pressures are silencing the island's identity, a theme central to the artist's recent work.</p>

Data from Indeed shows a 150% surge in applications from federal agency workers, creating a challenge as employer demand for these roles has pulled back significantly. (not investment advice)</p>
