          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel has initiated an investigation into whether former Special Counsel Jack Smith violated the Hatch Act. This probe follows a referral from Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged Smith's investigations into Donald Trump were politically motivated to interfere with the 2024 election. The OSC is an independent agency that enforces restrictions on partisan political activities by government employees. It is unclear what actions could be taken against Smith, who is no longer a federal employee, though the agency could refer its findings to the Department of Justice.</p>

          <p>Romania is making new efforts to confront its role in the Holocaust, specifically the genocide of the Sinti and Roma people, known as the "porajmos." At a commemoration event in Bucharest, the country's new pro-European president emphasized the need to address a history often silenced in public discourse. The ceremony highlighted the deportation and murder of over 25,000 Roma by Romania's World War II regime and stressed the ongoing dangers of right-wing extremism. Officials called for better enforcement of anti-racism laws and greater inclusion of the Roma community, which remains a vital part of the nation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychological technique known as "dopamine anchoring" is gaining popularity as a way to boost motivation for unpleasant tasks. The method involves pairing an enjoyable stimulus, like music or a favorite snack, with a chore to train the brain to anticipate a reward and release dopamine. Psychiatrists confirm the strategy is supported by neuroscience and can be particularly helpful for individuals with conditions like ADHD or depression. Experts caution against using unhealthy anchors and advise that the technique should be a tool to build intrinsic motivation, not a long-term crutch.</p>

Major financial institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank are increasingly building on Ethereum's network, valuing its stability and dependability.

          <p>A 54-year-old man from Polk County, Tennessee, has been arrested for allegedly threatening to kill public officials and law enforcement officers. During the arrest at his home, deputies discovered what appeared to be an improvised explosive device, prompting a wider investigation. A subsequent search by the ATF and local police uncovered a total of 14 explosive devices. Authorities stated the man attempted to detonate the explosives as officers arrived to apprehend him, leading to multiple charges of attempted first-degree murder.</p>

However, the Police Federation, representing over 145,000 officers, criticized the award as barely enough to "tread water." The federation argues the increase does little to reverse over a decade of real-terms pay cuts or address ongoing crises in officer retention and mental health. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Precinct DTLA, a well-known gay bar in downtown Los Angeles, has warned it is on the brink of permanent closure due to a costly legal battle. A former employee, a cisgender heterosexual woman, filed a lawsuit alleging she faced discrimination, harassment, and an unsafe work environment. The bar's owners have called the claims "completely false" and suggested the lawsuit is part of an anti-LGBTQ agenda, pointing to the plaintiff's lawyer's history of using slurs. The owners are now appealing to the community for support to cover the mounting legal fees that threaten the venue's survival.</p>

Creators like Aaron Parnas have amassed millions of followers by quickly breaking down complex events into digestible, minute-long videos.

          <p>A federal appeals court has placed limits on the Trump administration's attempt to suspend the U.S. asylum system at the U.S.-Mexico border. The D.C. Circuit Court panel ruled that the administration cannot use its proclamation to bypass laws that prevent the deportation of migrants to countries where they face persecution or torture. While the court allowed the administration to continue denying discretionary asylum, it affirmed that mandatory protections, such as "withholding of removal," must still be considered. This decision partially upholds a lower court's ruling that found the asylum ban violated federal law.</p>

          <p>A recent panel discussion highlighted the evolving dynamics between the United States and Israel, particularly regarding the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. According to reporting, the Trump administration is exerting more pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, reflecting a potential shift in U.S. policy. Panelists noted that while President Trump believes he has significant leverage, Netanyahu's own domestic political considerations complicate the situation. This interplay of international pressure and local politics is creating a complex and challenging environment for the Israeli government as it navigates the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>The nonprofit organization Black People Will Swim is working to address the historical and systemic reasons behind swimming disparities in the U.S. Rooted in a legacy of segregation at public pools, a significant gap in swimming ability persists, with Black children facing a much higher risk of drowning than their white peers. The organization provides accessible lessons and scholarships, aiming to create a ripple effect of more Black swimmers, instructors, and lifeguards. By opening doors to aquatic spaces, founder Paulana Lamonier and her partners hope to tackle what they describe as a public health crisis.</p>

          <p>Florida has quietly become a leader in solar energy, surpassing California last year in the addition of new utility-scale solar capacity. This growth is primarily driven by large utilities like Florida Power & Light, which are capitalizing on favorable economics and streamlined regulations for building new projects. With natural gas prices rising, solar has become the cheaper option for energy production, even as the state government removes climate change from its official policy. However, the industry faces future headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits and growing constraints on the existing power grid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The German government is increasing its diplomatic pressure on Israel, urging immediate and safe access for United Nations aid into Gaza to address the worsening humanitarian catastrophe. Following a visit by Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul, Germany stressed that the time for talk has passed and that Israel must allow the established UN system to distribute supplies without obstacles. While reaffirming its friendship with Israel, Berlin's sharpened rhetoric signals growing impatience with the Israeli government's handling of the crisis. This shift comes amid internal discussions in Germany about how to leverage its influence to push for a two-state solution.</p>

While the Lions celebrated with the trophy, players and coaches acknowledged they had not played to their full potential throughout the series. The tour will be remembered for its close contests, particularly the controversial ending of the second Test, and the Lions' ability to secure victory despite not always being at their best.</p>

The food giant is exploring strategic changes after struggling with shifting consumer tastes. Berkshire's operating earnings, which Buffett considers a more accurate measure of performance, saw only a slight decline as its other businesses performed well. The conglomerate continues to hold a massive cash pile of over $344 billion, as Buffett has yet to find any large, attractively priced acquisition targets. (not investment advice)</p>

The findings suggest that instead of forcing a one-size-fits-all approach, people can find a more sustainable fitness path by choosing activities that naturally suit their disposition.</p>

          <p>An appreciation of the late Malcolm-Jamal Warner's performance as Theo Huxtable on "The Cosby Show" highlights the complexity he brought to the character. Initially presented as a typical slacker teen, Theo's journey became a central arc of the series, evolving from an underachiever into a young man with purpose. Warner skillfully balanced comedy with vulnerability, especially as the character navigated his parents' high expectations and a later diagnosis of dyslexia. Ultimately, Theo's story was not just a punch line but a nuanced exploration of finding one's own path, challenging assumptions about success.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), just hours after the agency released a weaker-than-expected July jobs report. The report showed that only 73,000 jobs were added, and it included a large downward revision for the previous two months. Trump accused the agency of rigging the figures, a move that drew immediate criticism for politicizing a key federal statistical agency. The firing, described as unprecedented by many economists, has stoked fears about the integrity of U.S. economic data and its potential impact on market trust. (not investment advice)</p>
