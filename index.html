        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the cost of popular all-inclusive package holidays rises, consumers are employing creative strategies to save money on their summer vacations. The BBC spoke with several travelers who shared their money-saving techniques, including booking last-minute deals, traveling off-peak, and finding accommodations with "kids go free" offers. Other methods highlighted include using home-swapping websites to avoid expensive rental fees, accumulating credit card loyalty points for flights, and opting for house-sitting arrangements to eliminate accommodation costs entirely. These hacks have reportedly saved individuals and families hundreds or even thousands of pounds on their trips.</p>

          <p>WWE star Raquel Rodriguez is preparing to defend her tag-team championship in a fatal four-way match at the upcoming Evolution premium live event. Speaking with Fox News Digital, Rodriguez reflected on the significance of the all-women's event, which she watched as a trainee in 2018, and expressed excitement about representing women in wrestling on a global stage. She also discussed her personal connection to the sport, citing her father, a former independent wrestler, as a primary inspiration alongside trailblazers like Chyna and Beth Phoenix. Despite teaming with a new partner, Roxanne Perez, Rodriguez is confident in their ability to retain the championship titles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Talks are scheduled for next week between UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting and the British Medical Association (BMA) in an effort to prevent a planned five-day strike by resident doctors in England. The BMA announced the walkout over a pay dispute, arguing that the government's 5.4% pay increase offer is insufficient to restore real-terms pay to 2008 levels. While the government insists it cannot improve the offer, the BMA has expressed hope that constructive discussions could lead to a solution and a suspension of the strike. Public support for the doctors' industrial action has reportedly declined significantly since their last strike in June of the previous year.</p>

          <p>A child has reportedly died from measles at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool, which is experiencing a significant increase in young patients seriously ill with the highly contagious virus. The hospital confirmed a rise in cases, attributing it to a decline in MMR vaccine uptake, and emphasized that measles can lead to severe illness and, in rare instances, death. This is believed to be only the second measles-related child fatality in the UK in the last decade, highlighting the serious public health concerns over falling vaccination rates. The hospital has not released details about the child's vaccination status or other health conditions.</p>

          <p>The final boxing match between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano at Madison Square Garden highlighted the complex nature of women's professional boxing. This article reflects on the fight not as a spectacle of violence but as a demonstration of strategic, controlled athleticism, arguing that true equality in the sport includes the right for women to fight tactically and win without needing to provide a dramatic brawl. It contrasts the fighters' earned respect with the persistent contradictions in the sport, such as sexualized ring girls and financial disparities. The author suggests that by choosing to risk their health for glory, these athletes reclaim their bodies in a defiant act that transcends traditional female roles.</p>

The rock is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before landing in the Sahara desert, where it was found in November 2023. Scientific analysis confirmed its Martian origin by comparing its chemical composition to data from the 1976 Viking space probe. This meteorite represents nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet, making it an exceptionally rare and significant find for collectors and scientific institutions.</p>

However, retrospective analysis highlights significant flaws, particularly the lack of African performers and female artists in the lineup, which has led to accusations of a "white savior complex."

Campaigners, including a mother whose daughter had a severe reaction, argue this puts allergy sufferers at risk and that cosmetic labeling should adopt the clearer standards used for food products.

          <p>A 57-year-old cannabis farmworker, Jaime Alanís Garcia, has died after being taken off life support following a fall from a greenhouse roof during a large-scale immigration raid in Ventura County. His family stated he was fleeing federal agents, though the Department of Homeland Security claims he was not being pursued and that agents called for medical assistance. The raid, which resulted in over 300 detentions, has intensified tensions over the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics. The incident has also sparked an investigation into potential child labor violations at the facility, as several minors were among those detained.</p>

          <p>As Russia's war on Ukraine continues, this analysis poses the urgent question of what would happen if Ukraine were to fall, arguing that such an outcome would represent a monumental strategic failure for the West. The article contends that Ukraine is currently not winning, facing shortages of manpower and ammunition while Russia makes slow but steady gains. With Western support wavering and diplomatic solutions stalled, a Ukrainian collapse could have daunting ramifications for European security and the international legal order. The author suggests that a defeated Ukraine would embolden Russia, presaging an era of wider, permanent conflict across the continent.</p>

          <p>China's central government has become involved in the investigation into a kindergarten in Gansu province suspected of causing lead poisoning in children. The provincial government announced that a high-level task force, led by the party chief and governor, will now work alongside officials from the State Council in Beijing. The case came to light after parents had their children tested in another province, revealing elevated lead levels that local tests had missed. Authorities suspect the kindergarten used inedible, lead-based paint to color food, and eight people, including the principal, have been detained in connection with the incident.</p>

          <p>Malaysia is experiencing a significant political shift marked by the growing influence of Islamic-oriented parties, posing a challenge to the current coalition government. The opposition Perikatan Nasional, which includes the conservative Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), has gained substantial ground, particularly among younger and more conservative Malay voters. This "green wave" reflects a push for policies aligned with a conservative Islamic ideology, such as stricter dress codes and gender segregation. While some view this as a genuine societal shift, others see it as political posturing by parties using religion to consolidate power amid public dissatisfaction with the ruling government.</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests China's Upstream Dams May Increase Dry-Season Water Flow to India</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study analyzing the impact of China's dams on the Brahmaputra River suggests they may not cause the droughts in India that many have feared. By examining data from two existing upstream dams, Zangmu and Jiacha, researchers found that water flow downstream actually increased significantly during the dry season. The measurements, taken since 2014, show that low flows in February were up by more than 50%, contrary to concerns that the dams would withhold critical water. This data provides the first concrete evidence in the ongoing debate over the potential environmental and political consequences of China's massive dam-building projects in Tibet.</p>

          <p>After weeks of being denied access, Florida lawmakers toured the new "Alligator Alcatraz" migrant detention facility in the Everglades, where detainees have alleged inhumane conditions. Democratic lawmakers, who had sued for entry, reported seeing appalling conditions, including extreme heat in the medical area and small food portions. They also relayed detainee claims of having to drink water from toilets and going days without showers. Republican lawmakers, however, expressed satisfaction with the facility. The state has denied all accusations of poor conditions at the center, which was constructed in just eight days in the middle of the Everglades.</p>
