          <h2>PepsiCo Lowers Earnings Expectations Amid Tariff and Spending Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>PepsiCo has revised its earnings forecast downward, citing anticipated volatility in global trade, including new tariffs, and cautious consumer spending patterns. CEO Ramon Laguarta highlighted expectations for increased supply chain costs due to global trade developments and subdued consumer conditions in several markets. The company's first-quarter results showed mixed performance, with international sales partially offsetting weaker North American demand. PepsiCo is implementing strategies to improve North American business, focusing on multicultural and functional products, and expanding into prebiotic soda brands. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A large wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, has burned over 13,000 acres and is 50% contained, prompting air quality alerts for the New York City region.

Shifting winds are carrying smoke northward, affecting air quality in New York City and Long Island, potentially posing risks to sensitive groups. Firefighters are actively working to contain the blaze, and winds are expected to shift again, potentially bringing smoke back to the region on Friday.</p>

The Magic Circle has now apologized and is presenting Lloyd with a membership certificate, recognizing her as a role model for women in magic and honoring Winstanley's legacy.

          <p>Merck has lowered its full-year profit outlook, citing an anticipated $200 million hit from tariffs and a charge related to a licensing agreement with Hengrui Pharma. The expected tariff costs primarily stem from levies between the U.S. and China, with lesser impacts from Canada and Mexico. The revised outlook does not account for potential tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. Merck's first-quarter revenue and profit exceeded expectations, driven by strong performance in its oncology portfolio and animal health products.

          <p>Democrats are divided over how to respond to President Trump's deportation of undocumented immigrants to a mega prison in El Salvador, particularly the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Some Democrats, like Sen. Chris Van Hollen, advocate for high-profile advocacy and due process, while others fear it will elevate immigration as an issue and reinforce the narrative that Democrats prioritize foreigners over American citizens. The article argues that Democrats should continue to stand up for due process but focus messaging on Trump's economic mismanagement, as voters are more concerned with economic issues than immigration.</p>

          <h2>Economic Nostalgia Leads to Poor Policy Decisions, Says Contributor</h2>

          <p>The contributor argues that economic nostalgia, exemplified by the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 and Trump's tariffs, leads to terrible policies. Both protectionist episodes stemmed from a longing for a romanticized past and a fear of change, resulting in costly mistakes that undermined the economies they were meant to protect. The author warns against trying to freeze economies in place with trade barriers and urges policymakers to embrace change and creative destruction instead of resisting it.</p>
