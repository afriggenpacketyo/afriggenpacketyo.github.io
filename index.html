          <p>Oil prices surged over 5% after the Trump administration imposed new sanctions on Russia's two largest crude companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, on Thursday. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the measures, stating they aim to pressure Moscow regarding its commitment to a peace process in Ukraine and to hinder its ability to fund the ongoing conflict. A senior White House official indicated these sanctions were also related to the cancellation of a planned meeting between President Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Budapest. The administration is actively encouraging its allies to join these sanctions and is additionally pressing India, a major buyer, to reduce its purchases of Russian crude exports. This action comes as U.S. crude oil prices have already fallen 16% this year, with OPEC+ increasing production.</p>

          <p>Intel reported better-than-expected third-quarter revenue, signaling a recovery in demand for its core x86 processors for PCs, which led to a 6% jump in its stock in extended trading. This marks the first earnings report since the U.S. government became its top shareholder through an $8.9 billion investment negotiated in August. The chipmaker also announced a $5 billion investment from its former rival Nvidia in September, establishing a partnership to integrate Intel's central processors with Nvidia's dominant artificial intelligence graphics processors. The article notes that Intel's foundry division, requiring $100 billion in capital, has yet to secure a major external customer. (not investment advice)</p>

This strategic shift impacts the team tasked with assessing product and feature risks and ensuring adherence to global regulatory requirements, a unit originally established after Meta faced a $5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission following the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal. While the company is implementing more basic automation, rather than bleeding-edge generative AI, it aims to streamline risk management and accelerate innovation while upholding high compliance standards. This development is part of broader organizational restructurings at Meta, which recently included layoffs within its Superintelligence Labs AI unit.</p>

          <h2>Ford Exceeds Q3 Earnings, Adjusts 2025 Guidance Due to Supplier Fire and Tariff Changes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-23 16:29:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford Motor Company surpassed Wall Street's third-quarter earnings expectations but significantly lowered its 2025 guidance, primarily due to the impact of a supplier fire. This incident at an aluminum plant is disrupting the production of its highly profitable large trucks and SUVs, with an estimated cost of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Ford plans to mitigate much of this by increasing manufacturing and adding 1,000 workers to its Michigan and Kentucky plants early next year. Additionally, the automaker anticipates a $1 billion reduction in expected tariff costs following recent changes by the Trump administration. Ford's CEO Jim Farley emphasized that the company's "Ford+ plan" for turnaround and cost-improvement is delivering consistent results, despite these challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two federal prosecutors, Molly Gaston and J.P. Cooney, who were notably fired by President Donald Trump after serving on special counsel Jack Smith's legal team, have established a new law firm in Washington, D.C. The boutique firm aims to combat government corruption and protect civil rights, offering public integrity counseling to state and local governments, as well as representation in criminal and congressional investigations. The prosecutors, who had investigated potential election interference and classified documents, were terminated after Trump took office, with letters stating they couldn't be trusted to "faithfully implement" his agenda. They expressed regret that their cases against Trump couldn't be resolved in court, and their new firm seeks to fill a perceived void in federal enforcement.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Starbucks workers are preparing to vote on authorizing an open-ended unfair labor practice strike, as contract negotiations between Starbucks Workers United and the company remain stalled. The union, representing 12,000 workers in about 550 cafes, began negotiations in May 2024, but talks broke down over economic proposals despite securing 33 tentative agreements on non-economic issues. Workers are demanding increased hours, higher take-home pay, and resolution of numerous unfair labor practice charges against Starbucks for alleged union busting. Starbucks maintains it has engaged in extensive negotiations and that the union walked away, while CEO Brian Niccol's "Back to Starbucks" plan has led to store closures and job cuts.</p>

          <p>Target announced it is cutting 1,800 corporate jobs, comprising approximately 1,000 employee layoffs and 800 positions that will no longer be filled, marking the retailer's first major reduction in a decade. This decision, communicated by incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke, is part of an "Enterprise Acceleration Office" effort to simplify company operations, leverage technology, and accelerate Target's growth. The restructuring comes as Target faces a significant sales slump, with its shares having fallen by about 65% since their all-time high in late 2021, and the company expects annual sales to decline this year. Fiddelke emphasized that while difficult, these cuts are a "necessary step" to reduce complexity, speed up decision-making, and position Target for future growth.</p>

          <p>The price of gold recently experienced a significant 6% drop, its largest single-day decline in over a decade, prompting questions about its investment value. Despite this decline, gold remains above $4,000 per ounce, and experts suggest that this dip presents an affordable entry point for investors considering purchases. The article discusses purchasing gold from major retailers like Costco, noting it offers a flexible and potentially trustworthy path for immediate investment compared to online companies or pawnshops. While gold price dips are generally temporary, historical trends suggest a rebound. Locking in a purchase now could position investors for profit if gold continues its upward trajectory.

          <p>Fears of renewed conflict are escalating in Lebanon as violent encounters between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia intensify, just 11 months after a fragile ceasefire deal. Recent Israeli attacks targeted an alleged Hezbollah training camp and killed a commander, contributing to a toll of 274 fatalities in Israeli attacks since the ceasefire took effect. Both Israel and Hezbollah accuse each other of violating key aspects of the agreement, which stipulated Israeli troop withdrawal and Hezbollah disarmament beyond the Litani River. The ongoing stalemate, coupled with Lebanon's severe political and economic crises, leads experts to fear Israel may be signaling a return to full-scale conflict, potentially setting a dangerous precedent for broader regional instability.</p>

This scandal, which also ties into the previous case of former player Jontay Porter, poses a significant challenge to the industry's ongoing efforts to expand into major states like California and Texas. Sportsbooks are strategically responding to prevent potential regulatory crackdowns, particularly on player prop bets, which are highly profitable but often at the center of such integrity concerns.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced his endorsement of Andrew Cuomo in the city's mayoral race, marking a surprising reversal after months of public tension and Adams's previous harsh criticisms of Cuomo. Adams, who recently ended his own re-election campaign due to poor polling numbers, stated his intention to campaign alongside Cuomo in neighborhoods where he maintains strong support, particularly to engage Black and Brown communities affected by gentrification. This endorsement comes despite Adams previously calling Cuomo a "snake and a liar" and accusing him of having "a career of pushing Black candidates out of races." The mayoral race has been significantly shaped by the contest between Cuomo and democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, both of whom had previously indicated they would refuse Adams' endorsement.</p>

The project's cost has increased from an initial estimate of $200 million, and Trump asserts it will be privately financed by his own funds and corporate donors, including major tech giants like Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft. The White House has dismissed public criticism as "manufactured outrage," and the Treasury Department reportedly banned its staff from sharing photos of the demolition.

          <p>Mortgage rates have dropped for two consecutive weeks, with the 30-year average now at 6.19%, nearing the three-year low seen in September. This decline presents a potential opportunity for homebuyers previously sidelined by high rates, but experts advise a judicious approach given elevated home prices in many regions. While further gradual rate cuts by the Federal Reserve are anticipated in the coming months, significant rapid drops are unlikely, and delaying action might mean missing current opportunities. Homebuyers are encouraged to consider acting now to lock in current rates, as future reversals are possible, and less competition may exist compared to the traditionally fierce spring homebuying season, allowing for potential refinancing later if rates drop further.

This fluctuation, driven by factors like Federal Reserve rate cuts and shifting investor appetite for riskier assets, presents opportunities for strategic investors. Three key strategies include trading gold mining stocks or ETFs for leveraged exposure and liquidity, using gold-backed ETFs or futures contracts for precise short-term plays, and buying physical gold on dips for long-term hedging against instability. Flexibility and a strategic approach, such as dollar-cost averaging, are crucial for navigating this dynamic market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Quantum computing stocks, including IonQ, Rigetti Computing, and D-Wave Quantum, remained comfortably higher on Thursday despite the Trump administration denying it was "currently" negotiating equity stakes in these companies. Investors maintained optimism, interpreting the term "currently" as implying potential for future talks or different deal structures, such as warrants. Rigetti Computing emphasized the significant national security risks if the U.S. fails to lead in supporting these technological breakthroughs. While a federal stake in quantum firms would represent a different approach compared to the recent Intel bailout, it carries inherent risks as the technology is not yet commercially viable at scale. Moreover, major tech companies like Google, IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon already possess advanced quantum programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>States across the U.S. are warning millions of struggling Americans that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits may not be paid in November if the federal government shutdown persists. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which oversees the federal food stamps program, informed state agencies that there would be "insufficient funds" to pay full November SNAP benefits if the lapse in appropriations continues. Advocates and SNAP recipients warn of devastating consequences, potentially forcing families to make impossible choices between paying rent and feeding their children. While the USDA has multiyear contingency funds, it remains unclear if the agency plans to utilize them to ensure November SNAP benefits. The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) is also at risk, with temporary emergency funds rapidly depleting.</p>

          <p>The delayed September Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, set for release on Friday, is expected to reveal a renewed acceleration in U.S. inflation, with economists forecasting a 3.1% annual rise—the fastest pace in 16 months. This belated data release, necessitated by the government shutdown, is crucial for determining the Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), projected to be around 2.7%. Economists attribute the creeping inflation partly to the Trump administration's tariffs, with companies passing on costs to consumers. Despite this uptick, the Federal Reserve and most economists anticipate inflation will ease next year, though upside risks remain if pricing pressures spread to services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Emma Stone delivers a captivating and multifaceted performance in Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film, the paranoid comedy "Bugonia," further solidifying her unique acting prowess. In a stripped-down role, Stone portrays Michelle Fuller, a pharmaceutical CEO held captive by two working-class conspiracy theorist cousins, Teddy and Don, who are convinced she is an alien. The film, an adaptation of a 2003 Korean satire, delves into themes of online brain rot, the human need for purpose, and the growing divide between societal classes. Lanthimos masterfully uses Michelle's corporate-speak to subtly dehumanize her, while the captors' pathetic desperation highlights the stark realities of their marginalized lives. Stone's ability to make Michelle's torment darkly humorous underscores the film's edgy and absurd tone.</p>

          <p>Chinese state oil majors, including PetroChina, Sinopec, CNOOC, and Zhenhua Oil, have reportedly suspended purchases of seaborne Russian oil, at least in the short-term, due to concerns over recent U.S. sanctions on Russia's largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. This significant development follows similar intentions from refiners in India, Russia's largest seaborne oil customer, to sharply cut their imports to comply with the sanctions. Such a sharp drop in demand from Moscow's two biggest customers will severely strain Russia’s oil revenues and compel the world’s top importers to seek alternative supplies, which is expected to push up global oil prices. While independent Chinese refiners may eventually resume purchases, the suspension by state-owned firms marks a major shift in the global oil market dynamics.</p>

Behaviors such as saying "NO!" to everything, claiming everything as "mine," or constantly exploring through licking and smashing are explained as crucial for building a child's sense of self and understanding their impact on the world. The article provides practical parent tips for responding strategically to these actions, including modeling calm responses, offering positive choices during transitions, and teaching problem-solving instead of simply stating prohibitions. These expert-backed approaches aim to empower children with manageable pieces of personal power, fostering their development into well-adjusted young adults.</p>

Government sources indicate a strong determination to keep Phillips in her post, while acknowledging the critical need to re-engage with victims and survivors to rebuild trust and appoint the right chair.
