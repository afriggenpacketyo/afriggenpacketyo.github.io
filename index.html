        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chicha is a multifaceted term in Peru, referring to a fermented drink, popular culture, and a unique musical genre. Originating in the late 1960s, Chicha music is a vibrant fusion of Colombian cumbia, Andean huayno, Cuban guaracha, and psychedelic rock, characterized by its prominent use of the electric guitar. The genre reached its peak in the 1980s with icons like Chacalón, whose songs resonated deeply with marginalized migrant communities in Lima. Decades later, the sounds of Chicha continue to be an integral part of the capital's cultural identity, representing a complex blend of indigenous roots and external influences.</p>

          <p>A top Immigration and Customs Enforcement official testified in federal court regarding the Trump administration's plans to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported earlier this year. The official revealed that the U.S. has been in discussions with several foreign nations, including Eswatini and Ghana, to accept Abrego Garcia, though no final agreement has been reached. This testimony is part of a legal battle over his continued detention, as his lawyers argue it has become unlawfully indefinite. Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. to face criminal charges after a judge found his initial deportation violated a prior ruling protecting him from removal.</p>

          <p>The price of silver has experienced a substantial surge in 2025, rising 76% from $28.92 to $50.94 per troy ounce by early October. This increase highlights its potential as a more affordable alternative to gold for investors seeking to hedge against inflation and diversify their portfolios. The article suggests that factors such as geopolitical instability and domestic economic concerns could contribute to further price increases. As with any precious metal, experts advise limiting such holdings to a small portion of an overall investment portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has initiated layoffs of federal workers, termed "Reductions in Force," as the government shutdown extends into its tenth day. The Office of Management and Budget confirmed the firings have begun and are substantial, with agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services issuing notices. This move is seen as an escalation to pressure Democrats, who have blocked funding resolutions over disagreements on extending Affordable Care Act subsidies. Federal employee unions have responded by filing lawsuits, condemning the action as an improper tactic in a political standoff.</p>

          <p>The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics will temporarily bring back staff to complete and release the September consumer price index (CPI) report, despite the ongoing government shutdown. The release of this key inflation data had been paused but is now proceeding because the Social Security Administration requires the data to calculate its annual cost-of-living adjustments. While the CPI report will be published, other significant economic data, such as the nonfarm payroll report, remain delayed due to the lapse in federal funding.

          <p>A proposed class-action lawsuit filed against Amazon alleges that the company misled customers during its Prime Day sales event by advertising deals based on inflated and "fictional" list prices. The plaintiffs claim this practice made discounts appear much larger than they actually were, luring consumers into making purchases under false pretenses. The complaint provides several examples, such as a product sold for its typical price but advertised as being heavily discounted from a much higher, non-existent original price. Amazon has declined to comment on the pending litigation, which accuses the e-commerce giant of using fake sales to drive revenue.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted New York Attorney General Letitia James on charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. The indictment, presented by a U.S. attorney recently installed by the Trump administration, alleges James secured a more favorable mortgage rate by misrepresenting how a property would be used. James has vehemently denied the charges, calling them a baseless act of political retribution and a weaponization of the justice system for her previous civil fraud case against the Trump Organization. Democratic officials have defended James, framing the indictment as a fascist tactic by the president to punish political rivals.</p>

          <p>Paul Ingrassia, President Trump's nominee to lead the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, has been accused of sexual harassment, according to a Politico report. The allegation stems from an incident where Ingrassia allegedly canceled a junior female colleague's hotel room on a business trip so she would be forced to share a room with him. Ingrassia has denied the allegations through his lawyer, stating he never harassed any coworkers and that an internal investigation cleared him. The woman involved also issued a statement saying she never felt uncomfortable, though the report claims she initially filed a complaint before retracting it for fear of retaliation.</p>

The document, brokered by the US, is titled as a plan for a "comprehensive end" to the war, which suggests finality, yet it lacks specific details on crucial next steps like Hamas's disarmament. This leaves room for different interpretations and does not explicitly rule out a return to hostilities if negotiations on future phases stall.

Key among these are the expense ratio, which is the annual management fee, any commissions or transaction fees charged by the broker, and the bid-ask spread, which is the small cost incurred when buying or selling. Understanding these ongoing and transactional costs is crucial for maximizing long-term returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Affordable Care Act (ACA) remains a central point of contention in American politics, serving as the primary reason for the current federal government shutdown. Democrats are refusing to approve funding without the preservation of insurance subsidies used by millions, while some Republicans are unwilling to finance what they see as a failed law. The article argues that despite its unpopularity and the country's broader healthcare affordability crisis, the ACA successfully expanded coverage to millions and helped slow the growth of national health spending. However, this success is often invisible to the public amid ongoing political battles.</p>

          <p>The White House has sharply criticized the Nobel Committee, accusing it of prioritizing "politics over peace" for awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to Venezuelan pro-democracy activist María Coria Machado instead of President Donald Trump. A White House spokesperson asserted that Trump deserved the award for his role in ending global conflicts and brokering peace deals, including the recent Gaza ceasefire. President Trump has frequently expressed his desire for the prize, and his administration's statement reflects deep disappointment with the committee's decision, framing it as a politically motivated slight.</p>

          <p>The Knight First Amendment Institute, a free speech group affiliated with Columbia University, has won a landmark legal case against the Trump administration. A federal judge ruled that the detention and attempted deportation of pro-Palestinian students, including a Columbia student, was unconstitutional and designed to chill free speech. This victory highlights a stark contrast between the institute's confrontational legal strategy and Columbia University's own more conciliatory approach to the administration's pressures. The institute has been a vocal critic of the university's handling of campus protests, positioning itself as a key defender of constitutional principles.</p>

This renewed investor anxiety over escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China, which had been in a fragile détente.

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed Senate Bill 79, a historic piece of legislation aimed at addressing California's housing crisis by increasing density near public transit. The new law will override local zoning regulations in eight major counties, allowing for the construction of taller, denser residential buildings near subway, light rail, and dedicated bus stops. Proponents, including YIMBY groups, hail the bill as a transformative step toward creating more affordable housing and reducing car dependency. However, the bill faced opposition from some cities, including Los Angeles, which argued for local control over development.</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has released its annual inflation adjustments for the 2026 tax year, raising the income thresholds for all federal tax brackets. This change means that taxpayers will be able to earn more money before being pushed into a higher tax bracket, a measure designed to prevent what is known as "bracket creep." In addition to the new brackets, the IRS also increased the standard deduction for all filing statuses. For example, the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly will rise to $32,200 for the 2026 tax year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) currently falling, borrowing a significant sum like $200,000 has become more affordable. Based on the current average rate of 7.84%, a 15-year HELOC would cost approximately $1,893 per month, while a 10-year term would be around $2,410. These costs are notably lower than they were in previous months and last year, reflecting the cooling market conditions. Because HELOCs have variable rates, payments can change, so homeowners should calculate potential costs at higher rates to ensure long-term affordability. (not investment advice)</p>
