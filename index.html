          <p>Following the fatal stabbing of a worshipper at a mosque in southern France, police have stepped up their manhunt for the suspect. Prime Minister Francois Bayrou has condemned the act as an "Islamophobic atrocity", after the suspect allegedly stabbed the victim multiple times and filmed the attack. Authorities are considering whether to treat the case as a terror incident, as the suspect, identified as a French citizen of Bosnian origin, reportedly shouted insults against Allah during the attack. The French government has vowed to bring the perpetrator to justice and stands in solidarity with the victim's family and the Muslim community. </p>

          <p>In the wake of a recent terrorist attack in Kashmir, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has engaged with numerous world leaders. Rather than seeking de-escalation, India seems to be laying the groundwork for potential military action against Pakistan, which it accuses of being linked to the attack. Security forces from both sides have exchanged intermittent fire across the border, escalating tensions. Indian forces have initiated a sweeping clampdown in Kashmir, arresting hundreds in their search for the perpetrators of the terrorist attack.</p>

          <p>China is implementing more generous tax refunds for international visitors in an effort to boost tourism revenue. The new policy reduces the minimum purchase amount for tax refunds from 500 yuan to 200 yuan and raises the cash refund limit from 10,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan. These measures, effective immediately, follow previous efforts to relax visa restrictions and encourage domestic spending.

          <p>Elon Musk is reducing his involvement in overseeing the unofficial "department of government efficiency" (Doge) to focus on Tesla. Doge was created to modernize federal technology and cut spending, but its mandate expanded to include staff cuts and policy changes. Despite Musk's reduced schedule, Doge is reportedly building a database to expedite deportations of undocumented immigrants. The initiative has resulted in the firing of federal workers and the cancellation of humanitarian programs, raising concerns about the use of sensitive data and the impact on government services.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's golf resort in South Florida is scheduled to host Andreas Kalcker, a prominent promoter of chlorine dioxide, a form of industrial bleach, as a supposed cure for diseases like cancer and Covid-19.

The event highlights concerns about the proliferation of dangerous alternative health approaches.

          <p>Etiquette experts recommend avoiding certain foods on airplanes to ensure a more pleasant experience for both oneself and fellow passengers. Salty foods can cause thirst and bloating, while fish or egg-based meals can produce strong, unpleasant odors. Fried foods tend to become soggy and release a greasy aroma, and beans or cruciferous vegetables can lead to gas and bloating. Creamy or dairy-heavy foods may upset the stomach at high altitudes, and dishes with garlic can leave a lingering flavor on the breath. </p>

          <p>The IRS does not consider freeloading relatives as a hardship that would modify home sales exclusion rules. The amount of capital gains tax owed when selling a house is calculated by subtracting the tax basis from the sale price, minus selling costs. A financial advisor explains that banks may have different requirements for a power of attorney document, so it is important to check with financial institutions to avoid problems later.</p>

          <p>China has expanded its anti-corruption efforts to include village chiefs and other grass-roots officials. The revised regulations aim to improve supervision of rural government workers. The changes significantly increase the number of officials subject to disciplinary oversight, including township cadres and those involved in poverty alleviation campaigns. This marks the first revision of these rules since 2011, indicating a continued focus on combating corruption at the local level.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates are on the rise due to a sell-off in U.S. Treasury bonds, and the situation could worsen if China accelerates its mortgage sell-off. Experts suggest that China could unload Treasuries as a retaliatory measure, which would negatively impact U.S. homeowners. The possibility of other countries following suit and selling off mortgage-backed securities adds to the risk. While some doubt this will happen, an escalating trade war raises uncertainty and the potential for China to absorb losses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the United States are in talks to forge a “minerals-for-security” deal. The agreement will give the US access to its vast mineral resources. The deal would provide the DRC with security guarantees and military support from the US. This could potentially threaten China’s mining dominance in the region.</p>
