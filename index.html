          <h2>Trump Suggests Potential Tariff Reduction on Chinese Goods Amid Trade Talks</h2>

          <p>President Trump hinted at the possibility of reducing tariffs on goods from China as high-level trade talks were scheduled to take place in Switzerland. He referenced import taxes as high as 145% imposed on China, indicating they could be lowered. The meeting aimed to de-escalate the trade war, with both sides expressing confidence in managing trade issues, but analysts cautioned that lengthy negotiations were expected. China's exports to the U.S. had already fallen by over 20% in April, although its total exports rose by 8.1%.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced a notable surge in April, driven primarily by increased shipments to Southeast Asian nations, which compensated for a significant decline in exports to the U.S. due to recently imposed tariffs. Overall exports jumped by 8.1%, surpassing expectations, while imports saw a slight decrease of 0.2%. Despite this growth, exports to the U.S. plummeted by over 21%, highlighting the impact of the trade war. Analysts suggest that the surge may be due to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States, particularly under President Trump, has shown a revived interest in acquiring Greenland, driven by strategic considerations related to its geographic location and the changing Arctic landscape. Greenland's proximity to both Russia and the U.S. makes it crucial for defense, especially in the context of increasing geopolitical tensions and the opening of Arctic sea routes due to climate change. Russia's growing presence and economic activities in the Arctic further underscore the importance of Greenland to American policymakers, prompting discussions about potential military and economic involvement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's indefinite halt to the Empire Wind offshore wind project off Long Island, N.Y., has sent shockwaves through the European wind energy industry, causing companies to reassess their approach to renewable energy. The decision has raised concerns about the viability of other U.S. projects and prompted industry executives to focus on Europe as a more stable market. Despite the setback, European wind developers remain optimistic about the long-term growth potential of offshore wind in Europe, expecting it to significantly contribute to the continent's electricity generation by 2050.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles police have arrested a suspect in connection with a killing at a Valley Village apartment building. The suspect, Erick Escamilla, allegedly broke into an apartment and killed Menashe Hidra after stalking the halls. The arrest follows criticism of the LAPD's initial response to the incident, as officers had previously visited the apartment complex but did not discover the victim's body until three days later. Internal investigations have been launched into the officers' handling of the case.</p>

          <p>Texas Roadhouse reported disappointing first-quarter results due to inclement weather, but positive sales trends in April are giving investors hope. While earnings per share missed expectations, revenue exceeded estimates. The company's comparable sales growth slowed to 3.5% in the first quarter, but improved to 5% in the first five weeks of the second quarter. Management reaffirmed most of its outlook for 2025, except for raising its commodity cost inflation outlook.</p>

          <p>The enforced skort rule in camogie has ignited a debate over sexism, with former players and teams mounting pressure on the Camogie Association to allow players the choice between skorts and shorts. This comes after the Kilkenny and Dublin teams were forced to change into skorts before a match. A recent Gaelic Players Association survey revealed that 70% of players experienced discomfort while wearing skorts, and 83% wanted the option to wear shorts. The Camogie Association has called a Special Congress to vote on the issue.</p>
