          <p>Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara has announced his bid for a controversial fourth term, a move facilitated by constitutional changes he implemented in 2016 that reset presidential term limits. His ruling party, the RHDP, nominated him, citing the nation's ongoing security and economic challenges as reasons for his continued leadership, despite his earlier pledges to step down. This decision has sparked strong condemnation from the opposition, who argue it violates the constitution and undermines democracy, especially given that several key opposition candidates have been disqualified. Concerns are high regarding potential political polarization and unrest ahead of the October election, recalling the country's history of electoral violence and the 2010-2011 crisis that resulted in thousands of fatalities.</p>

Advertising revenue, specifically, exceeded projections at $46.56 billion, attributed by CEO Mark Zuckerberg to greater efficiency from Meta's artificial intelligence technology. The company also raised its third-quarter sales forecast and increased capital expenditure estimates for AI development, signaling continued investment in the sector. Despite a $4.53 billion operating loss in its Reality Labs unit, Meta's overall net income rose significantly, indicating strong financial performance and a positive outlook for future growth, particularly in AI capabilities.

          <p>WWE Hall of Famer Sgt. Slaughter publicly supported actress Sydney Sweeney following backlash over her American Eagle advertisement, which critics claimed promoted thinness and was akin to "Nazi propaganda." The ad campaign, titled "Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans," involved Sweeney altering the word "Genes" to "Jeans" on a billboard, sparking widespread online furor. Despite attempts at a "cancel culture" takedown, supporters, including C.J. Pearson, argued the criticism was rooted in Sweeney's appearance rather than the ad's content. The controversy temporarily saw American Eagle's share price rise, highlighting the unusual impact of such public debates on corporate image and market value.</p>

          <p>A new NHS England report has revealed significant failings in the care of five-year-old Yusuf Nazir, who tragically died eight days after being sent home from a hospital emergency department. The investigation found that the concerns of Yusuf's family, especially his mother's crucial "instinct" about his deteriorating condition, were repeatedly dismissed by healthcare providers across various services. Despite 13 identified opportunities to escalate his care, Yusuf, who suffered from asthma, ultimately succumbed to pneumonia and sepsis. His family is now demanding full accountability and a comprehensive inquest, stressing that the NHS must implement the report's recommendations to prevent similar tragic outcomes and ensure children receive proper care in the future.</p>

          <p>Arkansas State Police have arrested Andrew James McGann, a 28-year-old schoolteacher, in connection with the double homicide of Clinton and Cristen Brink, a married couple hiking with their children at Devil's Den State Park. McGann was apprehended in Springdale after a five-day search, with public tips and video footage proving instrumental in his capture. The couple's young daughters, aged 7 and 9, were unharmed and are now with family. While authorities have not disclosed a motive or how the couple was killed, past allegations of inappropriate behavior against McGann from a previous teaching position in Texas have surfaced, leading to his resignation there.</p>

          <p>Recent legislation, including President Donald Trump's "big beautiful bill," has significantly bolstered the benefits and accessibility of Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) accounts. These tax-advantaged savings accounts enable eligible individuals with disabilities to save and invest without jeopardizing their eligibility for crucial government benefits like Medicaid and Social Security. A key change, the ABLE Age Adjustment Act, will expand eligibility from age 26 to 46 starting in 2026, projected to qualify millions more people. Additionally, the new laws make permanent tax advantages, such as allowing rollovers from 529 college savings plans into ABLE accounts, and increasing the annual contribution eligible for the saver's credit, significantly enhancing financial planning for individuals with disabilities.

          <p>The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, showed an increase in June, with prices rising 2.6% compared to a year ago, up from 2.4% in May. This uptick is partly attributed to President Donald Trump's broad-based tariffs, which have started to elevate prices for many imported goods, including furniture, appliances, and computers. The core PCE, excluding volatile food and energy, also rose 2.8% year-over-year, remaining above the Fed's 2% target. This inflation trend contributes to the central bank's cautious stance on interest rate cuts, as they assess whether tariff impacts will lead to a persistent rise in overall inflation.

          <p>France is under pressure to intervene and prevent the destruction of $9.7 million worth of USAID-funded contraceptives, believed to be stored in Belgium and potentially slated for incineration in France. The Trump administration's decision to destroy these products, acquired under "terminated Biden-era USAID contracts," has drawn outrage from French feminists and rights groups, who condemn it as wasteful and an attack on women's rights. The Belgian government is in urgent contact with the U.S. to find an alternative solution, while international organizations like MSI Reproductive Choices and IPPF have offered to purchase and redistribute the contraceptives at no cost, but their offers have been rejected. The situation highlights a significant international dispute over public health policy and women's reproductive access.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is hearing critical arguments today that could determine the legality and future of President Donald Trump's global tariff regime, just hours before new duties are set to take effect. The case, V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, centers on whether the president exceeded his authority by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping tariffs on numerous trading partners. A lower court had previously struck down these tariffs, but the Federal Circuit temporarily reinstated them pending this appeal. President Trump has publicly underscored the immense importance of this "big case," asserting that the nation's ability to protect itself through tariffs is crucial for its survival and success.</p>

This remarkable birth is believed to be the longest an embryo has been cryopreserved before resulting in a successful live birth. The Pierces adopted the embryo through a Christian adoption agency's "Snowflakes" program, which connects donors with recipient families, after trying to conceive for seven years. The original donor, Linda Archerd, created the embryo in 1994 and sought a specific match for its adoption.

To secure the best terms, borrowers are advised to strengthen their credit, compare offers from multiple lenders, and carefully evaluate loan terms, fees, and monthly payments, ensuring the chosen product aligns with their financial goals.

          <p>High-yield savings accounts are presented as a smart choice for building an emergency fund, offering significantly higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts. While the national average is 0.38%, top high-yield accounts can offer APYs between 4.11% and 4.30%, allowing savings to grow substantially. These accounts are typically offered by online banks, which pass on lower overhead costs through better rates and fewer fees. Experts recommend comparing different online accounts to find the best rates and terms, emphasizing that even small regular contributions can lead to significant growth over time, providing a crucial financial safety net.

          <p>President Donald Trump's "baseline tariff" of 10% on all imported goods, along with higher "reciprocal tariffs" on dozens of trading partners, has come into effect as the August 1st deadline expired. Trump has insisted on this deadline, stating it will not be extended, aiming to reshape global trade. While several major partners like the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and the UK have struck deals to mitigate higher levies, others, including India and Brazil, face significant increases due to political and trade disputes. Negotiations with China, Canada, and Mexico remain ongoing, with higher tariffs on Chinese goods set to take effect later in August, highlighting the widespread impact of Trump's protectionist trade agenda.

          <p>As of July 31, 2025, the price of gold stands at $3,313.08 per ounce, though its value is subject to constant fluctuations influenced by numerous factors. Gold is traditionally viewed as a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge, making it particularly attractive during periods of market or economic uncertainty. Key drivers of gold prices include supply and demand dynamics, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and interest rate movements, which have an inverse relationship with gold. Geopolitical instability, currency fluctuations, market sentiment, and central bank policies also play significant roles in determining the precious metal's value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Moderna has announced plans to reduce its global workforce by approximately 10% by the end of the year, aiming to bring its total employees to under 5,000. This significant decision is a direct response to slowing sales of its COVID-19 vaccine and a broader strategy to cut annual operating expenses by $1.5 billion by 2027. CEO Stephane Bancel emphasized that while job cuts were a last resort, reshaping the company's operating structure and aligning its cost base with current market realities are crucial for financial discipline and continued investment in its scientific pipeline. Despite having three approved products and the potential for eight more in the coming years, the biotech firm faces ongoing market uncertainties and policy hurdles, necessitating these strategic adjustments.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Canada's intention to recognize Palestine as a state at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly, aligning with similar recent declarations from the United Kingdom and France. This shift from Canada's long-standing position, which previously tied recognition to a negotiated two-state solution, is driven by the "deepening suffering of civilians" and the erosion of prospects for peace. Carney emphasized that recognition is predicated on the Palestinian Authority's commitment to reforms, including elections without Hamas, and Hamas's release of hostages and disarmament. Israel has denounced these decisions as a "reward for Hamas," complicating international efforts towards a ceasefire and hostage release.</p>

          <p>Ofcom, the UK's communications regulator, has initiated formal investigations into four companies operating 34 porn sites for alleged non-compliance with new age verification requirements. These regulations, which became effective recently, mandate "highly effective" tools to ensure users are over 18, aiming to prevent children from accessing harmful adult content. The regulator prioritized these specific companies due to the significant risk of harm posed by their services and their substantial user numbers, collectively attracting over nine million monthly visitors. This enforcement action is a key component of the broader Online Safety Act, a law that has drawn both support for child protection and criticism regarding privacy concerns and the practical effectiveness of its implementation.</p>

This marks the first time two competing bids for a third runway are on the table, following the government's invitation for proposals. The initiative highlights the complex and often controversial nature of major infrastructure projects, balancing economic growth and increased capacity with significant environmental and community impacts, including potential rehoming of thousands.</p>

          <p>A group of distinguished British lawyers has warned the UK government that recognizing a Palestinian state could breach international law, specifically the Montevideo Convention's criteria for statehood. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer recently announced the UK would move towards recognition unless Israel met certain conditions, including a ceasefire and progress on a two-state solution. The lawyers argue that Palestine lacks a defined territory and a single functioning government, with Fatah and Hamas being adversarial entities. This intervention highlights the complex legal and political ramifications of such a diplomatic move, particularly at a time when international law is perceived as fragile.</p>
