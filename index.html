          <p>A court heard about the "obvious potential for real danger" during the sentencing of Nerys Bethan Lloyd, a paddleboard tour company owner, after four people died during a tour she led in 2021. The victims, Paul O'Dwyer, Andrea Powell, Morgan Rogers, and Nicola Wheatley, drowned in hazardous conditions on the River Cleddau. Lloyd, who admitted to manslaughter, lacked the proper qualifications to run the tour, and the court heard the river was in flood conditions with a strong current. Victim impact statements highlighted the devastating impact of the tragedy on the families.</p>

          <p>Two women, Julia Wandel and Karen Spragg, have denied stalking the family of Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in 2007. The women entered not guilty pleas at Leicester Crown Court and will face trial in October. Wandel is accused of sending letters and messages to the McCann family and visiting their home, while Spragg faces a charge of stalking involving serious alarm or distress. The case highlights the continued public interest and, in some cases, unhealthy obsessions surrounding high-profile missing person cases.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Southeast Asian immigrants in Los Angeles and Orange counties, with long-delayed deportation orders, are being detained and deported during routine ICE check-ins. These individuals, often convicted of crimes after arriving in the U.S., had previously been allowed to remain due to their home countries' unwillingness to accept them. The Trump administration's increased focus on deportations and potential tariff threats are believed to be contributing factors, causing concern and disruption within the affected communities.</p>
