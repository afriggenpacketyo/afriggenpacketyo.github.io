This investment was built secretly over two quarters, becoming the 18th largest position in Berkshire's portfolio. The disclosure comes as UnitedHealth faces significant challenges, including a nearly 50% stock decline this year and a Justice Department investigation into its billing practices. Following the news, the insurer's stock surged 6% in extended trading, signaling renewed investor confidence despite its recent struggles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced plans for a special election to vote on new congressional maps, a direct response to Republican-led redistricting efforts in Texas. Newsom stated that if states like Texas proceed with mid-decade redistricting, California will do the same for the 2026, 2028, and 2030 elections to "level the playing field." The move is framed as a defense of democracy against attempts to "rig the election." Republicans have criticized the plan as a self-serving political stunt by Newsom to consolidate Democratic power.</p>

          <p>Interest rates for home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) and home equity loans have continued their downward trend, with median rates falling to 8.12% and 8.23% respectively. This slight decrease, coupled with record-high home equity levels, presents an opportunity for homeowners looking to borrow money. The article suggests that while HELOC borrowers can benefit from future rate cuts due to variable rates, those considering a fixed-rate home equity loan might weigh waiting for potentially lower rates. However, it also notes the uncertainty of future Federal Reserve actions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A multinational effort is underway to airdrop tons of food into Gaza, a response to Israel's near-total blockade of the enclave that has led to widespread starvation. This article details the complex logistics of the airdrops, which are described as a wildly inefficient and costly last resort compared to overland truck deliveries. On the ground, the aid distribution is chaotic and dangerous, with desperate Gazans scrambling for supplies, often leading to injuries or death. Many residents express frustration, stating the airdrops are a "performance for cameras" that fails to reach the most vulnerable people.</p>

          <p>As President Trump and Vladimir Putin prepare for a summit in Alaska, their primary objectives appear to differ significantly, though both may see diplomatic opportunities.

Conversely, Trump is driven by a desire to be seen as a global peacemaker and end the war, a key campaign promise.

          <p>According to Norwegian media, Donald Trump made an unsolicited call to Norway's finance minister, Jens Stoltenberg, to ask about a Nobel Peace Prize nomination. The report from Dagens Næringsliv suggests this was not the first time Trump had raised the subject with Stoltenberg. In a statement, Stoltenberg confirmed the call took place but said it focused on economic cooperation and tariffs. Trump has frequently expressed frustration over not receiving the prestigious award, which has been given to four of his predecessors, including Barack Obama.</p>

          <p>China has made substantial early purchases of soybeans from Brazil for September and October, a period traditionally dominated by U.S. exporters.

The move highlights Beijing's increasing trade reliance on South American partners amid ongoing political and commercial tensions with Washington.

          <p>At MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, researchers are working to create the artificial brains needed for humanoid robots to operate safely and effectively in the physical world. Led by Professor Daniela Rus, the team is training a robot named Ruby to perform basic kitchen tasks by learning from human movements. They use sensors to capture data on motion and force, teaching the machine how to handle objects with appropriate strength and precision. The goal is to develop robots that can assist with household chores or in medical settings, moving beyond the repetitive tasks of current industrial robots.</p>

          <p>A Department of Justice trial attorney has been fired and charged with a felony after admitting to throwing a sandwich at a federal agent deployed in Washington, D.C. According to charging documents, Sean Dunn yelled profanities at Customs and Border Patrol officers before throwing the sandwich and attempting to flee. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the firing on social media, stating the employee's actions were disrespectful to law enforcement. The incident occurred amid heightened tensions and a significant federal law enforcement presence in the nation's capital, which was ordered by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Target and Ulta Beauty are ending their partnership, which established hundreds of Ulta "shop-in-shops" inside Target stores and on its website. The deal, which began in 2021, will conclude in August 2026. The partnership was often highlighted by Target executives as a key driver of store traffic and a way to capture market share in the growing beauty category. The dissolution of the deal could be another setback for Target, which has faced declining store traffic, flat sales, and investor concerns, adding another challenge for the company's next CEO.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer is selling its entire position in Coterra Energy, citing the lackluster price dynamics of both crude oil and natural gas. The club originally invested in Coterra as a hedge against geopolitical turmoil, valuing its flexibility to shift between oil and gas production. However, this strategy has not been effective, as the company has struggled to align its production with market demand for either commodity. The potential for a peace deal in Ukraine to lower oil prices further contributed to the decision to exit the position at a loss. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant development in the criminal case against Los Angeles City Councilman Curren Price, prosecutors tried to force his wife, Del Richardson, to testify before a grand jury. Price is facing charges of embezzlement, perjury, and conflict of interest, primarily related to voting on projects that allegedly benefited his wife's consulting firm. Documents also revealed that Richardson was considered a "suspect" in the investigation as recently as 2022. Price has pleaded not guilty to all charges, and his attorney has filed a motion to dismiss the case, questioning the legality of the grand jury proceedings.</p>

Officials emphasized that while such bites are rare and usually not fatal, people should never attempt to handle wildlife and should seek immediate medical attention if bitten.</p>

          <p>German soccer club Bayern Munich has ended its "Visit Rwanda" branding deal, a partnership that drew heavy criticism from fans and human rights activists. The deal was controversial due to Rwanda's human rights record and its alleged role in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Instead of completely severing ties, Bayern will shift to a new partnership focused on youth football development in the country. Analysts suggest the move was a "strategic climbdown" forced by external pressure rather than a moral stance, especially as the club signed a new deal with Emirates Airlines days earlier.</p>

          <p>Since its 2020 public debut, AI software company Palantir has seen its stock surge over 1,700%, with its valuation soaring past $430 billion. A significant driver of this growth has been government contracts, particularly with the U.S. military, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. The company recently secured a contract worth up to $10 billion with the U.S. Army. This explosive growth has led to a sky-high valuation, with its forward price-to-earnings ratio exceeding 280, a massive premium compared to other megacap tech giants. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts attribute the cooling market to a generational shift, as aging baby boomer collectors sell off their 1950s and 1960s cars.
