            <p>Citi and Natixis have lowered their China GDP growth forecasts to 4.2% for 2025 due to escalating trade tensions with the U.S., which include doubled tariffs and retaliatory duties. This adjustment reflects concerns about the limited potential for a deal between the two countries given recent escalations. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, while maintaining their 4.5% growth predictions, have also cautioned about increasing downside risks. China's official growth target is around 5%, but officials acknowledge it will be challenging to achieve given the current economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A federal judge has ruled that the White House cannot bar Associated Press (AP) journalists from accessing the Oval Office, Air Force One, and other controlled spaces. The ruling came after the AP sued to regain access, which was curtailed after the news agency refused to adopt President Trump's renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the "Gulf of America." Judge Trevor McFadden stated that blocking AP journalists based on their viewpoint violates the First Amendment, emphasizing that the government cannot selectively shut doors to journalists based on their expressed views.</p>
