          <h2>Google Advertising Antitrust Remedies Trial Scheduled for September</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government's remedies trial in the Google antitrust case concerning its advertising technology is set to commence on September 22. Judge Leonie Brinkema previously ruled that Google willfully acquired and maintained monopoly power in online advertising markets by tying its publisher ad server and ad exchange. This follows a prior ruling in August that Google holds a monopoly in internet search, marking a significant antitrust decision in the tech industry. Google faces the challenge of defending itself against antitrust allegations while also competing in the rapidly evolving generative AI market against rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic.</p>

          <p>Israeli fighter jets targeted an area near the Syrian presidential palace as a warning to the Syrian government to safeguard the Druse minority amidst escalating sectarian violence. This military action marks the second intervention by Israel in Syria this week, prompted by clashes involving Sunni Muslim extremists, government forces, and Druse fighters that have resulted in over 100 deaths. Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a stern warning to Syrian President Ahmed al-Shara, emphasizing Israel's commitment to preventing harm to the Druse population in Syria. The Druse community in Israel has been urging the government to take decisive action to protect their counterparts in Syria.</p>

          <p>A 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck off the coasts of Chile and Argentina, prompting Chilean authorities to issue an evacuation alert for coastal areas and a tsunami warning for areas within 185 miles of the epicenter. Waves up to 3 meters were expected in Chile and up to 1 meter in Antarctica, leading to evacuations in the affected regions. Chile's President Gabriel Boric assured that all necessary resources were available for the response. The earthquake's epicenter was located under the ocean, south of Ushuaia, Argentina, where water activities were suspended as a precaution.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year includes $163 billion in cuts to federal spending, targeting departments such as Education, Health and Human Services, USAID, and the Environmental Protection Agency. The proposed cuts aim to achieve significant savings, according to Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought. However, the budget also proposes a 13% increase in defense spending, bringing it to $1.01 trillion, and allocates $175 billion for the southern border. While budget proposals are essentially wish-lists for the administration, they serve to illustrate the president's priorities and what the White House hopes is a jumping off point for negotiations with Congress.</p>

          <p>Trade tensions between the United States and China have escalated, with uncertainty surrounding whether any discussions are currently taking place. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent declined to confirm President Trump's claim of a call with President Xi Jinping. China's Foreign Ministry stated that no consultations or negotiations on tariffs have occurred, while the Commerce Ministry suggested potential talks after attempts by U.S. officials to initiate negotiations. This standoff occurs as the Trump administration seeks trade deals with numerous countries facing potential tariffs, with China indicating reluctance to engage until the U.S. rolls back what it views as unfair trade measures.</p>

          <p>The UK's FTSE 100 has achieved its longest winning streak on record, gaining more than 5% since the beginning of the year and rising by 1.25% on Friday. This rally occurs amidst global market turbulence caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies. Analysts attribute the rise to the UK's neutral trade status, shielding it from tariffs impacting the European Union and China. Defensive stocks such as healthcare, energy, and consumer staples have attracted investors seeking refuge from volatility, supported by high dividend yields. Undervaluation relative to global peers and expectations of interest rate cuts from the Bank of England could further boost the index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An alumnus reflects on Columbia University's recent actions, drawing parallels to the decline of their alma mater, Smolny College in Russia, under autocratic pressure. The Trump administration's cancellation of federal grants to Columbia, ostensibly due to anti-Semitism, mirrors the Kremlin's manipulation of Smolny. The author recounts how Russian authorities undermined Smolny's independence, ultimately leading to its subjugation by the state. The author warns that Columbia must heed Smolny's story and resist further encroachment on its autonomy, as autocrats will not cease until they achieve total control. The author notes how the concerns of peers in America have begun to sound a lot like what the author heard from peers in Russia.</p>

          <p>The expiration of the de minimis tariff loophole on May 2 will lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers on goods from China and other countries. This loophole previously allowed packages worth $800 or less to enter the country duty-free, benefiting ultra-low-cost retailers like Shein and Temu. The end of the exemption will require millions more packages to be inspected daily, creating administrative challenges for U.S. Customs and Border Protection and potentially causing shipment delays. Companies selling goods made in the U.S. could benefit from reduced competition, while consumers may trade down to cheaper alternatives.</p>

          <p>Ruth Buzzi, famous for her role as Gladys Ormphby on "Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In," passed away at 88 due to complications from Alzheimer's disease. Buzzi's character, a spinster known for using her purse as a weapon, was a comedic highlight of the show. While Buzzi had a varied career in theater and television, her portrayal of Gladys Ormphby remained her most memorable role. The article notes that some of the humor directed at Gladys in the past would be considered inappropriate by today's standards, and that Buzzi also played roles on Sesame Street.</p>

The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%. Health care and transportation/warehousing sectors experienced the largest employment gains. Despite the positive job growth, rising jobless claims and a GDP contraction in the first quarter of the year signal potential economic weakness. Experts suggest the economy has been resilient, but the full impact of tariffs may take months to materialize in job numbers.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second presidency has faced significant challenges in its first 100 days, marked by collapsing approval ratings and troubling economic data. The U.S. economy contracted by 0.3% in the first quarter, attributed to Trump's tariffs, which have disrupted consumer confidence. Despite promises to end wars in Ukraine and Gaza, conflicts persist. Trump's expansionist threats have yielded little success, while his administration has faced criticism for its policies. These failures have led to increasing criticism, even from traditionally supportive media outlets.</p>

          <p>A ship carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza, operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, was attacked by explosions early Friday off the coast of Malta. The group suggested an Israeli drone strike was responsible for the explosion, but it did not provide definitive evidence, and two experts consulted by The Times were unable to conclusively determine if a drone had struck the ship based on a review of images of damage to the vessel. The ship, called Conscience, was en route to Gaza to challenge the Israeli and Egyptian blockade. The group said that crew members on the ship near Malta believed they had been hit by a drone attack.</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified antibodies in the blood of Tim Friede, who has injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades, that can neutralize the venom of multiple deadly snake species. This discovery may pave the way for a universal antivenom, addressing a significant global health issue. Friede's dedication to building immunity has allowed researchers to identify powerful antibodies that, when combined with a drug, protected mice from the venom of 19 deadly snake species. The study suggests that cocktails of antitoxins may successfully prevent deaths and injuries from various snake families.</p>

By consolidating so much foreign policy power in one person, she added, Mr. Trump risks losing someone who might provide him with different policy perspectives or competing advice. Mr. Witkoff has been leading the talks with Iran in recent weeks. Mr. Rubio has been vocal too, insisting that any deal must require Iran to give up the ability to enrich uranium, even for nuclear power reactors.</p>
