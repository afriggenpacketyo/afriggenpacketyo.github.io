            <p>President Trump speculated that China's deepening economic ties with Vietnam are part of a strategy to disadvantage the United States, particularly concerning tariffs and auto industry exemptions. He expressed this view during a discussion about trade relations, asserting that his predecessor lost trillions in trade to China. Despite these concerns, Trump maintained a positive relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping, creating a complex backdrop for ongoing trade negotiations. Last week, the US raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%.</p>

            <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele stated he would not comply with a U.S. Supreme Court order to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported from the United States. Abrego Garcia, a married father of three, was deported due to an administrative error, but the Trump administration claims he is a gang member. Bukele questioned how he could "smuggle a terrorist" into the U.S. and suggested he would not release criminals back into El Salvador. This stance creates a conflict between the U.S. legal system and El Salvador's national security concerns.</p>

            <p>Apple's stock experienced a boost, pushing its market capitalization back above $3 trillion, following the Trump administration's decision to exempt phones, computers, and chips from new tariffs.

Analysts estimate this could save Apple billions in costs, although the exemptions are considered temporary. Despite this positive development, Apple's stock remains down for the month, reflecting ongoing uncertainty regarding trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>
