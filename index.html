          <p>China's export growth in May fell short of expectations, primarily due to a significant decrease in shipments to the United States, despite a temporary trade truce. Exports to the U.S. plummeted by 34.5% year-on-year, marking the steepest decline since February 2020, while imports from the U.S. also dropped by over 18%. Overall exports rose by 4.8%, but this was offset by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, the European Union, and Africa. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China remain, with ongoing negotiations and accusations of violating the Geneva trade agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's new travel ban, restricting citizens from a dozen countries, primarily in Africa and the Middle East, has gone into effect. The ban, broader than the 2017 version, targets nationals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, and others, with partial restrictions on additional countries. Unlike the previous ban, this one includes Haiti and has faced less public outrage, overshadowed by immigration battles and protests in Los Angeles. Critics argue the ban is discriminatory, disproportionately affecting non-white countries and hindering opportunities for education and professional development.</p>

The board notes the move is ahistoric, invoking a rarely used provision of the U.S. Code on Armed Services, and compares it to instances where presidential authority was used to overrule state governors during times of civil unrest.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has strongly criticized President Donald Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles, comparing his actions to those of a "dictator." Newsom has demanded that Trump rescind the order, accusing him of inciting violence and militarizing cities. The criticism comes amid clashes between National Guard troops and demonstrators protesting Trump's immigration policies.

          <p>China's producer price deflation deepened to its worst level in nearly two years in May, while consumer prices continued to decline, as the economy faces trade tensions and a prolonged housing downturn.

Uncertainties from the tariff war with the United States and weak domestic consumption have fueled expectations of more policy stimulus.

          <h2>UK Energy Firms Paid Large Sums Not to Provide Power</h2>

          <p>Energy firms in Britain are receiving substantial payments for not providing power due to grid limitations, raising concerns about energy bills. Wind farms are being compensated for turning down output because the grid cannot handle the electricity they generate. Simultaneously, gas-fired power stations are paid to provide more electricity, leading to increased costs. The government is considering regional electricity markets as a solution, but the move faces opposition from energy firms and raises questions about the impact on consumer bills.
