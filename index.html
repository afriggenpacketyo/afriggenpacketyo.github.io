        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. crude oil prices experienced a sharp decline, falling over 4%, after OPEC+ nations agreed to increase oil production for the second consecutive month. The decision to raise output by an additional 411,000 barrels per day in June follows a similar increase in May, surprising market analysts who had anticipated a more conservative approach. This surge in production, coupled with concerns over tariffs and potential recession, has contributed to a significant drop in oil prices this year, impacting the earnings of major oil companies and leading to expectations of reduced investment in exploration and production.</p>

The professor views Trump as a proto-autocrat, suggesting his policies are driven by a desire to challenge democratic institutions and engage in tough bargaining tactics.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, enabling taxpayer funds to assist qualifying students with private school tuition. The new law will provide most students attending accredited private schools with $10,000 annually, while students with disabilities can receive up to $30,000, and home-schooled students will get $2,000 a year. Democrats argue the legislation will harm public schools, diverting funds to wealthier students already in private education, while supporters claim it will provide families with greater educational freedom.</p>

          <p>The expiration of a de minimis tariff exemption is expected to increase the cost of goods from China for U.S. consumers. This provision, which previously allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, has been eliminated, potentially affecting ultra-low cost retailers like Shein and Temu. The change could also lead to administrative challenges for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, with millions more packages requiring inspection, potentially causing delays in shipments.

Over six decades, he transformed a failing textile manufacturer into a $1.1 trillion conglomerate, influencing generations of financiers and becoming an icon of American-style capitalism. His departure raises questions about Berkshire's future without its visionary leader.</p>
