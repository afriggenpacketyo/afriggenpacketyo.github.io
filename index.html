        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to demonstrations against immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, the Trump administration is deploying 2,000 National Guard members to address what it describes as "lawlessness." This decision follows clashes between protestors and authorities. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the federal government's move as inflammatory and likely to escalate tensions, stating that the federal government was moving to take over the California National Guard. The deployment is framed by the White House as a necessary measure to maintain order amidst ongoing protests over immigration enforcement operations. The context of the situation is that the White House believes the protests are escalating to a level of lawlessness which requires federal intervention, while the state government is viewing the federal government's intervention as an overreach of power. </p>

          <p>Colombian presidential candidate Miguel Uribe Turbay is in critical condition after being shot at a campaign rally in Bogota. The attack has been widely condemned as a threat to democracy, with authorities arresting a 15-year-old suspect at the scene. Uribe's wife has asked the nation to pray for his survival as he fights for his life in the hospital, and President Gustavo Petro has also condemned the attack and urged Colombians to focus on ensuring Uribe's survival. The US Secretary of State Marco Rubio blamed the attack on violent leftist rhetoric coming from the highest levels of the Colombian government. </p>

          <p>The UK government's upcoming Spending Review will include an £86 billion package for the science and technology sector to fund research into areas like drug treatments and longer-lasting batteries. The package includes up to £500 million for regions across the UK, with local leaders having a say in how it is spent, according to the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology. Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that investing in the sector would create jobs and boost security, with the package expected to be worth more than £22.5 billion-a-year by 2029. Research backers have warned that the government needs to do more to secure the UK's reputation for science on the world stage. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has found that microplastics from polylactic acid, a widely used biodegradable material, can enter the metabolic cycle of bacteria and cells in the gut after being ingested. Researchers in China and the United States discovered that these microplastics altered gut metabolism and damaged the gut barrier of mice. The researchers suggest this could potentially contribute to conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes. This is the first time microplastics have been found to enter the body's metabolic cycle, according to the study's corresponding author Cui Xuejing. </p>

          <p>Archaeologists excavating the Floga archaeological site on the Greek island of Paros have discovered an ancient workshop containing unfinished sculptures. The excavation revealed new architectural remains, eating vessels, and storage items, documenting continuous use of the site from the late 5th to the 4th century BC. The artifacts uncovered include semi-finished marble sculptures, mainly of Aphrodite, clay heads of female figures, and clay molds and stamps. The site was reorganized at the end of the third century B.C., serving as both a residential space and a sculpture workshop, according to archaeologists. </p>

Scientific research on the moon aims to make space travel safer and easier, investigating lunar environments and how human activity affects them.

He emphasized his commitment to the US national team, which he took over at the end of 2024.

          <p>Ahead of this week's Spending Review, analysts are questioning whether the Labour government can convince investors that its economic vision is real. Chief executives express concern that the government appears hesitant despite its large majority. The chancellor's focus is on long-term capital spending, earmarking 2.7% of GDP over five years, the highest sustained level in nearly half a century. Long-term certainty over capital sums could incentivize private investment, especially for green technologies. </p>

          <p>Iranian rapper Tataloo, once a supporter of a hard-line presidential candidate, is now facing execution after being convicted of "insulting Islamic sanctities." Tataloo's music, which challenged Iran's theocracy, gained popularity among the country's youth, and his lyrics became increasingly political after the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini. Despite appearing in a music video backing Iran's Revolutionary Guard in 2015 and endorsing Ebrahim Raisi in 2017, Tataloo's criticism of the authorities ultimately led to his arrest and sentencing. Activists have voiced concerns for his safety, especially after reports of a suicide attempt in prison. </p>

Earlier Saturday, California Gov.

          <p>Subsidising men’s participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining global birth rates, according to a new study. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong (HKU), argued that subsidies for fathers produce significantly higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidising mothers. The findings came as the world’s second-largest economy faces a rapidly ageing population, shrinking workforce and strained social welfare system – before reaching high-income status. The interest in having children has continued to decline in most areas, pushing China’s overall fertility rate to an estimated 1.1 children per woman. </p>

          <h2>Intermittent Fasting: An Eating Disorder in Disguise?</h2>

          <p>Nutritionists are warning that intermittent fasting, a popular eating plan, may be an eating disorder in disguise. While intermittent fasting is touted for various benefits, it can be problematic for individuals with a history of eating disorders or disordered eating behaviors. The practice can serve as a socially acceptable disguise for restrictive eating, hiding disordered eating without raising concern. Experts emphasize that the potential benefits of intermittent fasting do not outweigh the risks of developing or worsening an eating disorder. </p>
