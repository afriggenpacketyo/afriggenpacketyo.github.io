        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant increase of over 4% due to escalating tensions between the United States and Iran, fueled by President Trump's skepticism about reaching a nuclear agreement with Iran. The U.S. is preparing to evacuate non-essential personnel from its embassy in Baghdad, while the UK Maritime Trade Operations warned of potential military escalation in the region. Iran's defense minister stated that U.S. bases in the region are within reach of Iran's military. The rising tensions and uncertainty surrounding a nuclear deal have contributed to market volatility and concerns about potential disruptions in oil supply. The price of oil reacted in this fashion as investors became more concerned about the stability of the world and the region itself. Optimism regarding stability is lower due to these concerns.</p>

          <p>NPR's "Consider This" podcast examines the impact of President Trump's immigration policies, particularly in Los Angeles, where the administration is increasing enforcement efforts. While polls suggest some support for Trump's deportation policies, critics highlight the human cost, citing instances of families being separated during workplace raids. California Governor Gavin Newsom described a situation where a pregnant U.S. citizen was arrested, and a four-year-old girl was taken. The episode features a conservative immigration analyst who believes Trump's approach will be effective, but the podcast also raises questions about the extent to which Americans support the administration's actions. The debate around immigration continues to be a divisive issue in the country, and the potential ramifications for families are real.</p>

          <p>During an ICE raid at a meat-producing plant in Omaha, Nebraska, an illegal immigrant from Honduras reportedly assaulted ICE officers, leading to the detention of over 70 individuals. ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons emphasized that the suspect was a violent criminal who attacked law enforcement, and that being in the country illegally is already breaking the law. The raid also resulted in protests outside the plant, with some protesters jumping on vehicles and throwing rocks. The plant's president stated that the plant uses E-Verify to confirm workers' immigration status and questioned why they were targeted if the system is broken. The incident has sparked debate about immigration enforcement and the safety of ICE officers.</p>

          <p>A New Jersey federal judge issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from deporting or continuing to detain Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestinian activist from Columbia University. Judge Michael Farbiarz barred the administration from removing Khalil based on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination that his presence posed a risk to foreign policy. The judge stayed the injunction to allow the Department of Homeland Security time to appeal the decision. The ruling is a blow to the administration's efforts to deport Khalil, who has been detained since March, but the government can still pursue deportation for other reasons. The ruling is a blow to the Trump administration's efforts to deport Khalil.</p>

Critics like Dr. Paul Offit fear the new committee's recommendations will be less informed and that the public will not receive the same quality of advice as before. Kennedy defended his choices, stating they are committed to evidence-based medicine and gold-standard science.

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ruled that social media companies can be held accountable for certain types of content posted by users on their platforms. The decision could lead to potential fines for companies that fail to remove illegal content. While a majority of judges supported the ruling, they did not agree on what specific types of content would be considered illegal. The current law only holds social media companies responsible for third-party content if they fail to remove it after a court order. The ruling marks a shift in the legal landscape for social media regulation in Brazil.</p>

          <p>A leisure center in Larne, Northern Ireland, was attacked as violence broke out for the third consecutive night, following unrest in Ballymena. The violence initially started after a peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault in Ballymena.

Police have deployed dogs and water cannons in Ballymena, and additional officers are being sent to the affected areas, with authorities condemning the violence and promising prosecutions.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the government cannot deport or detain Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil based on the foreign policy reasons cited by the Trump administration. The judge issued a preliminary injunction, stating that Khalil's career and reputation were being damaged and his speech was being chilled, causing irreparable harm. However, the ruling does not prevent the administration from pursuing deportation for other reasons, such as alleged omissions on his green card application. The case highlights the ongoing debate over the administration's use of foreign policy concerns to justify the deportation of pro-Palestinian activists. The judge found that the government is almost certainly detaining Khalil right now because of the Rubio determination, and not due to issues with his green card application.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that the bodies of two hostages, including Yair Yaakov, have been recovered from Gaza by the army and Shin Bet security agency. Yaakov was kidnapped and killed by militants from the Palestinian group Islamic Jihad. Netanyahu expressed condolences to the families and vowed to continue efforts to bring all hostages home. Israeli forces have retrieved five hostage bodies this month, and there are now 53 hostages still being held by Hamas, at least 20 of whom are believed to be alive. The recovery of the bodies underscores the ongoing challenges and complexities of the hostage situation in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attacking Biden-era policies aimed at limiting air and climate pollution from power plants, signaling a broader effort to stimulate the fossil fuel industry. The EPA is initiating the process of repealing regulations on carbon emissions from coal and natural-gas power plants, as well as tightening regulations on mercury and other toxins. Critics argue that these actions will worsen climate change and harm public health. The administration's actions are expected to face legal challenges from environmental groups. The administration's actions signal a shift away from climate action and towards prioritizing fossil fuel production.</p>

          <p>In Miami, the growing number of deportations is raising concerns among Cuban-Americans, a group traditionally supportive of President Trump. While some Cuban-Americans support deporting criminals, others are uncomfortable with the deportation of people who come to work hard and have no criminal record. The Trump administration has shocked the South Florida community by deporting people to countries run by authoritarian regimes, like Cuba and Venezuela. Some prominent Cuban-American elected officials have begun to criticize the administration's actions, highlighting the growing unease within the community. The deportations have sparked debate and raised questions about the administration's approach to immigration enforcement.</p>

The uncertainty surrounding trade policies and lingering recession fears are also weighing on EU exports bound for the U.S. The long-term impact of the trade war is expected to be felt throughout the economy.

          <p>President Trump has seemingly softened his stance on Chinese students studying in the U.S., stating that they are welcome after previously threatening to revoke their visas. This shift comes after Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested the U.S. would aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or who studied certain "critical fields." Universities depend on the tuition fees paid by international students and see Chinese and other foreign students as integral to their academic operations. The potential shift has exacerbated growing uncertainty at universities, which have been dealt a barrage of actions under Trump. The decision to allow Chinese students to come here is part of the importance of the United States being a draw for students from everywhere.</p>
