          <p>President Donald Trump declared that Memphis would be the next U.S. city to receive National Guard troops as part of his crime crackdown in Democrat-led areas. Memphis Mayor Paul Young expressed strong disapproval, stating he learned of the decision via Fox News and had not requested the deployment, despite earlier discussions about federal support. Young emphasized the city's need for financial resources and additional police officers, not military intervention, recalling the 1968 National Guard deployment after Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination. Trump, however, claimed the mayor was "happy" about the decision, while FBI data shows Memphis has one of the highest violent crime rates in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Taliban's top diplomat, Amir Khan Muttaqi, reportedly met with U.S. special envoy for hostage response, Adam Boehler, and former envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, with the Afghan Foreign Ministry stating discussions covered bilateral relations, citizen issues, and investment opportunities in Afghanistan. This meeting follows the release of a third U.S. detainee since President Trump's second term, a key priority for his administration. While the U.S. does not officially recognize the Taliban government, these contacts represent ongoing, albeit unofficial, diplomatic engagement. Such interactions, particularly concerning the release of detained citizens, are crucial for de-escalation and potential future stability.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer reportedly questioned Lord Mandelson about his association with convicted sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein before appointing him as the UK's ambassador to the U.S. Mandelson was asked three specific questions regarding his continued contact with Epstein post-conviction and alleged stays at Epstein's properties. Despite Mandelson's assurances, new emails revealed supportive messages he sent to Epstein after his 2008 conviction, leading to his eventual sacking. The revelation has intensified scrutiny on Sir Keir's judgment and the thoroughness of the vetting process.</p>

          <p>The United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly voted 142-10 to support a nonbinding resolution endorsing a two-state solution for the Israel-Palestinian conflict, urging Israel to commit to a Palestinian state. The resolution, sponsored by France and Saudi Arabia, also condemned attacks by both Hamas and Israel on civilians and infrastructure in Gaza. Israeli Prime Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the resolution, stating there would be "no Palestinian state," while U.S. Ambassador Danny Danon dismissed it as a "publicity stunt" that benefits Hamas. This vote comes as the war in Gaza continues and the Palestinian delegation hopes for more countries to recognize Palestine as a state.</p>

          <p>Nepal's major political parties, including Nepali Congress, CPN-UML, and Maoist Centre, have demanded President Ram Chandra Poudel reinstate the parliament, arguing its dissolution was unconstitutional. The parliament was dissolved following anti-corruption protests and upon the recommendation of interim Prime Minister Sushila Karki. While Karki's appointment was a key demand of the "Gen Z" protest movement, the parties insist that addressing public demands, including new elections, should occur through an elected institution. President Poudel urged restraint and called for elections within six months to move towards a more efficient democracy.</p>

          <p>Illinois congresswoman Delia Ramirez and local officials are demanding an investigation into the fatal shooting of Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents during a traffic stop in Franklin Park, Chicago. The officials condemned the incident as "inevitable violence" stemming from the Trump administration's deportation campaign, emphasizing that a traffic violation should not lead to death. DHS claims Villegas-Gonzalez resisted arrest and dragged an officer, while surveillance video shows agents breaking into his car.

The judge ruled that the Attorney General lacked authority to bring the RICO case without gubernatorial permission, exposing fundamental flaws in the indictment. Defense attorneys hailed the decision as a vindication, arguing the state acted inappropriately to criminalize a protest movement. This collapse highlights prosecutorial sloppiness, including violations of attorney-client privilege, and sets a precedent against using organized crime laws for protest movements.</p>

          <h2>Dermatologist Advises Ingredient Focus for Safe Use of Popular Lip Oils to Prevent Hyperpigmentation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dermatologist Dr. Rebecca Small advises consumers to prioritize ingredients over brand names when choosing lip oils, as some popular products have been linked to increased lip pigmentation. The thin skin of the lips is highly susceptible to sun damage and irritation, which can lead to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Products lacking SPF can magnify UV exposure, while plumping or fragranced ingredients may cause dermatitis. Dr. Small recommends lip oils with broad-spectrum SPF, linoleic acids, squalane, glycerin, and hyaluronic acid, while advising against fragrances and oleic acids to ensure hydration and safety.</p>

          <p>The first deportation flights of migrants from the UK to France, under a new "one in, one out" pilot scheme, are expected to commence next week. This deal, agreed upon by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and President Emmanuel Macron, involves the UK returning small boat arrivals to France in exchange for accepting an equal number of asylum seekers who haven't attempted crossings. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood confirmed formal removal directions have been issued to dozens of detainees. Critics, including the Conservatives, question the policy's workability and potential for abuse, as Channel crossings continue to rise.</p>

These initiatives aim to enhance reliability and attract more LNG traffic, crucial for the U.S. economy.

In a social media post, he criticized NATO's commitment to winning the war and the "shocking" continued purchases of Russian energy by some members. Trump also urged NATO allies to impose 50-100% tariffs on Chinese goods, arguing this would weaken China's influence over Russia and help end the conflict.
