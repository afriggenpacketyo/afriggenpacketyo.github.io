            <p>Hashem Abedi, brother of the Manchester Arena bomber, attacked three prison officers at HMP Frankland, leaving them with serious injuries including burns and stab wounds. Abedi, already serving a sentence for his role in the 2017 bombing, used hot cooking oil and homemade weapons in the assault. The Prison Officers' Association is calling for a review of freedoms given to prisoners in separation centers, while the Justice Secretary has vowed to pursue the strongest possible punishment. The incident has raised concerns about the ability to contain extremist inmates and ensure staff safety within the prison system.</p>

            <p>Dive teams are searching the Hudson River for remaining wreckage from a helicopter crash that killed six people, including a Siemens executive and his family. The investigation hinges on recovering key parts like the main rotor and transmission to determine the cause of the crash. Preliminary findings suggest a rotor may have broken off, causing the helicopter to shake uncontrollably before plunging into the water. Authorities are exploring theories including mechanical failure, birds, or drones as potential factors in the incident, while calls for increased FAA oversight have emerged in light of the tragedy.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's recent tariff policies have caused turmoil in the US debt market, weakening his economic and political position and giving Europe and the UK an advantage. The EU, Britain, and other democracies should work together to capitalize on this opportunity by forming a new trade order without the US. They should also be wary of China's growing influence and its efforts to undermine democratic societies. Britain should align itself with the EU in negotiations with Trump and pursue a more expansive trade deal with the EU to boost growth.</p>

            <p>President Trump's changing tariff policies have left US shoppers feeling confused and uncertain, with some engaging in panic buying while others feel paralyzed. Trump has repeatedly altered his plans, scaling back duties on some countries before exempting smartphones and other electronics. Consumers are worried about potential price increases and possible shortages, particularly for items such as clothing and electronics. Economists predict that these tariffs could lead to a significant jump in costs for the average US family, potentially impacting consumer spending and economic growth.</p>

Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that companies like Apple and Nvidia are increasing their investments in the U.S. at the direction of the President. However, other tariffs still apply to smartphones, laptops, and other electronics, as the exemptions only cover Trump's most recent tariffs.

The exemptions also include semiconductors, solar cells, and memory cards, with the White House indicating that the move aims to give companies more time to move production to the US.

Delta has apologized for the experience and is offering full refunds to affected customers.

Ethical problems remain, including the welfare of these animals, and whether there is a point bringing back an animal if we simply drive it to extinction again. Critics warn that the idea we can bring back species will undermine conservation.</p>

            <p>Former President Barack Obama's preference for medium-well steak continues to spark debate among culinary enthusiasts. While some consider it a faux pas due to potential dryness, Obama admits it's simply his personal preference. Cooking steak to medium-well ensures an internal temperature ranging from 145 to 155 degrees Fahrenheit, which aligns with food safety guidelines. Eating undercooked beef can carry risks of illness-causing bacteria. Ultimately, personal taste prevails, even if it deviates from conventional culinary wisdom.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump has authorized the military to take control of land at the US-Mexico border as part of his administration’s efforts to crack down on undocumented immigration. The memorandum allows the military to take a more direct role in securing the southern border. It gives the Department of Defense jurisdiction over federal lands, including the Roosevelt Reservation, allowing troops to detain immigrants accused of trespassing. The order excludes native reservations. Critics say this is a workaround of the Posse Comitatus Act.</p>
