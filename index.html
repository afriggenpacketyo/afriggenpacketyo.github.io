          <h2>Ford Suspends 2025 Financial Guidance Due to Tariff Impact</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 19:01:59 EDT</div>

          <p>Ford Motor suspended its 2025 financial guidance, anticipating a $2.5 billion hit from President Trump's tariffs, despite exceeding Wall Street's first-quarter expectations. The automaker aims to offset $1 billion of these costs, projecting a net impact of $1.5 billion. The suspension is attributed to potential industry-wide supply chain disruptions and the uncertainty surrounding tariffs, including retaliatory measures. This move follows GM's lowered 2025 guidance due to similar tariff-related expenses. Ford's action reflects broader concerns within the automotive industry regarding the economic impact of tariffs on imported vehicles and parts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is urging a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit brought by Missouri, Idaho, and Kansas, challenging the FDA's expanded access to mifepristone. Justice Department lawyers argue that the states lack legal standing and filed the suit in an improper venue. This legal battle began with anti-abortion rights groups, who sought to roll back FDA changes that allowed mifepristone to be taken later in pregnancy and dispensed through the mail. The administration's stance marks its first position on the challenge, with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stating that the president asked him to study the safety of mifepristone.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor announced that the Trump administration's tariff policies are expected to reduce its 2025 profit by approximately $1.5 billion and has suspended its financial forecast for the year due to increased uncertainty.

Ford cited potential disruptions to automotive supply chains and retaliatory tariffs as reasons for suspending its guidance. The company's profit in the first three months of the year fell to $471 million, down from $1.3 billion a year earlier, attributed to lower vehicle sales and production pauses. </p>

          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is facing scrutiny for potentially violating New York City campaign finance rules by using his campaign website to instruct a super PAC on how to support his mayoral bid. Cuomo's website features a "message for voters" that resembles detailed spending instructions for the super PAC, Fix the City. This practice, known as "red-boxing," is aimed at circumventing rules prohibiting direct coordination between campaigns and super PACs. If found in violation, Cuomo could face penalties and lose millions in public matching funds.

          <p>Air traffic controllers at Newark Liberty International Airport briefly lost communications with planes under their control, leading to multiple employees taking trauma leave. The FAA acknowledged that the antiquated air traffic control system is affecting the workforce and is working to improve the system. United Airlines has canceled 35 flights per day from Newark due to the airport's inability to handle scheduled flights. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association said employees took leave under provisions for workers experiencing a traumatic event at work. The US Department of Transport has unveiled a package to boost the numbers of FAA air traffic controllers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is seeking to force Harvard University back to the negotiating table by informing the school that it will not be eligible for any new federal grants until it demonstrates responsible management of the university. The decision was relayed to the university in a letter from Linda McMahon, the education secretary. The letter stipulated that Harvard must address concerns about antisemitism on campus, policies that consider a student’s race and complaints from the administration that the university has abandoned its pursuit of “academic excellence” while employing relatively few conservative faculty members.

          <p>President Donald Trump falsely claimed that gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon, in his push to convince the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. The national average for gasoline is actually around $3.165 per gallon.

The US Department of Justice urged a judge to dismiss the lawsuit by three Republican-led states on procedural grounds. While the filing does not discuss the merits of the states’ case, it suggests the Trump administration is in no rush to drop the government’s defense of mifepristone, used in more than 60% of US abortions.

Voight, whom he named a “special ambassador” to Hollywood this year, and Steven Paul, his longtime manager, met with Mr. Trump over the weekend and shared their plans to increase domestic film production. They suggested federal tax incentives, changes to the tax code, co-production treaties with other nations and infrastructure subsidies, the statement said. While few in the industry said that they understood Mr. Trump’s proposal, some worried that tariffs could cause more harm than good and called instead for federal help in the form of tax credits.</p>

If implemented properly, the digital Social Security numbers may provide more security than paper cards, she said.

Many of these chemicals have never been tested for safety, and some are known to cause cancer or impede fetal development. The prevalence of these chemicals is linked to America’s fervor for synthetic materials, which reshaped society beginning in the mid-20th century, and the cunning methods that chemical makers used to ensure their untrammeled spread.
