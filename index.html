Despite holding a double-digit lead in the first half, the Lakers' defense faltered, allowing 30 points in the third quarter. Cole Swider was a standout performer for the Lakers, scoring a game-high 24 points, while recent draft pick Dalton Knecht struggled with his shooting. Bronny James, son of LeBron James, traveled with the team but did not play in the game.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in Central Texas have resulted in at least 47 fatalities, including two young sisters from Dallas, 13-year-old Blair and 11-year-old Brooke Harber. The girls were staying with their grandparents, who are still unaccounted for, near the Guadalupe River when the disaster struck. The flooding heavily impacted Camp Mystic, an all-girls summer camp, where up to 25 campers remain missing after the river rose 26 feet in under an hour. A massive search and rescue operation is underway, involving state and federal agencies.</p>

          <p>A new study has identified the most stressful states for driving in the U.S., with Texas ranking as the worst. The analysis, conducted by a Wisconsin personal injury law firm, evaluated 25 factors including commute times, traffic volume, insurance costs, and road conditions to create a comprehensive stress index. Following Texas are New Jersey and California, with several other southern states also featuring in the top ten most stressful places to drive. In contrast, South Dakota was found to be the least stressful state for motorists. (not investment advice)</p>

While the tactic appears to yield some results with allies, its effectiveness against entrenched adversaries like Russia and Iran is questioned, as it may provoke them to pursue more extreme measures, like nuclear armament, for their own security.</p>

According to Dr. John Brooks, former chief medical officer for the CDC's HIV prevention division, this reduction in funding jeopardizes decades of progress and could halt the development of a potential HIV vaccine and cure. While treatments for existing patients remain, the cuts disproportionately affect prevention research and activities, which are vital for reaching the national goal of eliminating the HIV epidemic by 2030.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Mark Green of Tennessee has officially announced his resignation from Congress, effective July 20. This move further shrinks the already slim Republican majority in the House of Representatives to 219-212 until his seat is filled. Green, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, stated he is leaving public office to return to the private sector and start a business aimed at helping the U.S. compete against China. His departure presents an additional challenge for House Speaker Mike Johnson in managing his narrow majority on key legislative votes.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's efforts to curb the dominance of Chinese drone manufacturers through executive orders face significant challenges due to their deep integration into global supply chains. Industry insiders and analysts note that China's firms are world leaders, and there are few non-Chinese alternatives available, making a swift removal of their products difficult and costly. While Washington continues to view China's role in the drone market as a strategic concern, the economic reality is that Chinese companies like DJI have become pre-eminent, making any potential ban disruptive for commercial users in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration is facing sharp criticism for sending an email praising a new spending bill signed by President Trump, which it claimed eliminates federal income taxes on benefits for most recipients. Critics, including former agency officials and Democratic lawmakers, have called the statement a "lie" and "blatant misinformation," noting the bill only provides a temporary tax deduction for seniors, not a full tax elimination. The incident has raised serious concerns about the politicization of the historically apolitical agency and its communications with the public. (not investment advice)</p>

After a tight first half, England scored three quick tries from Tom Roebuck and Freddie Steward to take control of the game. Despite a brief comeback from the Pumas, England's composure and strong defense ensured a comfortable victory ahead of the second Test next week.</p>

          <p>Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made his first public appearance since the recent 12-day war with Israel, according to Iranian state media. He was shown on television attending a religious ceremony at a mosque in Tehran ahead of the Shia festival of Ashura. During the conflict, which involved Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear sites and retaliatory attacks, Khamenei had only appeared in pre-recorded video messages, leading to speculation about his whereabouts. His public return comes as Iran observes the month of Muharram, a significant period of mourning for Shia Muslims.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that pregnant individuals exposed to high heat and wildfire smoke are more likely to have babies who are smaller in the womb and at birth. The research, focused on climate-vulnerable neighborhoods in Los Angeles, found that heat stress during the first trimester or even before conception was linked to smaller infant size. The effects were nearly doubled for those in hotter neighborhoods with less access to air conditioning. Health experts are calling for greater awareness of these climate-related risks for pregnant people and their developing babies.</p>

He suggested the party could gain significant influence by targeting a small number of key congressional seats, thereby acting as a deciding vote on contentious legislation and better representing the will of the people.</p>

In one dramatic instance, a "monster rip current" pulled more than ten people far from shore, requiring a significant rescue operation involving lifeboats and helicopters. The National Weather Service had issued warnings for strong rip currents and high surf for much of Southern California's coastline through the holiday weekend. Officials urged beachgoers to exercise extreme caution due to the hazardous swimming conditions created by the elevated surf.</p>
