          <p>A Harris's hawk, nicknamed "Bomber Harris," that had been attacking people in Flamstead, Hertfordshire, has been given a permanent home with a local falconer. The hawk had dive-bombed approximately 50 people over a month, resulting in injuries including one man being hospitalized. Falconer Wayne Housden captured and trained the bird, noting that its behavior was likely due to hormonal or territorial reasons, and he spent about Â£1,000 building an aviary for it. Housden intends to keep the hawk and hopes to release it in the autumn, and the hawk will also be featured at the Flamstead Scarecrow Festival.</p>

          <p>Fast fashion giant Shein is reportedly aiming for a Hong Kong listing after facing regulatory hurdles for its planned London initial public offering (IPO). The company has faced scrutiny over alleged use of forced labor and breaches of consumer protection laws, including misleading sustainability claims and fake discounts. The closure of the U.S.'s de minimis loophole for low-cost goods and potential similar measures in the EU and UK have added to Shein's challenges. Analysts suggest a Hong Kong listing may be a safer option for Shein, appealing more to a domestic audience amid ongoing controversies.</p>

          <p>Glaciers are melting at twice the rate measured two decades ago, affecting water supply, ecosystems, and cultural traditions worldwide. The collapse of a glacier in the Swiss Alps recently underscored the impacts of a warming world on ice-packed regions, causing damage to infrastructure and increasing flood risk. Two billion people rely on glacial melt for their daily water needs, but thawing glaciers pose risks of both water shortages and infrastructure damage from floods.

Fletcher stated that food is being held at the borders while the population inside Gaza is starving, and Israeli ministers have indicated this is to put pressure on the Gazan population. He called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to disavow statements made by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich regarding the relocation of Gazans. Israel has faced growing international criticism over its conduct of the war, with the EU's top diplomat and leaders from the UK, France, and Canada urging Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza.</p>

          <p>A New York court ruling against President Trump's blanket import taxes has limited immediate impact on the UK's trade deal with the US. The tariffs ruled illegal do not include those on cars, steel, and aluminum, which are the UK's most affected industries. While the UK has secured a deal to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum, this deal is not yet in force. The ruling does block Trump's imposition of blanket tariffs on other UK goods, but the White House intends to appeal the decision, creating uncertainty for British exporters.

          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the vital role of UK's saltmarshes as "sinks" that lock away climate-warming greenhouse gases in layers of mud. The charity is advocating for the inclusion of these tidal habitats in the UK's official inventory of carbon emissions and removals. Researchers have installed greenhouse gas monitoring stations on a restored saltmarsh in North-West England, revealing that plants there absorb more carbon dioxide in the summer than they release in winter. The UK has lost about 85% of its saltmarshes since 1860, many of which were drained for agriculture.</p>

          <p>In 1955, the U.S. deported Qian Xuesen, a brilliant Chinese rocket scientist, in exchange for American prisoners of war, a decision that significantly altered the global balance of power. Qian returned to China and established a modern weapons program, leading to China's first missile test by the end of the decade and the development of capabilities to strike California or Moscow by 1980. The deportation, fueled by McCarthy-era xenophobia, cost the U.S. its lead in manned spaceflight and enabled China to challenge American dominance in Asia.

          <p>Japan's parliament has begun its first deliberations in 28 years on legislation that would allow married couples to keep different surnames. Despite growing public support, the passage of the bills submitted by opposition parties is unlikely during the current Diet session. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party remains hesitant due to concerns about family cohesion and traditional values. A revision to the Civil Code is needed to enable couples to retain separate family names, with most women currently abandoning their maiden names upon marriage. A recent poll showed that 71% of respondents support the dual family-name system.</p>

Japan has also ruled out a defense deal in return for U.S. tariff easing, stating that defense equipment purchases should be based on national security needs. Additionally, core consumer prices in Tokyo rose at the fastest pace in over two years, and Japan's unemployment rate remained unchanged. The digest also covers the Trump administration's accusations against China for exploiting U.S. universities and Japan's decision to lift some sanctions against Syria.</p>

          <p>President Trump attacked conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, calling him a "bad person" who "probably hates America." This outburst came after a panel of judges, including a Trump appointee, ruled most of his tariffs illegal, putting Trump at odds with some conservative legal figures. Trump expressed disappointment in The Federalist Society, claiming they gave him bad advice on judicial nominations. Leo responded by expressing gratitude for Trump's transformation of the Federal Courts, calling it his most important legacy. The president's attacks are notable given Leo's long-standing alliance with him, particularly in judicial selections.</p>

CSPC shares surged after announcing talks on licensing development and marketing rights for its drug candidates, potentially worth up to US$5 billion per candidate.</p>
