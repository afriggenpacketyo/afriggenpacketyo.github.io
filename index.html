          <p>A jury in Bradford has found Habibur Masum guilty of murdering his wife, Kulsuma Akter. Masum stabbed Akter over 25 times in a public street while she was with their infant son, who was unharmed in the attack. The court heard that Akter had been living in a women's refuge after Masum previously assaulted her. He had tracked her location on the day of the murder, confronting her and attacking her with a knife when she refused to leave with him.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have formalized a framework for a trade deal, building on previous agreements made in Geneva and London. The pact reportedly centers on easing U.S. access to Chinese rare earth minerals, which are crucial for high-tech manufacturing, in exchange for the U.S. canceling a series of restrictive measures. The deal also addresses China's efforts to control the flow of fentanyl precursors. This development comes amid economic pressures on both nations, with the U.S. economy contracting and Chinese factory profits declining due to the ongoing trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities in the Mexican state of Jalisco have discovered a mass grave containing the bodies of 34 people during construction work in Zapopan. The region is a stronghold for the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel, and such discoveries are common in areas plagued by cartel violence. This finding highlights Mexico's ongoing crisis of over 127,000 missing persons, with criminal organizations often using clandestine graves to dispose of their victims. The discovery was made using ground-penetrating radar and cadaver dogs following an initial find in February.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana has publicly reiterated his opposition to a Senate reconciliation bill that includes provisions for selling federal lands. In a social media post, Zinke stated that while he agrees federal lands have been mismanaged, the solution is improved management and access, not privatization. His stance puts him at odds with some fellow Republicans, like Senator Mike Lee of Utah, who are pushing for the land sales to address issues like housing affordability. The provision has reportedly been flagged by the Senate parliamentarian, creating further hurdles for the measure.</p>

          <p>The recent conflict between Israel and Iran has led to a strategic re-evaluation across the Middle East, with many nations adopting a stance of calculated ambiguity. Countries like Jordan and Saudi Arabia publicly condemned Israeli actions but privately took measures to intercept Iranian projectiles, balancing their reliance on U.S. security cooperation with the need for regional stability. The conflict has also seemingly weakened Iran and its proxies, prompting Gulf states to engage with a diminished but still important regional power. This complex balancing act reflects a broader regional uncertainty about the United States' future role and focus in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that following the recent conflict with Iran, international attention has shifted away from Gaza, allowing extremist voices in Israel to push for the elimination of Palestinians. The author compiles numerous statements from Israeli lawmakers, officials, and media personalities since October 2023 that advocate for collective punishment, flattening Gaza, and erasing its population. The piece highlights the role of outlets like Israel's Channel 14 in broadcasting and normalizing such rhetoric. The author contends that these statements demonstrate an intent that goes beyond defeating Hamas to the complete removal of Palestinians from their land.</p>

Dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz" by state officials, the camp is intended to house up to 5,000 detainees in tents in a remote, inhospitable area known for extreme heat, alligators, and pythons. Critics argue the conditions are inhumane and that the project, pushed by the Trump administration and Governor Ron DeSantis, will have a devastating environmental impact on protected wetlands.

The vote, introduced by Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, comes amid growing anger from Democrats over the administration's lack of transparency regarding recent strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. While top officials assert the strikes severely damaged Iran's program, some lawmakers who received a classified briefing have cast doubt on these claims. The resolution faces a difficult path to passage in the Republican-controlled Senate, but it forces a public debate on U.S. involvement in the conflict.</p>

          <p>Two recent federal court rulings have created a murky legal picture regarding the use of copyrighted material to train AI models. In one case against Anthropic, a judge ruled that training models is "transformative" fair use, but also found the company's use of millions of books from "shadow libraries" to be "irredeemably infringing." In another case against Meta, a different judge suggested training on copyrighted books is likely illegal but ruled for Meta because the plaintiffs failed to argue that their market was being harmed. These conflicting decisions suggest the battle over AI and copyright is far from over and will likely require future litigation to resolve.</p>

          <p>Bruce Springsteen's new box set, "Tracks II: The Lost Albums," is reviewed as an epic act of pop archiving that collects 83 previously unreleased songs. The set organizes the material into seven distinct "lost albums," aiming to reshape the public's understanding of his career, particularly his ambivalence toward stardom in the 1980s and his experimental work in the 1990s. The review compares the project's scope to Peter Jackson's "Get Back" and notes its timely arrival ahead of a new biopic. The collection is seen as a reclamation of Springsteen as a challenging songwriter who was constantly pushing himself creatively even at the height of his fame.</p>

While the book powerfully illustrates how stories can be a form of rebellion, the review notes it doesn't fully deliver on its subtitle's promise to cover the broader Cold War effort beyond Poland.</p>

          <p>Two men were captured on security video stealing 85 koi fish from an outdoor pond at the Oak House Restaurant in Yucaipa, California. The suspects used buckets to carry away the fish, some of which are valued at over a thousand dollars each. The San Bernardino County Sheriffâ€™s Department has arrested one suspect, David Smith, but the other remains at large, and only a few of the stolen fish have been recovered. The restaurant's owners, who have raised koi for over 20 years, expressed their distress, viewing the fish as beloved pets that were also enjoyed by their customers.</p>

          <p>This column argues that Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary reflects a broader populist revolt against the political establishment, similar to the Tea Party movement's effect on Republicans. The author posits that both Mamdani and Donald Trump, despite their vast differences, appeal to voters who are fed up with career politicians and crave authenticity and economic change. The piece suggests that the Democratic party is losing its grip on working-class and nonwhite voters by failing to deliver on economic issues. Mamdani's success is presented as a lesson for Democrats, especially in California, on the power of charismatic, anti-establishment candidates.</p>

          <p>Vice Admiral Li Hanjun, the chief of staff for the People's Liberation Army Navy, and Liu Shipeng, a top nuclear scientist, have both been expelled from China's national legislature, the National People's Congress. The dismissals were announced by the NPC Standing Committee. The expulsion of Li Hanjun is the latest in a series of removals of high-ranking military officials and defense industry executives amid a sweeping anti-corruption crackdown within the Chinese military. This move signals continued turmoil and consolidation of power within China's defense establishment.</p>

          <h2>Japan Executes Man Convicted of Murdering Nine People in 2017</h2>

          <p>Japan has carried out its first execution since July 2022, hanging Takahiro Shiraishi, who was convicted of murdering nine people in 2017. Shiraishi, known as the "Twitter killer," lured his victims, who had expressed suicidal thoughts on social media, to his apartment where he murdered and dismembered them. The execution comes as Japan's use of capital punishment faces scrutiny, especially following the recent exoneration of a man who spent over 40 years on death row. Despite international pressure, public support for the death penalty remains high in Japan, with over 80% of respondents in a 2024 government poll favoring it.</p>

          <h2>Tokyo's Nikkei Index Surpasses 40,000 for First Time Since January</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tokyo's Nikkei Stock Average rose for a fourth consecutive day, closing above the 40,000 mark for the first time in several months. The market rally was driven by easing concerns over potential U.S. tariffs and a reduction in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Investor sentiment was boosted by a White House announcement that President Trump might extend a pause on "reciprocal" tariffs. The positive market movement also saw the U.S. dollar strengthen against the yen, as investors moved away from safe-haven assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration to Eliminate Warning Period for Fining Undocumented Immigrants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 05:13:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is set to publish a new rule that eliminates the 30-day warning period before levying fines on individuals in the U.S. illegally. According to the rule from the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, the government can now immediately begin fining people up to $1,000 per day for offenses such as ignoring a removal order. This policy, which was first used during Trump's first term and halted by the Biden administration, is being reinstated to create stronger consequences for breaking immigration laws. DHS stated that those who self-deport using the CBP Home app can have their fines waived.</p>
