          <p>The Crown Prosecution Service has determined that a police officer involved in a pursuit leading to the deaths of two teenagers on e-bikes in Cardiff will not face criminal charges. The investigation concluded there was insufficient evidence to establish a realistic prospect of conviction, bringing closure to a case that sparked community concern and debate over police tactics. The incident raised questions about the appropriateness of police intervention in such situations and the potential risks associated with e-bike use by young people. The CPS's decision reflects a careful assessment of the available evidence and legal standards for criminal prosecution.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to impose large tariffs on all foreign imports has increased the risk of the U.S. slipping into stagflation, characterized by stagnant growth, rising inflation, and elevated unemployment. The tariffs function as taxes on imported goods, choking off access to affordable goods and materials from overseas and increasing inflation. At the same time, the tariffs are likely to slow growth and increase unemployment as businesses hold off on new investments and consumers have less disposable income. While economists differ on whether the trade war will lead to a recession or prolonged stagflation, the consequences of Trump's tariffs are difficult to anticipate.</p>

          <p>The article argues that Corporate America is unlikely to effectively resist President Trump's newly announced tariffs due to the disunity and weakness of its coordinating institutions. Despite concerns that the tariffs will raise prices and eliminate jobs, the business lobby is not expected to mount a unified front against the Republican party. The pursuit of individual self-interests and the lack of a strong, representative organization for big business hinder the ability to challenge the tariffs effectively.

          <p>In response to tariffs imposed by the US, the UK government is easing electric vehicle (EV) sales targets to support the car industry. While the ban on new petrol and diesel cars remains in effect for 2030, manufacturers will have greater flexibility in meeting annual targets and face reduced fines. The government hopes these changes will help the car industry cope with the tariffs. The US is a major export market for the UK motor industry, and the new tariffs are expected to have a significant impact.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields dropped as President Donald Trump's tariffs spurred a flight to safety amid riskier markets. The 2-year Treasury yield hit its lowest level since September 2022. Investors are reacting to the impact of Trump's tariffs, which have stoked fears of a global trade war. China has already retaliated with tariffs on U.S. goods, and the EU has vowed to impose countermeasures if negotiations fail. &#x3c;br&#x3e;&#x3c;i&#x3e;(not investment advice)&#x3c;/i&#x3e;</p>

          <p>Kevin Bacon revealed his post-"Footloose" desire to retreat to a rural farm, a dream that clashed with his wife Kyra Sedgwick's urban sensibilities. Sedgwick, a New Yorker, longed for city life and did not want to raise their children in isolation, leading to a major disagreement. Bacon initially wanted to live a solitary life, but Sedgwick pushed for a move to Manhattan, which Bacon now acknowledges was the right decision for their family. Despite their Hollywood success, they shielded their children from the spotlight, prioritizing a normal upbringing.</p>

          <p>Research published in the journal Cancer indicates that colon cancer survivors who exercise regularly live longer, potentially even longer than people who've never had colon cancer. Regular physical activity can have a meaningful impact on a patient's long-term prognosis. Patients who saw benefits were exercising the equivalent of walking about an hour a day at a 2-to-3 mile per hour pace about six days a week. Experts recommend getting 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity each week to reduce the risk of cancer.</p>
