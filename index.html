          <p>Researchers in Uganda have documented wild chimpanzees utilizing medicinal plants in various ways to treat injuries and maintain hygiene. The observations, which include chimps dabbing plants on wounds and applying chewed plant material to open injuries, build on previous discoveries of chimpanzees self-medicating with specific plants. The study also noted instances of chimpanzees tending to the wounds of unrelated individuals, suggesting empathy. Scientists have identified antibacterial properties in some of the plants used by the chimps, furthering the understanding of primate self-medication and social behavior.</p>

          <p>Family offices are experiencing rapid growth as the ultra-rich seek personalized wealth management services; however, these offices face a significant challenge in finding qualified money managers. The demand for skilled professionals is high, with family offices competing against banks, private equity firms, and hedge funds for top talent. Trust is a key criterion for family offices when hiring, often outweighing other qualifications, and families are willing to pay a premium to secure trusted individuals. Young employees are sometimes reluctant to work for family offices due to a lack of clear corporate structure and undefined career progression.</p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines highlight the release of Peter Sullivan, who was exonerated after serving 38 years for a murder he did not commit, with DNA evidence leading to his conviction being quashed. Several papers also focus on promising research into new weight-loss drugs, specifically GLP-1 agonists, which have shown to halve deaths from strokes and heart attacks in trials. Counter-terrorism police are investigating a blaze at the prime minister's London home, and authorities are urging concerned MPs to contact the police. The Daily Mirror highlighted the case of Peter Sullivan, after his conviction for the murder of Diane Sindall in 1986 was dramatically quashed.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced the lifting of sanctions on Syria ahead of a planned meeting with its interim leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, in Saudi Arabia. The decision to lift sanctions, which had blocked foreign financing and aid, was celebrated in Damascus as a "pivotal turning point." Al-Sharaa has called for the delisting of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) as a terrorist organization and has promised to protect ethnic minorities. However, concerns remain due to recent mass killings of civilians from the Alawite sect and clashes between Islamist factions and religious minorities.</p>

          <p>Iran has proposed the creation of a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington‚Äôs demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. The proposal, presented by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi to American special envoy Steve Witkoff, suggests Iran would enrich uranium to a low grade and then ship it to other Arab countries for civilian use. Unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, this joint venture would be permanent, allowing for greater oversight with representatives from other countries. President Trump has expressed a desire to make a deal with Iran to improve regional safety, but warned that time is limited.</p>

          <p>Even as the United States and China take steps to reduce trade war tensions, Beijing is preparing for continued broader rivalry with Washington, which means China's pursuit of economic and diplomatic opportunities across Asia is unlikely to soften its tough line on regional territorial claims and military competition. While a tariff truce may open the way for talks between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping, Beijing remains wary of U.S. intentions and is preparing for potential flare-ups in tensions. China aims to present itself as a stable and trustworthy alternative to the U.S. while simultaneously asserting its regional power and ambitions, particularly in the South China Sea and regarding Taiwan.</p>

Prosecutors plan to call witnesses to testify about Read's state of mind and intent leading up to O'Keefe's death, arguing that the Aruba incident reveals a pattern of hostility and unwillingness to accept the victim's desire to end their relationship.</p>

Despite concerns about Biden's cognitive abilities, Buttigieg defended his former boss, stating that he was always responsive and effective during their time working together, particularly during the Baltimore bridge collapse. Buttigieg emphasized the need for the Democratic party to adapt and meet people where they are, rather than reverting to the status quo.</p>

Republicans and Democrats clashed over the proposed changes, with Democrats accusing Republicans of taking health care away from vulnerable people. The bill includes a $2.5 trillion tax proposal, extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts and rolling back clean energy subsidies. The proposed Medicaid cuts have become a flashpoint, with Democrats warning of significant coverage losses and Republicans arguing for cost control through targeting waste and fraud.</p>
