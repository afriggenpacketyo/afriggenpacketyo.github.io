        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has confirmed the death of an infant from whooping cough, marking the first such fatality in the UK for 2025. The baby's mother was not vaccinated against the infection during pregnancy, a key measure recommended to protect newborns. This tragic event highlights growing concerns among health officials about declining vaccine uptake for childhood diseases, with none of the main vaccines reaching the 95% target needed for herd immunity last year. Officials are urging pregnant women and parents of young children to adhere to vaccination schedules to prevent further severe cases.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order to prevent the Trump administration from deporting a group of unaccompanied Guatemalan minors. Lawyers for the children, aged 10 to 17, argued that the administration was attempting to repatriate them without due process, violating laws that grant them the right to challenge their removal in court. The legal action was filed amid reports that immigration officials were preparing the children for immediate removal following a request from the Guatemalan government. The case raises significant concerns about the legal protections afforded to vulnerable migrant children in U.S. custody.</p>

          <p>Iran-backed Houthi forces have raided the offices of the World Food Program and UNICEF in Sanaa, Yemen, detaining at least one UN employee with others reported missing. The raids occurred shortly after an Israeli strike killed the Houthi prime minister and several cabinet members, leading to heightened security and tensions in the rebel-controlled capital. This action is part of a broader Houthi crackdown on international organizations operating in their territory. The UN has condemned the arbitrary detention of humanitarian staff, which complicates aid efforts in the war-torn country.</p>

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore addressed his ongoing feud with President Donald Trump regarding crime in Baltimore, stating his focus is on "fighting for my communities," not with the president. Trump recently called the city a "hellhole" and threatened to send in the National Guard, an offer Moore described as "performative." While acknowledging that Baltimore still faces challenges, Moore highlighted recent progress in reducing crime and criticized the president's "arrogant criticism and cynicism." The governor emphasized that a serious approach would involve increased federal funding for local law enforcement, not deploying military personnel untrained for municipal policing.</p>

          <p>European Union foreign ministers are considering several new measures to bolster support for Ukraine as Russia's aggression continues. Key proposals discussed include imposing secondary sanctions on Russia's trading partners and establishing "safe haven" production sites for Ukrainian arms on EU soil. Additionally, there is a renewed debate on seizing frozen Russian central bank assets, rather than just the interest, to fund Ukraine's defense and reconstruction.

          <p>Dr. Céline Gounder, a CBS News medical contributor, has raised alarms about the recent ouster of the CDC director and other top officials, warning of a "leadership vacuum" that could impact public health. She stated that crucial vaccine policy is now being driven by "political fiat" rather than a transparent scientific process, causing confusion for both the public and medical providers. Dr. Gounder expressed concern that upcoming advisory meetings may lead to unprecedented rollbacks of long-standing childhood vaccine recommendations and tighter eligibility for COVID-19 shots. These changes, she argues, invert the principle of radical transparency and could undermine public trust in health institutions.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys Hall of Famer Michael Irvin has strongly condemned the team's decision to trade star pass rusher Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers. Irvin described the move, which sent Parsons to Green Bay for two first-round picks and defensive lineman Kenny Clark, as a "crazy, dumb move." The trade concluded a period of tense contract negotiations between Parsons and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. Irvin speculated that something must have personally hurt Jones to provoke such a significant and, in his view, detrimental decision for the team's future.</p>

          <p>The UK has secured its largest-ever warship export deal by value, a £10 billion agreement to supply Norway with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The deal is expected to support 4,000 UK jobs, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow, and strengthen NATO's northern flank by creating a combined UK-Norwegian fleet of 13 anti-submarine frigates. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer praised the agreement as a driver for growth and national security.

          <p>In response to widespread anti-government protests, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto announced that political parties have agreed to scale back some state-funded perks for politicians. The demonstrations, which have turned violent in several cities, were partly fueled by public anger over a new monthly allowance for lawmakers that is nearly ten times the minimum wage in Jakarta. The president stated that certain allowances would be curtailed and a moratorium on overseas trips would be imposed. However, protest leaders have indicated these concessions may not be sufficient to end the unrest, demanding action on deeper issues like wages and corruption.</p>

          <p>A major kelp restoration project off the coast of Southern California has successfully revived a vital marine ecosystem that had declined by 80%. Led by the Bay Foundation, the effort involved divers manually smashing nearly 6 million voracious purple sea urchins, whose populations had exploded and created "urchin barrens" on the seafloor. This culling allowed the giant Pacific kelp, known as the "sequoias of the sea," to regrow rapidly, restoring critical habitat for over 800 species and enhancing carbon storage. The project is now being viewed as a potential model for restoring other struggling kelp forests around the world.</p>

          <p>Peter Navarro, a trade adviser to President Donald Trump, sharply criticized a recent appeals court decision that found most of the administration's sweeping tariffs to be illegal. Calling the ruling "weaponized partisan injustice," Navarro warned that if the decision is upheld by the Supreme Court, "it will be the end of the United States." The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that Trump overstepped his authority by using emergency economic powers to justify the tariffs. The administration has been given until October 14 to appeal, setting the stage for a major legal battle over a central component of its economic policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to sign an executive order that would require voter identification for all federal elections. The move, which is expected to face immediate and significant legal challenges, is based on the president's unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud. Election laws are constitutionally set by state legislatures, and previous attempts by the administration to alter election rules through executive action have been blocked by courts as unconstitutional.

The activist group Futuro Vegetal claimed responsibility, stating the protest was to highlight government inaction on the devastating forest fires that have ravaged Spain this summer. The group alleges a link between the fires and the country's livestock farming industry. This act is the latest in a series of disruptive demonstrations by the group, which has previously targeted famous artworks and private property to draw attention to what it calls a "climate emergency."</p>

          <p>Following a 14-7 season-opening loss to Ohio State, Texas quarterback Arch Manning took responsibility for his performance, calling it "ultimately not good enough." Manning, the highly anticipated nephew of NFL legends Peyton and Eli Manning, completed 17 of 30 passes for 170 yards with one touchdown and one interception in his debut as the full-time starter. Head coach Steve Sarkisian defended his young quarterback, stating that the external expectations placed upon him were "out of control." Sarkisian urged patience, asking critics to "finish the book before we judge it" and emphasizing that it was only the first chapter of a long season.</p>

          <p>An in-depth investigation reveals the growing crisis of indoor heat deaths in Arizona, disproportionately affecting the elderly, sick, and low-income residents. The article highlights cases where individuals died in their homes after their air conditioning failed and they could not afford repairs, sometimes within days of the malfunction. Energy poverty is a key factor, with one in three American households struggling to pay utility bills, a situation expected to worsen. Experts warn that as climate change fuels more intense heatwaves, these preventable deaths could surge, particularly among vulnerable populations living in poorly insulated homes.</p>

          <p>A pet sitter in Llanharan, Wales, had a surprising experience when the pregnant Labrador she was watching went into labor a week earlier than expected. Rhian Boxall was looking after her brother's dog, Tilly, who was initially scanned as expecting about six puppies. Over a 15-hour period, Tilly gave birth to a massive litter of 14 pups, with 12 surviving, all while her owner was on holiday abroad. Boxall described the event as a "rollercoaster of emotions," which included having to save one puppy born outside in the garden with a hairdryer, following advice from an emergency vet.</p>
