          <h2>China Foregoes Aggressive De-Dollarization Amid US Trade Tensions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 06:45:09 EDT</div>

          <p>Despite the ongoing trade war with the United States, China has refrained from significantly reducing its reliance on the U.S. dollar, according to an Oxford Economics report. The report indicates that China's export-oriented economy necessitates substantial dollar assets, and the limited availability of alternative high-grade, liquid foreign assets constrains rapid diversification. Rather than selling U.S. Treasury holdings, China is more likely to weaken the yuan to support exporters amidst trade tensions, making a disruptive sale of U.S. assets improbable, as a weaker yuan allows exporters to buy more of the Chinese currency with US dollars earned from sales overseas.</p>

          <p>Sean 'Diddy' Combs is facing a trial in New York on charges including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution, with jury selection beginning this week. The rapper, who has also been known as Puffy, Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Love, and Brother Love, also faces numerous civil lawsuits accusing him of sexual assault, drugging, and intimidation. Combs has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges and denies the allegations in the civil suits, dismissing them as attempts to garner publicity. The trial is expected to last around eight weeks and will be open to the public but not streamed online.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted that restricting winter fuel payments negatively affected Labour's support in recent local elections, with voters expressing dissatisfaction during campaigning. Despite this, he maintained that the decision is crucial for investing in public services amid inherited crises. The winter fuel payment, introduced in 1997, provides a lump-sum to pensioners, but recent changes limit eligibility to those receiving pension credit, impacting around 9 million pensioners. Streeting defended the move as part of a broader package to raise investment in public services, acknowledging the party has 'got the message loud and clear' from voters.</p>

          <p>Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan has declared she will challenge the UK Labour government when its policies negatively impact Wales, prioritizing the nation's interests over party loyalty. Morgan criticized cuts to disability benefits and winter fuel allowance, urging a policy rethink and greater Welsh benefits from wind power revenues via the Crown Estate. She emphasized the need for the UK government to understand that what is right for Essex may not be right for Barry, referencing the BBC sitcom Gavin and Stacey. Morgan also called for changes to the Barnett formula to better reflect Wales' needs, and to stop cuts to disability benefits.</p>

          <p>More than 25 protesters were arrested at the University of Washington after occupying an academic building and demanding the school sever ties with Boeing. The group, Students United for Palestinian Equality and Return (SUPER UW), sought to end all donations from Boeing, remove Boeing executives from teaching positions, and rename the Interdisciplinary Engineering Building. The university stated that the protesters were covering their faces and stacking furniture near entryways, and those remaining in the building would face legal and student conduct actions.

          <p>Michigan football head coach Sherrone Moore is expected to be suspended for two games in the upcoming season due to allegations of non-cooperation in the NCAA's investigation into sign-stealing during Jim Harbaugh's tenure in 2023. The suspension is anticipated to affect the Wolverines' third and fourth games of the season, with the team also facing a self-imposed sanction that has yet to be announced. The NCAA's investigation centers on Connor Stalions, a former Michigan staffer accused of illicitly stealing signs from opponents, and Moore is accused of deleting text messages with Stalions.</p>

          <p>Germany's conservative leader, Friedrich Merz, unexpectedly failed to secure a majority in a parliament vote to become chancellor, receiving only 310 of the required 316 votes in the 630-seat Bundestag. This defeat is seen as a significant setback, as his coalition with the center-left holds enough seats but 18 MPs dissented, marking an unprecedented event in modern German history. The Bundestag has 14 days to elect Merz or another candidate by an absolute majority, with the far-right Alternative for Germany calling for fresh elections following Merz's failure. Despite the setback, Merz's team is hoping for a second vote by the end of the day.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is offering migrants in the U.S. illegally $1,000 and paid travel if they agree to leave the country voluntarily, in a program called "self-deportation." The scheme relies on the CBP Home app to confirm migrants' return to their home countries, and those who participate will not be prioritized for detention. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described self-deportation as the best, safest, and most cost-effective way to leave the U.S. to avoid arrest, with the possibility of a legal pathway to return in the future for those deemed "good people."</p>

          <p>While overall inflation remains above policymakers' target, consumers are experiencing price declines in specific sectors, including airfare, produce, household goods, electronics, and gasoline. Economists attribute these declines to various factors, such as lower diesel fuel costs affecting produce transportation and increased efficiency in consumer electronics production. However, experts caution that these lower prices may be temporary due to potential tariff increases and the volatility of certain categories. For example, television and smartphone prices have fallen due to technology improvements, while gasoline prices have decreased due to lower crude oil prices.</p>

The area has high dental needs, and the clinic is grappling with managing patient expectations and staff wellbeing.

          <p>Former Labour MP Mike Amesbury attributes Labour's recent election losses, including his former seat falling to Reform UK, to "big political mistakes" regarding benefit cuts. He pointed to the decision to axe winter fuel payments and make it harder to claim personal independence payments as key factors contributing to the party's poor performance. While acknowledging his own role in triggering a by-election due to his resignation after an assault conviction, Amesbury emphasized that overturning a 15,000-vote majority was not solely his responsibility, as Labour suffered losses across the country.</p>

          <p>An Anthropic co-founder has characterized DeepSeek's AI technology as "clever" but still lagging behind leading US companies by six to eight months, suggesting that the recent hype surrounding the Chinese start-up may be "overblown." Speaking at an industry event, Jack Clark acknowledged DeepSeek's progress but emphasized that its models do not pose a national security risk, and are limited by compute power. Clark's assessment contrasts with speculation about DeepSeek's upcoming model releases, following the open-sourcing of its specialized Prover-V2 model.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to offer a $5,000 "baby bonus" to encourage Americans to have more children is facing skepticism from experts who argue it won't address the underlying financial challenges that disincentivize family growth. Experts cite unaffordable healthcare, soaring housing costs, inaccessible childcare, and lack of federal parental leave mandates as significant barriers. While the bonus may provide some relief, it is unlikely to significantly impact birthrates without more substantial policy changes to support families, such as childcare subsidies and accessible healthcare.</p>

          <p>US consumers are increasingly pushing back against "tip-creep," as gratuities expand to self-checkouts, drive-throughs, and other unexpected venues, prompting a backlash against businesses relying on tips to subsidize wages. While some consumers have become more generous due to economic hardships, others are reducing their tipping habits, hoping to encourage employers to increase pay for staff. The ubiquity of electronic point-of-sale systems and companies pocketing tips has fueled the resentment, with some advocating for the abolition of subminimum wages and a greater emphasis on fair compensation for service workers.</p>

          <p>A shift in the labor market has led to a growing political divide between men and women, with young men increasingly supporting right-wing parties.
