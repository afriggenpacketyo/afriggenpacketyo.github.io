          <p>A biotech CEO is suing Uber after he was allegedly violently assaulted by a driver in Charleston, South Carolina. Surveillance footage captured the driver, a Russian national in the U.S. illegally, grabbing the CEO by the throat and headbutting him after a dispute over a service dog. The lawsuit claims Uber was negligent in its driver screening process, as the driver reportedly used a fake license to access the platform. The CEO suffered a severe concussion and has criticized Uber for deactivating his account and allegedly blaming him for the incident.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, is moving away from the North Carolina coast after bringing tropical storm conditions to the Outer Banks. While not expected to make landfall in the U.S., the storm has prompted storm surge warnings and evacuation orders in parts of the state. The National Hurricane Center is cautioning against swimming along most of the East Coast due to life-threatening surf and dangerous rip currents generated by the large storm system. The hurricane is forecast to weaken and become post-tropical by the weekend as it moves further into the Atlantic.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Alina Habba, a former personal lawyer for President Trump, is serving illegally as the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. The decision came after defendants in criminal cases challenged her appointment, arguing it violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. The judge stated Habba has been serving "without lawful authority" and must be disqualified from ongoing cases, though the ruling does not invalidate existing indictments. This development marks a significant turn in a weeks-long conflict between the Trump administration and the judiciary over the key prosecutor's office.</p>

          <p>California's state Assembly has passed a contentious measure to redraw the state's congressional maps, a plan championed by Governor Gavin Newsom to counter a similar Republican-led effort in Texas. The proposal, which now moves to the state Senate, aims to make five Republican-held U.S. House seats more favorable to Democrats ahead of the 2026 midterms. If approved, the new boundaries will be put to California voters in a special election. This move represents a direct partisan escalation in the national redistricting battle, with Democrats framing it as a necessary response to Republican gerrymandering.</p>

          <p>A significant increase in home utility bills is becoming a major concern for voters, potentially influencing upcoming elections. Residents in several East Coast states are experiencing sharp price hikes, with some blaming the grid operator PJM Interconnection for a lack of reliable and clean energy sources. The issue of affordability is central in New Jersey's gubernatorial race, where both candidates are addressing the rising costs. Analysts note that high energy prices can directly impact election outcomes, as they place a tangible financial strain on households and create political accountability for incumbent parties.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver a closely watched speech at the Jackson Hole economic symposium, where he will navigate a complex economic landscape and political pressure from President Trump. Investors and economists are looking for any signals regarding the Fed's next interest-rate decision in September, especially amid conflicting data showing a jobs slowdown but rising inflation. Powell is expected to maintain a data-dependent stance, balancing the central bank's dual mandate of maximizing employment and controlling inflation. The speech is critical as the Fed weighs its next move on monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With its fighting force diminished and leadership targeted, Hamas's core strategy is now focused on survival and ending the war in Gaza, according to political analysis. The group faces immense pressure from Israel's ongoing military campaign, as well as from Arab governments urging it to relinquish control and weapons. By accepting a recent ceasefire proposal, Hamas appears to be playing for time, hoping that sustained international pressure on Israel over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza will change the political dynamics. The group's main goal is to maintain its existence and hold onto its remaining bargaining chip: the Israeli hostages.</p>

Concurrently, Netanyahu stated that his cabinet has approved military plans for a major assault on Gaza City, what Israel considers a final Hamas stronghold.

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to personally patrol the streets of Washington, D.C., with police and National Guard members, framing the move as a response to a "crime emergency." This follows his mobilization of nearly 2,000 guardsmen to the capital, an action he described as a test model for deployment in other U.S. cities. The move has drawn sharp criticism from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who called it politically motivated and disconnected from the city's actual crime statistics, which show a decrease in violent crime.

However, the ruling upheld the underlying finding that Trump and other defendants committed fraud by inflating asset values to secure better financial terms.

          <h2>Analysis Argues Trump's 'America First' Policy is an Interventionist 'America Everywhere' in Europe</h2>

          <p>This article argues that the Trump administration's "America First" doctrine, contrary to being isolationist, is actively interventionist in European politics. The author contends that the administration seeks to enforce an "America Everywhere" policy by supporting nativist political parties that align with its ideology while criticizing those that do not. Citing historical context, the piece suggests that the post-WWII era of strong transatlantic unity may have been an exception, and the relationship is now reverting to a more transactional and competitive state. This shift is driven by a new class of American nationalists who prioritize ideological alignment over traditional alliances.</p>

          <h2>New Pharmaceutical Plant Highlights Challenges for Drugmakers Navigating Trump's Tariff Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 15:09:12 EDT</div>

          <p>A new $3 billion Fujifilm biologics plant in North Carolina illustrates the lengthy timeline required for drugmakers to expand U.S. manufacturing, a process that can take five or more years. This reality presents a significant challenge for the pharmaceutical industry as it faces pressure from President Trump to onshore production and navigate potential tariffs on imported medicines. While the administration recently clarified that drugs from the EU would face a 15% tariff, lower than some feared, the complexity of building and certifying new facilities means companies cannot quickly pivot their supply chains. The trend towards U.S. production was already underway due to tax policy changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. Navy sailor, Jinchao Wei, has been convicted of espionage for selling military secrets to a Chinese intelligence officer in exchange for about $12,000. While stationed on the U.S.S. Essex, Wei used his security clearance to send his handler photos, videos, and technical manuals related to the warship's weapons, operations, and vulnerabilities. Prosecutors stated that Wei was recruited over social media in what officials call "virtual espionage," a rising threat where foreign agents target U.S. military personnel online. Wei, who admitted his actions constituted espionage after his arrest, now faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.</p>

          <p>New signs are being installed along the historic Route 66 in the Texas Panhandle to guide travelers and boost tourism ahead of the highway's 100th anniversary in 2026. The project is a collaboration between the Old Route 66 Association of Texas, the state's Department of Transportation, and the Big Texan Steak Ranch, which is funding custom signs within local towns. Community leaders hope the improved signage will encourage drivers on Interstate 40 to exit and explore the small towns along the original "Mother Road." The initiative aims to restore visibility and pride in the region's cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>A hairstylist who filed a lawsuit accusing sports commentator Skip Bayless of unwanted sexual advances has requested a dismissal, signaling that a settlement with Bayless and Fox Sports is likely. The lawsuit alleged a pattern of harassment, including an offer of $1.5 million for sex, and also implicated other high-profile figures at the network. The court initially rebuffed the dismissal request because the suit included a class-action complaint regarding unfair labor practices at Fox. Legal experts suggest the case will likely be settled once the class-action component is resolved, though non-disclosure agreements may keep the details private.</p>

          <p>U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver is seeking to have a federal indictment against her dismissed, arguing that it omits crucial context regarding her alleged assault of federal agents at a Newark migrant jail. Her legal filings claim that the indictment exaggerates her actions during the attempted arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, which she says occurred after he had already complied with orders to leave the facility. McIver's team alleges that the order to arrest Baraka came from high-level Trump administration officials and that her actions were a defensive reaction in a chaotic scene instigated by the agents.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice is set to investigate Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook following a criminal referral from a Trump administration housing official who accused her of potential mortgage fraud. The referral, from FHFA Director Bill Pulte, alleges Cook claimed two different properties as her primary residence simultaneously. A DOJ attorney sent a letter urging Fed Chair Jerome Powell to fire Cook, though Powell lacks that authority. The move is seen by many as a politically motivated attack on the Federal Reserve, as President Trump has been highly critical of the central bank's policies.</p>

          <p>Several prominent news organizations, including Wired and Business Insider, have removed articles from their websites after discovering they were written by a fake freelance journalist whose work appears to have been generated by artificial intelligence. The articles, published under the byline "Margaux Blanchard," were taken down after an editor at another publication grew suspicious of a pitch and found that sources and locations in the writer's previous work could not be verified. This incident highlights the growing challenge of AI-generated misinformation and the need for more robust verification protocols in journalism to maintain editorial standards.</p>
