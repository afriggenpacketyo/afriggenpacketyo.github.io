          <p>This article examines the potential effects of secondary sanctions imposed by a second Trump administration on Russia's economy, which has shown surprising resilience despite existing Western sanctions. It highlights concerns about Russia's reliance on China and India for trade and energy exports, and the potential for these countries to be targeted by secondary sanctions. The article also discusses Russia's efforts to create alternative payment systems to circumvent Western financial controls. The article ultimately concludes that it is difficult to predict the depth of impact of new secondary sanctions under a second Trump administration on Russia's economic partners.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has reduced the benefit clawback rate from 100% to 50% for new overpayment notices affecting Title II benefits, but experts warn that this may still cause financial hardship for affected beneficiaries. The erroneous payments can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if a beneficiary fails to report a change in their circumstances to the agency or if the agency does not process information promptly or enters errors in its data. The article highlights that beneficiaries typically have 90 days to request a lower withholding rate or a waiver of recovery.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how Trump's policies could have a lasting negative impact on the U.S. economy. It notes that Trump's defunding of scientific research threatens to hinder innovation, while his discouragement of immigration could constrain long-term economic growth. A major concern is that Trump could permanently reduce the value of the dollar, which serves as the world's reserve currency. The article explains how Trump's erratic trade agenda has shaken global investors' confidence and led to talk of "de-dollarization."</p>

          <p>British police arrested seven Iranian men in what the government called the biggest "counter-state threat and counterterrorism" operations in recent years. Four of the men were arrested on suspicion of preparing a terrorist act, while three others were arrested for a national security offense. The UK's domestic intelligence service, MI5, has warned of a growing threat from attackers linked to Tehran. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that the investigation is immensely important to determine if the arrests were connected to the Iranian state.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that he will impose 100% tariffs on movies made in foreign countries. He said he was authorising the US Department of Commerce and Trade Representative to start the process to impose the levy because America's movie industry was dying "a very fast death". He blamed a "concerted effort" by other countries that offer incentives to attract filmmakers and studios, which he described as a "National Security threat". The details of the move are unclear.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes Israel's plan to add tens of thousands of reserve soldiers to the battlefield in Gaza. The article questions whether a larger military presence will achieve Israel's goals of destroying Hamas and releasing all hostages, or merely intensify the conflict. It mentions that Israel has halted all humanitarian aid into Gaza since mid-March, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that Trump's tariffs are not solely based on economic theory but reflect a broader political vision of "protectionism." It suggests that Trump is signaling a desire to protect a way of life, even if it hurts others, by creating good-paying factory jobs. The article explores the "spirit of capitalism" and how it has evolved over time, arguing that Trump's tariffs represent a new, but flawed, spirit. The author advocates for a democratizing spirit that prioritizes collective well-being over protecting some at the expense of others.</p>
