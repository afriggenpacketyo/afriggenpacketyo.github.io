          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced the government's intention to make electric vehicles (EVs) more affordable for consumers to encourage a broader transition away from petrol cars. While details are forthcoming, reports suggest this could involve substantial grants to reduce the high upfront cost of EVs. This initiative is part of a larger strategy that includes a £63 million investment in charging infrastructure, aiming to meet the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales.

          <p>A funeral was held for Saifullah Kamel Musallet, a 20-year-old Palestinian-American from Florida who was killed in the occupied West Bank. According to his family, he was shot during a confrontation with Israeli settlers while protecting his family's land. His family is demanding an independent investigation by the U.S. State Department. The incident highlights the escalating violence in the region as indirect ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas continue to stall over key disagreements.</p>

          <p>A 54-pound meteorite, confirmed to be the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth, is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's with an estimated price of up to $4 million. The rock is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before landing in the Sahara desert, where it was discovered in 2023. Representing nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet, its authenticity was confirmed through analysis comparing its composition to data from the 1976 Viking Mars lander.</p>

Both tragedies occurred as Scotland experienced its hottest day in two years, with temperatures reaching 32.2C in Aviemore. Authorities have confirmed that neither of the deaths is being treated as suspicious. The extreme heat prompted warnings for people to take extra care while enjoying the outdoors.</p>

          <p>Researchers conducting a sonar survey of Wisconsin's Fox River have accidentally discovered a previously unknown shipwreck from the 19th century. The team, from the Wisconsin Historical Society, was mapping other known cultural sites when they found the 90-foot-long hull of a wooden paddle wheel steamer. Evidence suggests it is the L.W. Crane, a vessel that caught fire and sank in 1880. The discovery highlights the potential for unexpected historical finds, even in well-traveled waterways.</p>

Since methanol can be synthesized from carbon dioxide, this breakthrough presents a potential pathway to turn captured CO2 into food. This method, which uses enzymes instead of traditional agriculture, could help address global food security and environmental challenges.

Japan's defense ministry accused a Chinese fighter-bomber of making "unusual approaches" toward one of its reconnaissance planes, warning such actions could lead to accidental collisions. In response, China's defense ministry accused Japanese aircraft of repeatedly entering its air defense identification zone, calling its own actions "legitimate, reasonable, professional and standard."</p>

Because jellyfish have no central nervous system or pain receptors, they are ideal candidates for this augmentation. The goal is to deploy swarms of these biohybrid robots to collect oceanic data far more cheaply and widely than is possible with conventional submersibles.</p>
