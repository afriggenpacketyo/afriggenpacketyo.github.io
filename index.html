          <p>In Chatham, Illinois, a vehicle struck an after-school program, resulting in the deaths of four children aged 4 to 18 and injuring six others. The vehicle hit multiple people outside the building before crashing through it, hitting more inside, and exiting through the opposite wall. Authorities are investigating the cause of the crash, with the driver, who was uninjured, undergoing evaluation at a local hospital.

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party has won the federal election, according to projections, despite declining popularity and threats from U.S. President Trump to annex Canada and impose tariffs. The election was heavily influenced by Trump's policies, along with domestic issues like affordability and immigration. Liberal Leader Mark Carney emphasized the need for a strong mandate to counter Trump's influence, while Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre urged Trump to stay out of Canadian elections. Voters expressed concerns about Canada's sovereignty and the impact of tariffs on the economy.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has dismissed criticism from anonymous members within her party, labeling them as "cowards" as the party anticipates potential losses in upcoming local elections. An anonymous article in the Critic magazine called for her replacement, but Badenoch stated she is not concerned about criticism from those unwilling to attach their names to it. She also rejected claims of a rift between her and shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick regarding an electoral pact with Reform UK. Badenoch's strong rebuke underscores the internal tensions within the Conservative Party.</p>

          <p>Walmart and other major U.S. retailers have reportedly instructed some Chinese suppliers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to resume shipments to the United States, indicating a potential shift in trade dynamics. This directive comes after a period of slowed shipments due to escalating tariff tensions between the U.S. and China. The costs of the new import duties will be borne by the U.S. clients, according to one supplier. This development suggests that retailers are adapting to the trade war environment.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "border czar" Tom Homan asserted that Kilmar Abrego Garcia's deportation to El Salvador was not an error, despite a previous withholding order protecting him from removal. Homan claimed that the facts surrounding the withholding order had changed, alleging that Abrego Garcia is now a terrorist and the gang he feared no longer exists. Abrego Garcia's attorneys deny any gang affiliation and note his lack of a criminal record. The Salvadoran President has stated he will not send Abrego Garcia back to the U.S., and a federal judge has set a deadline for the Trump administration to respond to inquiries about his case.</p>

          <p>A Chinese political scientist has cautioned Southeast Asian nations (ASEAN) to carefully consider the potential risks of aligning too closely with the United States in the ongoing trade war with China. Zheng Yongnian, dean at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, suggested that ASEAN member states could face isolation from China and stalled growth if they prioritize economic and trade relations with the US over China. He argued that the US's re-industrialization efforts are primarily aimed at bringing manufacturing back to America, whereas China is better positioned to assist ASEAN in achieving its industrialization goals.</p>

Police declared the gathering an unlawful assembly, condemning the violence and vandalism.

The strike will impact nearly all county departments, with libraries and some healthcare clinics closing, though hospitals will remain open.

          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying its immigration crackdown by targeting unaccompanied minors for deportation, conducting "welfare checks" on children who arrived in the U.S. alone, often across the U.S.-Mexican border. These actions have sparked concerns about a crackdown and potential "backdoor family separation." Additionally, the president has signed executive orders targeting "sanctuary cities" that obstruct federal immigration laws. These measures reflect a broader effort to tighten immigration enforcement and prioritize deportation, raising questions about the treatment of vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated investigations into Harvard University and the Harvard Law Review following reports that the journal was selecting articles based on authors' race rather than merit. The investigations, conducted by the Department of Education and the Department of Health & Human Services, are in response to alleged violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits race-based discrimination by recipients of federal funding. Harvard Law School has stated its commitment to ensuring compliance with applicable laws and investigating credible allegations, while emphasizing the Law Review's legal independence.</p>

          <p>A teenager has been charged after the office of Australian opposition leader Peter Dutton was vandalized for the third time during the election campaign. The office was splattered with red paint and covered with posters criticizing Dutton's stance on various issues. Police arrested an 18-year-old woman, who was charged with causing willful damage. The incident occurred as Australians prepare to vote in an election, and Dutton has recently faced controversy for his comments about ceremonial Aboriginal rites.</p>

          <p>As the US-China trade war escalates, China is leveraging President Trump's tariffs as an opportunity to reduce dependence on the US market and build a large consumer market. Weak domestic demand has been a major drag on China's economic growth, prompting Beijing to implement countercyclical policies to boost consumption. China has a robust toolbox, including fiscal and monetary policies, with a 10 trillion yuan debt swap plan to help local governments deal with hidden debt and reduce interest rates. The country aims to achieve 5% growth despite the trade war.</p>

          <p>President Trump has decided to grant automakers some relief from tariffs, marking a shift from his previous stance on trade policies. The announcement, expected on Tuesday, precedes a Michigan rally celebrating Trump's first 100 days in office. The move aims to prevent the stacking of different types of tariffs on imported foreign cars. Importers of foreign auto parts will be eligible for government reimbursement of tariffs for the next two years. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that this measure would reward domestic manufacturers while providing runway to those needing time to invest in domestic plants.</p>

          <p>Communities along the Mississippi River south of New Orleans are grappling with the growing threat of saltwater intrusion, which is moving upstream from the Gulf of Mexico. The intrusion has compromised drinking water, decimated the local seafood industry, and raised concerns about the future of New Orleans' water supply. Plaquemines Parish has been particularly affected, with its freshwater supply compromised and infrastructure damaged. Researchers attribute the increasing frequency and severity of saltwater intrusion to drought, sea level rise, severe storms, and dredging.</p>

He warned that imposing high retaliatory tariffs permanently would be disastrous for states like Texas and the country as a whole. Cruz emphasized that choosing the path of negotiation would be a historic victory for American jobs and workers.</p>
