          <p>Despite uncertainties surrounding U.S. support, Europe is expressing growing optimism about its ability to defend Ukraine. European nations possess the financial resources and artillery shells necessary for sustained defense efforts. However, replacing key U.S. capabilities such as operational intelligence and air defense systems remains a significant challenge. This shift in European confidence underscores a proactive stance in regional security, yet it also highlights the critical role of transatlantic cooperation. The evolving dynamics reflect Europe's determination to bolster its defense capabilities in an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns about potential disruptions under Donald Trump's administration, a strong federal government remains essential for addressing societal challenges. The article argues that the issue with Trump's presidency is not the government's size but rather the lack of adequate oversight. Reducing governmental power would not necessarily protect citizens and could even consolidate power in undesirable ways. The author contends that a robust government is necessary for providing a social safety net, funding essential services, and regulating commerce. This perspective emphasizes the importance of checks and balances to constrain government overreach, making oversight, not shrinking government, the key to safeguarding democracy.</p>

          <p>Authorities arrested Daniel Park at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City in connection with the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing. Park, a U.S. citizen, was apprehended in Poland and is suspected of providing material support to the bomber, Guy Bartkus, who died in the blast. The bombing, which injured four others, was deemed an act of terrorism by the FBI. Bartkus, who stated he was against bringing people into the world against their will, allegedly acted alone at the site, though investigators are examining his online communications to determine if others assisted him in acquiring bomb components. The investigation continues to uncover the full extent of Park's involvement and the motivations behind the attack.</p>

          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that President Donald Trump's proposed tax bill would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The bill, which was passed by House Republicans, is projected to decrease federal revenues by $3.7 trillion while lowering spending by $1.3 trillion. The legislation is expected to undergo further revisions in the Senate, where it is facing opposition from deficit hawks concerned about escalating deficits. Republican senators, along with Elon Musk, have voiced strong criticism of the bill, increasing pressure on GOP lawmakers to reconsider its financial implications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The average 401(k) savings rate, including both employee and company contributions, reached a record high of 14.3% in the first quarter of 2025, according to Fidelity's analysis. Employees deferred 9.5% into 401(k) plans, while companies contributed 4.8%. A significant portion of the increased employee deferrals came from auto-escalations, which automatically raise savings rates over time.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the unsealing of several documents in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant deported to El Salvador. The order, responding to a media coalition request, found that the public has a right to access court records, which outweighs the Justice Department's concerns about national security and discovery materials. The Justice Department had opposed the request, citing typical restrictions on discovery materials and the need to protect national security. The Trump administration has acknowledged that Abrego Garcia's deportation was a mistake, as he had been granted legal status preventing his removal to El Salvador due to potential persecution by local gangs. The Trump administration is seeking to dismiss Abrego Garcia's case.</p>

The change reflects concerns about the country's falling fertility rate and the need to maintain a sufficient working-age population.
