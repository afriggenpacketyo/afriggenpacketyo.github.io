          <p>Strawberry growers in the UK are anticipating a particularly sweet season in 2025, thanks to warm days and cooler nights, which enhance the fruit's natural sugars. Marion Regan, a Kent-based farmer with over 50 years of experience, notes the strawberries are of good size and exceptional sweetness. While the current spring is the driest in over a century, growers have irrigation systems to mitigate potential drought effects, ensuring a steady water supply. Experts suggest pairing strawberries with black pepper, balsamic vinegar, or chilli to balance their flavors, offering adventurous alternatives to the classic cream pairing.</p>

          <p>Actor Christian Bale is dedicated to building Together California, a foster care home designed to keep orphaned siblings together, addressing the issue that up to 75% of siblings are separated in the foster care system. Bale emphasizes the importance of societal responsibility in caring for children and was inspired by imagining his own daughter without parents. He recruited Tim McCormick, a foster care veteran, to help create a village in Los Angeles where siblings can live together in individual houses with trained foster parents. The project broke ground in February 2024 and hopes to welcome its first children early next year.</p>

          <p>Hawaiian lei making, an ancient tradition of crafting garlands from flowers, is facing challenges due to suburban sprawl and climate change. Native Hawaiian Meleana Estes, who learned the art from her grandmother, emphasizes that a lei is an "expression of aloha." With flower farms disappearing and land overheating, most flowers are now imported. Andrew Mau, who owns ISLAND-BOY, adapts by using alternative materials like wood beads and seeds to create "forever leis."
