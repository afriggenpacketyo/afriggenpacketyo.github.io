            <p>The stock market was closed on April 18th for Good Friday, with both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq pausing operations. This break followed a volatile week influenced by UnitedHealth's profit forecast and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's inflation warnings related to tariffs. Trading resumed on Monday, April 21st, with regular hours. Most major banks remained open on Good Friday, as the Federal Reserve does not recognize the Christian holy day as a federal holiday.

Ábrego García, who came to the US illegally in 2011, was granted protection from deportation due to potential persecution in El Salvador. Despite the government acknowledging the deportation as an "administrative error" and a court order for his return, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has refused to allow him back into the US. The government alleges gang ties, but the judge says there is no criminal record for Ábrego García.</p>

            <p>Authorities have identified a suspect in the 1972 murder of Phyllis Bailer, an Indiana woman found dead with her three-year-old daughter unharmed nearby. Advancements in DNA technology led investigators to Fred Allen Lienemann, who would have been 25 at the time of the murder and had a prior criminal history. Lienemann was a match for DNA found on Bailer's clothes, though the two had no known connection. Lienemann was murdered in Detroit in 1985, and the case would have been prosecuted by the Allen County Prosecutor's Office if he were alive today.</p>

            <p>Saving money in an economy with persistent inflation can be challenging, but certificates of deposit (CDs) can help. Top CD rates offer higher returns than the current inflation rate, and rates can be locked in for the term of the CD. Online banks often have the most competitive rates due to lower overhead costs. Short-term CDs can be a good option, and laddering CDs can help take advantage of high rates while saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The price of gold is currently $3,331.77 per ounce, but gold prices are subject to constant fluctuations due to various factors. These factors include supply and demand, economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty, currency movements, and market sentiment. Gold is often viewed as a safe-haven asset and inflation hedge, making it a popular investment option during times of economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Apple's smartphone shipments in China experienced a decline in the first quarter of 2025, while the overall domestic market grew. This decline occurred ahead of President Trump's new tariff regime. The Chinese government implemented a subsidy scheme to boost domestic smartphone sales.

            <p>Despite soaring costs, new research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York suggests college is still a worthwhile investment for most graduates. The total cost of a college degree is around $180,000 in 2024, but the typical graduate can expect a median 12.5% return on their investment. Researchers considered out-of-pocket costs, earnings outcomes, and potential earnings without a degree to estimate the return on investment.</p>

            <p>The IRS is considering revoking Harvard University’s tax-exempt status, with a decision expected soon, according to sources. This comes after the White House froze $2.2 billion in grants due to Harvard's refusal to comply with demands from the Trump administration. The demands include ending diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, adopting merit-based admissions, and cooperating with immigration authorities. The administration argues that the school has "failed to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment."</p>

            <p>Canadian small businesses are responding to U.S. tariffs with a focus on promoting Canadian-made products. President Trump's tariffs have led to some long-standing relationships between U.S. and Canadian small businesses becoming strained. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business reports that over half of its members believe the U.S. is not a reliable trading partner. Some businesses are renaming menu items and highlighting Canadian patriotism in response to the tariffs.</p>

            <p>Chris Krebs, former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), resigned from his job at a cybersecurity firm after being targeted by an executive order from President Trump. The executive order called Krebs a "significant bad-faith actor" and directed the attorney general to review his actions. Krebs has maintained that the 2020 election was safe and secure, which contradicted Trump's false claims of election fraud and led to his firing in late 2020.</p>

            <p>The largest ever study investigating medical cannabis as a treatment for cancer, published this week in Frontiers in Oncology, found overwhelming scientific support for cannabis’s potential to treat cancer symptoms and potentially fight the course of the disease itself. The study overwhelmingly supported cannabis as a treatment for cancer-related inflammation, appetite loss and nausea. Perhaps more surprisingly, it also showed that cannabis has the potential to fight cancer cells themselves, by killing them and stopping their spread.</p>
