          <p>Seven & i Holdings Co., the Japanese operator of the Seven-Eleven convenience store chain, has appointed Stephen Hayes Dacus as its first foreign CEO. This decision comes as the retail giant aims to enhance corporate value amidst a takeover bid by Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc., the operator of Circle K convenience stores. Dacus stated his goal to achieve faster growth in the next decade by focusing on the convenience store business, which has experienced slowing growth in Japan and the United States. The company is currently examining both the buyout offer and the option of remaining independent, while also implementing restructuring plans such as selling its supermarket business and considering a U.S. listing for its U.S. 7-Eleven business unit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Italian filmmaker Silvio Soldini's film "The Tasters" is a fictionalized account inspired by Margot Wölk's experiences as one of Hitler's food tasters during World War II. The film, based on Rosella Postorino's novel "At the Wolf's Table," portrays the tension and terror experienced by the women who were forced to taste Hitler's meals to ensure they were not poisoned. While the film is inspired by Wölk's testimony, some historians question the historical accuracy of her claims, citing Hitler's specific dietary needs during the later years of the war. Soldini maintains that the film is based on the novel and aims to highlight the parallels between the tasters' experiences and today's political violence.</p>

          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" reveals that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were fake, more than double the number detected in 2022. This increase is attributed to both a rise in submissions and more aggressive policies against incentivized reviews. Tripadvisor uses a three-pronged process involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and moderate fake reviews. The company's system increasingly relies on how a review is posted rather than what it says, utilizing AI and behavioral biometrics to detect abnormalities.</p>
