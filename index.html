            <p>Amidst global trade uncertainty caused by President Trump's tariff policies, questions arise about the defense of rules-based multilateralism. The chaos surrounding Trump's trade-related actions has led to business stagnation, particularly affecting international buyers at trade expos like the Canton Fair. Many are waiting for stability before engaging in trade, causing harm to the global economy. While some hope the US legal system will check the president, the world cannot afford to wait indefinitely as uncertainty continues to negatively impact international trade.

Their defense team is highlighting their post-conviction conduct, including obtaining a college degree and leading prison self-help programs, arguing they are no longer a threat to the public. The defense is also pushing back against the prosecution's use of graphic crime scene photos, arguing they traumatized a family member.

            <p>A coroner's inquest into the deaths of four people killed by drivers with impaired vision has revealed critical flaws in the UK's driver eyesight regulations.

The families of the victims expressed their devastation and called for stricter enforcement to prevent future tragedies. The Department for Transport stated it would consider the coroner's report and emphasized the importance of regular eye tests and self-reporting of vision problems.</p>

            <p>Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has vowed to veto all bills amid a dispute with the Republican-controlled Legislature over funding for the state's Division of Developmental Disabilities. Hobbs is demanding a bipartisan compromise to guarantee funding for the agency, which supports nearly 60,000 people with disabilities. Republicans are seeking to establish guardrails for the program before approving funding, while Democrats want to approve funding first and discuss reforms later. The governor's spokesperson stated that Hobbs is willing to veto even legislation she supports until a compromise is reached.</p>

            <p>New research suggests that the domestication of brown rats may have occurred in China during the Ming dynasty, and these domesticated rats could have spread globally via the treasure ship fleets of explorer Zheng He. Artwork from the period depicts domesticated brown rats with coat color variations. This discovery provides the earliest evidence of brown rat domestication, predating known records in Japan by over two centuries. The expeditions of Zheng He, involving thousands of men and hundreds of ships, may have facilitated the spread of these rats worldwide.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from accessing sensitive Social Security records, citing concerns about privacy. The judge stated that granting DOGE unlimited access to personal information, including medical and financial records, would betray the government's commitment to citizens' privacy. The order prohibits DOGE from accessing personally identifiable information and installing software on Social Security Administration computer systems. The judge's decision extends a previous temporary block and allows the Trump administration to appeal.</p>
