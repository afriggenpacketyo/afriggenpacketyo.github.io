          <p>SpaceX successfully launched the Axiom-4 (Ax-4) mission, sending a four-person crew to the International Space Station (ISS). The crew includes retired NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, who is now with Axiom Space, as well as Shubhanshu Shukla of India, SÅ‚awosz UznaÅ„ski-WiÅ›niewski of Poland, and Tibor Kapu of Hungary, marking the return to human spaceflight for India, Poland, and Hungary after over four decades. The mission experienced delays due to weather and concerns about a leak in the ISS's Russian-controlled module. The crew will spend approximately two weeks on the ISS, conducting around 60 science experiments and engaging with students worldwide. The launch was made possible via the SpaceX Dragon capsule on a Falcon 9 rocket, with the crew planning to splash down off the coast of southern California upon their return. The Dragon is the only U.S. spacecraft certified by NASA to take astronauts to the space station.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An initial classified assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) suggests that recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have set back Tehran's nuclear program by several months. The strikes, which involved dropping 30,000-pound bombs on sites like Fordo, sealed off entrances to enrichment facilities. While some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was reportedly moved before the strikes, the DIA assessment indicates that the deep underground infrastructure at Fordo remains largely intact. The White House has disputed these findings, while other officials maintain that the strikes were devastating, but a classified briefing for Congress on the administration's actions in Iran was cancelled, to be replaced by individual briefings from intelligence and military officials. </p>

His proposals include free bus service, rent freezes, city-owned grocery stores, and universal childcare, aiming to address the city's cost-of-living crisis.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As summer brings record high temperatures, it's crucial to differentiate between heat exhaustion and heat stroke and know how to respond. Heat exhaustion, less severe than heat stroke, can lead to the more serious condition if not properly managed, with symptoms including headache, fatigue, nausea, and cool skin. Treatment involves moving to a cool place, drinking water, and applying cold cloths, while heat stroke is a life-threatening condition characterized by impaired consciousness, high body temperature, and potential organ damage. Immediate medical attention is necessary for heat stroke, involving cooling the body and providing fluids, with prevention strategies including avoiding excessive sun exposure, staying hydrated, and wearing appropriate clothing.</p>

Rutte emphasized that there is "absolute clarity" regarding the U.S.'s dedication to NATO and Article 5, which requires members to defend each other from attack. The summit is expected to endorse a higher defense spending goal of 5% of GDP, addressing concerns about European security in light of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p>

          <p>Tony Moon, a Los Angeles man who participated in the "rooftop Korean" movement during the 1992 Rodney King riots, asserts that today's riots are politically motivated and lack genuine grassroots support. Moon contrasts the organic nature of the unrest in 1992 with what he sees as a manufactured movement today, suggesting it is a continuation of the BLM/Antifa activities from 2020. He advocates for peaceful protest but condemns property damage and looting, advising Angelenos to arm themselves for self-defense. His comments come amidst recent riots in Los Angeles following ICE sweeps targeting criminal illegal immigrants, with the city's mayor blaming President Trump for the unrest.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Labour MPs are opposing the government's planned welfare changes, despite efforts from ministers to persuade them to back down. Over 130 MPs, including 122 Labour MPs, have signed an amendment to block the government's plan to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments. Cabinet ministers are reportedly calling Labour MPs to urge them to remove their names from the amendment, but only one MP has done so thus far. While Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer intends to "press ahead" with the welfare changes, some cabinet members are concerned about the sour mood on the issue and the potential for broader problems for the Labour leadership.</p>

Chinese Premier Li Qiang urged more trade for "reshaping" the world order, signaling China's deepening relationship with the Global South, as the U.S.'s tariff policies act as a wake-up call for the need to diversify markets.

Undocumented individuals have the right to a fair legal process, including due process, and the right to legal assistance, though not a government-appointed attorney. They can bring a friend or family member to immigration court, but must be wary of collateral arrests.

          <p>The UK government feared that victims of the Post Office scandal who had not yet sought compensation would feel "harassed" if officials chased them to apply, according to MPs. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) found that many wrongly-accused sub-postmasters were yet to receive "fair and timely" redress, despite the government having paid out over Â£1bn in compensation. The Department for Business and Trade (DBT) expressed concern that repeated letters would be perceived as harassment, though it agreed to consult the Horizon Compensation Advisory Board on sending follow-up letters. The long-running public inquiry into the scandal is set to publish its final report on July 8th.</p>

While the jets can also carry conventional weapons, their ability to be equipped with US-made nuclear bombs is a significant development. The decision, to be announced at the NATO summit in the Netherlands, has been met with both support and concern, with some questioning the UK's reliance on the US for the use of nuclear weapons. The purchase follows a Strategic Defence Review that confirmed new nuclear risks, with other states increasing their nuclear arsenals.</p>

          <h2>COVID-19 Lab Leak Theory: Beyond Right-Wing Conspiracy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The debate over the origins of COVID-19, whether from natural origins or a lab leak, is not solely a right-wing issue but reflects a broader public distrust of science. A new documentary blaming the controversy on right-wing misinformation is misguided, as many credible experts hold nuanced views based on scientific uncertainties. This controversy is fueled by public anxieties over virus research, lack of transparency, and scientists' behavior, contributing to skepticism and support for lab-leak theories, so trust must be cultivated through transparency, accountability, and relationship-building.</p>

          <p>China plans to increase gold production by over 5% in the next three years by using new mining technology and digging deeper, as demand for the precious metal rises amidst geopolitical tensions.

The action plan aims to address challenges like insufficient resource security and difficulties in meeting demand from key technologies. China has been the worldâ€™s top gold consumer for 12 years and the largest producer for 18 years.</p>

          <p>A private astronaut mission to the space station has exposed a new twist in a lingering issue at humanityâ€™s most frequently visited destination in space. While air has been slowly leaking out of a Russia-controlled module that typically remains sealed off from the rest of the space station, recently, station operators realized the gradual, steady leak had stopped. NASA revealed the concerns in a June 14 statement, delaying the launch of the private Ax-4 mission, carried out by SpaceX and Houston-based company Axiom Space, as station operators worked to pinpoint the problem.</p>
