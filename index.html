          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 09:35:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Downing Street has clarified that Prime Minister Keir Starmer does not believe transgender women are women, citing the UK Supreme Court's ruling that defines 'woman' as biological sex under equalities law. This contrasts with Starmer's 2022 statement where he said that trans women are women. The shift in stance follows the Supreme Court judgment, which has significant implications for equality law and the rights of transgender individuals. The Prime Minister's current view aligns with the legal definition established by the court. </p>

          <p>Joseph Mallord William Turner, born in 1775, is celebrated as one of the greatest Romantic painters, known for his masterful interplay of light, color, and atmosphere in capturing the grandeur of nature and the power of machines. Turner found inspiration in his travels throughout Europe, particularly in Venice and along the Rhine River, and his artistic style evolved towards increasingly abstract and mystical landscapes. His unconventional style, initially criticized, later inspired Impressionists like Claude Monet and Camille Pissarro, solidifying Turner's legacy as a pioneer of modernism and a forerunner of abstract art. Today, Turner is considered the father of Impressionism, with his works continuing to captivate audiences 250 years after his birth.</p>

          <p>At least five people were killed in Indian-administered Kashmir after gunmen opened fire on a group of domestic tourists in Pahalgam, a popular beauty spot in the Himalayas. The attack, described by the region's chief minister as larger than recent attacks on civilians, also wounded several others. Security forces have been deployed to the area, and a search is underway to find the perpetrators of what officials are calling a cowardly terror attack on tourists. The incident has raised concerns about the region's long-running insurgency, despite a recent decrease in violence.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has significantly slashed its 2025 U.S. growth forecast to 1.8% from 2.7%, citing the negative impact of President Donald Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs. The IMF also cut its global growth forecast to 2.8%, noting that the tariffs pose a major negative shock to the global economy. The IMF now estimates the odds of a U.S. recession at 40%, a substantial increase from the 25% previously estimated in October 2024, while also revising its expectations for headline inflation for advanced economies upward to 2.5%.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to consider a case involving Maryland parents challenging a school board's policy that prevents them from opting their elementary school-age children out of instruction featuring storybooks addressing gender identity and sexual orientation. The parents, who are Muslim, Roman Catholic, and Ukrainian Orthodox, argue that the policy infringes on their First Amendment right to exercise their religion freely. The school board defends its policy, stating that opt-outs had become unworkable and disruptive, while the parents contend that they are being forced to choose between violating their religious beliefs and forgoing public education. A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by early July.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has downgraded the U.K.'s 2025 growth forecast to 1.1%, a 0.5 percentage point decrease from its January forecast. The IMF cited U.S. President Donald Trump's trade tariffs, higher borrowing costs, and increased energy prices as factors contributing to the lowered outlook. The downgrade adds pressure on the U.K.'s Labour government, which has prioritized economic growth. The IMF's forecast aligns with similar downgrades from the Bank of England and the U.K.'s Office for Budget Responsibility.</p>

          <p>Bath & Body Works is well-positioned to weather the impact of tariffs due to its high level of domestic production, with 80% of its products made in the United States. This domestic exposure gives the company a key advantage over competitors who rely more on imports, allowing Bath & Body Works to maintain prices and profitability. The company's primary U.S. manufacturing facility, Beauty Park, enables quick testing, reaction, and adaptation to consumer trends.

          <p>A recent speech by Xia Baolong, Beijingâ€™s top official on Hong Kong affairs, has drawn attention to the escalating trade tensions between the US and Hong Kong. Xia condemned the US tariffs, claiming they are not merely about trade but aimed at undermining Hong Kong's very existence. He highlighted the irony of the US imposing high tariffs despite Hong Kong being a significant source of the US trade surplus. Observers suggest Xia's harsh tone is a call to action for Hong Kong officials and the business sector to unite with Beijing in the trade war with the US.</p>

          <p>Analysts report that the US Trade Representative's (USTR) revised port-fee plan has eased pressure on Chinaâ€™s shipyards while shifting the burden to major shipping carriers. The final plan, which includes a phased fee structure and various exemptions, is a significant departure from the stricter original proposals. Most notably, the USTR scrapped a plan to charge fees based on the number of Chinese-made vessels in a company's fleet and the number of orders placed with Chinese shipbuilders. This change is expected to alleviate concerns among clients and encourage orders from Chinese shipbuilders.</p>
