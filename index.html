          <p>Billionaire Elon Musk has announced the launch of a new political party, named the America Party, intended to challenge the traditional two-party system in the United States. The announcement, made on his social media platform X, follows a recent and public falling out with President Donald Trump over tax and spending legislation. Musk, who is ineligible to run for president himself, has not named a leader for the party, and its formal registration with the Federal Electoral Commission is currently unclear. The move is seen as a direct consequence of his disagreement with the administration's policies.</p>

          <p>As rescuers search for 27 missing girls from a summer camp, the death toll from the Texas floods has climbed to at least 43, including 15 children. The disaster has prompted questions about the adequacy of weather warnings, with some local officials claiming they were not prepared for the storm's intensity. The National Weather Service defended its actions, stating it issued a flood watch and warnings hours before the catastrophic flooding began. This event highlights the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and the challenges of emergency response.</p>

          <p>The government in England has announced a £500 million plan to establish "Best Start" family hubs in every local authority by April 2026, with a goal of up to 1,000 centers by 2028. These hubs aim to provide a wide range of support services for families, from midwifery and birth registration to debt advice and youth clubs. The initiative builds on the concept of "Sure Start" centres from the early 2000s, aiming to support 500,000 more children in disadvantaged areas. While the government touts it as a "lifeline" for families, the opposition has questioned how much of the plan is new versus a rebranding of existing services.</p>

          <p>After a lengthy trial, a Los Angeles jury found Monica Sementilli guilty of murder and conspiracy in the 2017 killing of her husband, celebrity hairdresser Fabio Sementilli. Prosecutors argued she conspired with her lover, Robert Baker, to stage the murder as a burglary to collect on a life insurance policy. Key evidence included extensive communication between the lovers, surveillance footage, and testimony from an accomplice. Sementilli, who maintained her innocence and was supported by her daughters, was sentenced to life in prison without parole, bringing a conclusion to the nearly eight-year-long case.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, "Mark Twain," delves into the author's 1882 return to the Mississippi River, a journey that would form the basis for his book "Life on the Mississippi." The passage captures Samuel Clemens's experience traveling incognito to observe the changes to the river and its culture, which had been the defining landscape of his youth. Chernow's book examines how Twain's early life in Hannibal, Missouri, and his time as a steamboat pilot profoundly shaped his identity and his iconic literary voice. The biography explores the complexities of the man who helped define American literature.</p>

According to state media, the new regulations are designed to standardize the policy coordination and review process at the highest levels of government. These top-level organs are now directed to focus on "planning, discussing and checking on major matters." Some analysts suggest this move could be a strategic effort to streamline governance or potentially hint at a long-term succession plan within the party leadership.</p>

          <p>Survivors of the Texas flash floods are sharing harrowing stories of the disaster that claimed at least 43 lives and left dozens missing from a summer camp. The Guadalupe River rose an unprecedented 26 feet in under an hour, catching residents and campers by surprise in the middle of the night. One teenage boy, Leo, survived by clinging to barbed wire after his family's home was swept away, though his mother and baby sibling remain missing. These accounts underscore the sudden and destructive power of the flood, which transformed a popular holiday retreat into a scene of devastation.</p>

          <h2>Texas Officials Face Scrutiny Over Warning Systems and Evacuation Orders During Floods</h2>

          <p>As the search continues for victims of the catastrophic Texas floods, local and state officials are facing intense scrutiny over their preparedness and response. Questions are being raised about why residents and summer camps along the Guadalupe River were not alerted or evacuated sooner, despite a series of increasingly urgent warnings from the National Weather Service. Local officials have defended their actions, stating they did not anticipate the flood's unprecedented severity and noting the public can become desensitized to frequent alerts. The disaster has highlighted potential gaps in emergency warning systems.</p>

          <p>New images have provided the first complete view of a mysterious Chinese wing-in-ground-effect (WIG) vehicle, or ekranoplan, being tested on the Bohai Sea. The craft, similar in concept to the large WIGs developed by the Soviet Union, is designed to fly efficiently at high speeds just above the water's surface. This capability makes it useful for logistics, search and rescue, and personnel recovery in littoral zones, while also being less vulnerable to certain naval threats. The vehicle's development indicates China's interest in this technology for potential military and logistical applications.</p>

          <h2>Peak District Walker Sparks Debate by Kicking Over Stone Stacks to Protect Environment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 19:10:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A walker in the UK's Peak District has gained viral attention for posting a video of himself kicking over man-made stone stacks. The walker, Stuart Cox, argues the stacks are environmentally damaging, as people are taking stones from historic walls and natural paths, which disturbs wildlife habitats and can cause erosion. The Peak District National Park Authority and the National Trust support his view, stating the stacks are "detrimental" to the area's historic and natural environment. While some have criticized his actions, Cox hopes his video raises awareness about this harmful trend.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 19:09:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many young people in the UK are struggling to find summer or part-time work, often facing the challenge of needing experience to get experience. Career experts advise applicants to highlight skills learned from non-work activities like volunteering, team sports, or even home responsibilities. They recommend keeping CVs simple and tailored, and suggest that dropping off a CV in person can still be effective at smaller businesses. Preparing for interviews by researching the company and practicing answers can also help candidates stand out in a competitive job market.</p>

          <p>A political analysis suggests President Donald Trump is strategically using unpredictability, a concept known as the "Madman Theory," to influence global affairs and pressure both allies and adversaries. This approach involves creating an impression of volatility to extract concessions, a tactic political scientists trace back to the Nixon administration. The article explores how this has led to significant shifts, such as increased defense spending by NATO allies, but questions its effectiveness against hostile nations like Iran. Experts debate whether this strategy is sustainable or if it could ultimately undermine U.S. credibility.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Lifetime ISA (LISA), a UK savings vehicle, is drawing both praise for its benefits and criticism for its strict rules. LISAs allow individuals under 40 to save for a first home or retirement, with the government adding a 25% bonus to contributions. However, savers face a significant penalty if they withdraw money early for unapproved reasons or use it to buy a home exceeding the £450,000 price cap, a limit unchanged since 2017. Critics argue the penalty is unfair and the price cap is outdated, effectively punishing savers and deterring others from using the product. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hundreds of runners participated in a 15-mile "Run Against ICE" through Los Angeles to protest recent raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The route passed through significant immigrant communities like Koreatown and MacArthur Park, as well as near the Metropolitan Detention Center, where detainees are held. Participants expressed outrage and defiance over the aggressive enforcement actions, which they say have instilled fear in Latino communities. The event aimed to show solidarity with those affected and call for an end to the federal operations.</p>
