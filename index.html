          <p>President Trump announced that the United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan, confirming the completion of the operation. According to Trump, all planes are safely out of Iranian airspace after dropping a full payload of bombs on Fordow. Iran has pledged to retaliate if the U.S. joined the Israeli assault, which began with airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites and military targets. The Fordow site, crucial to Iran's nuclear program, is buried almost 300 feet beneath a mountain and protected by significant air defenses.</p>

          <p>President Trump contradicted his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, regarding Iran's nuclear program, stating that she was "wrong" in her assessment that Iran wasn't building a nuclear weapon.

Trump dismissed this assessment, asserting that Iran was "very close to having" a nuclear weapon.

          <p>Dozens of people were injured when a yacht struck a dock in the Hudson River near the Henry Hudson Parkway and West 125th Street. The boat hit a pylon while attempting to dock near Riverside Park, and approximately 400 people were on board attending a birthday party. Marine units escorted the yacht to a dock at West 125th Street, where passengers were unloaded. Thirty-five people suffered non-life-threatening injuries, and 22 were taken to local hospitals for treatment.</p>

          <p>Texas will require all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments under a new law, making it the largest state to attempt such a mandate. The bill, signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott, is expected to face legal challenges from critics who view it as an unconstitutional violation of the separation of church and state. Supporters claim the Ten Commandments are foundational to the U.S. judicial and educational systems, while opponents argue it infringes on religious freedom. A similar law in Louisiana was blocked by a federal appeals court.</p>

Experts warn that simplistic solutions often fail to address the real issues causing stress and can prevent people from seeking necessary medical treatment. Jasleen Kaur Carroll, who experienced burnout, tried various social media hacks but found that therapy and mindfulness were more effective in managing her stress. Experts emphasize the importance of addressing the root cause of stress rather than just treating the symptoms.</p>
