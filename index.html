          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, with discussions slated to cover oil, trade, investment deals, and potential policy changes regarding semiconductor exports and nuclear programs. The visit occurs amidst heightened geopolitical tensions, including ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas and negotiations concerning Iran's nuclear program. Wall Street and Silicon Valley leaders are expected to attend a Saudi-U.S. investment forum in Riyadh during the visit, with potential announcements of investment deals anticipated. Discussions may also address lifting U.S. sanctions on Syria and renaming the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf, a move likely to anger Iran.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter died at his home in New Hampshire at the age of 85, according to a statement from the court. Appointed by President George H.W.

Casey (1992) and dissented in Bush v. Gore (2000). His retirement allowed President Barack Obama to appoint Justice Sonia Sotomayor, marking a shift in the court's ideological balance.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced another radar screen outage, lasting approximately 90 seconds, early Friday morning, prompting concerns about the airport's outdated air traffic control system. The FAA attributed the outage to a telecommunications issue impacting communications and radar display at the Philadelphia TRACON Area C, which oversees Newark's airspace. This incident follows a similar outage last week that caused significant delays and led some air traffic controllers to take medical leave, citing a traumatic experience. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans for a new, state-of-the-art air traffic control system to replace the current antiquated system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the decline of American manufacturing, a significant majority of Americans express a desire to see more citizens employed in factory jobs, fueled by cultural nostalgia and political incentives. While factory work is often romanticized as a source of good, solid jobs, the reality is that manufacturing salaries have fallen in the bottom half of all jobs, and unionization rates have declined. Politicians on both sides of the aisle have advocated for revitalizing American manufacturing, citing national security concerns and the potential for supporting a strong labor base. However, the desire to bring back factory jobs may not align with the reality of American manufacturing today, as automation and productivity growth have reduced the need for human labor in the production process.</p>

          <p>Board members of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum engaged in a heated email exchange after a Biden appointee criticized the museum's silence regarding President Trump's dismissal of Biden appointees.

Representative Max Miller, a Republican board member, dismissed Abel's concerns, asserting that all members serve at the pleasure of the President. The exchange highlighted the politicization of an institution dedicated to educating about historical atrocities, with board members clashing over the appropriateness of speaking out against the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to make an uncontrolled reentry into Earth's atmosphere. Experts predict the spacecraft, originally intended to land on Venus, could crash anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south, encompassing a vast area including parts of the United States, South America, Africa, Australia, and most of Europe and Asia. While the risk to humans is considered low due to the planet's large water coverage, there is a slight chance that the 1,000-pound object will survive reentry, as it was built to withstand the harsh conditions of Venus' atmosphere.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to bring the first group of white South Africans, classified as refugees, to the United States, contrasting sharply with the suspension of nearly all other refugee admissions. The program for white South Africans, who Trump claims are victims of racial persecution, was hastily assembled, processing cases much faster than normal. The South African government disputes the U.S. claim, stating that Afrikaners do not meet the threshold for refugee status. Critics argue the move is politically motivated and designed to question South Africa's democracy.</p>

Communication from the federal government has been lacking, hindering planning efforts as the West anticipates a significant fire season. While a court order brought back some previously fired workers, officials say it wasn't enough and the loss of experienced personnel set the process back.

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is alerting the public about the dangers of products containing tianeptine, often referred to as "gas station heroin," due to its availability in gas station stores. Tianeptine, an opioid alternative prescribed as an antidepressant in some countries, is not FDA-approved for use in the U.S. Use of tianeptine can lead to serious harm, including death, agitation, confusion, sweating, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and coma. The FDA has previously warned consumers about products containing tianeptine, such as Neptune's Fix, which have been recalled due to severe reactions.</p>

Republican Senator Josh Hawley introduced a bill to reimpose restrictions on mifepristone, and allow patients to sue telehealth abortion providers.

While some sectors, such as British steelmakers and the aluminum industry, will be able to export tariff-free, the 10% baseline tariff will apply to most other goods.
