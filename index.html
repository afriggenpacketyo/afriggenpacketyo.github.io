          <p>A British couple has discovered they are saving thousands of pounds monthly by taking an extended "gap year" to travel the world with their six-year-old daughter. After quitting their jobs and pulling their daughter from school, they found their travel budget of £2,000–£3,000 per month is significantly less than the £4,000-£5,000 they were spending at home. The family has traveled through Europe and Asia, embracing the adventure and challenges of life on the road over their previous corporate lifestyle.</p>

Fellow boxers like Tyson Fury and Amir Khan, along with other sporting greats, paid tribute to him as a "warrior" and the "people's champion," also acknowledging his candid struggles with mental health after his retirement.</p>

Medical personnel from organizations like Médecins Sans Frontières describe horrific scenes of children as young as two being brought in without any family, their relatives often killed or lost in the ongoing Israeli military offensive. This has led to what the UN has described as the "largest orphan crisis in modern history," with doctors and nurses struggling to provide care amid collapsing health infrastructure and constant bombardment.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein who died by suicide in April, is calling for a full investigation into Prince Andrew over allegations of sexual assault. Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, stated that the prince has not faced sufficient consequences and should be held to the fullest extent of the law, regardless of his royal status. Prince Andrew has consistently denied the allegations and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 without any admission of liability.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and James Lankford (R-OK) highlighted the role of the internet as an "accelerant" for extremism in the U.S. Speaking on "Face the Nation," the senators made a bipartisan appeal to lower the political temperature, arguing that social media algorithms push the angriest and most extreme voices to the forefront. They pointed to legislative efforts like the Kids Online Safety Act as a potential step toward mitigating the online radicalization that contributes to real-world political violence.</p>

          <p>In municipal elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) of Chancellor Friedrich Merz secured a victory.

This election is viewed as a critical test for the national government and indicates a growing rightward shift in western Germany, a trend previously concentrated in the country's eastern states.</p>

          <p>Jon Green, a Democratic supervisor in Johnson County, Iowa, has publicly refused to comply with Republican Governor Kim Reynolds's order to fly flags at half-staff in honor of the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Green condemned the killing but stated he would not grant county honors to a man whose mission was to "denigrate" marginalized communities and harm the political fabric. The decision has drawn both criticism from the governor, who called it "disgraceful," and support from another supervisor who agreed Kirk's rhetoric should not be honored.</p>

          <p>Swiss bank UBS is reportedly exploring a potential move to the United States in response to proposed stricter capital requirements from the Swiss government. According to the New York Post, senior executives have met with U.S. officials to discuss a strategic shift, which could involve acquiring a U.S. bank or a merger. The Swiss government's proposal, following the takeover of Credit Suisse, would require UBS to hold significantly more capital, a move the bank's CEO has described as punitive and excessive.

          <p>The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has reported that the 16-year-old who opened fire at a Colorado high school was an active user on a "violent gore" website known for hosting white supremacist content and graphic violence. The site, WatchPeopleDie, has been linked to several other recent school shooters, suggesting a pattern of radicalization in these online spaces that glorify violence. The report highlights a disturbing trend where perpetrators draw inspiration from one another on platforms that are easily accessible and feature horrific, real-life violent content.</p>

          <p>Amazon is rolling out a new feature called "Hear the Highlights," which uses generative AI to create short audio summaries of product information and customer reviews. The AI model synthesizes content from the product catalog, user comments, and other web sources to produce a concise, voiced-over description accessible in the mobile app. While intended to simplify the shopping experience, the feature raises questions about whether an AI summary can capture the nuance of human reviews or if it might inadvertently blend marketing language with genuine user feedback.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece by Moira Donegan argues that while the assassination of Charlie Kirk was a tragedy, the impulse to eulogize him in a way that ignores his controversial and divisive rhetoric is a mistake. The article refutes claims that Kirk was a practitioner of good-faith debate, instead characterizing his campus appearances as "aggressive, unequal, trolling affairs" designed to humiliate opponents and spread hateful rhetoric. The author contends that an honest commitment to non-violence also requires an honest accounting of Kirk's political legacy, which actively opposed civic equality.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article posits that after two years of war, Israeli society has largely adapted to the conflict, with the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza remaining abstract and distant for most. It argues that political discourse has been replaced by a mythical narrative of victimization, framing the conflict as an eternal, biblical struggle rather than a political problem of occupation. This shift, combined with a general disinterest in news from Gaza, has created a dangerous status quo where the systematic destruction continues without a clear vision for a future beyond permanent conflict.</p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court decision has heightened fear and apprehension in Los Angeles's immigrant communities, as it allows federal agents to conduct warrantless raids and potentially target people based on their appearance. The ruling overturned a temporary restraining order that had limited such actions, and the Department of Homeland Security has since vowed to "flood the zone" with enforcement. Community organizers and volunteers are mobilizing to protect vulnerable residents, many of whom face the difficult choice between risking deportation by going to work or facing eviction by staying home.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Trump administration titled "Make Our Children Healthy Again," led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is facing criticism for its failure to mention smoking or nicotine. Health advocates and parents find the omission glaring, as youth vaping and tobacco use remain significant public health concerns. Critics also point out that the administration has recently cut funding for the very FDA and CDC programs responsible for tobacco control and public awareness campaigns, actions that seem to contradict the report's stated goals.</p>
