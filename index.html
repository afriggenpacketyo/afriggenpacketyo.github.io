          <p>President Trump attributed the first-quarter decline in U.S. GDP to former President Biden's policies.  He suggested that the second quarter's results would also be blamed on Biden, despite Trump's own recent inauguration.  The article notes that the GDP decline partly stemmed from increased imports in anticipation of Trump's tariffs and a drop in government spending.  Experts attribute the economic downturn to uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariff policies.</p>
