            <h2>Cambodian Manufacturers Face Crisis Amidst Trump's Tariffs, Reshoring Unlikely</h2>

            <p>The Trump administration's imposition of a 49% tariff on Cambodian goods is causing an existential crisis for factories and workers in Cambodia. Despite the administration's goal of bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., experts argue that reshoring from Cambodia is highly unlikely due to labor costs. Instead, manufacturers are exploring alternative locations like Egypt, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Indonesia to mitigate the impact of the tariffs. This situation highlights the complex and potentially unintended consequences of the administration's trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump has initiated tariffs on imported goods, asserting they will stimulate the US economy and job creation. These tariffs, which include a minimum 10% levy on all imports and higher rates on specific countries, aim to reduce the trade deficit. However, economists warn that these measures could increase prices for American consumers and disrupt global trade. The tariffs have already caused volatility in stock markets, reflecting investor concerns about increased costs and reduced profits for businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A new study indicates that concentrating physical activity into one or two days a week, the "weekend warrior" pattern, may provide similar mortality risk reduction compared to exercising more regularly. Researchers found no significant difference in mortality risk between those who exercised regularly and those who concentrated their activity on weekends. Experts caution about the risk of injuries with intense weekend workouts and emphasize that any exercise is better than none.

The man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, was sent to El Salvador despite having protected legal status, due to what the government called an "administrative error." The Supreme Court is considering the administration's argument that a federal court cannot order the president to engage in foreign diplomacy to facilitate his return.

His legal team asserts that the Royal and VIP Executive Committee (Ravec) did not follow standard procedures and lacked expert risk analysis in making the decision. The Home Office, responsible for Ravec's decisions, opposes the appeal, stating that the security arrangements were adjusted due to the prince's change of status and relocation abroad.

            <p>The BBC has faced criticism for using the term "revert" without qualification in an article about Eid al-Fitr. The term, which refers to converts to Islam, is based on the Islamic belief that all humans are born with an innate understanding of God. Critics argue that the BBC, as a public broadcaster, should use the term "convert" to maintain impartiality and respect for the diverse religious and non-religious population in Britain. The BBC has since removed the term from the headline and other instances where it was used outside of quoting an interviewee.</p>
