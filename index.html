          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has called for an unusually large and short-notice meeting with numerous generals and admirals in Quantico, Virginia. The purpose of the rare gathering remains undisclosed by the Pentagon, sparking speculation about its agenda. Theories range from an announcement regarding the National Defense Strategy to discussions about Hegseth's previously stated goal of reducing the number of high-ranking officers in the armed forces, a plan he has vocally supported.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration will now permit Boeing to resume issuing its own airworthiness certificates for certain 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner aircraft, a role the agency had taken over following safety crises. This decision signals growing regulatory confidence in the manufacturer's production quality after years of intense scrutiny and restrictions, including a production cap on the 737 MAX. The FAA stated its inspectors will now focus on other areas of the production process, while continuing to oversee certification on an alternating basis with Boeing.</p>

Health equity advocates have expressed concern that removing these resources, which included information for LGBTQ+ individuals and people with disabilities, could create dangerous gaps in access to critical health information. An HHS spokesperson stated the changes were made to align the CDC's website with administration priorities and executive orders.</p>

          <p>The UK government, under Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has announced plans to introduce a mandatory digital ID scheme required for anyone to work in the country, aimed at tackling illegal migration. The government argues the system will make it harder to work illegally and offer citizens benefits like easier access to services, framing it as a bedrock of a modern state. However, the proposal has faced strong opposition from other political parties and civil liberties groups, who raise concerns about mass surveillance, data security, and its effectiveness in stopping illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>A new Quinnipiac University poll reveals that a vast majority of American voters, 79%, believe the country is in a political crisis, a sentiment expressed across party lines following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The survey also indicates that 71% of voters view politically motivated violence as a very serious problem, a significant increase since a similar poll in June.

          <p>A retirement income strategy known as the "rule of thirds" is gaining attention as an alternative to traditional methods like the 4% withdrawal rule. This approach suggests converting one-third of retirement savings into a guaranteed lifetime income product, such as a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds of the portfolio can then be invested for growth or used for flexible spending, aiming to balance financial security with liquidity. The article notes that this strategy may not be suitable for everyone and depends on individual circumstances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Alabama woman, Summerlin Skipworth, is recovering after contracting a flesh-eating bacteria, Vibrio vulnificus, from a cut on her foot while boating in the Gulf of Mexico. The infection spread rapidly, requiring emergency surgery and a yearlong regimen of antibiotics to save her life. Skipworth is sharing her story to urge others to take injuries sustained in warm coastal waters seriously, as cases of vibriosis have been increasing along the Gulf and East Coasts. Health officials link the rise to warmer ocean temperatures.</p>

          <p>Nineteen immigration detainees at a newly opened ICE facility within Louisiana's notorious Angola prison have been on a hunger strike for five days to protest unsafe and degrading conditions. According to advocacy groups, the strikers are demanding access to medical care, prescription medications, clean drinking water, and basic hygiene products. The facility, located in a former camp at the state penitentiary, has been criticized for subjecting detainees to poor treatment, including the denial of life-saving medication, in what advocates are calling a humanitarian emergency.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order paving the way for a deal that allows TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. under a new structure, avoiding a nationwide ban. The agreement establishes a U.S.-based joint venture with a majority of American investors, including Oracle, which will host U.S. user data and review the app's code for security. Under the deal, TikTok's parent company, China-based ByteDance, will own less than 20% of the new entity, satisfying the requirements of a divest-or-ban law passed by Congress.</p>

Many experts point to a major study of 2.4 million births that found no such link, and they express concern that the administration's conflicting messages could confuse pregnant women about using one of the only approved painkillers available to them.</p>
