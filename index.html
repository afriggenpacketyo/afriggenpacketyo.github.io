          <h2>Study Suggests Vitamin D May Slow Down Biological Aging</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-26 19:54:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Mass General Brigham and the Medical College of Georgia indicates that daily vitamin D supplements could potentially slow biological aging. The research, which tracked over 1,000 U.S. adults over four years, found that vitamin D3 may protect against the shortening of telomeres, which are protective caps on DNA that erode with age. Participants taking vitamin D3 experienced significantly less telomere shortening compared to those taking a placebo, suggesting a potential way to protect the body at the cellular level. While further research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the impact on different populations, the study offers a promising strategy for countering the aging process. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The English government is shifting its apprenticeship funding to focus on individuals under 21, redirecting resources from postgraduate-level programs. This change aims to create 120,000 more training opportunities for young adults and those needing to retrain, utilizing increased charges on employers recruiting from outside the UK. Funding will be pulled from level 7 apprenticeships, which are equivalent to a master's degree and used by professionals in fields like accounting and healthcare. Critics argue that this decision will harm public services and limit career opportunities for those who do not attend university, while the government asserts it will strengthen the economy by investing in skills for young people.</p>

          <p>This article summarizes the testimonies from the Sean "Diddy" Combs sexual assault and racketeering trial. Over two weeks, prosecutors presented 16 witnesses to demonstrate Combs' alleged use of violence and threats to coerce women into sex and protect his music empire. Key testimonies include Cassie Ventura's accounts of a decade of abuse, corroborated by witnesses who claim to have seen Combs' violence, as well as accounts from escorts and federal agents involved in the investigation. Combs has pleaded not guilty, with his defense arguing that his violence stemmed from jealousy and drug addiction, and that his sexual activities were private and consensual. </p>

This visit comes at a time when President Trump has made remarks suggesting Canada would be better off as a U.S. state.

The restructuring of the National Security Council, along with these job cuts, is viewed as a trend toward radical downsizing.

This pattern of criticizing Russia's actions while refraining from concrete measures has led to questions about the effectiveness of Trump's approach.
