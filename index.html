The strikes targeted Hamas military commanders, officials, and infrastructure, with Israel vowing increased military action unless the hostages are released.

          <p>The US imposing additional tariffs on Chinese imports due to the fentanyl crisis is criticized as ineffective.  The opinion piece argues the root cause lies within the US, and that China's counternarcotics efforts have been significant.
