          <p>Chinese scientists working on a maglev project claim to have found a solution to the problem of unpleasant vibrations in ultra-high-speed ground travel systems like Elon Musk's Hyperloop. According to a study, minor imperfections in the track can cause violent low-frequency vibrations at speeds of 1,000km/h, making the ride extremely unpleasant. The Chinese engineers say they have developed a method to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, making the ride more comfortable. This research, using supercomputer simulations and scaled-down prototypes, could significantly advance vacuum-tube maglev technology and address challenges faced by Hyperloop concepts.</p>

          <p>SpaceX launched its ninth test flight of the Starship mega-rocket, achieving orbit but experiencing a loss of control during reentry. An apparent propellant leak caused the spacecraft to spin, preventing a controlled descent, and it likely disintegrated over the Indian Ocean. Despite the failure to complete the mission, the launch demonstrated significant progress, including reaching orbit and reusing a Super Heavy booster from a previous flight. SpaceX will analyze the data to improve the reliability of Starship for future missions, as the company seeks to make life multiplanetary.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's ninth test flight of the Super Heavy-Starship rocket faced fresh challenges, resulting in the loss of both stages before controlled descents could occur. The Super Heavy first stage suffered a catastrophic failure during its descent, while the Starship upper stage made it into its planned suborbital trajectory but failed to open a door for satellite deployment. A propellant leak then caused the spacecraft to spin, leading to a catastrophic breakup during reentry. Despite the setbacks, SpaceX founder Elon Musk noted the mission achieved significant improvements, and engineers will review the data to implement fixes for future flights.</p>

          <p>The CDC will no longer advise routine COVID-19 shots for healthy children and pregnant women, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This decision marks a departure from the previous approach of recommending annual shots for everyone age 6 months and older. The move reflects ongoing debates among medical researchers about the actual risk COVID-19 poses to children and the necessity of annual vaccinations. While many agree that the initial vaccination course offered significant protection against serious illness, the need for annual vaccines against new variants remains contentious, with considerations for children with underlying conditions and those living with high-risk individuals.</p>

          <p>Families in Northumberland are facing hardship after the government cancelled a project to widen part of the A1, years after National Highways purchased their properties for the scheme. Homes acquired for the road expansion have been left vacant and are deteriorating, causing distress to former residents who had to relocate. More than £68 million has already been spent on the project, with ongoing costs for insurance and council tax on the unused properties. Local representatives are calling for a strategy to refurbish and rent the homes to young families to prevent further waste and improve the area's appeal to tourists.</p>

Rowley, along with other chief constables, points to overstretched resources, debt, and outdated technology as obstacles to restoring neighborhood policing and reducing crime.

Musk said the bill increases the budget deficit and undermines the work that the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, is doing. The tax provisions of the package, titled the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," would increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

          <p>The California Interscholastic Federation is changing its competition rules to allow more girls to participate in the state track and field championships amid controversy over a trans student-athlete. The decision follows a social media post by Donald Trump criticizing the participation of a trans athlete in girls' sports. The federation said it was extending access for more “biological female” athletes to participate in the championship meet. Trump had threatened to pull federal funding in California if the state did not bar trans students from participating in girls sports.</p>
