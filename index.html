          <p>A former Mexican federal agent, Ivan Morales, who testified against Ruben Oseguera Gonzalez, a leader of the Jalisco New Generation cartel, and his wife were shot dead in Morelos, Mexico. Morales had previously survived a drug trafficking attack in 2015, escaping with severe burns when a military helicopter was shot down. The Jalisco New Generation cartel, led by Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, is a powerful criminal organization designated as a foreign terrorist group by the U.S. The U.S. government has imposed economic sanctions on individuals linked to the cartel's drug trafficking and fuel theft operations, targeting top members and their network.</p>

          <p>The anti-immigration Reform UK party, led by Brexit figure Nigel Farage, achieved notable gains in recent UK local elections, securing a parliamentary seat and several local council seats. This marks a setback for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party, which has experienced declining voter support since taking office. Reform UK's victory highlights a shift in the British political landscape, capitalizing on dissatisfaction with both Labour and Conservative parties. The party advocates for stricter immigration controls, deportations, and withdrawal from global environmental commitments.</p>

          <p>Chevron's stock experienced a decline following the announcement of a profit decrease due to falling oil prices. The company's net income dropped by over 30% to $3.5 billion, or $2 per share, compared to the previous year's $5.5 billion, or $2.97 per share. U.S. crude oil prices have fallen by about 18% this year due to tariffs and increased OPEC+ supply.

Instead, existing hate crime legislation will be amended to include protections based on sex. The government also confirmed that legislation to end conversion therapy will not be brought forward this term, with hopes for a UK-wide solution.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's actions in his first 100 days have surpassed the scope of Project 2025, a conservative manifesto for his second term, by consolidating power in the executive branch and implementing key policy changes. Many of Trump's moves align with Project 2025's recommendations, including firing disloyal individuals, dismantling the Department of Education, and ending climate programs. The administration has also ended diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, restricted access to gender-affirming care, and taken steps to deport undocumented immigrants, reflecting the project's influence across the federal government.</p>

The bill proposes reducing government spending by at least $1.5 trillion, potentially impacting Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap).</p>

          <p>A recent poll revealed that 80% of Americans believe the country would benefit from more manufacturing jobs, while only 25% would prefer working in a factory themselves. Despite the challenges, a quarter of Americans' interest in factory jobs indicates a significant desire for economic revitalization. The decline of manufacturing has been linked to social rot and stagnant wages, emphasizing the importance of a strong industrial sector for a nation's economic health. Reindustrialization could also lead to greater national self-sufficiency and political leverage, as well as offer political opportunities for parties that can connect with working-class voters.</p>

They also admire Elon Musk's "department of government efficiency" and support Trump's use of tariffs. Trump's supporters dismiss concerns about due process and potential overreach, viewing them as collateral damage in his efforts to secure the border and restore America.</p>

          <p>After 100 days in office, Donald Trump's policies are facing declining public support, with key initiatives losing popularity. His overall favorability has decreased due to negative ratings on the economy and trade, particularly concerning tariffs. While some policies, like targeted tariffs on China and immigration enforcement, initially had support, public opinion has shifted. This trend suggests potential challenges for Republicans in upcoming elections and highlights the risk of overestimating public appetite for major change.</p>
