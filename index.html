          <p>A New York Times article reports that electricity has been restored to most of Spain and Portugal nearly 18 hours after a blackout disrupted daily life. The cause of the outage remains unclear, with officials ruling out cybersecurity attacks, human error, and meteorological causes, but they suspect two separate power outages occurring in quick succession in southwestern Spain. The blackout affected traffic lights, trains, businesses, and communication networks, leaving millions stranded. While power has returned, the Spanish capital is slowly returning to normal, with many people staying home and schools reporting low attendance.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has instructed federal agencies to track and report occupancy data in public buildings and offices leased by the government, signaling a crackdown on remote work.

          <p>A New York Times article reports that General Motors is abandoning its previous forecast for solid profit growth this year due to the uncertainty created by President Trump's trade policies. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on imported cars and parts, impacting G.M., which imports about half of its U.S. cars. The company's chief financial officer stated that the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs "could be material," leading to the postponement of a conference call to discuss earnings results. G.M. reported a 7 percent profit decline in the first quarter, hurt by a drop in North American earnings.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to ease tariffs on automakers to prevent them from being doubly impacted by import duties on car parts, steel, and aluminum. Automakers will be reimbursed for previously paid double tariffs, although the 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts will remain. Industry leaders from Stellantis and Ford have expressed support for the move, while General Motors has postponed its first-quarter conference call to assess the potential impact of the tariff changes. The administration aims to reward companies manufacturing domestically and incentivize further investment in American manufacturing.</p>

Adidas has already rerouted some products destined for the U.S. to other markets and is refraining from issuing a full-year profit outlook due to the unpredictability caused by tariffs.</p>
