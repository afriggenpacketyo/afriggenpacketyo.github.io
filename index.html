          <p>Nearly 100 former employees and prosecutors for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C., have signed a memo opposing President Trump's nominee, Ed Martin, to lead the office.

Senate Democrats have requested a confirmation hearing and placed a hold on Martin's nomination.

          <p>President Trump's China policy remains a chaotic mix of rhetoric, reaction, and risky escalation. Despite calling President Xi Jinping a “good friend,” Trump has increased tariffs on Chinese imports and accused China of trying to “screw” the US. The US Senate has yet to confirm an ambassador to Beijing, and there is no lead negotiator for China. The US policy is unpredictable, and it is unknown what the plan is for the future.</p>

          <p>Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani expressed his government’s desire to build a “strategic partnership” with China. Shaibani met with the Chinese ambassador to the United Nations and stated that Syria's new government is seeking to "strengthen relations with China". China was a key backer of the Assad government, including during the civil war. The two countries aim to collaborate on a long-term strategic partnership.</p>
