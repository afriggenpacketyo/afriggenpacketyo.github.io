          <p>A severe heat wave is affecting the eastern United States, with numerous cities experiencing record-high temperatures as a result of a "heat dome" phenomenon, where high pressure traps heat and humidity. New York City's JFK Airport recorded 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the highest since 2013, and other cities like Boston and Baltimore also saw temperatures exceeding 100 degrees. Hospitals reported an increase in heat-related illnesses, and public transportation faced disruptions, while utilities urged customers to conserve power. The National Weather Service anticipates improved conditions in the coming days, but the heat wave has already impacted over 150 million people. </p>

          <p>Japan and NATO have agreed to strengthen their collaboration in addressing security challenges, including the Middle East crisis, Russia's war in Ukraine, and North Korea's abductions of Japanese nationals. During discussions in The Hague, Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte committed to elevating cooperation in various fields, such as defense industries. Additionally, SBI Shinsei Bank plans to repay the remaining 230 billion yen in public funds received after the collapse of its predecessor, marking the completion of government bailout repayments following Japan's asset price bubble. These funds were initially provided after the 1998 collapse of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.</p>

Cuomo, who resigned from the governorship amidst sexual harassment allegations, conceded, stating that Mamdani had put together a great campaign and inspired young people.

The proposed network would produce three times the amount of power needed at a lower cost than independent regional systems, according to researchers from China, Denmark, and the United States. The team acknowledges that establishing such a system would require navigating geopolitical boundaries and crises, but successful global interconnection could improve energy efficiency, reduce decarbonization costs, and enhance resilience against conflict and climate extremes.</p>

          <h2>Warning Issued Over Unregulated IVF Concierge Clinics</h2>

          <p>IVF patients are being warned about unregulated "concierge clinics" after one such clinic went bust, leaving clients without treatment or refunds. These online companies act as middlemen between patients, donors, and doctors, but are not regulated by the fertility watchdog, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). The HFEA is calling for the law to be strengthened to protect patients, as these clinics do not provide IVF treatment directly. Several patients have lost significant amounts of money and experienced delays in their treatment due to the closure of Apricity Fertility, a concierge clinic.</p>

          <p>Australian journalist Antoinette Lattouf won her case against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), with a court ruling that she was unfairly dismissed over a social media post about the war in Gaza. Lattouf argued that the ABC cut short her stint as a fill-in radio presenter due to her political views and race, after lobbying from pro-Israel groups. The court found that the ABC sacked Lattouf for reasons including her opinions on the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, awarding her damages of A$70,000. The ABC apologized to Lattouf, acknowledging that it had failed its staff and audiences in its handling of the matter.</p>

The $321.1-billion budget addresses a $12-billion deficit through borrowing, tapping reserves, and shifting funding. The deal reflects resistance to Governor Newsom's proposed cuts and includes a "poison pill" requiring legislators to pass a proposal that would lessen the number of building projects that would require a full environmental review under CEQA. The budget also includes changes to Med-Cal funding and addresses uncertainty about future federal funding.</p>
