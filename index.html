          <p>The pilot of a SkyWest flight arriving in Minot, North Dakota, executed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a B-52 military aircraft that appeared on a converging course. In a calm announcement to passengers, the pilot explained that the airport tower, lacking radar, had not warned them about the fast-moving military plane. He apologized for the sudden turn, which he deemed the safest course of action, stating the event was highly unusual and not a fun day at work. The Federal Aviation Administration and the Air Force are both investigating the near-miss incident.</p>

          <p>A demonstration outside the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, which is used to house asylum seekers, devolved into what police called "mindless thuggery." Over 1,000 protesters gathered, with some throwing bottles and smoke flares, leading to six arrests for offenses including violent disorder. The unrest was reportedly sparked by the recent arrest of an asylum seeker for alleged sexual assaults in the town. Downing Street condemned the violence against police, and authorities implemented special orders to manage the disorder and prevent further escalation.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's social media platform, X, has denied allegations from French authorities and is refusing to hand over data for a criminal investigation into alleged data tampering and algorithmic manipulation. X described the probe as "politically-motivated" and an attempt to restrict free speech, raising concerns about the impartiality of the experts assigned to the case. The investigation, which began in January, focuses on potential foreign interference and fraudulent data extraction. The company stated that while the decision was not taken lightly, it believes the investigation distorts French law for a political agenda.</p>

          <p>At least nine people were shot and killed after a group of armed men opened fire at a bar in the tourist city of General Villamil Playas, Ecuador. The attack is part of a growing wave of violence sweeping the nation, which experts attribute to the expansion of transnational drug trafficking organizations. This incident follows the recent recapture and extradition of notorious gang leader Adolfo Macías, alias "Fito," yet criminal violence continues unabated.

          <p>A new study has quantified the immense value of global emergency vaccine stockpiles for diseases like cholera, Ebola, and meningitis, finding they have averted approximately 6 million cases and 300,000 deaths. These stockpiles, funded by organizations like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, provide a rapid response mechanism that is crucial given the long manufacturing times for many vaccines. However, this confirmation of their effectiveness comes at a precarious time, as a significant drop in global health funding threatens the future of these life-saving programs. The research highlights that the stockpiles are a worthwhile investment with over $32 billion in economic benefits.</p>

          <p>In an innovative environmental project, a century-old shipwreck off the Belgian coast is being used to reintroduce rare flat oysters to the North Sea. Scientists have deposited 200,000 oyster larvae into the ship's hull, hoping to establish a new reef that will help purify water and boost overall marine biodiversity. The native oyster population was decimated by overfishing and disease, and this project aims to reverse that decline. The protected status of the shipwreck, where fishing is banned, makes it an ideal location for this sanctuary to thrive.</p>

          <p>All residents of the Beech Rise and Willow Rise flats in Kirkby, Merseyside, are being evicted after the buildings were deemed a serious fire safety risk, despite £1 million being spent on repairs. Flat owners describe "years of hell" paying escalating service charges for failed upkeep, asbestos removal, and other costs while their properties became uninhabitable. The case highlights what the local MP called a "broken leasehold system," where residents were left responsible for massive costs while management companies and landlords allegedly failed to maintain the buildings, leading to the current crisis.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security has issued a public warning about potential national security risks posed by imported technology, including chips, software, and smart devices. The ministry cautioned that these products might contain embedded "back doors" or exploits that could allow malicious actors to bypass security, steal data, or gain unauthorized access to critical systems. This alert highlights Beijing's growing concerns over technological vulnerabilities and its push for greater self-sufficiency and security in its tech supply chain. The ministry urged citizens to remain vigilant about the devices and systems they use.</p>

          <p>This article posits that Chief Justice John Roberts has been instrumental in expanding presidential power, creating a constitutional framework that legitimizes President Trump's most extreme actions. Through key majority opinions, Roberts has advanced a theory of a "unitary executive" with nearly unchecked authority, particularly regarding the firing of officials and immunity from prosecution. This judicial philosophy, the article argues, has transformed the American presidency into a more authoritarian institution, moving away from the traditional system of checks and balances envisioned by the Framers. The result is a presidency that aligns with Trump's claim to have the right to do whatever he wants.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has been accused of systematically erasing crucial climate change information from federal websites, including the congressionally mandated National Climate Assessments. This move follows the dismissal of all 400 experts working on the next report and the defunding of key climate research programs. Critics and science advocates describe this as "denial by erasure," a strategy to undermine the scientific basis for climate policy and regulation. This unprecedented suppression of federally sponsored research makes it harder to track and respond to the impacts of a changing planet.</p>

This approach, part of the "America First" agenda, has been used to address trade deficits with China and to influence non-trade issues like immigration with Mexico and Canada. While the White House defends tariffs as a source of revenue and leverage, critics warn that the unpredictable "tariff tango" creates global market uncertainty and risks economic slowdown.

          <p>Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has stated the airline is considering an increase to the bonus paid to staff for intercepting passengers with oversized baggage. Currently, staff receive about €1.50 per bag, a practice intended to enforce the airline's strict luggage rules and reduce boarding delays. O'Leary referred to non-compliant passengers as a "scourge," noting that while over 99% of customers comply, the incentive helps manage the issue on full flights. The discussion comes as the EU pushes for standardized free carry-on allowances, a proposal O'Leary predicts will not pass.</p>

          <p>Stellantis, the automotive giant behind brands like Jeep, Fiat, and Vauxhall, has announced that US tariffs have cost the company €300 million. The financial impact stems from the 25% tariff on imported cars, which has reduced the company's shipments to North America and led to a 10% drop in total sales for the second quarter. The tariffs, intended by President Trump to boost American manufacturing, have instead disrupted global supply chains and forced carmakers to absorb significant costs or alter production plans.

The report's primary recommendation is to scrap the economic regulator, Ofwat, and create a single, unified regulator to oversee the industry. It also calls for an end to companies "marking their own homework" on pollution monitoring and for greater control over company ownership and executive accountability. The review acknowledges that bills may need to rise to fund necessary infrastructure investment after a long period of underinvestment.</p>
