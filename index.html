          <p>A man in Polk County, Florida, identified as 42-year-old Timothy Schulz, was shot and killed by sheriff's deputies after exhibiting bizarre behavior, including an apparent alligator attack. Deputies initially responded to reports of a man acting strangely at a convenience store and later found Schulz swimming in a lake with alligators, where he was bitten. After emerging from the water, Schulz wielded garden shears and attempted to enter a patrol vehicle, leading deputies to use a Taser before ultimately shooting him. The incident is under investigation, and the deputies involved have been placed on administrative leave.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump issued a full and unconditional pardon to Scott Jenkins, a former Virginia sheriff convicted of federal bribery charges in December 2024. Jenkins was found guilty of accepting over $75,000 in bribes in exchange for appointments as auxiliary deputy sheriffs, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Trump, in an online post, described Jenkins as a victim of an overzealous Biden Department of Justice, asserting that Jenkins did not deserve to spend a single day in jail. This pardon follows Trump's previous pardons of individuals involved in the January 6th Capitol attack and other controversial cases.</p>

          <p>Former referees' boss Keith Hackett criticized Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) for appointing Thomas Bramall, considered one of the most inexperienced referees in the Premier League, to officiate Aston Villa's defeat by Manchester United. Villa complained to PGMOL about Bramall's "big mistake" that contributed to their missing out on the Champions League. Hackett argued that a top referee like Michael Oliver should have been appointed instead, noting that Oliver was assigned as VAR for another game. The decision to appoint Bramall has raised questions about PGMOL's management and the importance of experience in high-stakes matches.</p>

          <p>President Trump has voiced criticism of President Vladimir Putin's attacks in Ukraine, describing them as "absolutely CRAZY," but has not taken any action to impose new financial sanctions on Russia or provide additional aid to Ukraine. Despite expressing shock at the Russian attacks, Trump has maintained his refusal to join European allies in implementing further economic penalties. Experts note that this pattern creates a strategic void in which Trump complains about Russia's actions but avoids making Putin pay a price, signaling a potential pullback from the conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump delayed imposing 50% tariffs on the European Union until July 9, prompting officials to resume trade discussions. However, the path to de-escalation is fraught with differing priorities and unresolved issues. The United States and the European Union still disagree on key points, including consumption tax systems and digital regulations. While the EU hopes to reduce tariffs, the Trump administration signals that the current 10 percent tariff is likely the new floor. Despite the delay, significant obstacles remain in reaching a comprehensive trade agreement.</p>

          <p>A century ago, electric vehicles were a mainstay, but they lost ground to cheaper gasoline-powered cars, a history that may repeat itself. The Trump administration is working to undercut the growth of electric vehicles and swing federal policy in favor of oil and gasoline. Charging and access to fuel were also concerns a century earlier. The article notes that Republican leaders say that electric vehicles do not deserve subsidies in the tax code and that their tax bill levels the playing field that Democrats had tilted in favor of one technology.</p>

          <p>Analysts warn that the potential for a trade war between the U.S. and the EU has not completely dissipated despite President Trump's delay in rolling out tariffs. The six-week window until tariffs kick in may not be enough time to settle detailed questions, but it should be sufficient to put the framework of a trade agreement in place. Labeling Trump "an interesting negotiator," Schmieding argued that the president often tries to shock those with whom he's negotiating into agreeing to concessions. But the EU, he said, was unlikely to capitulate to these tactics.</p>

          <p>Nine European Union member states, led by Italy and Denmark, are calling for a reinterpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights to make it easier to expel foreign national criminals. The states say they need "more room" to "decide on when to expel criminal foreign nationals" and "more freedom" to track "criminal foreigners who cannot be deported." A political act, it's not a legal way of participating in discussions, but it's more of a political act. Even if the nine states succeeded in sparking a reassessment of the court, they remain bound by other EU and UN rules on migrant rights.</p>

Despite a high strike percentage, Scott's pitches have been hit hard, leading to blown saves and a rising ERA. Pitching coach Mark Prior suggests Scott needs to aim for more "miss" pitches, even if it means walking a few more batters. With several key relievers injured, Scott's performance in save opportunities is crucial for the Dodgers.</p>
