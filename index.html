          <p>Veteran England midfielder Jordan Henderson has signed a two-year contract with Premier League club Brentford following his departure from Dutch side Ajax. The move marks a return to English football for the 35-year-old, who is renowned for his 12-year, trophy-laden tenure at Liverpool. This signing follows brief, less successful spells at Al-Ettifaq in Saudi Arabia and then Ajax, and comes after he received an England national team recall in March.</p>

          <p>An upcoming EU-China summit is overshadowed by significant trade frictions, with the EU raising alarms over its €400 billion trade deficit and Chinese protectionist policies, particularly concerning electric vehicles. Beijing has shortened the planned two-day summit to one, signaling a limited willingness to engage on EU demands for reciprocal market access. A major point of contention is the EU's reliance on China for 98% of its rare earth minerals, which are critical for technology manufacturing, further complicating the tense negotiations.</p>

          <p>Germany's Federal Constitutional Court has dismissed a case brought by two Yemeni men who lost relatives in a 2012 US drone strike. They argued Germany was complicit because signals for the drone were relayed via the US Ramstein air base on German soil. The court ruled that while Germany has some obligation to protect rights abroad, it could not establish that the US acted unjustifiably or that there was a sufficient link to German state authority to assign responsibility.</p>

          <p>The price difference between Hong Kong-listed H-shares and mainland-listed A-shares for dual-listed Chinese firms has reached its smallest point since June 2020. This convergence is attributed to a weaker US dollar prompting global investors to diversify into Hong Kong, alongside strong buying from mainland investors seeking exposure to China's tech sector. Analysts suggest Hong Kong stocks remain attractive due to their valuation and expected capital inflows. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia reported downing over 50 Ukrainian drones overnight across several southern regions, in an attack that comes amid heightened diplomatic activity. The attack follows President Trump's announcement of new weapons for Ukraine and tariff threats against Russia, a move Denmark has already offered to support financially. Meanwhile, EU foreign ministers are meeting to discuss further sanctions on Russia, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing, signaling a complex and escalating international landscape surrounding the war.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new grant scheme to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), offering discounts of up to £3,750 on eligible cars costing less than £37,000. The £650 million program is part of the government's push to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. While the automotive industry has welcomed the move, critics and consumers point to the insufficient number of public charging points as a major barrier to widespread EV adoption.</p>
