          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo is experiencing a period of cautious optimism, with its men's national football team on track to qualify for the 2026 World Cup for the first time since 1974. This sporting success coincides with a fragile peace deal signed with neighboring Rwanda, which could end decades of violent conflict in the nation's mineral-rich eastern region. Experts believe that achieving both peace and World Cup qualification could significantly boost the country's global image, attract investment, and provide young people with alternatives to violence. However, challenges remain, particularly in the underfunded women's football program, which highlights the broader need for sustained development.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the National Education Association (NEA), the largest U.S. teachers union, has strayed from its educational mission to become a highly partisan political organization. Citing leaked resolutions from its recent convention, the author criticizes the NEA for focusing on far-left political causes, such as officially labeling Donald Trump's program as fascism and opposing the abolition of the Department of Education. The piece contends that this political activism comes at the expense of addressing declining student proficiency in core subjects. The author concludes that the union's actions are alienating parents and fueling the school choice and homeschooling movements.</p>

          <h2>A Father Reflects on a Neurodivergent Son's Overwhelming First Major Soccer Match</h2>

          <p>A journalist shares a personal account of taking his nine-year-old, neurodivergent son to his first professional soccer game, a Club World Cup semi-final at MetLife Stadium. Initially overwhelmed by the loud noises, pyrotechnics, and massive crowds, the boy experienced sensory overload and broke down in tears. However, the experience was salvaged by empathetic stadium staff who provided noise-canceling headphones and moved the family to a quieter, more accessible seating area. This act of kindness allowed the son to watch the remainder of the game calmly. The author reflects on how this personal experience provided a grounding reminder of the human element of sport amidst its increasing commercialization.</p>

          <p>Shoppers in the U.S. are increasingly noticing price hikes on everyday items like t-shirts and footwear, a direct consequence of the ongoing trade war initiated by the Trump administration. Retailers, particularly department stores like Macy's that rely heavily on imported goods, are passing on the costs of new tariffs to their customers. While some stores are offering significant sales, many consumers find prices are still higher than before, impacting their budgets for basic necessities. A recent study confirms that apparel and footwear prices have risen, and with further tariffs potentially being imposed, the financial pressure on American households is expected to continue as retailers navigate the difficult economic environment.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse has asserted that the Democratic party and climate activists have been overly cautious in their fight against the fossil fuel industry, which he describes as running a "malevolent propaganda operation." In an interview, the Rhode Island Democrat argued for a more aggressive approach, calling out the industry for avoiding costs associated with the environmental and health damages it causes. Whitehouse criticized his own party for not effectively highlighting what he calls the industry's deceit and its powerful influence over Republican politicians since the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling. He believes a more forceful strategy would resonate with the American public, who he says strongly support climate action.</p>

          <p>UK regulator Ofcom has approved a plan for Royal Mail to cease second-class letter deliveries on Saturdays as part of a significant reform to the postal service. The change, intended to help the company manage rising costs amid a sharp decline in letter volume, will see second-class mail delivered on alternating weekdays. First-class letters will continue to be delivered six days a week, but with slightly relaxed next-day delivery targets. While Royal Mail welcomed the decision as necessary for financial sustainability, the move has drawn criticism from consumer groups and some political parties, who express concern it will lead to a less reliable service without guaranteeing improved performance.</p>

The West African nation was founded in the 19th century for free Black Americans, and English has been its lingua franca since.

His inclusion on the bench signals a remarkable turnaround, as he had previously stepped away from international rugby for personal well-being and was ineligible for England selection after a move to a French club.

This follows the sinking of another vessel, the Magic Seas, days earlier. The Iran-backed group claims it is targeting ships linked to Israel, the US, or the UK in support of Palestinians in Gaza.

The report details new claims against former Bishop Anthony Pierce, who was jailed earlier this year for child sexual abuse, and highlights that concerns about him were first reported to church officials in 1986. Victims are now calling for an independent inquiry, alleging a culture of ignoring abuse and protecting perpetrators within the institution.

While the initial pilot scheme is expected to be limited in scale, returning about 50 migrants per week, it marks a significant diplomatic shift. The ultimate test of the policy's success will be whether it serves as a sufficient deterrent to meaningfully reduce the number of crossings over time.</p>

The move also coincides with a safety recall issued by U.S. regulators because the van's third-row seats do not meet federal standards.

          <p>A former official from China's central bank has argued that the yuan possesses the fundamental qualities to become a safe-haven currency, challenging the traditional dominance of the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc. In a recent article, the authors contended that China's institutional credibility, low inflation, and large foreign reserves provide a strong foundation for the yuan's stability. They noted that the currency has already shown resilience and reduced sensitivity to risk during recent periods of global stress, including the war in Ukraine and shocks from U.S. tariffs. This perspective adds to the ongoing debate over the internationalization of the yuan as confidence in the U.S. dollar is tested by debt and protectionism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vienna is frequently cited as a benchmark for successful housing policy, largely due to its extensive and stable social housing sector, which comprises 43% of the city's housing units. This system, which serves not only low-income but also middle-class residents, keeps rent levels significantly lower than the private market and helps moderate private rents as well. Financed partly by a levy on employee salaries, the model originated in the 1920s and has resisted the large-scale privatization seen in other European cities. While challenges in accessibility and the complexity of the allocation system exist, Vienna's long-term political commitment to treating housing as a basic need offers valuable lessons for other cities grappling with housing crises.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially announced it will impose a 50% tariff on all copper imports, with the new duty taking effect on August 1. President Trump stated the decision was based on a national security assessment, highlighting copper's critical role in manufacturing semiconductors, military equipment, and other essential technologies. The move, which aims to bring copper tariffs in line with recent increases on steel and aluminum, has caused a surge in U.S. copper prices. While the administration's goal is to stimulate domestic production, experts caution that the U.S. currently lacks the capacity to offset its reliance on imports, which could lead to shortages and higher costs.

Senator Tammy Duckworth grilled the nominee on issues such as trade figures and Singapore's strategic importance, at one point telling him he was "unqualified" and needed to "do some homework." Dr. Sinha, a surgeon and long-time friend of Trump, was unable to provide accurate or substantive answers on several topics. The exchange has gone viral in Singapore, prompting questions about his suitability for the critical diplomatic posting, though his confirmation remains likely given the Republican majority in the Senate.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed sanctions on Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur for the Palestinian territories, in a move to punish critics of Israel's military actions in Gaza. The State Department's decision follows a U.S. campaign to have Albanese removed from her post due to her vocal criticism, including describing Israeli actions as "genocide." Albanese, an independent human rights lawyer, has urged other countries to pressure Israel and has supported the International Criminal Court's pursuit of arrest warrants for Israeli officials. Human rights groups condemned the sanctions as an attempt to silence a UN expert for performing her duties and to dismantle international justice institutions.</p>

According to police, the mother, Maya Hernandez, left the children in the running vehicle with the air conditioning on while she received a lip filler procedure at a medical spa. However, her 2022 Toyota Corolla is equipped with an automatic one-hour engine shutoff feature, which police believe deactivated the A/C. The one-year-old was found unresponsive with a body temperature of 107.2 degrees and was later pronounced dead. The mother has been charged with involuntary manslaughter and murder.</p>

President Lai Ching-te observed the live-fire drill, stating the powerful tanks enhance national security. This is Taiwan's first acquisition of new tanks in over two decades. Analysts note that while the Abrams tanks are potent weapons for coastal and urban defense, Taiwan will need to integrate advanced counter-drone technologies to protect them, drawing lessons from their vulnerability in the Ukraine war.

          <p>A North Korean defector plans to file a lawsuit in Seoul against leader Kim Jong Un, seeking accountability for the torture and sexual abuse she endured while detained in the country. The woman, Choi Min-kyung, was forcibly repatriated from China in 2008 before escaping again and settling in South Korea. This will be the first time a North Korean-born defector has taken direct legal action against the regime's leader. While South Korean court rulings against Pyongyang are largely symbolic and unenforceable, human rights groups assisting with the case say it is a significant step for acknowledging the suffering of victims and officially recording their stories in history.</p>

          <p>An investigation by Global Witness has found that some of the world's poorest nations, including Somalia, Haiti, and Yemen, are paying millions of dollars to lobbying firms with strong ties to Donald Trump. These deals appear to be attempts to offset cuts in U.S. foreign aid and secure humanitarian or military support, sometimes by bartering access to crucial natural resources like lithium and cobalt. The report highlights contracts worth $17 million signed within six months of the last election with firms connected to Trump's inner circle. This dynamic raises concerns that desperate, low-income countries are being drawn into exploitative deals that prioritize access to resources over fair and transparent aid.</p>

          <p>Sir Jake Berry, a former Conservative Party chairman and cabinet minister, has defected to Nigel Farage's Reform UK, marking another significant blow to the Tories. In a scathing statement, Sir Jake, who was knighted by Boris Johnson, claimed that two decades of Labour and Tory rule have been deeply damaging to the country. His move follows several other former Conservative MPs who have recently joined Reform. The defection is seen as particularly consequential given Sir Jake's seniority and closeness to Boris Johnson. The trend is forcing the ruling Labour party to shift its political focus, now treating the rising Reform UK as a serious, long-term challenger.</p>

Residents and commuters in the Frankfurt an der Oder and Slubice region express frustration over the political showmanship, which causes traffic delays and disrupts daily life. While the checks are officially about migration control, they are straining a region long seen as a model of European integration and undermining the spirit of the Schengen Area's borderless travel.</p>
