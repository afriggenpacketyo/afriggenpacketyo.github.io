          <p>Firefighters across Europe are battling deadly wildfires, with significant blazes in Greece, Albania, and Turkey. In Greece, progress has been made against four major fires, though the risk remains extremely high, while a forestry worker was killed in Turkey. The widespread heat and dry conditions have stretched resources thin, leading countries like Spain and Albania to request and receive international assistance, including support from the EU's civil protection mechanism. Authorities are investigating various causes, including arson, as the continent grapples with the increasing frequency of these destructive events.</p>

          <p>In response to a Republican effort in Texas to redraw congressional districts to their advantage, California Democrats are preparing a retaliatory redistricting plan. Governor Gavin Newsom has signaled that California could redraw its own maps to create more Democratic-leaning seats, aiming to offset potential GOP gains in Texas. This political maneuvering highlights the intense national battle over gerrymandering, which could significantly impact the balance of power in Congress in the upcoming midterm elections. The process in California is more complex than in Texas, requiring a potential constitutional amendment approved by voters.</p>

The club, which is already facing significant financial and on-field struggles, has stated it will conduct a thorough internal investigation into the matter.

          <p>Bodhana Sivanandan, a 10-year-old from London, has made chess history by becoming the youngest female player to ever defeat a grandmaster in a competitive game. She achieved this record during the British Chess Championships by beating 60-year-old grandmaster Peter Wells. Sivanandan, who only began playing chess during the COVID-19 pandemic at age five, is now being hailed as a remarkable talent in a sport historically dominated by men. Experts believe she is on a path to becoming a grandmaster herself and potentially a future world champion.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) recorded an $8 billion write-down on its "gigaproject" investments, including the futuristic Neom city, despite its total assets growing to nearly $1 trillion. The fund's annual report revealed that investments in these large-scale domestic projects declined, constituting a smaller portion of the overall portfolio. This adjustment comes as the kingdom faces lower global oil prices and a growing fiscal deficit, which could impact future funding for its ambitious Vision 2030 diversification plan. The PIF has been broadening its funding sources, including raising public and private debt. (not investment advice)</p>

Its strategic location, a former Cold War frontline, also provides a practical and symbolic backdrop for the high-stakes talks on the war in Ukraine. This neutral yet historically-charged territory offers a unique setting for diplomacy between the two world leaders.</p>

          <p>Logistics experts warn that while consumers have not yet felt the full inflationary impact of recent tariffs, price hikes are looming as excess inventory sits in warehouses. U.S. importers rushed to front-load freight to avoid higher rates, creating a bottleneck in the "middle mile" of the supply chain. This buildup has temporarily shielded shoppers from price increases on many goods, but as this inventory moves to retail shelves in the coming months, consumers should expect to see higher prices. This situation highlights the complex effects of trade policy on supply chains and consumer costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The upcoming summit in Anchorage between President Trump and Vladimir Putin is framed by their complex and often controversial history. Trump has long expressed a desire to work with Putin, a stance that has drawn criticism, notably during their 2018 Helsinki meeting where Trump appeared to side with Putin over U.S. intelligence. Despite recent expressions of frustration with the Russian leader over the war in Ukraine, Trump remains confident in his ability to broker a peace deal. This history of deference, personal rapport, and recent tension creates an unpredictable dynamic for the high-stakes negotiations.</p>

          <h2>Analysis of UK A-Level Results Shows Boys Outperforming Girls in Top Grades for First Time in Seven Years</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in seven years, boys in the UK have achieved a higher percentage of top A-level grades (A* or A) than girls, reversing a long-standing trend. Boys secured 28.4% of top grades compared to 28.2% for girls, with the gap widening at the A* level. Analysts suggest this shift is partly due to the increasing popularity of STEM subjects like mathematics, which are taken by significantly more boys and tend to award more high grades. While humanities subjects have declined in popularity, business and economics have seen a rise in entries.</p>

          <p>Rebecca Young, a school pupil from Glasgow, has been recognized by Time magazine as one of its "girls of the year" for her invention designed to help homeless people. At age 12, she conceived the idea for a solar-powered blanket that stores heat during the day to provide warmth at night. The concept was developed into a working prototype by an engineering firm, and dozens of units have been distributed to a homeless charity in Glasgow. For her inspiring and impactful invention, Rebecca is being honored alongside nine other young women from around the world.</p>

          <p>This opinion article by Rebecca Solnit argues that President Trump's federal intervention in Washington, D.C. is a hypocritical power grab based on false pretenses about crime. The author contrasts the move with the violence of January 6, 2021, which she notes was instigated by Trump himself, and points out that D.C.'s violent crime is at a 30-year low. The piece frames the takeover as part of a broader right-wing war on diverse, Democratic-leaning cities, using manufactured crises to justify authoritarian control. It suggests the move is also a distraction from other political issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard and assume federal control over Washington, D.C.'s police force is a move that would be hard to repeat elsewhere. As a federal district and not a state, D.C. falls under unique presidential authority during declared emergencies, allowing Trump to command its National Guard directly. In contrast, the governors of the 50 states control their own National Guard units, making a similar federal takeover in cities like New York or Chicago legally and politically far more difficult. Critics argue the D.C. intervention is a political move, as data shows violent crime is at a 30-year low.</p>

          <p>Yue Wa, one of the last affordable grocery markets in Los Angeles's Chinatown, is closing after 18 years, succumbing to a combination of pressures. The owner, Amy Tran, cites a decline in foot traffic due to gentrification, the lingering effects of the pandemic, and fear in the immigrant community following recent ICE raids as major factors. A series of burglaries and assaults at the store and the family's home proved to be the final straw. The closure represents the loss of a vital community hub for the neighborhood's elderly and low-income residents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the historical definition of "genius," tracing its evolution from an innate personal spirit in Roman times to a marker of exceptional, almost magical, talent in the 19th century. It examines how early attempts to scientifically explain genius, such as Francis Galton's work on heredity, were intertwined with the deeply flawed and racist ideas of eugenics. The author notes that while modern genetics acknowledges heritability in intelligence, it cannot fully account for genius, which is also shaped by social conditions, timing, and luck. The piece reflects on how our understanding and use of the word continues to change.</p>

In a legal letter, her lawyers called the allegation "false, disparaging, defamatory and inflammatory," stating it has caused significant harm. Biden made the comment in a recent interview, attributing it partially to a journalist's reporting that was later retracted. In a subsequent interview, Biden defended his comments and appeared unwilling to apologize, welcoming the discovery process a lawsuit would entail.</p>

The summit follows a lapsed deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face new sanctions.

A volunteer firefighter in the León region died from severe burns, marking the third fatality.

Ruth was supposed to be under constant supervision at the Huntercombe Hospital in Berkshire but was left alone for about 15 minutes by an agency staff member who had used false credentials. The hospital, which has since closed, was failing at the time, and the jury found that insufficient staff training and unsuitable care contributed to her death.

The article supports the report's call for open debate, suggesting that policies should be crafted from facts rather than fear, and that insisting "the science is settled" stifles important scientific scrutiny.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the key differences between two major debt relief strategies: debt forgiveness and debt management. Debt forgiveness, or debt settlement, involves negotiating with creditors to pay back less than the full amount owed, but it can significantly damage one's credit score and result in a tax liability on the forgiven amount. Debt management, facilitated by credit counseling agencies, structures a repayment plan to pay the debt in full but with lower interest rates, which is less harmful to credit. The best choice depends on an individual's financial situation, income stability, and long-term credit goals. (not investment advice)</p>
