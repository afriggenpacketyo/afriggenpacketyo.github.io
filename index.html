          <p>The ultra-wealthy are increasingly storing their gold in Singapore due to growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty, with The Reserve, a precious metals repository near Singapore's airport, experiencing an 88% increase in storage orders from the beginning of the year to April. Clients are seeking safe jurisdictions like Singapore, viewed as the 'Geneva of the East,' due to tariffs and potential instabilities. The wealthy are opting for physical gold bars over paper to mitigate counterparty and geopolitical risks, with concerns about the health of the global financial system driving this preference. Spot gold prices are trading near historic levels, currently at $3,346.32 per ounce.</p>

          <p>Three more inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail earlier this month have been captured, according to Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, leaving two escapees still at large. Lenton Vanburen was detained in Baton Rouge, while Leo Tate and Jermaine Donald were arrested in Walker County, Texas. The three men were originally incarcerated on charges ranging from parole violation to second-degree murder, and they will now face additional charges related to the escape. The escape occurred on May 16 when ten inmates broke out of the jail by forcing open a cell door and breaching a wall, and authorities are investigating possible security lapses.</p>

          <p>British-South African endurance athlete Lewis Pugh became the first person to swim around Martha's Vineyard, completing a 60-mile trek over 12 days to raise awareness about the plight of sharks. Pugh, a United Nations Patron of the Oceans, aims to change public perceptions of sharks, which he believes have been unfairly maligned by the film "Jaws." The swim was one of his most difficult, due to cold water, wind, and waves, and it coincided with the New England Aquarium's first confirmed sighting of a white shark this season. Pugh hopes his swim will encourage policy makers to protect sharks, which are being killed at an alarming rate.</p>

          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" reveals that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were fake, more than double the number detected in 2022, though this is also due to more aggressive policies against incentivized reviews. The company defines a fake review as biased or non-firsthand content intended to manipulate a property's reputation. Tripadvisor uses a three-pronged process involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and remove fake reviews. The company's trust and safety team moderated over 4.2 million reviews, and the system relies less on the review's content and more on how it is posted, using AI and behavioral biometrics to detect patterns.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese automakers experienced a second day of decline due to fears of a price war and increased scrutiny from regulators. BYD's Hong Kong-listed shares fell significantly after the electric vehicle giant announced price cuts on May 23. China's commerce ministry is reportedly meeting with industry bodies and automakers to address the practice of marking cars as sold to meet sales targets, with these zero-mileage cars then being sold on the secondhand market. One analyst expects BYD's vehicle margin to be under pressure in the short term due to the need to hit sales targets.</p>

Residents fear that connecting the new homes will increase sewage pollution in the nearby River Great Ouse. The Environment Agency has objected to new developments in other areas due to sewage capacity concerns, and an environmental charity is challenging the planning permission in court. Anglian Water stated in planning documents a decade ago that the local water recycling center lacked capacity for new development, yet permissions for 1,500 homes have been granted since.</p>

They argue that these cuts could be a matter of life and death for some disabled individuals, who already face significant challenges in employment, healthcare, and social situations. Many disabled people rely on Pip and universal credit to cover extra costs associated with their disabilities, such as electricity for breathing equipment or wheelchair charging. The existing scheme to support disabled people in employment is broken, with long waiting lists and potential cuts to support worker elements.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits rose for a second consecutive month in April, with growth improving despite U.S. tariffs and deflationary pressures, supported by Beijing's policy measures. Cumulative profits at major industrial firms climbed 3% compared to a year earlier, accelerating from 2.6% growth in March. The boost in industrial firms' profits was largely due to Beijing's efforts to support the private sector, offsetting some of the negative impacts from the U.S. tariffs. Profits in the high-tech manufacturing industry climbed 9% from a year earlier, with notable improvement in the biopharmaceutical products and aircraft manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elisabeth Moss discusses the ending of “The Handmaid’s Tale” and the journey of her character, June, from a normal person to a figure of true heroism. She emphasizes that the series, based on Margaret Atwood's novel, was always about the women inside the color-coded uniforms, not the uniforms themselves. Moss also used her roles as executive producer and director to focus on the show's look and how June came across on camera, drawing inspiration from Stanley Kubrick's films to convey fury and dark intent. She loves the idea that at the end, June begins to tell the story that is the book, highlighting the circular nature of the narrative.</p>

The firm says the layoffs are due to the challenging period faced by the global motor industry, including tariffs, higher material costs, and slower sales. This move is part of an 18 billion Swedish kronor "action plan" to shake up the business, and it follows a recent announcement that global sales for April fell by 11% compared to the same period last year. Volvo aims to be fully electric by 2030, though it scaled back this ambition due to uncertainties created by tariffs on EVs.</p>
