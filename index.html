          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has terminated approximately $500 million in funding for 22 mRNA vaccine development projects. The canceled projects, primarily targeting COVID-19 and influenza, included proposals from major pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Moderna. Kennedy stated that the administration determined mRNA technology poses more risks than benefits for respiratory viruses, a claim that has drawn sharp criticism from leading infectious disease experts who argue the decision undermines pandemic preparedness and public health.</p>

Alexander believes Darnold, who is coming off a career-best year, will perform even better in Seattle's offensive system under coordinator Klint Kubiak, with whom he has previously worked. Despite the departure of receiver DK Metcalf, Alexander praised the team's offensive weapons and strong defense, boldly predicting an 11-6 record and a playoff berth for the Seahawks this season.</p>

          <p>A hotel in St. Charles, Illinois, where a group of Texas Democratic lawmakers are staying, was evacuated following a bomb threat. The lawmakers left Texas to break a quorum and block a Republican-led redistricting bill. Police conducted a thorough search of the hotel, which housed 400 people, but found no device, and guests were allowed to return safely. The incident has heightened tensions, with Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker ordering a state police investigation into what he called a "threat of violence."</p>

          <p>The new season of the BBC's "MasterChef" has premiered, featuring hosts Gregg Wallace and John Torode, despite both having been fired last month following an investigation that upheld misconduct allegations against them. The BBC decided to air the pre-filmed series for the sake of the contestants, but the episodes appear to be edited to minimize the hosts' banter and jokes. The decision to broadcast the show has faced backlash from some of the women who came forward and has been met with mixed reviews from critics, who noted the show's different, more subdued tone.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the recent resignation of Governor Adriana Kugler, President Donald Trump now has an open seat to fill on the Federal Reserve Board, creating significant implications for the central bank's future. Analysts suggest Trump could either make a short-term appointment or select his long-term choice for Fed Chair now, potentially creating a "shadow chair" to influence policy. This move introduces political intrigue into the historically collegial institution, as Trump has been openly critical of current Chair Jerome Powell and has stated he will only appoint governors who favor cutting interest rates.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, citing New Delhi's continued purchase of Russian oil. This new levy, which brings the total tariff rate on India to 50%, is set to take effect in three weeks and comes on top of other tariffs scheduled to begin this week. The move escalates trade tensions between the U.S. and India and is part of a broader strategy by President Trump to penalize countries that trade with Russia. The Indian government has described the tariffs as "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable."</p>

The cubs—three females and one male—are part of an international endangered species program aimed at preserving the breed in captivity with the long-term goal of reintroducing them to their native habitat in North Africa. While officials say a reintroduction is still a distant prospect, preliminary talks have begun with Moroccan authorities to explore the feasibility of returning the majestic lions to the Atlas Mountains.</p>

          <p>Evghenia Gutul, the pro-Russian governor of Moldova's autonomous Gagauzia region, has been sentenced to seven years in jail on charges of illegal party financing.

Gutul denounced the verdict as "political reprisal," while the Kremlin labeled it as politically motivated. The ruling highlights the ongoing political struggle in Moldova, which is torn between pro-European and pro-Russian factions.</p>

One study found that six to 14 months after the Maui fire, one in five people suffered lung damage and nearly half showed symptoms of depression. Another study noted a near-doubling of suicide and overdose death rates on Maui during the month of the fire. The research underscores the hidden toll of these disasters, including healthcare disruptions and the increased toxicity of modern wildfire smoke.</p>
