        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pakistani officials have accused India of launching a drone attack in the disputed Kashmir region, resulting in casualties and heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors. According to Pakistani officials, India launched multiple drones, most of which were allegedly shot down, but one drone managed to engage a military target near Lahore, causing casualties. India has not yet responded to these claims, which follow recent missile strikes by India inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The escalating violence has sparked fears of a potential war between the two nations, with both sides bracing for further retaliation and engaging in national preparedness exercises. The current crisis was triggered by a massacre of tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, with India accusing Pakistan of backing the terrorists, which Pakistan denies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk has revised its global container market volume growth forecast downward due to increasing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty stemming from U.S.-China trade tensions. While the company posted stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profits, it warned that current U.S.-China trade tariffs could restrict global container market volumes. Maersk now expects container volume growth to be between -1% and 4% for 2025, a revision from its previous forecast of 4% growth. The company's CEO noted that the first quarter's strong demand was a continuation of the previous year's robust economy, but the tariff landscape sparked by the Trump administration is creating complexities for the shipping industry.</p>

          <p>In a New York Times opinion piece, Senator Chris Murphy discusses the challenges facing the Democratic Party in the face of a second Trump administration, arguing that the party was unprepared for Trump's coordinated assault on the rule of law and democracy. Murphy emphasizes the need for Democrats to match Trump's intensity, engage in risk-tolerant tactics, and address the perception that the current version of democracy is rigged in favor of billionaires and special interests. He advocates for campaign finance reform, measures to unrig the economy, and a focus on issues such as wages and corporate power. Murphy also suggests that Democrats should be more tolerant of diverse views on social and cultural issues to build a broader coalition and win over working-class voters.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge in Boston has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to deport migrants to Libya, citing due process concerns. The order came after reports that the U.S. military was preparing to fly migrants to the conflict-ridden North African country. Judge Brian Murphy stated that the deportations would defy a previous injunction protecting migrants' rights. Libya is one of several countries reportedly being considered by the Trump administration for migrant deportations, sparking controversy due to the country's ongoing conflict and instability.</p>

          <p>Nintendo forecasts selling 15 million units of its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, while also reporting its fiscal fourth-quarter and full-year results. The company's projections are tempered by concerns over U.S. tariff rates, particularly on products manufactured in Vietnam, where Nintendo produces its consoles. Despite these concerns, analysts predict strong sales for the Switch 2, citing a large existing user base for the original Switch. Nintendo's President acknowledged that additional tariffs could impact demand in the U.S., and CEO of Kantan Games noted the tariffs create an unclear future for Nintendo, making it hard to make sales predictions.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a trade agreement with Britain, marking the first such deal since the imposition of tariffs on numerous trading partners. The agreement is anticipated to be a significant win for both countries, aiming for closer economic cooperation. Details of the agreement remain unclear, but discussions have included lowering British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, as well as removing taxes on U.S. technology companies. British officials have been pursuing a trade agreement with the United States since Brexit to offset weaker relations with Europe.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The New York Times argues that the U.S. has crossed the line into competitive authoritarianism, where opposition to the government comes with a price. The authors, political scientists Steven Levitsky, Lucan Way, and Daniel Ziblatt, contend that the Trump administration has weaponized government agencies and taken punitive actions against critics, raising the cost of opposition for many Americans. They cite examples such as investigations into political opponents, targeting law firms perceived as unfriendly to the Democratic Party, and threatening universities with penalties. The authors express concern that these actions are silencing watchdogs and checks on executive power, leading to a retreat into silence or acquiescence.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. projects a 34.9% drop in net profit for the current business year, citing the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's higher tariffs and a stronger yen. Despite expecting record sales, the automaker anticipates a decrease in operating profit due to the U.S. trade policies, which are projected to reduce profits by 180 billion yen. Toyota's president noted the difficulty in forecasting the outlook given the fluid nature of the tariffs. The company does not plan to immediately pass the increased costs onto customers, but will continue to develop products tailored to local markets. The yen's appreciation is also expected to significantly impact operating profit.</p>

          <p>Republican-led states are enacting new restrictions on citizen-initiated ballot measures, which opponents say will strip voters of a way to address issues their lawmakers ignore. New laws in states like Arkansas and Florida require petition signers to show photo ID and verify they understand fraud is a crime, while also increasing the threshold for a measure to pass. Advocates argue these laws are designed to suppress voter rights and limit direct democracy, while Republicans claim they are necessary to combat fraud. Groups like the Fairness Project are witnessing a surge in state bills aimed at limiting citizen-initiated ballot measures.</p>

The National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers presidents advocate for better pay and resources, highlighting the need for more teachers to reduce class sizes and provide well-rounded education. The Trump administration's proposed cuts to the Education Department are a major concern, as federal money supports the rights of students with disabilities and provides a portion of total funding for public K-12 schools.</p>

          <p>An interim report states that the root cause of the fire that led to the shutdown of Heathrow Airport remains unknown. The incident, which occurred on March 21, was caused by a fire at a nearby electrical substation and affected hundreds of thousands of journeys. While power was restored to Heathrow's terminals seven hours before flights resumed, the airport is awaiting the final report to determine the cause of the fire. The Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit found no evidence suggesting the incident was suspicious.</p>

          <p>The UK is poised to become the first nation to secure a trade agreement with the U.S. following President Trump's imposition of "reciprocal" tariffs. While a government spokesperson from the UK's Department for Business and Trade emphasized that talks are ongoing and declined to comment on specific details, there is an expectation that the deal is imminent. U.S. Vice President JD Vance indicated that the U.K. has a "good chance" of securing a trade deal. This development comes amidst uncertainty following Trump's remarks that the U.S. does not need to sign deals with trade partners.</p>

          <p>North Korea launched multiple ballistic missiles toward the Sea of Japan, according to South Korea and Japan, marking Pyongyang's first missile activity in almost two months. The missiles were fired from the Wonsan area and flew approximately 800 km before falling into the sea.

The launches occur amid military cooperation between North Korea and Russia in the Ukraine war and ahead of South Korea's presidential election.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rapid analysis by climate scientists reveals that the storms causing death and destruction in the central Mississippi valley in early April were made more likely and severe by burning fossil fuels. The record rainfall was about 9% more intense and 40% more likely due to human-caused climate change, with warm ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico playing a significant role. The National Weather Service, which issued timely warnings, is facing major cuts and staff layoffs, potentially endangering lives in future extreme weather events. The study highlights the need for a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy to mitigate increasingly dangerous extreme weather.</p>

          <p>A new study by researchers from the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) suggests that Chinaâ€™s hypersonic weapons can travel at extreme speeds and be launched from space. The study claims that certain variants of Chinaâ€™s re-entry glide missiles can reach speeds of up to Mach 20 and potentially be launched from space-based platforms. The analysis likely discloses some details for the first time and corroborates earlier reports from the US that critics dismissed as hype. The Financial Times cited US military intelligence claiming China tested two hypersonic weapons released from near-Earth orbit in 2021.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that climate change significantly intensified the deadly storms that struck the Midwest and South in early April, resulting in more intense rainfall. The analysis found that human-caused global warming increased the record-breaking downpours by approximately 9%. The intensity of the storms was partially attributed to unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, exacerbated by climate change. The study also raises concerns about ongoing staff shortages at the National Weather Service and the increasing strain on insurance markets due to more frequent and severe weather events.</p>

The sale, which drew criticism from Buddhist academics, was suspended to allow for discussions between the parties.

The collection, known as the Piprahwa Gems, was unearthed in northern India nearly 130 years ago.</p>
