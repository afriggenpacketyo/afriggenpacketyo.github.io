          <p>An unidentified North Korean man successfully crossed the heavily fortified land border into South Korea and is now in custody. The South's Joint Chiefs of Staff tracked the individual near the military demarcation line and conducted a "guiding operation" to safely secure him from the mine-strewn Demilitarized Zone. Authorities plan to investigate the incident, which occurred amidst recent heightened border tensions involving propaganda balloons and warning shots. This event highlights the ongoing delicate relationship between the two Koreas.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer discussed his positive relationship with US President Donald Trump, attributing it to shared family values. Starmer revealed that their first conversation occurred after Trump was shot at a rally, and Trump later called him following the death of Starmer's brother. He emphasized that building strong relationships with international leaders, including Trump, is crucial for national interest, particularly in securing vital trade deals. This personal rapport has reportedly helped mitigate the impact of US tariffs on UK industries.</p>

          <p>India's Securities Exchange Board (SEBI) has temporarily barred US firm Jane Street Group from its securities market and frozen over $566 million in alleged illegal gains. SEBI accuses Jane Street of widespread market manipulation, specifically influencing the Nifty 50 index through aggressive trading and rapid reversals to profit from options. The regulator cited the "intensity and sheer scale" of the firm's actions, despite prior advisories, to protect market integrity and retail investors. Jane Street disputes the findings and intends to engage further with SEBI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has announced it will levy anti-dumping tariffs on European cognac, primarily from France, for the next five years, effective Saturday. The Ministry of Commerce stated that its investigation found evidence of dumping, causing a "material threat of injury" to China's domestic brandy industry. This decision, with dumping margins ranging from 27.7% to 34.9%, was announced just ahead of a Chinese foreign minister's visit to Paris. No retroactive duties will be imposed on imports prior to this new measure.</p>

          <p>A bin strike in Birmingham, UK, has continued for six months, causing "apocalyptic" piles of rubbish and a pervasive stench, particularly impacting student housing areas. Residents express frustration over uncollected waste and suspended recycling services, with the city's recycling rate now among the lowest in the country. Members of the Unite union initiated the strike in January over plans to downgrade roles as part of the city council's efforts to address equal pay liabilities. Despite ongoing efforts, a resolution to the industrial action remains elusive.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" has passed Congress, marking a significant legislative victory, but sparking debate over its impact. The bill includes extensive tax cuts, massive increases for immigration controls and military spending, and incentives for fossil fuels, while cutting health and social programs. Nonpartisan analysts project it will add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over a decade. Critics, including former Trump ally Elon Musk, express concern over the debt and the estimated 17 million people who could lose healthcare coverage by 2034. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pitcher Dustin May delivered his best start of the season, leading the Dodgers to a 6-2 victory over the Chicago White Sox and completing a series sweep. May pitched into the eighth inning for the first time, scattering four hits and striking out nine, providing much-needed stability for the Dodgers' injury-plagued pitching staff. His performance is particularly significant as he has struggled historically around this time of year. This outing highlights May's growing dependability, boosting the team's confidence as key pitchers return from injury.</p>

Service members are strictly prohibited from direct contact with individuals in ICE custody. This deployment is part of a broader military effort to strengthen border presence, drawing criticism from liberal figures like California Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>

          <p>Former NBA player Ben McLemore has been found guilty by an Oregon jury of sexual assault, unlawful sexual penetration, and sexual abuse. The charges stemmed from an October 2021 party, where prosecutors argued the victim was incapacitated by alcohol and unable to consent. McLemore's defense claimed consensual sex. The victim testified she froze in terror during the assault, seeking only justice rather than financial compensation. Sentencing is scheduled for Wednesday, marking a significant legal outcome regardless of the score.</p>

Russia's foreign ministry emphasized mutual respect and constructive engagement. This recognition contrasts sharply with widespread Western condemnation of the Taliban's human rights violations, especially concerning women and girls, highlighting differing international approaches to the regime.</p>

          <p>China has reiterated its commitment to tackling excessive competition and oversupply in its solar photovoltaic (PV) industry, which continues to expand globally. Industry and Information Technology Minister Li Lecheng emphasized the need to govern the industry through laws, address "disorderly low-price competition," and guide companies toward improving product quality and phasing out outdated capacity. President Xi Jinping also recently targeted excess industrial capacity. The move aims to ensure healthy and sustainable development, though it remains to be seen if this renewed vow will be different from past efforts.</p>
