          <p>Rice prices in Japan have more than doubled in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, following similar surges in previous months, prompting the government to release emergency stockpiles. This spike coincides with Japan's core inflation rate climbing to 3.7%, the highest since January 2023, exceeding economists' expectations. JP Morgan Asset Management suggests that reducing rice prices could boost household spending if the reductions extend to processed foods and restaurants. Despite rising geopolitical tensions potentially impacting energy prices, Neuberger Berman anticipates a waning of food price pressures in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is weighing potential military action against Iran, including targeting its nuclear facilities, with a decision expected within two weeks, sparking fears of escalation and retaliation. This consideration breaks with attempts by Cabinet officials to distance the U.S. from the Israeli-Iranian conflict. Lawmakers from both parties are pushing for congressional approval before any military engagement in Iran, citing the War Powers Resolution. Critics express concerns about violating international law and endangering U.S. officials, while supporters argue that decisive action is necessary to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>China has maintained its benchmark lending rates, keeping the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%, following monetary easing measures implemented last month.

The players, along with their coach and FIFA president, were presented with jerseys but spent most of the time listening to Trump discuss politics, particularly U.S. involvement in the Israeli-Iranian conflict. One player described the experience as "a bit weird" and expressed a desire to focus on playing soccer rather than engaging in politics. The visit included an awkward moment when Trump questioned whether a woman could make their team.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with federal immigration authorities in order to receive transportation funding. The ruling sided with 20 plaintiff states that argued the administration lacked the authority to tie transportation dollars to immigration enforcement. The judge stated that Congress did not authorize the Secretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on federal dollars appropriated for transportation purposes. This decision prevents the administration from coercing state and local governments into enforcing federal immigration policy.</p>

While an attack could cripple Iran's nuclear weapons capability, it would not eliminate it, as Iran has the knowledge, experience, and resources to rebuild.
