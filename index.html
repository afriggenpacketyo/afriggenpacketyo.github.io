            <p>A food service worker at Florida State University, Robert Morales, was among those killed in an on-campus shooting. The alleged gunman, 20-year-old Phoenix Ikner, opened fire near the student union building, injuring six others before being shot by police. Morales' sister posted a tribute online, highlighting his dedication to his job. The incident prompted a campus-wide alert and a brief lockdown, leaving students shaken and mourning the loss of life in what is being called a senseless act of violence. Doctors confirmed that the injured victims are expected to make a full recovery.</p>

            <p>The ACLU is fighting the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants, arguing that it violates due process. Attorneys claim their clients are at "imminent risk" of being deported to El Salvador, potentially within hours, without a fair chance to challenge their removal. The administration argues that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua constitutes a "hybrid criminal state" invading the U.S., justifying the use of this wartime authority. A federal judge initially denied the ACLU's request for a restraining order, but the legal battle continues amidst concerns about the migrants' rights.</p>

Governor Jenniffer Gonz√°lez stated that the remaining outages were due to separate, unidentified issues, while criticizing Luma for an insufficient system. The blackout was triggered by a transmission line failure that caused generators to shut down, also impacting water services for hundreds of thousands of customers.

            <p>President Trump has threatened to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, citing concerns about antisemitism on campus and accusing the institution of not doing enough to protect its Jewish students. This action follows the administration's freezing of over $2.2 billion in federal funding and pressure to release disciplinary records of international students involved in protests. Legal experts note that revoking Harvard's tax exemption would be a complex process with significant financial implications for the university, potentially impacting its endowment and donor contributions. Harvard maintains that there is no legal basis for such an action.</p>

            <p>The Trump White House has replaced government websites providing COVID-19 information with a new page dedicated to the theory that the pandemic originated from a lab leak in Wuhan, China. The new page criticizes the Biden administration's pandemic response and singles out Dr. Anthony Fauci. Scientists have expressed mixed reactions, with some criticizing the site as political propaganda that misrepresents scientific evidence. The move reflects the Trump administration's focus on transparency and its belief that the American people deserve to know the truth about the pandemic's origins.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is implementing a new rule to reclassify some career civil servants as "at-will" employees, making it easier to fire them for poor performance or subversion of presidential directives. The White House says the rule empowers agencies to remove employees in policy-influencing roles without lengthy procedural hurdles. The Office of Personnel Management estimates about 50,000 positions will be affected. Civil service employees currently have more protections than political appointees, intended to prevent turnover between administrations.</p>

            <p>Good Friday, a religious day for Christians, is not a federal holiday but is recognized as a state holiday in twelve U.S. states, leading to the closure of state offices in those areas. While postal services remain open, stock markets and many Catholic and Christian schools are closed. Banks typically follow the Federal Reserve holiday schedule, but some may have reduced operating hours. Most public libraries are open, while retailers and grocery stores generally remain open but may have adjusted hours.</p>
