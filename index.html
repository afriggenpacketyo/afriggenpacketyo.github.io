          <p>Edan Alexander, an American-Israeli hostage held by Hamas since October 7, 2023, has been released, with Hamas citing hopes for a lasting ceasefire and renewed humanitarian aid to Gaza as the impetus. Alexander, who was serving in the Israeli military when abducted, was transferred to the Red Cross and then to the Israel Defense Forces. Negotiations for the release involved contacts with the U.S. administration, and Hamas expressed readiness for intensive talks to end the war and establish a prisoner exchange, though Israel denies committing to a ceasefire or releasing terrorists. Meanwhile, reports indicate a dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, with a high risk of famine due to restricted aid and ongoing military operations.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have presented their tax bill, aiming to extend several provisions from the 2017 Trump tax law, including lower income tax rates and a larger standard deduction, which are set to expire at the end of the year. The bill also introduces new temporary tax breaks, such as exemptions for tips, overtime pay, and a $4,000 bonus deduction for older Americans, while raising the state and local tax deduction limit to $30,000. To offset the costs, the legislation proposes tax increases on clean energy subsidies, university endowments, and remittances sent overseas, expected to add $2.5 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. The bill faces opposition from some Republicans who seek a higher state and local tax deduction cap, signaling challenges in securing enough votes for passage.</p>

          <p>A museum dedicated to Oskar Schindler and the Jews he saved during World War II has opened at a former textile factory in Brněnec, Czech Republic, marking the 80th anniversary of the war's end. The site, once stolen by the Nazis and turned into a concentration camp, now houses the Museum of Survivors, displaying the history of Schindler, his wife Emilie, and the Löw-Beer family, who originally owned the plant. The museum features testimonies of Holocaust survivors and aims to be a universal place for sharing survivor stories and promoting education. While the museum is currently focused on educational activities for schools, plans are underway to fully restore the remaining buildings, including Schindler's office and the barracks where the Jewish prisoners lived and worked.</p>

          <p>Counter-terrorism police are investigating fires at two London properties connected to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, treating them as suspected arson attacks. One fire occurred at Starmer's private home in north London, causing damage to the entrance, while another damaged the front door of a house converted into flats in Islington. Authorities are also investigating a car fire as part of the probe. The Prime Minister's office has acknowledged the incidents, thanking emergency services for their work, but declined to comment further due to the ongoing investigation.

          <p>American Bitcoin, a bitcoin mining firm co-founded by Eric Trump, is merging with Gryphon Digital Mining to go public on the Nasdaq, marking the Trump family's deepening involvement in cryptocurrency. The company aims to mine bitcoin below market cost and build a reserve of the cryptocurrency, aligning with President Trump's pledge to make the U.S. a "bitcoin mining powerhouse." However, bitcoin mining is controversial due to its energy-intensive nature, and the Trump family's crypto ventures have drawn criticism for potential conflicts of interest. Senate Democrats have pushed for regulations to limit elected officials' participation in crypto ventures, accusing Mr. Trump of "crypto corruption."</p>

          <p>The top 220 buyers of the $TRUMP cryptocurrency have won access to an exclusive dinner with President Trump, creating a bidding war for direct access to the president. The contest has drawn criticism from Democrats and ethics watchdogs, who allege potential conflicts of interest and corruption, as the coin could allow foreign entities to purchase influence with the president. Despite the controversy, the White House claims Trump is abiding by all conflict of interest laws, while the price of the $TRUMP coin has fluctuated wildly since its debut. Concerns have been raised that the anonymity afforded by the blockchain could be exploited by foreign governments or unscrupulous individuals seeking to enrich the President.</p>

          <p>President Trump's second administration is facing scrutiny for potential corruption, as it increasingly mixes public office with personal benefits. The administration's plan to accept a $400 million luxury jet from the Qatari royal family is the latest example of this trend, with Trump expected to transfer the plane to his presidential foundation after leaving office. This move, along with other instances such as Trump's cryptocurrency venture and auctioning off access to him, demonstrates a disregard for traditional legal and political guardrails around public service. The Justice Department's disbanding of a cryptocurrency crimes unit and narrowing of enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act further raise concerns about conflicts of interest and ethical standards.</p>

          <p>A former top campaign aide to Kamala Harris claims that Joe Biden's decision to remain in the 2024 presidential race for too long ultimately undermined Harris's campaign. David Plouffe, a former Obama campaign manager, described Harris's campaign as a "fucking nightmare" due to Biden's late withdrawal. The book, "Original Sin," details concerns about Biden's cognitive skills and alleged efforts by his staff to conceal his decline. The book also describes how Obama and others attempted to persuade Biden to drop out of the race, but were unsuccessful until it was too late.</p>

          <p>President Trump appointed Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, as the acting librarian of Congress, leading to a staff revolt at the Library of Congress. Staff members refused access to two Justice Department officials selected by Blanche for key roles, citing the need for Congressional input. The Library's staff is recognizing Robert Newlen as the acting librarian until it gets direction from Congress. The move has been criticized as a power-hungry assault on the legislative branch.</p>

          <p>A group of 59 white South Africans has arrived in the US to be granted refugee status under a Trump administration plan, citing racial discrimination as the reason, though the South African government disputes these claims. This move has sparked controversy, as it contrasts with the halting of other refugee admissions, including those from warzones, leading to accusations of a racial double standard. The US has criticized South Africa's land policies, while claims of a genocide against white people in South Africa have been widely discredited. The situation has strained relations between the US and South Africa, with accusations of race-baiting and politically motivated actions.</p>

CPB leaders denied that request, citing federal law that establishes the independent nonprofit outside of the control of the federal government. The request comes as the president is launching a broad assault against the country's two largest public broadcasters. At the same time, the informal Department of Government Efficiency has sought to embed itself in numerous independent agencies Trump wants to shutter.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration welcomed a group of white South Africans as refugees, citing persecution, a claim South Africa denies. The arrival of the group has sparked controversy amid the White House's broader crackdown on immigration.

The documents, intended to spread Nazi ideology in Argentina, arrived from the German embassy in Tokyo in 1941. Argentinian customs officials found Nazi propaganda, postcards, photographs and thousands of notebooks from the National Socialist German Workers' Party Organization Abroad and the German Trade Union. The contents will now be scanned, digitized, and reviewed to uncover information about the Holocaust and the regime's financial activities.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose and then walk back triple-digit tariffs on Chinese products highlights the power and limitations of U.S. trade policy. While the tariffs disrupted global trade, they also proved too painful for American businesses, leading to a temporary reduction in levies. The agreement to lower tariffs has eased market anxieties, but questions remain about whether the trade disruptions were worth the limited concessions from China. The situation underscores the challenges of using aggressive trade tactics against an economic power with similar might.</p>

The attorney general is seeking a $10,000 fine for each day the gas line wasn't marked and wants a special monitor appointed to ensure the company complies with the law.</p>

          <p>The health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., believes toxic chemicals in food are behind the U.S. explosion in rates of obesity and a range of other chronic illnesses. The United States allows food companies to self-certify the safety of many chemicals without prior Food and Drug Administration approval. This is because of a regulatory pathway known as GRAS, or “generally recognized as safe.” Regulators also don’t routinely re-examine chemicals already on the market — checking if new science has emerged suggesting they might be dangerous — something European regulators do.</p>

The ban had been indefinite, lasting until Al Jazeera, which is funded by Qatar, "corrected its legal status," though they did not detail the accusations against the broadcaster. Al Jazeera's bureau chief in Ramallah said the broadcaster's offices there would not be immediately reopened because they had also been shut by Israeli military order.</p>
