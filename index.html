          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced plans to sue the Trump administration for deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles without his consultation.  Newsom criticized the deployment as illegal and immoral, citing the federal government's action as an escalation of protests following immigration enforcement operations. The deployment followed clashes between law enforcement and protesters, resulting in arrests. Newsom's office confirmed a prior conversation with Trump, but the timing and content remain unclear.</p>
