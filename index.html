        <h2>Analysis of Claims About the Department of Education and its Functions</h2>

        <p>This article examines three claims made by President Trump regarding the Department of Education (DOE).  It refutes his claim that the US ranks last in education while spending the most per pupil, citing data showing the US's performance is above average in some areas and average in others. The article also challenges Trump's assertion that DOE employees don't work or show up, presenting evidence from interviews with DOE employees affected by recent layoffs.  Finally, it counters the claim that returning education to states would significantly change the system, as the federal DOE's role in funding and oversight is limited.</p>
