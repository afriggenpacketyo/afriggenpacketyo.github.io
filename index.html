          <p>Millions of mobile phones across the United Kingdom emitted a siren-like sound as part of a national test of the emergency alert system. The drill, which lasted for about ten seconds, is the second of its kind and aims to ensure the system's effectiveness in warning citizens about life-threatening events such as severe weather or public safety emergencies. While officials deemed the test a success, noting that tens of millions of phones received the alert, some minor technical glitches were reported. The system has already been used in real emergencies, including for flood warnings and the discovery of a WWII bomb.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has confirmed that its Azure cloud services are experiencing disruptions due to several undersea fiber optic cables being cut in the Red Sea. The damage is causing increased latency for internet traffic passing through the Middle East, affecting services in countries like India, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates. While the cause of the cuts remains unconfirmed, the incident highlights the vulnerability of critical global internet infrastructure, with past events in the region raising concerns about potential sabotage.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asserted that President Donald Trump's recent summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska primarily served the Russian leader's interests. In an interview, Zelenskyy expressed that Putin achieved his goal of meeting with the U.S. president, which enhances his image on the world stage, while Ukraine was notably absent from the discussions. The critique comes as Russia launched a record aerial assault on Ukraine, striking a government building in Kyiv and killing several civilians. Zelenskyy reiterated his call for increased pressure and sanctions on Russia, emphasizing that energy is Putin's primary weapon.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who passed away from leukemia in 2006 at age 15, has been declared the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known as "God's influencer," Acutis used his computer programming skills to spread the Catholic faith online by documenting miracles, making him a relatable figure for young people. The canonization ceremony, led by Pope Leo XIV in St. Peter's Square, drew tens of thousands of pilgrims. Acutis's preserved body, dressed in jeans and sneakers, is displayed in a glass tomb in Assisi, reflecting his modern identity and impact on a new generation of believers.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured a dominant victory for Red Bull at the Italian Grand Prix, but the race was marked by controversy surrounding McLaren's team orders. Lando Norris, who had been running in second place, was given the position back from teammate Oscar Piastri after a slow pit stop had dropped him behind. The team instructed Piastri to yield, citing strategic team reasons, a decision Piastri audibly disagreed with but ultimately followed.

The driver, a 51-year-old man, was tracked to his home after the red, Ferrari-liveried vehicle was seen again on the D4 motorway. Police had previously been unable to press charges because the driver's helmet obscured his identity. The vehicle, identified as a Dallara GP2 car, is not street legal, and the owner now faces a fine for driving without essential features like headlights, indicators, or license plates.</p>

          <p>The advancement of artificial intelligence is poised to disrupt traditional career paths by eliminating a significant portion of entry-level jobs, potentially ending the classic "career ladder" narrative. As AI automates routine tasks, roles that have historically served as the first step for corporate advancement are disappearing, a trend supported by data showing a 50% decline in new-hire roles for recent graduates at major tech firms since 2019. This shift creates a flatter organizational structure but also pressures new graduates to acquire advanced skills independently, without the benefit of on-the-job training. Experts believe this will reshape how talent is developed and integrated into the workforce.</p>

The author contends that the more critical issue is the broader economy's ability to absorb inevitable price increases.

Dr. Golshevsky advises creating a soothing environment that mimics the womb with warmth and white noise, but stresses flexibility over rigid routines.

          <p>Arizona State Senator Analise Ortiz, a Democrat, is facing an ethics complaint and calls for her expulsion from the Republican-led chamber. The controversy stems from her res-haring an Instagram post from a community group that warned of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity near an elementary school. Republican colleagues accuse her of jeopardizing officer safety and tipping off individuals, while Ortiz defends her action as protected First Amendment speech intended to inform her community. The complaint, which she calls an act of intimidation, seeks her expulsion or, alternatively, removal from all committees and the loss of her staff.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores President Trump's Frequent Use of 'Never Seen Before' Hyperbole</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump's frequent use of phrases like "the likes of which nobody's ever seen before" has become a defining feature of his rhetoric, escalating in his current term. An analysis shows he has used variations of the phrase nearly 200 times this year, far outpacing previous years in office. This rhetorical habit reflects his governing style, framing issues in black-and-white terms where his successes are unprecedented and national problems are unparalleled crises requiring drastic action. While sometimes factually accurate, the claims are often a form of "truthful hyperbole" used to promote his agenda and consolidate power.</p>

          <p>Over 15,000 protesters gathered in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, urging Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to secure a deal for the release of remaining hostages held by Hamas and to end the war in Gaza. The demonstrations, among the largest in recent months, included families of the hostages who expressed anger and fear that an expanded military offensive would further endanger their loved ones. Despite growing domestic and international pressure, Netanyahu's government has shown no signs of halting the conflict, vowing to achieve total victory over Hamas and preparing for a major ground incursion into Gaza City.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick, now head coach for the University of North Carolina, confirmed that he has banned scouts from the New England Patriots from attending his team's practices. Following his first victory with UNC, a 20-3 win over Charlotte, Belichick stated bluntly that since he is not welcome in the Patriots' facility, they are not welcome in his. The comments underscore the apparent deterioration of the relationship between the legendary coach and the NFL franchise he led for nearly 25 years. The win provided some relief for Belichick's new program after an embarrassing season-opening loss.</p>

          <p>London Underground staff have begun a five-day strike over pay and working conditions, leading to significant disruption across the city's transport network. Members of the RMT union are demanding a pay increase and a reduced 32-hour work week to address fatigue, initiating rolling action that will see little to no service on most Tube lines until Thursday. Transport for London (TfL) has offered a 3.4% pay rise but rejected the shorter work week as unaffordable. The strike, the first to close the entire network since March 2023, is causing other services like the Elizabeth line to be much busier than usual.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: China's Increased Coal Use Serves as a 'Shock Absorber' for Its Rapid Renewables Expansion</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 08:30:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that China's simultaneous expansion of both coal power and renewable energy is a pragmatic, rather than contradictory, climate policy. While China is adding record amounts of solar capacity, grid limitations and intermittent power sources like hydropower, affected by droughts, create instability. In this context, new coal plants function as a crucial backup or "shock absorber," ensuring grid stability and preventing blackouts during peak demand. This strategy allows grid operators the confidence to continue approving and connecting massive amounts of new renewables without risking the country's energy security during its transition.</p>

          <p>The United States Tennis Association (USTA) is facing criticism for its decision to ask broadcast partners not to show any crowd disruptions or negative reactions directed at Donald Trump during the US Open men's final. This move is being described as hypocritical and cowardly, particularly for an event that often televises other fan disturbances and prides itself on a vibrant, unfiltered atmosphere. Critics argue that by attempting to shield a political figure from public disapproval, the USTA is sacrificing the event's authenticity and undermining democratic expression. The organization defended its request as consistent with its policy on off-court disruptions.</p>

In 2008, while preparing to move to a smaller apartment, she realized she had far too many clothes and conceived of a website to sell them. After confirming with friends that this was a common problem, she and a co-founder quickly launched a basic site that gained popularity through word of mouth. Despite early mistakes, including a failed attempt to add commission fees, the platform grew into a major player in the second-hand fashion market.</p>

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a statement encouraging public school students to recite the Lord's Prayer, reflecting a new state law allowing time for prayer and religious texts. His specific endorsement of Christian prayer has drawn criticism and accusations of promoting Christian nationalism, especially given his past actions. In 2017, Paxton's office raised concerns about a prayer room used by Muslim students in a Frisco high school, suggesting it was exclusionary despite school officials stating it was open to all faiths. Critics argue this demonstrates a clear double standard and an attempt to breach the separation of church and state.</p>

          <p>The head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), a Donald Trump appointee, used a highly unusual process to refer Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook for a criminal mortgage fraud investigation. Experts and former officials call the director's personal involvement "bizarre," noting such matters are typically handled by the independent Office of Inspector General to ensure impartiality. The accusations, which Cook denies, claim she misrepresented her primary residence on loan applications and have been used by Trump as grounds to fire her. This has fueled widespread belief that the referral is politically motivated to remove her and install loyalists at the Federal Reserve.</p>

          <p>A group of women who were sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein gathered at the U.S. Capitol to demand that Congress pass the Epstein Files Transparency Act. The bipartisan bill would compel federal agencies to release all documents related to the disgraced financier's sex trafficking network, regardless of who might be embarrassed. Survivors shared powerful testimonies, stating that the unsealed files could help them piece together their experiences and hold powerful individuals accountable. They expressed frustration with the slow pace of the House investigation and threatened to release their own list of names if lawmakers continue to delay.</p>
