          <h2>China's Exports Surge Despite Plunging Shipments to the U.S.</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced a surprising surge in April, growing by 8.1%, even as shipments to the U.S. plummeted by 21% due to the impact of recently imposed tariffs. While imports saw a slight decrease of 0.2%, the overall export growth exceeded expectations, indicating a resilience in China's trade sector. The Chinese government is actively assisting exporters in redirecting sales to the domestic market, a strategy that could potentially lead to increased deflation within the economy. The article highlights the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, as well as the measures both countries are taking to mitigate the economic consequences of tariffs.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer have unveiled the framework of a new trade agreement between the U.S. and the U.K., which aims to boost trade, create jobs, and open market access for both countries. While the 10% tariff on U.K. imports will remain in place, the deal includes provisions for tariff-free treatment of the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers each year. The agreement also anticipates increased access for U.S. agricultural products and reduced non-tariff barriers for American imports, with further details expected in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>Despite Russia's announcement of a three-day ceasefire, Ukrainian soldiers and civilians in the Donetsk region report ongoing attacks and distrust of Russian intentions. The article recounts the experiences of soldiers on the front lines who continue to face shelling and drone attacks, and civilians who have been displaced by the conflict and remain fearful. Ukrainian President Zelensky has rejected the ceasefire, calling for a longer truce, while others express a desire for peace but emphasize the need for caution in dealing with Russia.</p>

          <p>Analysts are questioning the benefits of the new US-UK trade deal, with some suggesting it offers limited substantive benefits for the US. While the agreement maintains the 10% import tax imposed by President Trump, it also walks back some import taxes on strategic sectors like cars and steel. In exchange, the US hopes to expand sales of American beef, ethanol, and other agricultural products in the UK.</p>

          <p>Chinese academics are advocating for a revised narrative of World War II, challenging the "Western-centric" view by pushing the start date back to 1931 with Japan's invasion of Manchuria. This perspective aims to emphasize China's role in fighting against fascism, rather than focusing solely on Germany's 1939 invasion of Poland. The call for a reevaluation comes as countries worldwide commemorate the 80th anniversary of the war's end.</p>
