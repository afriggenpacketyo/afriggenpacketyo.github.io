          <p>Pre-excavation work is set to begin at the site of a former mother and baby institution in Tuam, County Galway, Republic of Ireland, where investigators discovered human remains in 2016. The remains are believed to belong to babies and children up to three years old who resided at the institution, which was run by the Bon Secours Sisters until its closure in 1961. The excavation will be overseen by the Office of the Director of Authorised Intervention, ensuring the recovery, forensic analysis, respectful memorialization, and dignified burial of the remains. The initial phase involves setting up the site with security and hoarding, and family members will have the opportunity to view the perimeter in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>In Hawaii, scientists are using drones to release male mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia bacteria into forests to combat avian malaria, a disease devastating native honeycreeper bird species. The male mosquitoes, which don't bite, mate with local females, resulting in eggs that don't hatch, thereby reducing the mosquito population. This innovative approach aims to protect endangered bird species threatened by climate change, which is allowing mosquitoes to spread to higher elevations. The effort is led by a coalition of organizations known as Birds, Not Mosquitoes, and the technique has been successful in controlling mosquito-borne diseases in humans elsewhere.</p>

          <p>CBS News sources report that President Trump rejected an Israeli proposal to assassinate Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The discussion between Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly occurred after Israel's recent large-scale attack on Iran. While Netanyahu avoided directly confirming or denying the report, he stated that Israel does what it needs to do, focusing on nuclear and military targets rather than political leaders. Trump warned Iran against retaliating against U.S. targets and suggested that a deal between Iran and Israel is possible, citing his past success in de-escalating conflicts.</p>

          <p>Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is a significant contributor to global warming, trapping far more heat than carbon dioxide over shorter periods.

A new report from the International Energy Agency indicates that methane emissions from energy production are still rising, Researchers are using ground-based sensors, aerial monitors, and satellites to better understand methane sources, revealing that underappreciated sources like coal mines and small oil and gas facilities contribute significantly.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term in office is facing scrutiny over alleged conflicts of interest and ethical breaches, with critics accusing him and his administration of using their positions for personal enrichment. Examples include the Qatari government's gift of a luxury jetliner to be repurposed as Air Force One and lucrative business deals involving Trump's family. Watchdogs and ethics experts have raised concerns about potential quid pro quo arrangements and the erosion of ethical norms. Senator Chris Murphy has described Trump's administration as a "pay-for-play" system, while ethics lawyer Kathleen Clark has characterized the situation as the "looting of America."</p>

This shift is driven by Washington’s push for “friendshoring” and the “China+1” strategy, as well as Chinese firms exploring lower-cost regions.

Trump's efforts at rapprochement have disrupted Russia's propaganda apparatus and foreign policy strategy, forcing the Kremlin to portray Washington as a rational negotiating partner. Putin has had to improvise, competing with Zelensky to convince the White House of the other's unreasonableness. Trump's economic policies, including tariff wars, have intensified fiscal pressure on the Kremlin, while his desire for a settlement between Russia and Ukraine has created a complex dynamic for Putin.</p>

          <p>Ekrem Imamoglu, the imprisoned mayor of Istanbul and a prominent rival of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, appeared in court on charges of threatening and insulting a top judicial official. The case centers on comments Imamoglu allegedly made about Istanbul's chief public prosecutor, questioning his integrity. Imamoglu faces over seven years in prison and a political ban for allegedly targeting, threatening, and insulting persons working in the fight against terrorism. He has been detained since late March in a separate corruption investigation, which he claims is politically motivated.</p>

          <p>In Bat Yam, an Israeli city south of Tel Aviv, residents express strong support for Israel's ongoing attacks on Iran despite a recent Iranian missile strike that killed eight people and caused extensive damage. Locals believe that Israel must continue its military actions against Iran to prevent further attacks, including the potential use of atomic weapons. The ballistic missiles used by Iran are more powerful than those previously fired by Hamas and Hezbollah, highlighting the escalating nature of the conflict. Residents whose homes were damaged or destroyed remain resolute in their support for Israel's military response.</p>

In response, the Israeli military says it has destroyed over 120 surface-to-surface missile launchers in Iran, targeting the Quds Force. The fighting has led to the cancellation of talks on Iran's nuclear program between the U.S. and Iran. President Trump reportedly opposed an Israeli plan to assassinate Iran's Supreme Leader, while the U.S. State Department has issued a directive to embassies stating that the U.S. is not involved in Israel's actions against Iran.</p>

However, staffing cuts at federal agencies, ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency, could impede these efforts. Gov.
