          <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is blocking Department of Justice political nominations in protest of President Trump's plan to accept a luxury jet from Qatar. Schumer calls the move corrupt and a national security threat, demanding Attorney General Pam Bondi testify before Congress. While Republicans hold the Senate majority, Schumer's move could slow down the nomination process. The controversy arises amid ethical questions about Trump accepting such a gift from a foreign government. </p>

          <p>Small businesses are challenging President Trump's tariffs in federal court, arguing they are an unlawful expansion of executive power under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The businesses claim the tariffs, imposed due to trade deficits, do not meet the legal standard for a national emergency. The Department of Justice defends the tariffs, asserting Congress permits the president to impose them and that Trump's declaration of a national emergency broadens his authority. This case marks the first time a federal court is hearing a challenge to Trump's tariffs, with a panel of three judges presiding.</p>

          <p>Microsoft is laying off 3% of its workforce, affecting about 6,000 employees across all levels and geographies. The company cites organizational changes necessary to position it for success in a dynamic marketplace. This decision follows better-than-expected results and an upbeat forecast in late April. The layoffs are likely Microsoft's largest since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023 and are not performance-based.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in April rose 2.3% on an annual basis, slightly less than economists expected, indicating that price hikes remain above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Housing costs were a major driver of inflation, while energy costs also increased despite lower gasoline prices. Grocery prices dropped slightly, with egg prices declining 12.7% but remaining near historic highs due to bird flu outbreaks. Economists are watching for signs that Trump's tariffs are affecting consumer prices, although the impact may not be evident in economic data for several months.</p>

The Federal Reserve is also in a wait-and-see mode, unwilling to lower interest rates until the inflationary effect of the tariffs is known.
