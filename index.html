          <p>The WNBA has launched an investigation into the Seattle Storm's coaching staff following reports of alleged misconduct toward a former player. The investigation was prompted by a complaint accusing an assistant coach of using profanity toward the unnamed player. The Storm had previously conducted an internal investigation into allegations of bullying and harassment by the coaching staff, which concluded without finding any violations of workplace misconduct. The team has directed inquiries to the league, which has not yet commented on the matter. The league's review will determine if any further action is necessary.</p>

          <p>Jared Isaacman, founder of Shift4 Payments, addressed his withdrawn NASA nomination, stating his "brief stint in politics was a thrilling experience." President Trump pulled the nomination after a review of Isaacman's prior associations, possibly related to donations to Democrats, but Isaacman believes the timing was linked to Elon Musk's criticism of Trump's spending bill. Isaacman, who has led private spaceflights with SpaceX, noted Musk's increasing attacks on the bill, which he called a "disgusting abomination." Isaacman will step down as CEO of Shift4, succeeded by Taylor Lauber, while remaining as executive chairman. His continued involvement suggests a dedication to the company's future.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer suggests that Nvidia's advanced graphics chips could serve as a valuable asset for the U.S. in its trade negotiations with China. He argues that while many U.S. businesses rely on Chinese manufacturers, Nvidia's products are highly desirable to China. However, the Trump administration's restrictions on Nvidia's exports to China may hinder the company's potential leverage. Cramer emphasizes the need for the U.S. to negotiate effectively with China, given the current economic dependence on Chinese manufacturing. The potential use of Nvidia chips as a bargaining chip could influence the dynamics of the trade war.</p>

Judge Brian Murphy mandated his return after the Justice Department admitted it had no witness to verify its account of O.C.G.'s removal.

          <p>The Federal Reserve's latest "Beige Book" report indicates that the U.S. economy has experienced a slight contraction over the past six weeks, with hiring slowing and concerns about tariff-related price increases. All districts reported elevated levels of economic and policy uncertainty, leading to hesitancy in business and household decisions. Hiring remained "little changed" across most districts, with lower labor demand and reports of layoffs in certain sectors. Prices are rising at a moderate pace, with expectations of faster cost increases due to higher tariff rates. The report suggests a cautious outlook for the near-term economy.</p>

Farmers rely on fungicides to mitigate the risk, but scientists worry about mutations. The FDA monitors for toxins produced by the fungus to prevent excessive contamination in the food supply.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an order doubling tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from 25% to 50%, aiming to bolster the American steel industry. The UK received a carve-out, maintaining duties at 25%. Critics warn of potential disruptions to steel producers outside the U.S. and retaliatory actions from trade partners. Canada, a major supplier, anticipates devastating effects on its industry. Economists suggest the tariffs could lead to job losses in sectors reliant on these metals, as prices rise for U.S. businesses.
