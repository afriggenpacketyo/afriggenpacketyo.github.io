          <h2>Trump Administration Considers 'Baby Bonus' to Boost Birth Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 07:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is exploring pronatalist policies, including a $5,000 'baby bonus' for mothers, to encourage Americans to have more children, drawing mixed reactions. While proponents argue such bonuses could provide financial relief to new parents, critics view them as a distraction from broader issues like inadequate social safety nets and reproductive rights. Some also express concern that these policies are driven by a desire to reinforce traditional gender roles and limit abortion access, rather than genuine support for families. The effectiveness of baby bonuses in significantly boosting fertility rates remains questionable, with some experts suggesting they may only influence decisions for those already considering pregnancy.

          <p>Pfizer reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates, despite a decrease in sales largely due to diminishing COVID-19 revenue. The pharmaceutical company is expanding its cost-cutting initiatives to achieve additional savings of $1.2 billion by the end of 2027, primarily by reducing selling, informational, and administrative expenses. These savings will be reinvested into Pfizer's product pipeline, as the company aims to recover from the decline of its COVID-19 business and stock price. The earnings per share were reported at 92 cents adjusted versus the expected 66 cents, while revenue reached $13.72 billion against the anticipated $13.91 billion.</p>

          <p>General Motors (GM) reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings but is reassessing its full-year financial guidance due to the uncertainty surrounding ongoing auto tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The company is suspending additional stock buybacks amid expected cost increases resulting from the tariffs. GM's CFO, Paul Jacobson, stated that the prior guidance cannot be relied upon until the impacts of the tariffs are clearer. While GM believes it may be able to offset 30% to 50% of the North American tariffs, significant investments in the U.S. may be required depending on the final levies.</p>

The violin, built in 1941, remained unnoticed for decades until art dealers in Hungary sent it for repairs. Kempa's note explained the poor quality of the wood and tools used, despite his skilled craftsmanship. The instrument, now called the "violin of hope," is the only known instrument built inside Dachau, where at least 40,000 people died.</p>

While the Court's Republican majority has often supported Trump, their commitment to traditional conservative principles and concerns about executive power could lead them to break with the president.

          <p>A study reveals a shifting pattern in partisan trust in the Federal Reserve, with Republicans expressing less faith in the institution compared to Democrats following the recent presidential election. Historically, Americans tended to trust the Fed more when their party controlled the White House, but this trend did not hold true this time. Despite their distrust, Republicans were more likely to believe that inflation will be lower in the future, potentially attributing it to Trump's policies. Democrats, while expressing higher faith in the Fed, were more concerned about inflation.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney led the Liberal Party to a narrow victory in Canada's election, securing a fourth term and a mandate to counter President Trump's trade policies and threats to Canadian sovereignty. Carney, a former central banker, criticized Trump's attempts to 'break' Canada and vowed to defend the country's interests. The Liberal Party fell short of a majority, requiring potential support from smaller parties. Pierre Poilievre, the Conservative leader, lost his seat in Ottawa, despite his party gaining a larger share of the popular vote.</p>
