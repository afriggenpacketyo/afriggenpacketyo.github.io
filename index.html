          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 00:12:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has urged China to intervene and prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global shipping route. This request follows reports that the Iranian parliament approved a plan to potentially block the strait, though the final decision rests with the Supreme National Security Council. Disruption of oil supplies through the Strait of Hormuz could severely impact the global economy, especially countries like China, a major buyer of Iranian oil. The US has increased its defense presence in the region to prepare for possible Iranian counterattacks, and analysts warn that the situation could escalate, driving up oil prices which would affect the cost of many everyday goods.</p>

          <p>Following US President Donald Trump's announcement of attacks on three nuclear sites in Iran, world leaders have expressed a range of reactions. Iran has vowed to respond, reserving all options to defend its sovereignty, while Israel praised Trump's decision as history-changing. The United Nations warned of a dangerous escalation threatening global peace, and China strongly condemned the attacks, singling out Israel's role. European leaders called for de-escalation and a return to negotiations, with the EU stressing that Iran must not develop nuclear weapons, and Middle Eastern nations like Saudi Arabia and Qatar expressed concern and urged a ceasefire.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City is utilizing ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary, allowing voters to rank up to five candidates in order of preference. This system aims to ensure that the elected candidate has broader support, as votes are redistributed from eliminated candidates until one candidate reaches a majority. The process involves multiple rounds of tabulation, with the candidate receiving the fewest first-choice votes being eliminated in each round until a winner emerges. While this method aims to reduce wasted votes and prevent candidates with fringe views from winning, it can also be complex and less transparent than traditional elections.</p>

          <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile has unveiled its first images, showcasing its ability to deeply explore the universe. The images reveal colorful gas and dust clouds in a star-forming region 9,000 light years away, highlighting the telescope's capacity to transform our understanding of the cosmos. This observatory, equipped with the world's most powerful digital camera, will conduct a 10-year survey of the southern night sky, mapping the Milky Way, detecting killer asteroids, and answering crucial questions about dark matter. The telescope's design ensures high image quality by using a unique three-mirror system and maintaining strict darkness within the observatory to capture faint astronomical light.</p>

The observatory, equipped with a large telescope and a massive digital camera, will gather data on approximately 40 billion celestial objects. By repeatedly imaging the same areas, the observatory will detect changes and movements in the sky, alerting researchers to transient phenomena like exploding stars and asteroids. The data collected is expected to revolutionize astronomy by allowing scientists to mine vast amounts of information and study the universe in unprecedented detail.</p>

General Dan Caine, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reported "severe damage and destruction" to facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, though a full battle damage assessment is still pending. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth stated that all precision munitions struck their intended targets with the desired effect. Meanwhile, the UN nuclear watchdog chief expressed caution, noting that it was too early to assess the damage at Fordo.</p>

The Thunder's strong second-half performance sealed the victory, despite the Pacers' initial lead and the injury to Tyrese Haliburton. The win represents the culmination of the Thunder's rebuild and establishes them as the youngest team in nearly half a century to win an NBA title.</p>

          <p>Oil markets are experiencing increased volatility as the US has joined the conflict between Iran and Israel, leading experts to predict potential triple-digit oil prices. The market is closely monitoring Iran's response to the US strikes on its nuclear facilities, with threats of blocking the Strait of Hormuz adding to the uncertainty. Analysts warn of unprecedented supply disruptions and potential escalation of the conflict, which could drive oil prices towards $100 per barrel. The Strait of Hormuz is a crucial artery for global oil trade, and any disruption could have severe economic consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Nashville ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, previously deported to El Salvador's CECOT prison, can be released on bail while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges. The judge stated that the government failed to prove Abrego Garcia was a flight risk. However, it is anticipated that Abrego Garcia will likely be taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) due to an immigration detainer. Another hearing is scheduled to set conditions for his release, though his actual release remains uncertain due to the potential ICE detention.</p>
