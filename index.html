Critics argue that reducing the number of intelligence officials could compromise America's ability to stay safe at home and abroad. This move is part of a broader trend of radical downsizing within the National Security Council during Trump's second term, and it is a restructuring characterized by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The cuts could have far-reaching implications for the U.S. government's ability to gather and analyze intelligence.</p>

          <p>British-South African endurance athlete Lewis Pugh completed a 62-mile swim around Martha's Vineyard to raise awareness about the importance of protecting sharks. Pugh, a United Nations patron of the oceans, hopes to change public perception of sharks, often villainized in popular culture, and highlight the threats they face. He described the swim as one of the most challenging of his career due to the cold water, strong winds, and the presence of sharks. Pugh aims to draw attention to the ecocide of sharks, with approximately 274,000 being killed globally each day.</p>

Trump also criticized immigration policies and referenced his Truth Social posts, drawing mixed reactions. The speech comes amid ongoing tensions with Russia over the war in Ukraine, with Trump labeling Vladimir Putin as "crazy."</p>

          <p>While the unemployment rate remains low, a report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) suggests a different picture of the labor market. LISEP's "true rate" of unemployment, which includes unemployed workers, those seeking full-time work, and those in low-wage jobs, stood at 24.3% in April. This measure aims to capture nuances missed by traditional unemployment data, such as workers struggling to make ends meet. The report also highlights disparities among different racial and gender groups, with Hispanic, Black, and female workers experiencing higher rates of functional unemployment (not investment advice).</p>
