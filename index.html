        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A gunman killed one person and injured others at a Dallas ICE field office before taking his own life. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence, citing evidence of an ideological motive after finding unspent shell casings with anti-ICE messages engraved on them. The attack prompted senior Trump administration officials to condemn what they described as extreme left-wing rhetoric against the law enforcement agency. This shooting is the latest in a series of violent incidents targeting ICE facilities in Texas.</p>

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported that attempts were made to intercept the drone before it hit. While the Houthi rebel group has not officially claimed responsibility, they have previously launched missiles and drones toward Israel in solidarity with Palestinians. This incident marks one of the most serious attacks attributed to the group in terms of casualties, escalating regional tensions.</p>

          <p>A federal advisory panel, recently reconstituted by the Trump administration, has issued new recommendations that weaken previous guidance on COVID-19 shots and certain childhood immunizations. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) shifted the COVID vaccine to a "shared clinical decision-making" model and voted against a combination MMRV vaccine for young children. These changes, which still require CDC approval, could create confusion and complicate vaccine access in some states. Health experts advise patients to consult trusted providers, as some regional health alliances and insurers have pledged to follow the former, broader guidelines.</p>

          <p>The UK's Home Office has announced the arrival of the first family under its new "one in, one out" migrant agreement with France. The scheme, established by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and President Emmanuel Macron, involves the UK accepting a refugee with a valid protection case for every migrant returned to France who had their asylum claim withdrawn or deemed inadmissible. This development follows the recent removal of four migrants from the UK to France, as the government aims to deter people-smuggling gangs. Over 30,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats this year.</p>

          <p>Plans for the Northern Powerhouse Rail line, a key infrastructure project intended to connect major cities in the north of England, have been delayed again. An announcement expected at the upcoming Labour Party conference has been postponed due to concerns over the long-term costs of the Liverpool to Manchester segment. Officials are reportedly conducting an extended review to avoid the costly mistakes and delays that have plagued the HS2 project. The repeated delays have frustrated Northern mayors who see the project as vital for boosting the region's economy.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, a candidate for the Labour Party's deputy leadership, has stated she has been the victim of "sexist briefings." In an interview, she addressed recent rumors that she would be sacked from her Cabinet role, which proved to be untrue. Phillipson is competing against Lucy Powell for the position vacated by Angela Rayner. She also commented on the culture within the Prime Minister's office, suggesting that some colleagues have felt excluded from the team, and emphasized her goal to unite the party.</p>

          <p>A new report from VantageScore reveals a significant increase in payment delinquencies even among "superprime" borrowers, those with the highest credit scores. This trend signals that widespread economic pressures are affecting households previously considered financially stable, with credit card balances and unsecured loans on the rise. To avoid missing payments, consumers are advised to explore strategies like debt consolidation to lower interest rates and simplify bills. Other options include enrolling in a debt management plan with a credit counseling agency or proactively communicating with lenders about potential hardship. (not investment advice)</p>

Known scientifically as Drymonema larsoni, this species was only identified in 2011 and can weigh over 50 pounds with tentacles extending up to 70 feet. Jace Tunnell of the Harte Research Institute noted their appearance is linked to the abundance of their primary food source, moon jellyfish.

          <p>A podcast from The Atlantic explores the parallels and differences between the political violence and polarization of the 1960s and the current era in the United States. Historian Geoffrey Kabaservice discusses the assassinations of figures like Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, comparing the societal chaos of that time with contemporary tensions. The analysis notes that while the 1960s began with a sense of hope that later soured, the current period feels like a continuous cycle of radicalization. The discussion also highlights how technology, particularly social media, now amplifies awareness of polarization and disseminates outrage more rapidly.</p>

The report warns that species extinction and ecosystem loss are particularly critical, having moved far into the high-risk zone.

          <p>The brief suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" is being examined by media analysts as a significant event in the ongoing debate over free speech and press freedom in the U.S. New York Times reporter Adam Liptak and former Washington Post editor Marty Baron argue that the Trump administration is increasingly using federal power to control public discourse. The controversy surrounding Kimmel's comments on the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, and the subsequent pressure on the ABC network, is seen as an example of this trend.

However, economists offer mixed predictions on its effects, suggesting it could boost domestic hiring in some sectors like technology but potentially slow overall long-term economic growth. Some experts argue that U.S.-born computer programmers could benefit, while others point to research showing that H-1B workers often help firms expand and create additional jobs for native-born Americans. The White House maintains the policy is necessary to protect American workers from being replaced by cheaper foreign labor.</p>

Kimmel stated it was never his intention to make light of the murder and criticized what he called "un-American" and "dangerous" threats to free speech, alluding to pressure from President Trump and the FCC. The show's return was preempted by some local ABC affiliates, highlighting the ongoing controversy. Kimmel's reinstatement was praised by some celebrity supporters but criticized by others who felt his apology was insufficient.</p>

          <p>An independent review has found that the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) engaged in unlawful surveillance of journalists and used their phone numbers to detect leaks from police staff. The report by Angus McCullough KC revealed 21 unlawful attempts to uncover reporters' sources, double the number previously admitted. It also detailed a practice where journalists' phone numbers, provided to the PSNI press office, were systematically checked against police call logs in "defensive operations" against leaks. The PSNI Chief Constable acknowledged the need to improve processes and stated the "blanket searching of journalists" has since stopped.</p>

          <p>Following an election that saw Peter Mutharika stage a political comeback against incumbent Lazarus Chakwera, Malawi's next leader will inherit a nation grappling with severe economic turmoil. Widespread public frustration over the past five years of hardship, marked by soaring inflation and rising poverty, was a key factor in the election's outcome. Experts state the new administration must prioritize restoring fiscal discipline, implementing austerity measures, and tackling corruption to stabilize the economy. Citizens express cautious optimism, emphasizing the urgent need for policies that provide tangible relief and make basic goods affordable again.</p>

          <p>A wildfire near the north shore town of Paia on Maui prompted officials to issue evacuation orders, sound emergency sirens, and conduct door-to-door warnings on Tuesday. The fire grew to over 100 acres, sparking fear among residents still mindful of the devastating Lahaina fire in 2023. However, firefighters were able to halt the blaze's forward progress, and evacuation orders were lifted later in the day as the threat receded. The incident demonstrated a more proactive emergency response compared to last year's tragedy, which was criticized for the failure to activate warning sirens.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma's state superintendent, Ryan Walters, has announced a plan to establish chapters of the conservative youth group Turning Point USA in every high school across the state. The move is framed as a way to counter "woke indoctrination" from "radical leftist teachers' unions" and to honor the legacy of the group's founder, Charlie Kirk, who was recently assassinated. Walters stated that schools refusing to open a chapter could face losing their accreditation. The initiative represents the first government-led effort to promote the organization's high school program, which has seen a surge in interest following Kirk's death.</p>

The advice also covers retirement strategy, explaining how the "rule of 55" could allow for penalty-free 401(k) withdrawals.
