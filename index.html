            <p>Design software company Figma has confidentially filed for an initial public offering with the SEC, 16 months after its $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated due to regulatory concerns in the UK. The San Francisco-based startup, valued at $12.5 billion in a recent tender offer, had annual revenue of approximately $600 million as of early last year. Figma's software is widely used by designers for collaborative prototyping of websites and apps, and the IPO filing occurs amidst a largely dormant tech IPO market since late 2021, despite earlier hopes for a revival following promises of less burdensome regulations.

While Trump has expressed interest in the idea, stating it would apply to "really bad people," legal experts argue it would violate numerous constitutional provisions, including the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. They suggest a potential loophole might exist for naturalized U.S. citizens who committed fraud during their naturalization process, but emphasize that unrelated crimes cannot be the basis for denaturalization and deportation.</p>

            <p>President Trump's approach to governing, characterized by a mix of authoritarian tactics inspired by figures like Nayib Bukele and Viktor Orbán, may ultimately backfire and strengthen resistance to his policies. While Trump admires the strongman tactics of Bukele and the subtle manipulation of law by Orbán, his attempts to combine these approaches in the U.S. could lead to a backlash. Trump's disregard for legal constraints and showy displays of power may inflame opposition and prevent him from fully consolidating power, potentially safeguarding American democracy.</p>

            <p>The United States has removed sanctions on Antal Rogán, a close aide to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, citing that the punitive measures were "inconsistent with US foreign policy interests." The Secretary of State informed Hungary's Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó of the decision. The two also discussed strengthening US-Hungary alignment on critical issues and opportunities for economic cooperation. The Biden administration had imposed sanctions on Rogán in January over alleged corruption.</p>

            <p>A new CDC study indicates that 3% of children, or one in 31, have been identified with autism, a significant increase from previous years. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cited the figures as evidence of a growing "epidemic" of autism. CDC scientists suggest the rise in diagnoses may reflect improved screening and access to autism services. The study also found higher autism prevalence among Asian, Black, and Hispanic children compared to White children.</p>

Nearly half of samples just outside the burn scar’s boundary had lead levels above the state limit.

            <p>The Supreme Court is considering Trump v. Wilcox, a case that could significantly limit the independence of federal agencies from presidential control, potentially impacting the Federal Reserve and other regulatory bodies. The case centers on whether the president can fire officials who are supposed to be independent, and could lead to the overturning of Humphrey’s Executor, a landmark decision that protected the Federal Trade Commission from undue presidential influence. A ruling in favor of Trump could make him the most powerful president in American history.</p>

            <p>President Trump threatened to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, escalating a battle over alleged antisemitism on campus and ideological biases in academia. The move follows the administration's freezing of over $2.2 billion in grants and contracts to Harvard after the university rejected demands to alter its teaching and admissions policies. The threat has raised concerns among higher education leaders, who view it as an attack on academic freedom. Some fear that it could set a precedent for other institutions.</p>

Since the memo was sent by Assistant Secretary Anderson, however, all Army libraries were told this week to only "flag" rather than remove any books, said a U.S. official not authorized to speak publicly, adding that a final decision for removing books will be made by top Army officials.</p>
