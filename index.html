            <p>Austan Goolsbee, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, suggests that Trump's tariffs could lead to an 'artificially high' economic activity due to preemptive purchasing by businesses and consumers. This surge may be followed by a slowdown in the summer as people have already stocked up on goods before potential tariff increases. Sectors like the auto industry are particularly likely to build up inventories now. Goolsbee remains optimistic about the longer-term economic outlook, citing steady employment and declining inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A draft executive order from the Trump administration outlines significant changes to the U.S. State Department, including shuttering embassies in Southern Africa and eliminating bureaus focused on democracy, human rights, and international organizations. The order aims to "streamline mission delivery" and align the department with an "American First Strategic Doctrine." Diplomatic presence in Canada would be drastically reduced, and hiring practices would prioritize alignment with the president's foreign policy vision. Current officers who do not wish to participate in the reorganization may voluntarily leave with a buyout.</p>

Zelensky denounced Putin's truce declaration as a "PR" exercise and accused the Kremlin of creating "a general impression of a ceasefire".

            <p>Donald Trump is reportedly interested in attracting wealthy immigrants to the United States, potentially through the sale of citizenship or residency in exchange for investment. This aligns with a trend of countries offering "golden-visa" schemes. While many find the idea of commodifying national belonging distasteful, Trump and market proponents see potential efficiency in such arrangements. America's existing scheme is considered cumbersome and underpriced, suggesting a possible area for reform under a Trump administration.</p>

            <p>An Israeli investigation into the killings of 15 Palestinian medics in Gaza last month concluded there were "professional failures" and a deputy commander will be fired. The investigation found an "operational misunderstanding" and a breach of orders led to the incident. Initially, Israel claimed the medics' vehicles lacked emergency signals, but video evidence contradicted this. The investigation also asserted that six of those killed were Hamas members, although this is disputed. The findings have been turned over to the Military Advocate General for potential charges.</p>
