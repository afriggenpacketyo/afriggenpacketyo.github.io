          <p>President Trump has indicated he plans to send National Guard troops to Chicago to address violent crime, a move that could escalate his use of federal forces in U.S. cities. He stated his administration has the right to intervene even without a request from Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, who has called the president's remarks "unhinged." This potential deployment faces strong opposition from local leaders, who are prepared to challenge the action in court, raising questions about federal authority over state-run Guard forces.</p>

          <p>Rep. Julie Fedorchak of North Dakota revealed she was recently assaulted by a group of youths in Washington D.C., highlighting what she calls "out of control" crime in the capital. Speaking at a press conference, she praised the Trump administration's decision to federalize the city's police and deploy the National Guard to restore order. Fedorchak and other Republican colleagues argued that congressional action is necessary to ensure the city is safe, contrasting with Democrats who attribute the move to political motivations.</p>

          <p>Shares of Google's parent company, Alphabet, jumped 8% in after-hours trading following a federal judge's ruling in its landmark antitrust case. The court decided against the Department of Justice's most severe proposal, which would have forced Google to sell its Chrome browser. While Google must end exclusive default-search-engine contracts and share some search data, investors reacted positively to the company avoiding the worst-case penalties, viewing the outcome as a significant win for the tech giant.</p>

          <p>In a major antitrust ruling, a federal judge has ordered Google to alter its business practices but stopped short of forcing a divestiture of its Chrome browser. The decision requires Google to end exclusive contracts that made it the default search engine on many devices and to share some user interaction data with rivals. Judge Amit Mehta's ruling, which also establishes a compliance oversight committee, is the most significant outcome in a tech antitrust case in over two decades, though it falls short of the DOJ's more aggressive demands.</p>

          <p>Authorities have released a 699-page booklet of evidence photos from the investigation into the University of Idaho murders, offering a glimpse into the life of convicted killer Bryan Kohberger. The images, taken at his Washington apartment, show academic materials, personal belongings, and two birthday cards he received just days after the November 2022 stabbings. One card, apparently from his parents, and another from a friend provide a jarring look into his personal world following the murders for which he was sentenced to life in prison.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has conducted a "precision strike" on a boat that originated from Venezuela and was allegedly carrying drugs, according to officials. President Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed the action, with Rubio stating the vessel was operated by a "designated narco-terrorist organization." This strike heightens tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela, following the recent deployment of U.S. warships to the region for an anti-drug mission, which Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has condemned as a threat.</p>

          <p>Musician Drake has placed a $300,000 bet on world No. 1 Jannik Sinner to win the US Open, a wager that would pay out over half a million dollars. The bet has drawn attention due to the "Drake Curse," a popular narrative that the subjects of his large public wagers often lose. This phenomenon has been noted across various sports, including a previous losing bet on Taylor Fritz against Sinner in the 2024 US Open final, making his wagers a recurring cultural subplot at major sporting events.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals facing substantial credit card debt, such as $20,000, financial experts suggest several structured approaches to regain control. Options include working with a debt relief company for management or settlement, or consolidating multiple debts into a single loan with a potentially lower interest rate. Alternatively, personal strategies like the "debt avalanche" or "debt snowball" methods can be effective, as can increasing income through a side hustle or making significant budget cuts to free up funds for repayment.

While the administration plans to appeal, logistics professionals report that businesses are in a holding pattern, unsure if the tariffs will ultimately be lifted and if collected duties will be refunded. The decision adds another layer of complexity to supply chain management, which has been volatile throughout the year due to the ongoing trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

The legal battle and the hotel's use have led to months of local protests, prompting the council leader to call for calm and restraint amid what he described as "great strain" on the town.</p>

The article suggests that while street theft remains a concern, the perception of widespread violent crime, particularly in tourist areas, may be misaligned with current statistical trends.</p>

The lopsided loss serves as a reality check for the new white-ball captain and raises questions about the team's preparation and player fatigue, given the demanding summer schedule that has seen players switching between different formats with little rest.</p>
