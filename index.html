          <p>BTG Pactual, a major Brazilian investment bank, is exploring opportunities for expansion in Asia, with a potential new office in Hong Kong. This move is driven by increasing demand for data centers among Chinese AI firms, as trade and investment ties between China and Brazil grow stronger despite global trade tensions with the U.S. BTG's partner, JoÃ£o Scandiuzzi, mentioned that many Chinese companies, especially in the electricity sector, seek investments in Brazil through them, highlighting the importance of fostering the Brazil-China relationship. BTG previously had an investment office in Hong Kong but closed it around 2015 after former UBS personnel left. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An advice columnist for Vox explores the ethical dilemma of students using AI to cheat in humanities courses. The author argues that the true value of humanities education lies in the formation of human persons and the cultivation of virtues like practical wisdom, rather than simply producing academic work. She suggests that educators should be honest with students about the real benefits of a humanities education and offer them choices about using AI, while also incorporating reflection exercises to promote critical thinking. By adding cognitive friction back into the learning process, educators can help students develop the reasoning skills they need to navigate the complex ethical challenges posed by emerging technologies.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to modernize its airspace, potentially leading to quicker flights, fewer delays, and reduced climate change impacts. The UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) will redesign flight paths, many of which were established 70 years ago, to allow planes to climb and descend more smoothly. Aviation Minister Mike Kane stated that modernizing airspace is a simple way to reduce pollution from flying and prepare the industry for sustainable technologies like flying taxis. While the changes are not expected to take effect for several years, industry leaders have expressed support for the initiative, emphasizing the need for swift action.</p>

The FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted terror attack, citing ideologically motivated violence and witness accounts indicating the suspect yelled "Free Palestine" during the attack. The attack occurred during a Run for Their Lives walk, an event aimed at raising awareness about the hostages in Gaza, and has prompted the cancellation of future events.</p>

Eurasia predicts that if Lee is elected, he will contend with the dual challenges of reviving South Korea's economy and completing a "package" agreement with the U.S. by July.

          <p>Months after Hurricane Helene, some North Carolinians are still struggling to find affordable housing. The storm caused widespread damage, exacerbating an existing housing shortage in areas like Asheville. Many residents were displaced and face challenges finding temporary or permanent housing, while the storm also impacted the local economy. Efforts are underway to address the housing crisis, including community-led initiatives to repair mobile homes and advocate for policy changes.</p>

Seres-backed Aito, which uses Huawei tech, announced that it had delivered 44,454 vehicles, setting a new record.

As Beijing tightens export restrictions, there is a growing risk to the Pentagonâ€™s military readiness and supply chain security. China dominates the global supply of rare earths, including more than 90 per cent of the worldâ€™s processing and refining. In December, the Chinese commerce ministry imposed export bans on gallium, germanium and antimony to the United States, which affects American military end users.</p>

          <p>A new book, The Family Dynamic by Susan Dominus, examines how sibling relationships, including birth order and achievements, affect a personâ€™s life trajectory. Studies suggest eldest children may perform better on cognitive tests, possibly due to increased parental attention. The author reflects on her own experiences as the eldest of three, noting the tendency to take on responsibility. While birth order archetypes may be simplistic, sibling influence is powerful and can shape individuals' interests and emotional robustness.</p>

Russia proposed another attempt at peace negotiations with Ukraine on Monday in Istanbul, but both sides remain firmly entrenched in their positions on territorial disputes and sovereignty that have thus far made substantial progress unlikely. Despite this limited diplomatic progress, the fighting on the ground continues unabated. Trump has been showing signs of frustration over the process, suggesting that he is prepared to "just back away" and allow the fighting to continue if the two leaders can't make progress soon.</p>

However, the move has been criticized by opposition parties, who question the need for external auditors and express concerns about transparency and data security.
