          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix announced its readiness for mass production of next-generation HBM4 high-bandwidth memory chips, crucial for AI computing. This development positions the company ahead of rivals like Samsung and Micron, particularly as HBM4 is anticipated to be a key component for Nvidia's upcoming Rubin architecture. The announcement led to a significant surge in SK Hynix's stock, reflecting strong investor confidence and the company's dominant market leadership in HBM technology. This strategic move is expected to further boost its record profits from HBM demand.</p>

          <p>Russia and Belarus have initiated joint military exercises, codenamed Zapad, near the Belarusian-Polish border, following a recent incident where Poland downed Russian drones. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha met with his Polish counterpart in Kyiv to discuss shared security concerns and Ukraine's EU and NATO accession. Moscow asserts the drills, which involve tens of thousands of soldiers and the training of new Oreshnik missiles, are not aimed at any specific country. However, the timing coincides with escalating regional tensions and Russia's ongoing conflict with Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Over 300 South Korean workers, detained during a US immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia, have returned home, sparking diplomatic concerns. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and Hyundai's CEO criticized the raid, warning it could deter future foreign investment in the US. Seoul is now negotiating with Washington for new visa options for its workers, while the White House defends the operation, emphasizing the need for foreign companies to adhere to US immigration laws. The incident has caused significant delays in the factory's opening and strained US-South Korea relations.</p>

          <h2>UK Economy Experiences Zero Growth in July, Signaling Expected Slowdown in Latter Half of 2025</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy recorded zero growth in July, aligning with economists' expectations and putting pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of the Autumn Budget. This stagnation follows a stronger second quarter and is largely attributed to a contraction in production output, despite slight increases in services and construction. Analysts predict a broader economic slowdown in the latter half of 2025, influenced by factors like trade adjustments and public spending. The Bank of England faces a challenge balancing fiscal uncertainty with persistent inflation, with a potential rate cut anticipated in November. (not investment advice)</p>

While Kuiper has a comparatively small number of satellites in orbit, this deal injects new competition into a sector where Starlink has been a dominant player. The global satellite internet market is rapidly expanding, with numerous LEO satellites planned for deployment, driven by the anticipated rollout of 6G communications and the need to connect unserved populations worldwide.</p>

The article details the shooting incident, including Kirk's final moments and the chaos that ensued. Authorities have released photos and video of a "person of interest" and recovered a high-powered rifle, with Utah's governor vowing to pursue the death penalty. The assassination has elicited shock and grief across the political spectrum, but also exposed deep partisan divisions, with some blaming "radical left political violence" while others caution against escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has warned Mexico against its plan to hike tariffs on Asia-made cars to 50%, threatening "necessary measures" in retaliation. Mexico's proposed tariffs, part of a broader budget, aim to protect its domestic auto industry and align with USMCA requirements for regional content. China argues that countries should safeguard free trade and not sacrifice third-party interests due to US tariff pressure. The move highlights escalating global trade tensions, with China already using mineral export restrictions as countermeasures against the US. (not investment advice)</p>

The legislation, which could allow buildings up to nine stories, aims to address the state's severe housing shortage but faces strong opposition from critics who view it as state overreach. Concerns include the potential alteration of single-family communities and increased competition with developers.
