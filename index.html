          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle has intensified into a Category 3 storm, making it the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. Located southeast of Bermuda, the hurricane is packing maximum sustained winds of approximately 120 mph but is not expected to make landfall, with no current watches or warnings in effect. However, swells generated by Gabrielle are forecast to create life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast, from North Carolina to Atlantic Canada. The development comes during what was historically the peak of hurricane season, which has been quieter than initially predicted by NOAA.</p>

          <p>Oracle has promoted two key executives, Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia, to the roles of co-CEOs, with former CEO Safra Catz transitioning to executive vice chair. Magouyrk previously led the company's cloud infrastructure, while Sicilia oversaw its industries division, both of which have been central to Oracle's recent growth fueled by the AI boom. The leadership change comes as Oracle's stock has surged significantly this year, driven by massive demand for its cloud services and access to Nvidia's GPUs. The company reaffirmed its financial guidance, signaling confidence in its strategic direction under the new leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Official customs data from China reveals a notable decrease in rare earth magnet exports to the United States, its second-largest buyer. In August, the U.S. imported 590 tonnes, a 5% drop from July and a 12% decline compared to the previous year, reflecting ongoing uncertainty from trade tensions. In contrast, China's overall permanent magnet shipments reached their highest monthly total since January, driven by a continued rise in exports to the European Union. This divergence highlights shifting trade dynamics as EU companies seek to secure their supply chains amid global economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 09:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in China have developed a new technique that demonstrates potential for analyzing old and poorly preserved biological samples, a task previously hindered by chemical damage from preservation methods. Researchers successfully applied the method to cancer tissues that had been stored for nearly a decade under suboptimal conditions. Co-corresponding author Li Yang of BGI-Research noted that while challenging, the technology could theoretically be used on historical samples like Albert Einstein's brain, depending on its original preservation quality.

          <p>Pfizer has announced a deal to acquire weight loss drug developer Metsera for up to $7.3 billion, signaling a major push into the lucrative obesity drug market. The acquisition comes after Pfizer faced setbacks with its own drug candidates, increasing pressure to compete with successful treatments from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Metsera's pipeline includes several promising oral and injectable treatments, which could help Pfizer capture a share of a market analysts predict could be worth $100 billion by the 2030s. The deal, which represents a significant premium on Metsera's stock price, is expected to close by the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, has been removed from her role as patron of the children's hospice charity Julia's House. The decision follows the publication of a 2011 email in which she referred to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as her "supreme friend." This correspondence appeared to contradict her previous public statements denouncing her association with him as a "gigantic error of judgement." A spokesperson for the duchess claimed the email was sent to counter a legal threat from Epstein, but the charity deemed it inappropriate for her to continue in her role.</p>

The J-35 is the world's second carrier-based stealth fighter, comparable to the U.S. F-35, and its integration with the Fujian's advanced electromagnetic catapult system represents a major leap for China's military power. State media reported that the successful tests demonstrate the carrier has achieved key operational capabilities.

          <p>Germany is aiming to become a global leader in autonomous driving technology, but its progress is hampered by several challenges, including high car ownership, a strong taxi lobby, and a well-developed public transit system. While driverless taxis are already operating in parts of the U.S. and China, German deployments have been limited to small-scale pilot projects on fixed routes. A consortium called NeMo Paderborn is developing a concept of lightweight autonomous cabs for short trips, which can form convoys for longer distances to improve energy efficiency. However, industry experts argue that for Germany to truly lead, the government must support a nationwide rollout rather than funding temporary pilot programs.</p>

          <p>This article critiques President Trump's recent public demands for Attorney General Pam Bondi to pursue criminal indictments against political opponents like Letitia James, James Comey, and Adam Schiff. The author argues this action is a profound transgression against the foundational norm of an independent Department of Justice, which has been a hallmark of American governance since Watergate. The piece contends that such politicization of justice turns the legal system into a tool for personal retribution, regardless of the merits of the cases. It concludes with a warning that this erosion of legal neutrality is a danger to democracy, especially without bipartisan condemnation.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a £2.2 billion plan for a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport, a move the government claims will create thousands of jobs and boost economic growth. The project involves bringing the airport's existing northern runway into regular use, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000. The decision has drawn sharp criticism from environmental groups and the Green Party, who argue it ignores climate science and will increase noise and air pollution. The approval comes with new conditions, including stricter noise controls and enhanced public transport usage targets.</p>

One long-term employee even threatened to quit if it happened again, prompting Ramsey to label the staff as "entitled little twerps." Ramsey advised the owner that the backlash stemmed from poor leadership communication, which had allowed employees to view the discretionary bonus as a guaranteed part of their compensation. He stressed that profit-sharing is a gift from ownership, not an obligation, and urged the owner to reframe expectations to prevent a toxic culture.</p>

The policy aims to address the large number of people who entered the UK after Brexit under looser rules.

The article argues that the individualistic nature of self-help can lead to isolation, undermining the crucial role of community and interpersonal relationships. It suggests that asking for help from others can strengthen social bonds and provide more profound benefits than solitary self-improvement efforts.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz is urging President Trump to support raising the mandatory retirement age for airline pilots from 65 to 67. In a letter, Cruz argued that the current policy forces thousands of experienced pilots into early retirement annually and that the U.S. should lead international efforts on this issue at an upcoming UN aviation meeting. The proposal faces opposition from the Air Line Pilots Association, which cites health risks and potential cognitive decline in older pilots. Last year, Congress rejected a similar push, siding with the FAA's call for more safety analysis before making such a significant change.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump delivered a speech at a memorial service in Arizona for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was shot and killed on September 10. Addressing tens of thousands of mourners, Trump hailed the 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA as a "great American hero" and a "martyr." During the service, Kirk's wife, Erika, gave a tearful speech in which she forgave the alleged killer. In contrast, Trump stated that he disagreed with forgiving opponents, saying, "I hate my opponent and I don't want the best for them," underscoring the deeply partisan tone of the event.</p>

          <p>Christian Horner has officially left his position as team principal of the Red Bull Formula 1 team after agreeing to a severance deal. While not officially confirmed, sources report the payout is around €60 million (£52 million), one of the largest in sports history. Horner, who led the team since 2005 to numerous championships, was dismissed in July following a controversial period that began with allegations of sexual harassment, of which he was twice cleared. His departure follows a string of other high-profile exits from the team, including design chief Adrian Newey, amid internal power struggles and a decline in competitive form.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly set to make an announcement linking the use of Tylenol (acetaminophen) during pregnancy to autism, advising expectant mothers to use the pain reliever only for high fevers. This move follows a pledge from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to investigate the causes of rising autism rates. While some studies have suggested a correlation, the scientific evidence is inconsistent and does not prove causation. Major medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, maintain that acetaminophen is one of the only safe pain relief options for pregnant women, and Tylenol's maker has strongly disputed the claim.</p>

          <p>Sociologist Christina Cross's new book, "Inherited Inequality," presents research showing that Black children raised in two-parent households still face significant disadvantages compared to their white counterparts. Her findings reveal that these children experience higher rates of school suspension, lower college enrollment, and greater unemployment by their mid-twenties than white children from similar family structures. The book argues against the long-held policy focus on promoting marriage to solve racial inequality, pointing out that structural racism creates persistent resource gaps. Cross advocates for shifting focus and funding toward direct assistance programs that address these systemic economic and social disparities.</p>

A pathologist testified that while Voyce's blood alcohol level would have impaired his judgment and coordination, it was not considered a direct causal factor in his death. Voyce, who had a distinguished career with Wasps, Bath, and Gloucester, retired from professional rugby in 2013.</p>
