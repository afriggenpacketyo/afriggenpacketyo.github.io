          <p>Mining giants Anglo American and Teck Resources have agreed to a significant "merger of equals," establishing Anglo Teck, which is projected to become one of the world's top five copper producers. This new Canadian-headquartered entity will be listed on exchanges in New York, Toronto, London, and Johannesburg, with Anglo American shareholders holding a majority stake. The announcement occurred amidst a confidence vote loss for France's prime minister, leading to a new government, and a watchful global market awaiting U.S. inflation reports and reacting to weaker hiring data. This strategic merger aims to create a global critical minerals champion, enhancing Canada's leadership and providing exceptional and enduring benefits.</p>

          <p>A protracted succession battle within Rupert Murdoch's influential conservative media empire has reached a resolution, positioning his son Lachlan Murdoch to control key outlets like Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Post. The family agreement ensures the continued conservative editorial direction of these properties, with Lachlan's older siblings selling their stakes for substantial financial compensation and relinquishing influence over the trust. This culmination of years of internal strife, which famously inspired a television drama, solidifies Lachlan's leadership following Rupert Murdoch's step back in 2023. The outcome is seen as a victory for Rupert's vision, albeit an expensive one, ensuring the desired political bent.</p>

CEO He Xiaopeng indicated the company's overseas expansion is accelerating faster than anticipated, having already met its 2025 goal of presence in 60 countries. Xpeng is also open to acquiring other EV makers to bolster its position, following the Mona M03's aggressive price point debut in China. This strategic move aims to challenge both Chinese rivals and established Western automakers, with the company exploring European manufacturing options amidst tariff concerns.

Trump has vehemently denied authoring the letter, labeling it "fake," and initiated a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal for its reporting. The White House also disputed the signature's authenticity. This significant release, obtained via subpoena, also includes Epstein's last will and testament and other records, bringing renewed focus to the disgraced financier's extensive network of contacts and the legal controversies surrounding his past.</p>

          <p>China is actively seeking to upgrade its free-trade agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) this year, aiming to finalize the CAFTA 3.0 upgrade protocol. This initiative underscores Beijing's strategy to diversify exports and strengthen economic ties with its largest trading partner, particularly as global supply chains shift and US protectionism intensifies under President Trump. The concluded talks will facilitate broader market access in key sectors such as agriculture, digital trade, and pharmaceuticals. China also plans to deepen cooperation in green and digital economies, promoting digital infrastructure, mobile payments, and cross-border e-commerce to drive industrial upgrades.

          <p>India has called on its BRICS partners to address significant trade deficits, with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar highlighting that India's largest trade imbalances are with fellow BRICS nations. This appeal comes as the bloc, comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, collectively pushes back against U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and protectionist policies, which have strained relations with Washington. While India views BRICS primarily as an economic initiative focused on smoother trade flows, China and Russia perceive it more as a geopolitical grouping. Chinese President Xi Jinping warned against "Hegemonism, unilateralism, and protectionism," urging unity among BRICS members to counter global economic disruptions. (not investment advice)</p>

The rankings evaluate trusts across seven key areas, including waiting times for operations, cancer treatment, A&E performance, and financial health, sorting them into four categories. High-performing trusts will receive greater autonomy, whereas struggling ones will get enhanced support, with potential implications for leadership pay.</p>

Baidu is part of a growing trend of issuers capitalizing on relatively low Chinese interest rates and increasing investor demand for alternatives to US dollar assets.

Trump emphasized that many vaccines "pure and simple work" and are not controversial, directly contradicting RFK Jr.'s past statements on COVID-19 and debunked claims about vaccines causing autism.

The ruling addresses widespread public criticism concerning perceived privileged treatment for influential figures. Thaksin, who ended years of self-imposed exile in 2023, appeared in court with his daughter, expressing a commitment to serving his country and monarchy despite his loss of physical freedom.</p>

          <p>China Unicom has received a satellite mobile communication business license, significantly accelerating its preparations for the large-scale commercial rollout of home-grown satellite services, directly competing with Starlink. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the license, enabling the state-owned company to conduct services such as direct-to-phone satellite connectivity and expand its applications in emergency and maritime communications. This strategic move aims to foster a moderately competitive market, enhance internet accessibility for everyday users, and drive industrial transformation. The announcement closely follows China Unicom’s launch of four low-orbit satellites in late August, including China’s first equipped with advanced narrowband Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities.

          <p>Russia faces significant social challenges as hundreds of thousands of soldiers, including many pardoned convicts, prepare for eventual return from the war in Ukraine. The article highlights the disturbing case of Azamat Iskaliyev, a pardoned murderer who committed another brutal murder upon his return, exemplifying potential risks. Experts warn of widespread psychological impacts and deep discontent among veterans, as many will struggle to reintegrate and secure employment with salaries comparable to their wartime earnings. The Kremlin, under President Putin's direction, is actively trying to manage this demobilization to avoid social instability reminiscent of the 1990s post-Afghanistan, implementing policies to integrate veterans into leadership roles.</p>

The article highlights the government's dilemma, with experts warning that a shift from hotels to HMOs could exacerbate tensions in communities already burdened by housing shortages. The new Home Secretary has prioritized protecting UK borders and restoring order to the immigration system, acknowledging the "utterly unacceptable" small boat crossings.</p>

Although the no-hitter was broken in the ninth inning by a double, Scott successfully closed out the game, preventing a repeat of Saturday's loss where a no-hitter was also broken late.

This revelation follows a 2019 JP Morgan report noting Epstein's "particularly close relationship" with Mandelson and Prince Andrew.

          <p>Ethiopia's nearly $5 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is nearing its commissioning ceremony, projected to double the country's electricity output, but remains shrouded in significant controversy. An Ethiopian magazine reported a staggering 15,000 deaths during its 14-year construction, a claim that the Water and Energy Minister would neither confirm nor deny. Funded entirely by internal government bonds and public donations due to its geopolitical sensitivity, the dam's self-reliance is seen as a model for other African nations. However, downstream neighbors Egypt and Sudan fear severe impacts on their vital water supplies and have yet to reach a water-sharing agreement, despite Ethiopia's assurances and calls for continued dialogue.</p>

Phillips disappeared with his children in 2021 after losing legal custody, with Police Commissioner Richard Chambers stating he "quite literally put [them] in harm's way." An officer was seriously injured during the shootout, which occurred after Phillips fired a high-powered rifle at police following an attempted burglary. Firearms and ammunition were found at a dense vegetation campsite believed to be one of Phillips' hiding spots. The children, now in state care, are reportedly doing well but will require time to recover from their ordeal.</p>

Badenoch cited rising UK borrowing costs, which hit a 27-year high, and insufficient economic growth as key indicators, though some economists dismiss bailout fears as hyperbole.
