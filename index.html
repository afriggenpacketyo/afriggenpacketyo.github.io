          <p>Syria's interim presidency announced plans to deploy a new military force to the southern part of the country to stop deadly sectarian violence between Bedouin and Druze communities near Suweida. The clashes have resulted in nearly 600 deaths, with government troops previously accused of killing civilians. The announcement follows reports of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Syria, brokered with the help of Turkey and Jordan, aimed at de-escalating the conflict and protecting the minority Druze population.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old man from Cardiff has described the severe physical and psychological trauma he endures after being attacked by three dogs while protecting a friend and her baby. The incident, which cost him the use of two fingers and over £8,000 in lost wages, highlights a growing problem in the UK, with police data showing a 4% increase in recorded dog attacks in 2024. The article details his ongoing struggles with confidence and the financial burden of private counseling, reflecting a broader national issue of rising dog-related injuries.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese medical experts from Huazhong University of Science and Technology has developed a new, more affordable method for delivering CAR-T cell therapy. This innovative approach produces anti-cancer cells directly within the human body, significantly reducing the complexity and cost associated with conventional treatments, which can exceed $139,200 per session. The researchers successfully used this gene therapy technique to treat four patients with multiple myeloma, a common blood cancer, with findings published in The Lancet.</p>

          <p>The UK Met Office has issued an amber weather warning for parts of the country, including London and the south coast, forecasting torrential rain and thunderstorms over the weekend. Following a recent heatwave that left the ground dry and hard, the expected downpour of over a month's worth of rain in a few hours is likely to cause dangerous flash flooding. The severe weather could lead to significant travel disruptions, power outages, and potential danger to life, with authorities warning that homes and businesses are likely to be flooded quickly.</p>

          <p>An explosion at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's Biscailuz Center Training Academy has resulted in the deaths of three deputies. The incident, which occurred Friday morning, is being investigated by a multi-agency task force including the FBI and ATF. Officials stated it was the department's largest single loss of life since 1857. Early reports suggest the deputies, who were part of the Arson Explosives Detail, may have been working to render safe a grenade that was recovered the previous day when the fatal blast occurred.</p>

While the Dodgers' offense was shut out by Brewers' pitcher Quinn Priester, Glasnow's solid outing is a crucial development for the team.

          <p>A recent study by Chinese researchers has found that chemotherapy, while effective at treating primary tumors, can sometimes awaken dormant cancer cells, potentially speeding up the spread of cancer to other organs. The findings help explain why some breast cancer patients experience metastasis in places like the lungs even after successful initial treatment. The research team also identified specific drugs that, when used with chemotherapy in mice, could inhibit this process. A clinical trial based on these findings is now underway with human breast cancer patients.</p>

This new configuration aims to overcome current technological hurdles, allowing the weapon to fire heavier 30kg projectiles at speeds of Mach 7.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, his company News Corp, and The Wall Street Journal. The lawsuit stems from an article claiming Trump sent a "bawdy" birthday letter, which included a drawing of a naked woman, to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. Trump vehemently denies authoring the letter, and the suit alleges the newspaper published false and malicious statements to link him to the disgraced financier. The legal action follows Trump's public threats to sue and escalates his battle with the media outlet.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died after being violently pulled into an MRI machine at a medical facility in Westbury, New York. According to Nassau County police, the man was wearing a large metallic chain and entered the MRI room against staff orders while a scan was in progress for his relative. The powerful magnetic force of the machine pulled the chain, causing the man to be drawn in and suffer severe, fatal injuries. Medical experts noted that such incidents are rare due to strict safety protocols that require the removal of all metal objects before entering an MRI suite.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced at a White House dinner that ten more hostages held in Gaza are expected to be released "very shortly." The statement comes as his administration continues to push for a 60-day ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.

Trump praised his Middle East envoy and expressed hope that the process to free all remaining hostages would be finished quickly.</p>

During the war, Harrison would listen to a music box and imagine a carousel in a peaceful mountain meadow to cope with the brutality. After struggling with PTSD for years, he began building the carousel in 1986, hand-carving the animals over 26 years. Now a nonprofit, the carousel has brought joy to over a million visitors and has become a source of healing for Harrison himself.</p>

          <p>At a White House dinner, U.S. President Donald Trump claimed that up to five jets were shot down during the recent military hostilities between India and Pakistan. The conflict, which was sparked by an attack in India-administered Kashmir in April, saw a significant escalation before a ceasefire was announced in May. While Trump did not specify which side's jets he was referring to, his comment adds a new dimension to the conflicting claims from both nuclear-armed nations, each of which reported downing the other's aircraft while disputing their own losses.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The bipartisan bill, which creates consumer protections and clear rules for dollar-pegged digital currencies, is seen as a major victory for the crypto industry. At the signing ceremony, Trump hailed the law as a step toward a "21st-century upgrade" for the financial system that would strengthen the U.S. dollar. The legislation allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins under the new federal guidelines. (not investment advice)</p>
