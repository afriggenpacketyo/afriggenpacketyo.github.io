          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a right-wing historian, has been elected as the new president of Poland, narrowly defeating Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski. The election result is a turnaround from initial exit polls, which had predicted a win for Trzaskowski. As president, Nawrocki is expected to continue using his veto power to block Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda and energize the national conservative Law and Justice (PiS) opposition. Nawrocki supports traditional Catholic and family values, Polish sovereignty within the EU, and continued support for Ukraine, but opposes Ukraine joining NATO and the EU during Russia's aggression. Poland's president has limited influence on foreign policy and defense, but can veto legislation.</p>

          <p>The debate over artificial intelligence (AI) and copyright remains unresolved, pitting the government against creative industry leaders. The central issue is balancing AI developers' need for access to creative content with the livelihoods of content creators. The Data (Use and Access) Bill, intended to allow AI developers access to all content unless owners opt out, is stalled due to opposition in the House of Lords. Opponents propose AI firms disclose used copyrighted material for licensing, while supporters fear this would stifle the UK's AI industry; the outcome of this standoff remains uncertain.</p>
