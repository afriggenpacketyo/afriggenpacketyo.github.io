          <p>Rapper Tory Lanez, currently serving a 10-year sentence for shooting Megan Thee Stallion, was hospitalized after being attacked by a fellow inmate at the California Correctional Institution.

          <p>A recent Zillow analysis reveals that renters now need to earn at least $100,000 annually to comfortably afford rent in eight major metropolitan areas across the U.S., double the number before the pandemic. Cities like New York City and Boston require incomes exceeding $127,000, while more affordable options include Buffalo and Oklahoma City, where incomes around $55,000 suffice. The surge in rents has outpaced wage growth, exacerbating the housing affordability crisis, and experts call for increased housing supply and congressional action to expand affordable housing programs.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are moving forward with a plan to cut $880 billion from Medicaid over the next decade, but they acknowledge they will not receive a full analysis from the Congressional Budget Office before their committee markup. Despite this, the CBO confirmed that the legislative recommendations would meet the $880 billion savings target. President Trump has urged Republicans to unify around the bill, while Democrats criticize the plan, citing prior CBO analyses that millions could lose Medicaid insurance. Republicans are emphasizing the savings anticipated through work requirements for Medicaid recipients, but details await the CBO's pending analysis.</p>

NWS infections have been detected in several Central American countries and recently in Mexico, prompting the US to take action.

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to drastically reduce tariffs on each other for the next 90 days, providing relief to investors and retailers who feared a trade breakthrough was out of reach.

The White House Press Secretary stated that any gift would be accepted in full compliance with applicable laws. Qatar is reportedly offering a Boeing 747-8, a newer model worth about $400 million, which would need retrofitting and security clearance.</p>

          <p>With home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) offering attractive interest rates, homeowners are exploring optimal times to leverage them in 2025. HELOCs are particularly advantageous for financing home projects due to tax-deductible interest and offer affordability compared to other borrowing options. However, borrowers must consider variable interest rates and calculate future repayment costs. HELOCs can also be a cheaper alternative to home equity loans or cash-out refinancing, but homeowners must carefully assess their financial health before using their home as collateral.</p>

          <p>Hamas released Edan Alexander, a dual Israeli-American national, following pressure from President Trump ahead of his visit to the Middle East. Mr. Alexander’s release was portrayed by Hamas officials as an attempt to secure U.S. support for a wider deal to end the war. Alexander was among those seized during the Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023. Unlike most other hostages, Mr. Alexander was released without a formally announced cease-fire between Israel and Hamas.</p>

          <p>A group of White South Africans arrived in the United States after being granted refugee status by the Trump administration. The group was greeted by U.S. officials who cited "egregious discrimination" in South Africa, a claim the South African government denies. The Trump administration alleges that White South Africans face discrimination, including through a controversial land seizure law. The South African government maintains that the law respects private property rights and targets unused land.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at lowering prescription drug prices in the U.S. by tying costs to the lower prices often negotiated by other countries. The order asks for drug companies to voluntarily lower their prices within 30 days, so the U.S. is paying the same amount that other wealthy countries pay for similar medications. If pharmaceutical companies don't lower their prices, the administration will pursue a host of regulatory options. The administration will also "communicate price targets to pharmaceutical manufacturers" and then direct the Department of Health and Human Services to "establish a mechanism" for American patients to buy drugs directly from manufacturers that lower their prices in the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Trump said weekend talks had resulted in a "total reset" in trade terms between the US and China, a move which goes some way to defuse the high stakes stand-off between the two countries. The talks in Switzerland resulted in significant cuts to the tit-for-tat tariffs that had been stacked up since January on both sides. The US will lower those tariffs from 145% to 30%, while China's retaliatory tariffs on US goods will drop to 10% from 125%. The retreat comes as the first impacts from the tariff-war were beginning to show, with US ports reporting a sharp drop in the number of ships scheduled to arrive from China.</p>

While the price of gold dipped slightly this week, the potential profit could be substantial, especially for those who bought before 2025. However, selling would mean losing a portfolio diversifier and a long-term hedge against inflation. Selling should be relatively easy due to the abundance of gold buyers, but investors need a realistic understanding of their gold's worth. The article suggests weighing the pros and cons carefully before taking any action, and potentially selling some while keeping a portion for portfolio benefits.</p>
