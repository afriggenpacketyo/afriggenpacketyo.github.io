          <p>The BBC has revealed several new celebrity participants for the 23rd season of its popular competition show, 'Strictly Come Dancing.' The lineup so far includes 'Love Island' winner Dani Dyer, actress Alex Kingston, and former professional footballer Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, with more names expected to be announced soon. The article also notes the addition of two new professional dancers to the cast. This season follows a period of controversy for the show, which prompted the BBC to implement new welfare measures for all participants and crew members involved in the production.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders have publicly appealed to the U.S. President to ensure Ukraine has a central role in any potential peace negotiations with Russia, expressing fears that a deal could be made without Kyiv's consent. This comes as Ukrainian forces report tactical successes, having recaptured two villages in the eastern Sumy region amid ongoing heavy fighting. The appeal from 26 of the 27 EU member states underscores deep concerns in Europe about maintaining Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of potential concessions made to end the conflict.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce, suspending the implementation of new, higher tariffs for an additional 90 days until November 10. This move provides more time for negotiations aimed at resolving trade imbalances and what the U.S. terms unfair trade practices. Under the extended agreement, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will remain at 30%, while China's tariffs on American products will stay at 10%. Despite averting an immediate escalation, the extension prolongs uncertainty for businesses, as trade flows between the two economic giants have already seen a significant decline this year.

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.6%, the lowest level in over two years, in response to a weakening economic outlook. The central bank also revised its annual economic growth forecast downward from 2.1% to 1.7%, citing softer than expected public demand. The RBA noted that inflation has dropped substantially from its 2022 peak, bringing it closer to the target range. Analysts are now forecasting further rate cuts later this year and into 2026 to stimulate the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists report that coral reefs along the coast of Western Australia have experienced their worst bleaching event on record, caused by an unprecedented marine heatwave. The damage spans 1,500 kilometers and has affected previously resilient areas, including the World Heritage-listed Ningaloo Reef. According to the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the prolonged heat stress is a direct result of climate change, giving reefs insufficient time to recover between events. The United Nations has warned that even with limited global temperature rises, a vast majority of the world's tropical coral reefs are projected to die.</p>

          <p>In her new memoir, 'Frankly,' former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon candidly discusses the most challenging moments of her political career, including the severe impact on her mental health. She admits regret over not pausing controversial gender recognition legislation to build more consensus and addresses the case of a man convicted of two sexual assaults who was sent to a female prison. The book also details her fractured relationship with her predecessor Alex Salmond, her personal struggles including a miscarriage, and the police investigation into SNP finances that she describes as the worst day of her life.</p>

          <p>A secretly placed Red Bull can was the crucial clue that helped Scottish police solve the three-year-old disappearance of cyclist Tony Parsons. The case was cracked after Alexander McKellar confessed to his new girlfriend, Dr. Caroline Muirhead, that he and his twin brother had fatally struck Parsons in a hit-and-run and buried his body. McKellar then took Muirhead to the remote burial site, where she discreetly dropped the can as a marker before alerting authorities. Parsons' body was recovered, and his family has expressed immense gratitude for Muirhead's quick thinking, which brought them long-awaited answers.</p>

          <p>Recent surveys in Israel indicate a growing majority of the public supports a deal with Hamas to secure the release of all remaining hostages, even if it means ending the war in Gaza. However, the same research reveals a stark disconnect regarding the humanitarian crisis, with nearly 80% of Jewish Israelis reporting they are not troubled by the suffering and famine among Palestinians. This sentiment reflects a hardening of attitudes and a focus on internal concerns like the hostages and soldiers' lives. Experts suggest that extremist views regarding Palestinians have become more mainstream in Israeli society amid the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>An investigation has revealed that thousands of North Koreans are being sent to work in Russia under what defectors describe as slave-like conditions, filling a labor shortage caused by the war in Ukraine. According to interviews with escaped workers and intelligence officials, these laborers are forced to work up to 18-hour days on construction sites, are confined to their work areas, and have most of their earnings seized by the North Korean state. This practice, which violates UN sanctions, is reportedly expanding, with Pyongyang potentially dispatching over 50,000 workers to earn cash for the regime.</p>

          <p>Spain is taking a distinct foreign policy path that has created friction with the Trump administration, notably by renouncing the purchase of U.S. F-35 fighter jets and resisting pressure to meet NATO's new 5% defense spending target. Additionally, the Spanish government has pursued closer economic ties with China, including awarding a contract to Huawei, which has drawn criticism from both the U.S. and EU. Analysts suggest Spain's minority leftist government is leveraging these foreign policy stances to distract from domestic issues, gambling that its EU membership will shield it from direct U.S. trade repercussions.</p>

The threat escalates an ongoing feud between Musk and OpenAI, a company he co-founded. In response, OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman dismissed the claim as remarkable given Musk's alleged manipulation of his own platform, X.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani and his agent, Nez Balelo, are being sued by a real estate developer and broker in Hawaii. The lawsuit alleges that Ohtani and Balelo used their celebrity leverage to have the plaintiffs fired from a $240 million luxury housing project they had conceived and brought Ohtani into as an endorser. According to the complaint, Balelo made increasing demands and ultimately pressured their business partner to remove them from the deal. The plaintiffs are accusing Ohtani and Balelo of tortious interference and are seeking to hold them accountable for financial losses.</p>

          <p>Thomas Dohmke, the CEO of Microsoft's GitHub unit since 2021, has announced he is leaving the company to pursue a new startup venture. His departure comes as GitHub faces a surge of competition in the AI-powered coding assistant market from fast-growing rivals like Cursor and Replit. Dohmke, who oversaw the launch of the popular GitHub Copilot, will stay on through the end of the year to manage the transition. GitHub will continue to operate within Microsoft's CoreAI division, with top executives now reporting to a different leader within the new structure.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, to be the new commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The announcement comes shortly after Trump fired the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, blaming her for a weak July jobs report and making unsubstantiated claims of data manipulation. Antoni has been a vocal critic of the BLS's methodology and has defended the president's economic policies. The nomination, which requires Senate confirmation, has raised concerns among some economists about the potential politicization of the independent federal statistical agency.</p>

          <p>Amid fierce competition in China's instant retail market, a prominent Chinese economist and central bank adviser, Wang Yiming, has called for government guidance to support the sector's growth. He argued that "quick commerce," which involves delivering goods within 30 minutes, presents new consumption opportunities crucial for the country's long-term economic health. Rather than stifling competition, Wang urged officials to implement targeted policies that steer the industry away from excessive cash burn and towards innovation and quality improvements. The goal is to foster a more sustainable and high-quality industrial ecosystem for this burgeoning market.</p>

          <p>An 11-year-old girl is recovering in the hospital after being attacked by a mountain lion outside her family's home in Malibu. The girl was doing chores in her backyard when the attack occurred, and her mother and sibling rushed out after hearing screams, which scared the animal away. Officials from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife later located the mountain lion in nearby brush and killed it. DNA samples are being compared to confirm it was the correct animal, and wildlife officials noted that while such attacks are rare, the home is located near mountain lion habitat.</p>

          <p>In an effort to stimulate tourism in its more remote areas, Nepal has announced it will waive climbing permit fees for 97 Himalayan peaks for the next two years. This initiative is aimed at drawing attention to unexplored destinations in the country's less-developed western provinces. The move contrasts with a recent fee increase for climbing Mount Everest, which continues to be a major source of revenue but also faces issues of overcrowding. It remains unclear if infrastructure improvements will accompany the fee waiver to support a potential influx of climbers to these remote regions.</p>

The pursuit ended when the suspects abandoned the third vehicle, a pickup truck, under a freeway overpass in downtown Los Angeles and fled.

D.C. officials have condemned the action as illegal, and protests have formed outside the White House in response.
