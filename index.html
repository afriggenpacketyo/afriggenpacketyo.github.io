          <h2>US Treasury Secretary Signals Likely Extension of China Tariff Deadline</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that an extension of the current trade tariff deadline with China is probable. The current 90-day suspension of most heavy tariffs is set to expire, but Bessent expects to finalize an extension during upcoming talks in Stockholm. He described the trade relationship as being in a "very good place," expressing optimism for constructive dialogue on broader economic issues, such as China's manufacturing output and its purchases of sanctioned oil.

          <p>The U.S. government's decision to rescind a ban on selling Nvidia's H20 computer chips to China has drawn sharp criticism from some Washington officials. The reversal was reportedly part of a larger trade negotiation that involved securing China's cooperation on rare earth mineral access. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick defended the move, suggesting that selling slightly older technology keeps Chinese developers dependent on the American tech ecosystem, a strategy not all policymakers agree with.

          <p>The Spanish island of Ibiza is experiencing a significant strain on its local health services due to a high volume of emergency calls from tourist-heavy party areas. According to a healthcare technicians' union, a quarter of all ambulance emergencies are linked to drug or alcohol incidents at large clubs, primarily involving foreign visitors. The union argues this saturation of public resources is unsustainable and is advocating for the large, profitable clubs to be required to fund their own private ambulance services.</p>

          <p>Laura Anne Jones, a member of the Welsh Parliament (Senedd), has defected from the Conservative Party to join the right-wing Reform UK party. The move makes her Reform's first-ever Senedd member and comes at a time of rising poll numbers for the party in Wales. Jones cited her disagreement with current Conservative policies as her reason for leaving, a decision that her former party colleagues said would let down the voters who elected her as a Conservative.</p>

This adaptability is considered crucial as the market faces uncertainty with the impending expiration of federal EV tax credits, which could slow EV sales growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has filed a lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal and its parent company over a report that he sent a lewd birthday card to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. The card was allegedly part of a scrapbook compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell. Trump has furiously denied the report, calling it a "scam" and a "fake story." This legal action intensifies the scrutiny surrounding Trump's past association with the late disgraced financier as he continues to face political pressure on the matter.</p>

This article argues that while occasional aid is provided, it is counteracted by moves like giving Russia a 50-day grace period before considering new sanctions, effectively allowing Moscow's bombing campaign to continue unabated. This pattern suggests a strategy of stringing Ukraine along with insufficient support, rather than providing the decisive aid needed to repel the invasion.</p>
