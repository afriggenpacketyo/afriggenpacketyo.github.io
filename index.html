          <p>Officials from the Trump administration publicly defended the president's economic strategy after a week of unfavorable data, including weaker-than-expected job growth. A central controversy was the dismissal of Bureau of Labor Statistics head Erika McEntarfer, a decision the White House justified by stating a need for more "reliable numbers." However, the move was sharply criticized by figures like a former Trump-appointed BLS commissioner, who labeled it a dangerous, authoritarian act that threatens the credibility of U.S. economic data.</p>

Although a Supreme Court decision has limited the potential scope of payouts, millions of drivers might still qualify for compensation under the plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Pentagon Restricts Officials' Attendance at Public Forums, Sparking Concerns of Isolationism</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Pentagon, under the leadership of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has instituted a new policy to vet and limit the attendance of defense officials at external conferences and public forums. This policy, which began with a prohibition on attending the Aspen Security Forum, is officially aimed at preventing the DOD from associating with organizations whose values are deemed contrary to the administration's. Critics and former officials are concerned that this move will foster a dangerous level of groupthink and isolate the military from vital external expertise and strategic dialogue.</p>

First Minister John Swinney commended her for her "invaluable contribution," and she will continue to fulfill her duties as an MSP and in her current government role until the election.</p>

          <p>The worldwide production of farmed fur has undergone a staggering decline, dropping from 140 million animals in 2014 to just 20.5 million in 2024. This dramatic shift is credited to a combination of effective animal welfare campaigns that successfully lobbied major fashion houses to adopt fur-free policies and the implementation of legislative bans on fur farming in Europe. The industry's decline was further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on mink farms and evolving economic and political conditions in key markets like Russia and China.</p>

This renewed emphasis is significant, as it is the first time in three years that yuan internationalization has been a distinct focus in the bank's midyear policy outline. (not investment advice)</p>
