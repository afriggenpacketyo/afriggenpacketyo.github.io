These doctrines, favored by conservative justices, require clear congressional authorization for actions with significant economic impact. The suits claim that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not explicitly grant the president authority to impose tariffs, raising questions about the legality of the levies.</p>

          <p>Following radar outages at some of the country's busiest airports, the nation's aviation infrastructure is again under scrutiny. The word radar is a near acronym that stands for RAdio Detection And Ranging and was coined by the U.S. Navy in either 1940 or 1941. Radar works by emitting pulses of radio waves that bounce off of an object, and by timing how long it takes for the signal to go out and come back, one can calculate how far away something is. The application dates back to the late 19th century, and the British military unleashed the true potential of radar technology under pressure from the Germans in the 1930s.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing to accelerate the construction of a $20-billion water tunnel beneath the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta by streamlining the permitting process and limiting legal challenges. The Delta Conveyance Project aims to create a second route to transport water to state pumping facilities. Supporters say the project is crucial for protecting the water supply amid climate change and earthquake risks, while opponents argue it's an expensive boondoggle that will harm the environment and communities.</p>
