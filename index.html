          <p>Welsh rugby international Louis Rees-Zammit has announced his decision to end his pursuit of an NFL career and return to rugby union. After 18 months in the United States, which included time on the Jacksonville Jaguars' practice squad, the 24-year-old stated it was time to come home and do what he does best. Rees-Zammit had retired from rugby in January 2024 to join the NFL's International Player Pathway Program. His return is anticipated to be a significant boost for the Welsh national team, which recently ended a long losing streak.</p>

          <p>Nintendo's fiscal first-quarter revenue has more than doubled year-over-year, largely propelled by the successful launch of its new Switch 2 console, which sold 5.82 million units. The company's video game platform business saw sales surge by 142.5%, attributed to the new hardware's higher price point. Despite the strong quarterly results that surpassed analyst expectations, Nintendo has maintained its conservative financial guidance for the full fiscal year. The company's stock has rallied significantly this year on excitement for the new console, even as it navigates potential impacts from U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany has officially reported a "favorable" conservation status for its wolf population in the country's Atlantic region, citing significant population growth. Authorities have documented 209 wolf packs and approximately 1,600 individual animals, primarily in northern Germany, a notable recovery since the species was considered in "unfavorable" condition in 2019. This new status may lead the government to authorize wolf hunting in the region to manage the population. The development has drawn criticism from farmers' associations, who advocate for more urgent measures to protect livestock from the predators.</p>

          <p>The BBC is under significant pressure to pull the upcoming series of 'MasterChef' following the dismissal of its hosts, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, over misconduct allegations. Broadcast union Bectu and women's rights charities have warned that airing the show would be inappropriate after an investigation substantiated numerous complaints against the presenters. One contestant has already been edited out of the series at her request, stating she felt pressured to agree to its broadcast. The BBC has defended its decision, citing widespread support from other contestants and the desire to recognize their efforts.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new policy restricting its main civil service internship scheme exclusively to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This initiative, driven by Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Pat McFadden, aims to increase working-class representation within Whitehall and ensure the government better reflects the country it serves. Successful interns will be given priority for the Fast Stream graduate program. The move has drawn criticism from the Conservative opposition, who labeled it as "leftist social engineering" that tells some young people they are not welcome.</p>

In contrast, countries like India face a 25% tariff after failing to secure a deal, and Switzerland expressed "great regret" over its high 39% rate. The new duties are part of a broader U.S. strategy to rebalance trade relationships. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British 800-meter runner Max Burgin is optimistic about his chances at this year's World Championships in Tokyo after a strong start to the season. The 23-year-old, who has faced significant injury setbacks in recent years, recently ran a personal best that makes him the third-fastest British man in history. After fearing his early promise was fading, Burgin now feels he is back on the trajectory he showed as a record-breaking junior athlete.

Major lenders have set aside substantial funds in anticipation of a ruling against them, which could have a significant economic impact comparable to the PPI scandal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian air defense reports have begun documenting Russia's use of new, jet-propelled versions of its Shahed attack drones.

This development poses a major challenge for Ukraine's air defenses, as the new drones may be too fast for the mobile fire groups that have been effective against older models.

          <p>Charlie Woods, the 16-year-old son of golf legend Tiger Woods, is in a strong position to secure an automatic spot on the U.S. Junior Ryder Cup team. After an impressive third round at the Junior PGA Championships, he is currently tied for second place. The top two finishers at the tournament earn automatic qualification for the prestigious team event. Woods, a rising junior in high school, has demonstrated considerable talent, winning a major junior tournament earlier this year and continuing to climb the ranks of youth golf, following in his father's famous footsteps.</p>

          <p>Washington Commanders star wide receiver Terry McLaurin has formally requested a trade after negotiations for a contract extension have reportedly stalled. McLaurin, who is entering the final year of his current contract, previously sat out the first four days of training camp in protest. The 29-year-old is coming off a career year, leading the team with over 1,000 receiving yards and 13 touchdowns. The trade request from one of the team's most crucial offensive players creates significant uncertainty for the Commanders as they prepare for the upcoming NFL season.</p>

          <p>This opinion article explores the widespread financial anxiety and burnout experienced by millennial women who were encouraged to pursue their passions. The author reflects on her own exhaustion and precarious financial state after 15 years of creative work, contrasting it with the security of male peers and her parents' generation. The piece argues that systemic issues, such as the undervaluing of female labor and a lack of financial literacy education, have left many women in this generation feeling broke and unsupported. It critiques a system that relies on women's unpaid labor and flexibility, particularly in creative fields.</p>

          <p>China and Kuwait have pledged to strengthen their military relationship as a new jointly-operated ammunition factory in Kuwait nears its inauguration. Kuwait's deputy minister of defence called the project a "milestone" in cooperation between the two nations. The factory, which will reportedly produce light and medium ammunition, signifies a deepening of ties that began with a military cooperation agreement in 1995. This development is part of Beijing's broader strategy to increase its engagement and influence with key partners in the Gulf region, including established U.S. allies like Kuwait.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 23:55:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the function of tariffs, which are taxes imposed on imported goods, and examines why the Trump administration has employed them as a key policy tool. President Trump argues that tariffs protect American jobs and manufacturing by making foreign goods more expensive, thereby encouraging consumers to buy domestic products. However, the policy has been criticized for creating global economic uncertainty and leading to higher prices for U.S. consumers as companies pass on the costs. The administration has used tariffs as a negotiating tactic to secure trade deals and to pressure countries on other issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen nearly $200 million in federal science and medical research grants allocated to UCLA. The government cited the university's alleged failure to maintain a research environment free of antisemitism and its use of discriminatory practices in admissions as reasons for the decision. This action represents a significant escalation, targeting a major public university's research capabilities. UCLA's chancellor called the penalty "deeply disappointing" and a "loss for Americans," arguing that defunding life-saving research does nothing to address the alleged discrimination on campus.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. This ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals who have been legally living and working in the U.S., some for decades. The judge found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing the terminations were preordained and potentially motivated by racial animus. The decision postpones the planned expiration of their legal status and deportation protections until at least November.</p>

He described the court's internal collegiality as strong, even amidst disagreement on contentious and high-profile legal issues.</p>

          <p>Jen Easterly, who served as the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) during the Biden administration, has had her appointment to a position at West Point rescinded. The decision by the Secretary of the Army came after a pro-Trump activist targeted Easterly on social media, accusing her of undermining the Trump administration. Easterly described the rescission as a "casualty of casually manufactured outrage." The incident highlights the intense political polarization affecting even academic and military appointments, following a similar dismissal of the head of U.S. Cyber Command earlier this year.</p>
