          <p>Okinawa marked the 80th anniversary of the end of the Battle of Okinawa, a fierce World War II ground battle between Japan and the United States. The ceremony, attended by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki, included the addition of 342 names to the list of war dead, bringing the total to 242,567 people. Tamaki emphasized the importance of preserving the lessons of the battle and passing them on to future generations as the spirit of Okinawa. Ishiba pledged to work towards a peaceful and prosperous Okinawa, acknowledging the prefecture's disproportionate burden in hosting U.S. military bases. The event highlighted the ongoing local discontent over the U.S. military presence and the need for continued efforts towards peace and stability in the region.</p>

          <p>NATO allies are expected to pledge to increase their defense spending, potentially reaching 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP), during the annual summit. The U.S. is pushing for this increase, comprising 3.5% for defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure, amidst the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and instability in the Middle East. While some member states are willing to meet this target, others struggle to reach the existing 2% threshold, leading to potential clashes within the alliance. European aerospace and defense companies are closely monitoring these commitments, seeking concrete government procurement to scale up production capacity and manufacturing capabilities. The article emphasizes the challenges and potential impacts of these increased spending goals on European economies and defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>NHS Lothian is considering establishing a ketamine clinic to treat severe depression, offering an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This move follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine, known for its recreational use, is being explored for its potential to make patients more receptive to psychotherapy, as reported by patients who have tried it. While esketamine nasal spray is approved for treatment-resistant depression in Scotland, intravenous ketamine is not yet routinely available, raising hopes for broader NHS access and partnerships. The article presents the perspectives of psychiatrists and patients on the potential benefits and risks of using ketamine as a treatment option.</p>

          <p>Despite the U.S. joining the war between Israel and Iran, global markets have largely shrugged off the escalation. The MSCI World index experienced only a slight decline, and safe-haven assets traded mixed, suggesting investors view the conflict as contained. Analysts believe the market sees the attack on Iran as a relief, diminishing the nuclear threat in the region. However, traders are closely monitoring potential countermeasures from Iran following the U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities. The overall sentiment suggests a belief that the conflict will not significantly destabilize global markets.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has signaled support for U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, viewing it as a demonstration of Washington's resolve to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya stated that Japan understands the U.S. action as a means to de-escalate the situation while preventing nuclear proliferation. Despite maintaining amicable ties with Iran, Japan emphasizes the importance of stability in the Middle East due to its dependence on the region for crude oil. While refraining from immediate endorsement of the military action, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba underscored the need for de-escalation and maintaining Japan's stance against Iranian nuclear weapons possession.</p>

          <p>The article critiques the response of Western leaders to the escalating conflict between the U.S., Israel, and Iran, arguing that their calls for diplomacy are undermined by a refusal to address the root causes of the conflict. It accuses these leaders of prioritizing unconditional support for Israel while ignoring violations of international and human rights law. The author contends that this approach reveals a political establishment unsuited for crisis management and committed to maintaining a flawed world order. The article suggests that Western leaders are increasingly detached from public opinion and unable to manufacture consent for their policies, leading to a growing sense of nihilism.</p>

          <p>Germany's military, the Bundeswehr, faces significant challenges as NATO sets ambitious goals, including a defense spending target of 5% of GDP. While Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged to provide necessary resources, the proposal has met skepticism and criticism within the coalition government. The increased spending is intended to strengthen military capabilities and deter Russia, but some argue it is an irrational allocation of resources. In addition to financial commitments, NATO requires additional troops in Europe, placing further demands on the German armed forces. The article explores the potential implications of these changes, including the possibility of reinstating compulsory military service.</p>

          <p>The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague is expected to focus on increasing defense spending, a key demand of U.S. President Donald Trump. Secretary-General Mark Rutte's persuasive efforts, particularly with Germany, have made this goal potentially acceptable to most NATO countries. The summit aims to give Trump a win and rebalance the alliance, but concerns remain about potential resistance from some European nations. The article also highlights the lack of ambition regarding Ukraine's NATO aspirations and the potential for a disappointing summit for the country. The main goal of the summit is to deter Russia and ensure the safety of European and NATO citizens.</p>

The country praised Trump's diplomatic intervention in the India-Pakistan crisis but criticized the U.S. strikes on Iran as a violation of international law. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed concern to Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian about the bombings targeting IAEA-safeguarded facilities. Pakistan maintains close ties with Iran and supports its attacks on Israel, citing the right to self-defense.

Paola, a Mexican national who entered the U.S. seeking asylum as a child, had a deportation order from 2018 due to her mother's failure to appear at an immigration hearing. Despite Marine Corps recruiters promoting enlistment as protection for families lacking legal status, immigration law experts say the Trump administration's strict enforcement directives have reduced discretion for military families.

          <p>New York City will use ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election, a system where voters rank multiple candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the voters' second choices. This process continues until a candidate secures a majority, potentially leading to a different outcome than traditional elections. While proponents argue it prevents wasted votes and ensures broader support for the winner, critics raise concerns about complexity, transparency, and potential for unexpected results. The article explains the mechanics of ranked choice voting and its potential impact on the election.</p>
