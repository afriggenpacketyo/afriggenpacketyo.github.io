        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Niger's ruling junta has announced its intention to nationalize Somair, a unit of the French uranium company Orano, escalating tensions between the two countries. This decision comes after a deterioration in relations following a military coup in Niger in 2023, leading to the withdrawal of French troops. Orano, which is 90% owned by the French state, holds a 63% stake in Somair, and has operated uranium mines in Niger for decades. The company has been pursuing legal avenues to regain operational control, claiming the state's actions have been damaging the mine's finances.</p>

Health alerts have been issued across England due to the potential impacts on public health and social care services, particularly for vulnerable individuals such as the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions.

          <p>Former President Joe Biden delivered a speech at a Juneteenth Celebration Service in Galveston, Texas, criticizing what he described as ongoing attempts to erase history. Speaking at the Reedy Chapel AME Church, Biden highlighted the importance of remembering the events of Juneteenth and its significance to America's story. He referenced efforts to remove aspects of history from textbooks and classrooms, seeming to allude to his successor, President Trump, without naming him directly. Biden also pointed to his administration's efforts to rename military bases named after Confederate officers, contrasting it with the Trump administration's push to restore the old names.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have uncovered a sophisticated drug-smuggling tunnel stretching approximately half a mile between Tijuana and San Diego. The uncompleted tunnel, equipped with electrical wiring, lighting, ventilation, and a track system, was discovered by the Border Patrol’s San Diego Sector. The tunnel ran underneath the Otay Mesa border point and was believed to have exited at a commercial warehouse. Authorities seized a package containing methamphetamine inside the tunnel, and contractors are expected to fill the tunnel with concrete to prevent future use.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump Administration cannot withhold transportation grant funding from states that refuse to cooperate with immigration enforcement. Chief U.S. District Judge John McConnell granted a preliminary injunction in a case filed by 20 states, stating that irreparable harm would occur without it. The ruling came in response to the Department of Transportation imposing conditions on grant funding, requiring adherence to an Immigration Enforcement Condition. Judge McConnell agreed with the states, finding no plausible connection between cooperating with ICE enforcement and the congressionally approved purposes of the Department of Transportation.</p>

          <p>Rice prices in Japan have more than doubled in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, following similar spikes in April and March. This surge in rice prices coincides with Japan's core inflation rate climbing to 3.7% in May, its highest level since January 2023. The government has released emergency stockpiles to moderate the price of the country's staple food. Economists are closely monitoring the situation, as rice accounts for a significant portion of Japan's core inflation, and future trends are heavily reliant on food prices.

          <p>China's central bank has maintained its benchmark lending rates unchanged, following monetary easing measures implemented last month. The decision comes as a trade deal with the U.S. eases some growth concerns. The People's Bank of China held the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%, aligning with expectations. This follows a rate cut last month, the first since October, aimed at cushioning the impact of trade tensions with Washington. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is increasing its influence in Central Asia, as evidenced by a recent high-level summit with its Central Asian partners.

Despite these concerns, the Kremlin has dismissed the possibility of diminished influence, emphasizing its strategic partnership with China and its historical ties with Central Asian countries. Diplomatic observers note that Moscow's capacity to counterbalance China's growing influence is limited, though Beijing is avoiding challenging Russia's role as the region's key security guarantor.</p>

          <p>Japan's core consumer prices in May increased by 3.7% compared to the previous year, marking the largest rise in over two years. The surge is primarily attributed to soaring rice and food costs, according to government data. The nationwide consumer price index, excluding volatile fresh food, has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target since April 2022. Economists anticipate that rice prices will decline with the new harvest in the fall, easing their impact on overall consumer prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hunan has become the first province in China to utilize special-purpose bonds to guarantee government payments to enterprises, allocating 20 billion yuan for this purpose this year. This adjustment to its annual fiscal budget marks the first instance of such bonds, typically earmarked for revenue-generating construction projects, being used to cover government arrears. Proceeds will be distributed based on eligible outstanding debts from existing investment projects, prioritizing cities and counties to complete construction, clear obligations, and reduce fiscal risk. However, concerns remain about the scale of local government debt and the complexity of repayment obligations.</p>

Some players expressed discomfort with the political focus, stating that they would rather concentrate on playing football. One player, Weah, described the experience as "a bit weird" and suggested that the players were not given the option to decline the visit.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with federal immigration authorities in order to receive transportation funding. The judge sided with 20 plaintiff states, issuing a preliminary injunction that barred the government from enforcing the new immigration rules. The judge stated that Congress did not authorize the Secretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on federal dollars appropriated for transportation purposes. This decision prevents the administration from using transportation funding as leverage to enforce its immigration policies.</p>

          <p>An expert familiar with Iran's nuclear program has questioned the effectiveness of bombing the underground Fordo nuclear plant, even with the use of massive bunker-buster bombs. The expert noted that the exact depth and reinforcement of the facility are not fully known, and that even if damaged, Iran has the knowledge and resources to rebuild its program. The Fordo facility is built deep inside a mountain, making it a difficult target to destroy completely. Continued military strikes may not be a viable solution for preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons.</p>
