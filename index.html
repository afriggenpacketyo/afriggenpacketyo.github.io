          <p>A new evolutionary genetic analysis by Chinese and Dutch researchers indicates that roses, often associated with the color red, were initially yellow. The study, published in Nature Plants, examined domesticated and wild rose samples to determine the traits of their common ancestor. The research team concluded that the original rose likely had single-petal flowers with a yellow color and seven leaflets, challenging the modern perception of roses as predominantly pink or red.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay, Eric Schmidt and Selina Xu highlight China's rapid advancements in technology, particularly in artificial intelligence, challenging the long-held belief that the United States is always ahead. China has effectively disseminated, commercialized, and manufactured tech, positioning itself at parity or even ahead in areas like AI. The article notes China's success in developing competitive AI models, exemplified by DeepSeek's V3 large language model. The authors argue that the U.S. must learn from China's open-source approach and accelerate its own AI innovation to maintain its competitive edge.</p>

          <p>General Syed Asim Munir, Pakistan’s army chief, has taken a more prominent role in shaping the country’s stance amid heightened tensions with India following a deadly terrorist attack in Kashmir. General Munir has issued strong statements, asserting that any military misadventure by India will be met with a resolute response. Analysts suggest that his hard-line views on India are influenced by his background in military intelligence and a belief in the religious nature of the conflict, reflecting a shift towards a more Islamist-oriented approach within the Pakistani armed forces.</p>

          <h2>Survey Reveals Visitors to Japan Most Frustrated by Lack of Trash Bins</h2>

          <p>A recent government survey indicates that foreign visitors to Japan are most inconvenienced by the lack of trash bins in public areas, including train stations. The issue was cited by 21.9% of respondents as their top concern. While the figure has improved from the previous year, many visitors reported having to carry their trash back to their accommodations. The removal of public trash bins is partly due to safety concerns following terror attacks, leading to littering in tourist spots becoming a major issue.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence invoked the Constitution as what "binds us all together" after receiving the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award.

          <p>As high tariffs diminish U.S. orders for Chinese goods, China is helping exporters redirect sales to the domestic market, a move that threatens to drive the economy into deeper deflation. Local governments and major businesses are supporting this effort, with e-commerce giants like JD.com and Douyin promoting sales of these goods to Chinese consumers. This influx of discounted goods could erode companies' profitability and weigh on employment, further weakening consumer demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Silent book clubs are gaining popularity as a way for people to unplug, read, and socialize in a low-pressure environment. Unlike traditional book clubs, members can read any book they choose and participate in an hour of silent reading followed by a discussion. The original Silent Book Club was founded in San Francisco in 2012, and now has over 1,600 chapters in 54 countries. The trend reflects a resurgence in people seeking "third spaces" for socializing that aren't focused on drinking or dating.</p>

Critics question the effectiveness of the offensive in securing the release of captives and the Prime Minister's objectives. The military plans to operate in new areas and "destroy all infrastructure" above and below ground, but reports suggest the expansion will not happen until after President Donald Trump's trip to the region next week.</p>

He authorized the United States Trade Representative to begin the process of taxing “any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.” The move raises questions about the scope of the tariff and its potential impact on Hollywood studios that increasingly rely on foreign locales for filming due to tax incentives and lower labor costs.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump announced a 100% tariff on films made outside of the US, claiming the country's movie industry was "dying a very fast death." He attributed this decline to other countries offering incentives to attract filmmakers and film studios away from the United States. Trump described this as a "concerted effort by other nations and, therefore, a national security threat." The announcement is part of a wider crackdown on US imports, with the president outlining a 10% baseline tariff on goods from other countries.</p>

During the race Hamilton asked Ferrari to have his teammate Charles Leclerc, who was in front, switch places with him as the British driver was clearly quicker.</p>
