          <p>Police investigating the Annunciation Catholic School shooting identified 23-year-old Robin Westman as the suspect, who died from a self-inflicted wound after killing two children and injuring 17. Westman, a former student and whose mother worked at the parish, harbored deep hatred for various groups, including religious communities, Black people, Mexican people, and even President Trump, while admiring previous mass shooters. Investigators found writings and videos indicating a desire for notoriety and a specific intent to cause terror and harm children. The incident, which saw 116 rifle rounds fired, has intensified calls for stricter gun control measures, with officials condemning the "incomprehensible" act and the suspect's "deranged obsession" with violence.</p>

          <p>Robert Primus, a Democratic member of the U.S. Surface Transportation Board, was fired by the Trump administration, learning of his termination after an Amtrak event. Primus, who plans to contest his ouster, stated he was blindsided and received no cause for his removal, though the White House cited his lack of alignment with the "America First agenda." This firing is part of a series of high-profile removals by the Trump administration, including Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook and CDC Director Susan Monarez. Primus's termination comes as the STB reviews a major freight rail merger, a decision from which he had previously dissented.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a "massive" overnight attack on Kyiv, killing at least 18 people and damaging an EU delegation office and the British Council, drawing strong condemnation from European leaders. Ursula von der Leyen urged Putin to negotiate, while Germany's Merz and France's Macron slammed the "terror and barbarism." The White House noted President Trump was "not happy" but "not surprised" by the attack, which occurred after a US-led diplomatic push for a ceasefire. This article also details reports of Russian drones monitoring weapons routes in eastern Germany and a timeline of failed ceasefire talks since 2022, highlighting the ongoing challenges to peace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nike is implementing another round of layoffs, affecting less than 1% of its corporate staff, as part of CEO Elliott Hill's strategy to realign the business and reignite growth. This follows a larger 2% staff reduction in February and aims to shift the company's focus back to sports and culture, moving away from a previous lifestyle-oriented segmentation. Hill's vision involves organizing into "sport-obsessed teams" to drive innovation across Nike, Jordan, and Converse brands. While the company expects sales and profit declines to moderate, this restructuring reflects ongoing efforts to reverse a decline in sales and win back wholesale partners.</p>

The closure followed a formal complaint by EU MP Alessandra Moretti, who condemned the site for operating with impunity and inciting sexual assault and violence. This incident highlights Italy's ongoing struggle with gender-based violence and the need for stronger legal measures.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified Robin Westman, 23, as the individual responsible for the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting that killed two children and injured 17. Westman, who died by suicide at the scene, was a former student at Annunciation Catholic School and her mother previously worked there. Investigators are reviewing YouTube videos and journal entries showing a "deranged obsession with previous mass shooters," nihilistic views, and grievances, alongside an LGBTQIA flag sticker overlaid with a gun and anti-Israel writings. The legally purchased weapons and Westman's past behavior, including "red flags" noted by a former classmate, are central to understanding this "deliberate act of violence."</p>

The rate of job changes has declined significantly from its 2022 peak during the "Great Resignation," now nearing 2019 levels, as employers reduce hiring. This article explains that workers are becoming more hesitant to switch jobs due to nervousness about the future labor market, which has seen average monthly payroll gains drop sharply. Consequently, the median pay raise for job hoppers has also decreased from 20% in 2022 to 7% in July, reflecting a shift in power dynamics back towards employers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A cybersecurity expert recommends using unique email aliases for online shopping to protect privacy, reduce spam, and prevent companies from extensively tracking online behavior. This article explains that a single email address acts as a "skeleton key" for companies to build comprehensive behavioral profiles, link purchases, and potentially facilitate fraud after data breaches. By creating a unique, forwarded alias for each website, users can disrupt tracking systems and identify which sites may have compromised their data if spam occurs. This simple practice fragments digital identity, reduces the "blast radius" of breaches, and encourages more deliberate online engagement.</p>

          <p>The groundbreaking "No Sex for Fish" group in Kenya, empowering women to own boats and avoid transactional sex for fish, faces a precarious future due to climate change and U.S. aid cutbacks. This article revisits the women of Nduru Beach, many of whom are HIV positive, who were displaced by floods in 2020 and now worry about the consistent supply of life-saving anti-retroviral drugs. Despite U.S. assurances, drug supplies have been reduced from six months to one, increasing hardship for single mothers like Rebbeccah Atieno. The group continues to support members through informal "table banking," while hoping for donor assistance for new agricultural endeavors.</p>

          <h2>Reverse Mortgages Generally Do Not Affect Social Security or Medicare Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 14:25:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For most retirees, a reverse mortgage typically does not impact Social Security retirement benefits or Medicare eligibility, as these are based on earnings history and not assets. This article clarifies that Social Security payments remain unchanged, and Medicare coverage is unaffected regardless of home equity use. However, it warns that need-based programs like Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid can be affected. Large lump-sum payouts from a reverse mortgage could push recipients over asset limits for SSI, while unused funds might impact Medicaid eligibility. Consulting with a financial advisor and a HUD-approved housing counselor is crucial to navigate these nuances and avoid unintended consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Reform UK leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, Mick Barton, has banned reporters from the Nottingham Post and its online arm, Nottinghamshire Live, citing "consistently misrepresenting our policies, actions or intentions." This "unprecedented ban," which also includes BBC-funded journalists, stems from a disagreement over an article about local government reorganization. Barton stated the move is to uphold "responsibility and honesty" in journalism and prevent misinformation from shaping governance narratives. Liberal Democrats have condemned the decision as "dangerous and chilling," drawing parallels to Donald Trump's approach to the press and warning it hinders accountability and public access to information.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article posits poetry as an "analog solution" for mindful living, offering a deeper immersion in the present moment than modern wellness devices. It argues that poetry, unlike platforms aimed at optimizing human versions, connects with the "resonant sources" of life—family, rage, love, fears—to address the root cause of unwellness: feeling disconnected from one's own life. Citing poet Linda Gregg's work, the article illustrates how her style, often drawing from Greek landscapes, creates a sense of satisfaction and balance through careful language and the omission of verbs. Gregg's poetry invites readers to cultivate self-awareness, aligning them with their surroundings and their own breath.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines has agreed to a $79 million settlement in a federal lawsuit after one of its flights dumped 15,000 gallons of jet fuel onto a community in southeastern Los Angeles County in 2020. Dozens of schoolchildren at Park Avenue Elementary in Cudahy and other schools were doused with fuel and required medical treatment. The incident occurred when Delta Flight 89, en route to Shanghai, experienced a malfunction shortly after takeoff, forcing pilots to dump fuel before an emergency landing. This article details that the settlement allocates funds for both property owners and residents, with Delta agreeing "without any admission of liability" to avoid trial expenses.</p>

          <p>A Trump administration border advisor, Tom Homan, announced that federal authorities plan to "ramp up" immigration raids in Los Angeles and other "sanctuary cities," with Chicago likely being the next target. This article reports that Homan indicated Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is considering a naval base near Chicago as a hub for these operations, which will involve a "large contingent" of agents. This initiative follows thousands of immigration arrests in Southern California since June and ongoing legal battles over the constitutionality of such raids. The move intensifies the administration's mass deportation efforts, despite a recent federal judge's temporary restraining order limiting roving raids.</p>

          <p>President Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has plunged the nation into uncharted legal territory, potentially requiring Supreme Court intervention to clarify the scope of presidential authority. Cook, a Biden appointee, is challenging her dismissal, which Trump attributes to alleged mortgage fraud, a claim she denies as unsubstantiated and a pretext to undermine the Fed's independence. This move is part of a pattern of aggressive removals of Democratic-appointed officials from independent agencies, testing legal precedents around the "for cause" removal standard. The outcome could significantly impact the balance of power on the Fed's Board of Governors and its ability to maintain independence from political pressure.</p>

Scientists in Nestor, near the border, recorded hourly hydrogen sulfide levels up to 70 times the California standard at night, causing symptoms like dizziness and headaches.

The article criticizes Trump's inability to draw obvious conclusions, his tendency to blame Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, and his rebadging of domestic politics as Russia policy, such as the tariff increase on Indian goods.
