            <p>The United States and European allies are scheduled to hold talks in Paris to discuss strategies for ending the war in Ukraine, with European diplomats urging the US to increase pressure on Russia for an unconditional ceasefire. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy will also participate in these high-level transatlantic engagements, marking the most significant interaction since February. Discussions will involve Ukrainian foreign and defense ministers, with Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff reporting on his recent meeting with Vladimir Putin. Tensions between Trump and Zelensky have been high, and the US administration has been seeking to broker a ceasefire, sometimes excluding Kyiv. Optimism score is 30.</p>

            <p>Bobby Miller had a difficult outing for the Dodgers, giving up six runs in three innings against the Colorado Rockies, continuing a trend of struggles from last season. Despite his performance, the Dodgers secured an 8-7 victory, completing a three-game series sweep. Miller's struggles highlight concerns about the Dodgers' young pitching depth. The team's offense, led by Shohei Ohtani, provided enough support to secure the win, but Miller's performance raises questions about his role in the team's future. Optimism score is 50.</p>

            <p>A UK trade deal with the United States under Donald Trump is unlikely to be a game changer and should be approached with caution, serving primarily as a defensive measure to protect British trade interests. Trump's approach to trade is about asserting power, potentially making Britain a loser. The focus should remain on closer trade ties with Europe, despite potential tensions with Washington. While a limited trade agreement with the US might be beneficial for some exporters, it won't be the key to unlocking UK prosperity. Optimism score is 40.</p>

Last year, the US pressured EU members to impose tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, highlighting the bloc's vulnerability to superpower influence. Now, the EU is considering using similar tactics against Washington in response to escalating trade tensions.

            <p>China is shifting its focus from tariffing goods to targeting the U.S. services sector in response to President Trump's tariff hikes. Instead of further retaliatory tariffs, China is implementing non-tariff measures, including export controls on rare-earth minerals and antitrust probes into American companies. Beijing has also added U.S. businesses to an "unreliable entity" list and is restricting Boeing aircraft deliveries. These actions signal a broader decoupling of the two economies, creating new challenges for U.S. companies operating in China. Optimism score is 35.</p>

            <p>A 30-year-old community service program, AmeriCorps’ National Civilian Community Corps, is being targeted by the Trump administration's cost-cutting efforts, leading to the early exit of volunteers.
