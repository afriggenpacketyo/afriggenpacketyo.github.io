          <p>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has condemned the new Israeli-backed aid distribution system in Gaza, stating it is inherently unsafe and is "killing people." The system, which bypasses the UN, has been linked to over 400 Palestinian deaths as they attempt to get food. Guterres stressed that the search for food must never be a death sentence and renewed his call for a ceasefire, while the foundation running the aid program denies responsibility for any deaths near its distribution sites.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled 6-3 to significantly limit the ability of federal judges to issue universal injunctions that block executive branch policies across the entire country. The decision arose from legal challenges to President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, although the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the order itself. Justice Amy Coney Barrett's majority opinion argued that such broad injunctions exceed judicial authority, while dissenting justices warned the ruling weakens essential checks on presidential power.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has warned that a Republican-led budget bill currently in the U.S. Senate could lead to as many as 3.4 million Californians losing their Medi-Cal health insurance. The bill proposes new work requirements for Medicaid recipients, a change that Newsom described as "reckless and cruel" and could force the closure of rural hospitals. Health policy experts echo these concerns, pointing out that such verification systems often cause eligible individuals to lose their benefits due to bureaucratic complexities.</p>

          <p>A recent study from the Japan Institute for Health Security indicates a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals who follow a traditional Japanese diet. This diet, which includes rice, miso soup, fish, and soy products, was assessed in a self-reported study involving nearly 12,500 employees. Researchers theorize that key nutrients, such as folic acid and omega-3 fatty acids, may contribute to improved mental well-being by positively influencing neurotransmitters and reducing inflammation, though they emphasize that further research is necessary.</p>

A BBC correspondent demonstrated the concept's potential by finding a phage in his home that, in a lab setting, successfully killed bacteria from a patient with a persistent infection. Once overshadowed by the success of antibiotics, phage research is experiencing a resurgence.

          <p>The European Space Agency's new Biomass satellite is delivering unprecedented images from beneath the dense canopies of the world's rainforests. Utilizing a special P-band radar, the satellite can see through thick foliage and clouds to measure the amount of carbon stored in tree trunks. These initial images are already revealing previously hidden features, such as concealed deforestation and wetlands. The mission's long-term objective is to create a comprehensive 3D map of global forests, which will enable scientists to more accurately assess their vital role in mitigating climate change.</p>

          <p>Molly Schafer, an 18-year-old senior at Waunakee High School in Wisconsin, spent approximately 600 hours painting individual portraits of 44 of her classmates as a way to overcome her social anxiety and reconnect. Feeling isolated, she undertook the massive project to be "seen again" and then presented the finished paintings to each student as a personal gift. The gesture was met with surprise and admiration, prompting some classmates to express regret for not having reached out to her sooner, highlighting the powerful impact of her artistic effort.</p>

The judge found that the order, which sought to punish the firm, violated the First and Fifth Amendments and was an assault on the American legal system.
