            <p>Amnesty International reports that hundreds of people in Ghana, particularly older women, face human rights abuses, including murder, due to witchcraft accusations. The organization urges the Ghanaian government to criminalize these accusations and ritual attacks, highlighting that existing legislation has yet to be enacted. Victims, often marginalized individuals, are banished to camps with inadequate resources. Amnesty calls for sensitization campaigns and improved living conditions in these camps, noting similar attacks occur in other parts of Africa. Optimism score: 65</p>

            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has extended an invitation to Donald Trump to visit Ukraine before any potential deals with Russia are made, emphasizing the need to witness the human cost of the war. This invitation comes after a deadly Russian missile attack on Sumy, which killed 34 people, and amid ongoing negotiations between the US and Russia. European leaders have condemned the Sumy attack, with Germany's chancellor-in-waiting calling it a war crime. The UN has also expressed alarm, stressing the need for a just and lasting peace.</p>

            <p>Concerns are growing about extremism in the US military after an active-duty soldier was found to be following a proscribed neo-Nazi terrorist group on social media. Experts highlight that the Pentagon's counter-extremism initiatives have been halted, potentially allowing extremist views to go unchecked. This incident raises questions about the effectiveness of current policies and the potential for individuals with extremist ideologies to gain military training and experience.

            <p>There's a shift away from the idea that college is the only path to success, with more students, parents, and educators recognizing alternative routes to a fulfilling life. This change is driven by concerns about college costs, debt, and the realization that not all students thrive in a traditional academic setting. High schools are beginning to offer a wider range of post-graduation options, including trades, military service, and direct entry into the workforce. This holistic approach aims to provide students with the best pathway for their individual needs and aspirations.</p>

            <p>Proposed cuts to Medicaid, as Congress seeks to reduce the federal deficit, are raising concerns about the impact on long-term care and family caregivers. Medicaid is a primary source of funding for long-term care, covering nursing home stays and in-home services for low-income individuals. Reducing Medicaid services could strain families, leading to increased hospitalizations and financial burdens for caregivers. The proposed budget could slow Medicaid's growth, potentially affecting eligibility, services, and payments to providers.</p>

            <p>A Wisconsin teenager, Nikita Casap, has been accused of murdering his parents as part of an extremist plot to assassinate President Donald Trump and overthrow the U.S. government. Federal authorities allege that Casap sought to obtain financial means and autonomy for his plan.

            <p>A new study reveals that paper receipts from major US retailers contain high levels of bisphenol S (BPS), a chemical linked to cancer and reproductive problems. Holding a receipt for just 10 seconds can expose individuals to unsafe levels of BPS, according to California's safety standards. The Center for Environmental Health (CEH) has issued violation notices to numerous companies, urging them to switch to safer alternatives or provide warnings. The findings raise concerns about the health risks faced by cashiers and consumers who frequently handle these receipts.</p>

            <p>A new study reveals that Atlantic salmon exposed to anti-anxiety medication in rivers exhibit bolder behavior, leading to increased migration success. Researchers found that clobazam, a common anxiety drug, caused salmon to traverse hydropower dams more quickly, potentially increasing their chances of survival. However, this increased boldness could have negative consequences in other contexts, such as increased vulnerability to predators. The study highlights the potential impact of pharmaceutical contamination on aquatic ecosystems and the need for improved wastewater treatment.</p>
