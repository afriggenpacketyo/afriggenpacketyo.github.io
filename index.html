        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An 11-year-old girl, Kyra Hill, drowned at Liquid Leisure water park in Berkshire in August 2022 due to gross breaches in health and safety, according to a coroner's inquest. The breaches included the lack of an emergency plan, risk assessment, and adequate warning signs about water depth, which reached over 15 feet in some areas. The coroner noted that parents were not informed of these risks, which likely contributed to the tragedy. Kyra's father described her as a strong swimmer whose life was tragically cut short, while the park owner admitted in hindsight that the water should have been cleared sooner and a missing swimmer procedure should have been in place. </p>

          <p>A new UK-EU deal addresses several concerns regarding holidays, jobs, and trade, but leaves some questions unanswered. The agreement includes dedicated dialogues on professional qualification recognition, but a full agreement may take time. While the deal clarifies e-gate usage for UK citizens at EU ports, it may not be implemented before a new EU border security scheme in October, potentially leading to continued queues. Pet passport resumption timing remains uncertain, while UK farmers will need to align with EU food standards, and the deal recognizes the value of touring artists, though concrete commitments are still sought. Finally, the agreement is expected to boost the UK economy by around £9 billion a year, mainly from food, farming, and energy trading.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump cautioned House Republicans against altering Medicaid during a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill. He urged them to pass a major tax bill currently facing resistance from some Republicans who want increases in state and local tax deductions, while others seek cuts to the federal deficit. House Speaker Mike Johnson is aiming to pass the bill before Memorial Day weekend, but movement has been hampered by these internal divisions. Trump's direct message underscores the importance of Medicaid in the ongoing negotiations. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has lifted its previous order to halt construction on Equinor's offshore wind farm in New York, allowing the project to proceed. This decision follows an apparent compromise with the state regarding a gas pipeline.

Governor Kathy Hochul announced the reversal, noting the project supports 1,500 union jobs, and Equinor aims to commence commercial operations in 2027. </p>

Despite the disappointment, some Ukrainians believe reduced pressure from the U.S. might be beneficial, as Trump previously pushed for territorial concessions to Russia. With civilian casualties rising and intensified Russian assaults, Ukrainians like Liliia Zambrovska are resolved to rely on themselves and seek support from allies, underscoring their commitment to defending their future. </p>

The piece references Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’s “Original Sin,” which suggests many Democrats were aware of Biden's cognitive decline but remained silent due to partisanship and fear of another Trump term. The review highlights instances of Biden's forgetfulness and confusion, as well as efforts by his staff to simplify his speeches and limit public appearances. The article also explores the motivations behind Biden's decision to run again, with some suggesting it was driven by a desire to stick it to Obama by endorsing Kamala Harris as his replacement. </p>

          <p>The gold-silver ratio, which measures the amount of silver needed to purchase one ounce of gold, is a key metric for precious metal investors. A high ratio suggests silver may be undervalued compared to gold, potentially indicating a buying opportunity. Currently, with gold around $3,200 per ounce and silver around $32, the ratio is high, nearing 100 to 1. Experts recommend using the ratio as a guide alongside understanding the volatility and diversification roles of both metals, noting that while gold is a stronger hedge against inflation, silver is more cost-effective but also more volatile.

          <p>For seniors seeking to tap into their home equity, HELOCs and reverse mortgages present different advantages and disadvantages. HELOCs offer flexible financing with lower interest rates, suitable for short-term needs like home improvements or debt consolidation, provided borrowers can manage monthly payments. Reverse mortgages, on the other hand, allow seniors to access equity without monthly payments, ideal for those with limited income, but come with higher fees and erode home equity over time.

          <p>Self-made millionaire and money expert Ramit Sethi advised a disciplined Gen Z couple to increase their spending, arguing that "life is not just about keeping your expenses low." Despite earning a combined $157,000 annually and having significant retirement investments, the couple disagreed on spending habits, with one partner fearing lifestyle inflation. Sethi encouraged them to confidently spend on meaningful experiences, noting that strict financial limitations can become emotionally problematic and lead to missed opportunities for enjoyment. He emphasized that their existing financial habits would likely prevent overspending. </p>

          <p>Home Depot's CFO, Richard McPhail, announced that the retailer does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing the company's scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity. This contrasts with Walmart, which expects to increase prices to cover tariff costs. McPhail noted that over half of Home Depot's sales come from the U.S., and the company has diversified its import sources, aiming to have no single country outside the U.S. represent more than 10% of purchases by next year. The decision to maintain prices could allow Home Depot to gain market share amid a sluggish housing market. </p>

The timeline for British travelers to use e-gates at EU airports is uncertain, depending on individual EU countries' decisions.

She contends that the left has moved away from focusing on economic stability for blue-collar workers and adopted a style that resonates more with college-educated elites. Williams suggests that Democrats need to emphasize "predistribution" policies that ensure fair wages and job opportunities, rather than relying solely on redistributive social programs. Trump's policies, such as tariffs and attacks on social security, have created an opening for Democrats to appeal to working-class voters. </p>

This stance could confine Russia to economic purgatory, limiting access to Western sanctions relief and foreign investment.
