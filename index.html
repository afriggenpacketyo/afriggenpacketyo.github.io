          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 09:40:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup poll reveals that only 54% of U.S. adults now report drinking alcohol, a record low in the survey's nearly 90-year history. This decline is largely driven by a significant shift in perception, with a record 53% of adults, especially younger ones, now believing that even moderate alcohol consumption is detrimental to their health. This trend coincides with a growing scientific consensus challenging the previously held belief that moderate drinking offered health benefits, particularly for the heart. The federal government is also in the process of updating its dietary guidelines, which may further influence public opinion and consumption habits.</p>

The new projection is now 4% to 6%, down from the previous range of 6% to 8%. This revision came after second-quarter same-store sales grew by only 2.1%, far below Wall Street's expectation of 6.1%, as the company lapped the successful launch of its grilled steak option from the previous year. Despite the slowdown, Cava reiterated its other key financial projections for the year. (not investment advice)</p>

Originating near the Cabo Verde islands, the storm is moving westward and is forecast to strengthen into a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands by the end of the week. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, its long-term path remains uncertain, prompting vigilance. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-normal hurricane season this year, with Erin being the fifth named storm to develop so far.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged 13 individuals in connection with a sophisticated "grandparent scam" that defrauded hundreds of elderly victims out of millions of dollars. The scheme, allegedly based in the Dominican Republic, involved callers impersonating a grandchild in trouble to trick victims into handing over large sums of cash. The investigation was initiated after Uber's security team flagged suspicious activity to the FBI, as the scammers were using unknowing Uber drivers to transport the money. Officials noted that the average age of the victims was 84 and total losses exceeded $5 million.</p>

Cornyn's letter suggests potential violations of laws such as the Travel Act and honest services fraud, and questions whether PAC funds were used for prohibited personal expenses.</p>

This warning comes as a late-August deadline approaches for Tehran to resume negotiations and cooperation with the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The E3 countries stated their preparedness to act if Iran does not pursue a diplomatic solution. The move follows a period of diplomatic stalemate and heightened tensions after an Iran-Israel conflict in June, after which Iran suspended ties with the IAEA.</p>

          <p>In a federal court hearing, lawyers for the state of California argued that President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles was an illegal use of military force in civilian life. The state's attorney contended that the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act and caused "anxiety and fear" among residents, asking a judge for an injunction to block military support for immigration enforcement. In response, a Justice Department lawyer argued the deployment was legal and intended to protect federal property and personnel.

          <p>A growing number of older Americans are struggling with student loan payments, with nearly 18% of borrowers aged 50 and over becoming seriously delinquent in the second quarter of 2025, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. This rate is significantly higher than for younger age groups and has nearly doubled since 2019. The trend is particularly concerning as the Trump administration resumes collection activities, such as wage garnishment, after a multi-year pause.

          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are being highlighted as affordable borrowing methods in the current high-interest-rate environment. With average rates for these products sitting significantly lower than those for personal loans or credit cards, they offer a viable way to access large sums of money. The article explains the differences between the two, noting that home equity loans provide a lump sum at a fixed rate, while HELOCs offer a variable-rate revolving line of credit. Potential tax benefits exist but homeowners are reminded the home serves as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indicated a potential shift in ceasefire negotiations, suggesting that efforts are now focused on a comprehensive deal to release all remaining hostages at once. This moves away from a previous phased proposal that involved a 60-day truce and a partial release. The comments came as a Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo for preliminary talks with Egyptian officials. Meanwhile, intense Israeli military operations have continued in Gaza, with the Hamas-run health ministry reporting over 120 Palestinians killed in the past day amid heavy strikes on Gaza City.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police investigation into the late Harrods boss Mohamed Al Fayed has now received crime reports from 146 people, according to an update from Scotland Yard. The investigation is examining historical allegations against Al Fayed, including sexual assault, and is also looking into whether others enabled his behavior. This number has more than doubled since the last update, following a BBC documentary that detailed widespread predatory behavior. The Met is also investigating its own past handling of the case, having previously received 21 complaints against Al Fayed before his death without ever charging him.</p>

The discussion is set to take place just ahead of Trump's high-stakes, in-person summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. The pre-summit call is seen as an attempt by European and Ukrainian leaders to ensure their perspectives are heard, amid fears that a U.S.-Russia deal could be made without their input. Zelenskyy has been firm that Ukraine will not cede territory for a ceasefire and has warned that "talks about us, without us, will not work."</p>

          <p>Residents in Juneau, Alaska, are evacuating their homes as meltwater from the Mendenhall Glacier threatens to cause record-breaking floods. A glacial lake outburst, where water dammed by the glacier rapidly drains, is sending a deluge into the Mendenhall River. The National Weather Service has issued a flood warning, and water levels have already surpassed the major flood stage, with officials expecting a new record crest. This has become an annual event since 2011 due to rising temperatures shrinking the glacier, but this year's flood is projected to be the most severe yet.</p>

          <p>This opinion article challenges the fearful framing of a "China Shock 2.0," arguing that China's dominance in green technology is a global benefit, not a disruption to be blocked with protectionism. The author posits that while the first "China Shock" involved lost manufacturing jobs, this new wave is about building entirely new systems for the green transition. By massively increasing solar and wind capacity and driving down costs worldwide, China is effectively underwriting the global shift to clean energy. The piece suggests that instead of trying to shut out this progress, other nations should embrace the construction of these new industries.</p>

          <p>The cultural phenomenon of the Barbie doll has a surprising and risqué origin story, tracing back to a 1950s German comic strip character named Lilli. Created for the Bild tabloid, Lilli was a sexually liberated, "sassy secretary" or high-class call girl designed to appeal to male readers with her titillating adventures. The character was later turned into a plastic doll, which was not intended for children but became a popular gag gift for men. Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler discovered the Lilli doll in Switzerland, acquired the rights, and in 1959, launched her own version named Barbie.</p>
