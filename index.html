          <p>This article summarizes findings from a decade-long study on parenting styles that foster success in children, emphasizing optimism, tailored motivation, and love for learning. The study highlights the importance of instilling a sense of possibility and adapting motivational approaches to match each child's unique interests. It also underscores the value of learning and empowerment through everyday activities, fostering a love for knowledge, and motivating children with love rather than acting as a coach or critic. The research suggests a shift towards encouraging curiosity and a deep love for learning over sheer hard work. The author, Susan Dominus, emphasizes the significance of supporting children's growth with love and joy, allowing their desires to drive them.</p>

          <p>Bukayo Saka was excluded from England's squad for the match against Andorra, with coach Thomas Tuchel expected to test an experimental starting lineup. Tuchel is considering deploying Reece James in an unfamiliar left-back position, while Curtis Jones is an option on the right side. Cole Palmer is anticipated to make his debut after a strong training week, and Declan Rice may rest, potentially allowing Jordan Henderson and Jude Bellingham to play centrally. Saka's omission is likely due to fitness concerns, as he completed only one full training session during the week.</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic discusses The Washington Post's initiative, internally called Ripple, to expand opinion writing using an AI writing coach named Ember. The author, a former senior editor at the Post's Opinions section, expresses concern that AI-generated content may lack the originality and insight that human editors seek. The piece argues that generative AI, designed for predictability, could dilute the quality of opinion pieces, and suggests that the Post should focus on using AI for tasks like archiving and data crunching instead. The author questions whether the use of AI aligns with the Post's commitment to readers and journalistic integrity.</p>

          <p>Thailand has temporarily closed two border crossings to tourists following a military skirmish with Cambodia, which resulted in the death of a Cambodian soldier.

Thai authorities cited threats to sovereignty and security as the reason for the closure, while trade and Cambodian workers' entry remain unaffected. Both countries have reinforced their military presence along the border, and Thailand is committed to holding bilateral talks with Cambodia to resolve the dispute.</p>

          <p>A recent study reveals the salary needed for a single person to live comfortably varies widely across the United States, with West Virginia being the most affordable at $80,829 annually, while Hawaii requires $124,467. The study defines "comfortable" based on the 50/30/20 budget method, allocating income to essentials, discretionary spending, and savings. The findings highlight the significant economic disparities between states, reflecting differences in cost of living and economic opportunities. The median annual wage for individuals falls short of what's needed for comfortable living in most states.</p>

          <p>A US Navy warship captain contrasts the Red Sea conflict with the potential challenges of a maritime war with China, emphasizing China's advanced weaponry, surveillance, and intelligence capabilities. The captain describes the Red Sea conflict as a 'knife fight in a phone booth' compared to the longer-distance engagements expected in a China conflict. Lessons learned from the Red Sea, including the performance of the Aegis Combat System and considerations for magazine capacity and rearming, are informing planning for future naval operations. The Navy is working to drive down the cost ratio for air defense missions and improve reloading capabilities.</p>
