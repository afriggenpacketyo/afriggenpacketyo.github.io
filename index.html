ElevenLabs, specializing in text-to-speech and voice cloning, has since reached a $3.3 billion valuation and plans global expansion and an IPO within five years.

The tour includes stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, with a primary focus on high-stakes trade talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to resolve the ongoing trade war. Trump aims to seal a deal to prevent new tariffs, while also discussing Taiwan and Russia with Xi. The trip also involves signing a trade deal with Malaysia and a peace accord between Thailand and Cambodia.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered an 11-4 defeat in Game 1 of the World Series against the Toronto Blue Jays, raising questions about whether a week-long layoff affected their performance. Pitchers Blake Snell and Emmet Sheehan struggled, with Snell attributing his poor outing to needing to be better regardless of rest. Manager Dave Roberts dismissed the layoff as an excuse, but historical data shows teams sweeping their LCS often lose the World Series. The team now faces the challenge of quickly readjusting to their demanding game routine for Game 2.</p>

          <p>A manhunt is ongoing in London for Hadush Kebatu, an Ethiopian national convicted of sexual assault against a schoolgirl and a woman, who was mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford. Kebatu, jailed for 12 months in September, was meant to be transferred to an immigration detention center for deportation. Justice Secretary David Lammy expressed outrage, while opposition leaders condemned the "unacceptable" error. An investigation is underway into the Prison Service blunder, which occurred just weeks after Kebatu's sentencing for multiple offenses.</p>

          <p>Argentine President Javier Milei's radical austerity policies have curbed hyperinflation to 2.1% and achieved the first budget surplus since 2010, but at a high social cost. Former party member Marcela Pagano criticizes the government for ignoring the middle class and vulnerable groups, leading to widespread disillusionment as purchasing power declines and businesses close. With a parliamentary election approaching, Milei's popularity has fallen, and his party faces a close race against the resurgent Peronists, further complicated by recent corruption scandals involving his sister and a party colleague.</p>

          <p>The US Latino population has nearly doubled to 68 million since 2000, now constituting one in five Americans and driving over half of the country's population growth. A Pew Research Center report highlights that US-born Latinos, with a median age of 20, are the youngest major ethnic group, indicating future growth. The majority (79%) are US citizens, with Mexican-origin individuals forming the largest subgroup. California and Texas lead in Latino population, while English proficiency and college attendance rates have significantly increased, reflecting evolving demographics.</p>

          <p>Officers shot at a U-Haul truck that was reversing towards them outside a US Coast Guard base in Alameda, California, during protests against an immigration enforcement surge. The driver, who was wounded and is now in custody for a mental health evaluation, initially fled before returning. The incident occurred amidst day-long demonstrations against a planned Border Patrol operation in the San Francisco Bay Area, which President Trump later claimed was canceled. Protests had seen flash bangs and smoke grenades used earlier, with one minister reportedly hit by shrapnel.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro accused the US of "fabricating a new eternal war" after the Pentagon deployed the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier towards the Caribbean. The US has intensified its military presence, conducting airstrikes against alleged drug traffickers, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth confirming a strike that killed six "narco-terrorists." Maduro, a long-time foe of Trump, denies US accusations of leading a drug-trafficking organization, viewing the military actions as an intimidation campaign aimed at destabilizing his government. Experts suggest the buildup signals a push for regime change.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico have petitioned a US appeals court to block a Trump administration order requiring them to dissolve their nearly nine-year-old joint venture by January 1. The Department of Transportation mandated the end of the partnership, which coordinates US-Mexico flights, citing competition concerns. Both airlines argue the order is "arbitrary and capricious," would cause substantial unrecoverable costs, severe flight disruptions, and could eliminate up to $800 million in annual consumer benefits. They contend their combined market share is competitive, unlike the DOT's assessment. (not investment advice)</p>

This brings the total infections in the county to 14, half of which are in the Valley. Studies indicate that drought conditions, prevalent in the San Fernando Valley, can increase West Nile virus risk by concentrating infected mosquitoes and birds around limited water sources, accelerating transmission rates.
