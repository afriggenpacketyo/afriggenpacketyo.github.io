          <p>Thieves who snatched €88 million worth of jewelry in a daring daylight heist at the Louvre museum left behind extensive DNA and fingerprint evidence. Investigators discovered over 150 traces on abandoned items like helmets, angle grinders, and gloves, which are now undergoing priority analysis to identify perpetrators, especially if they are on file. The burglars exploited a blind spot in the museum's security surveillance to scale outside walls and initially struggled to open display cases before forcing them open. Museum officials plan to upgrade CCTV and security, while prosecutors express optimism that the widespread media attention will deter attempts to move or sell the stolen jewels, aiding in their recovery and bringing the culprits to justice.</p>

          <p>Intel reported better-than-expected Q3 revenue, with its stock rising 6% after hours, signaling a recovery in demand for its core x86 processors for PCs. This positive report follows a significant $8.9 billion investment from the U.S. government and a $5 billion deal with Nvidia to integrate AI graphics processors. Despite some accounting complexities due to the government's stake and a warning of potential future revisions, Intel forecasts strong Q4 revenue and anticipates continued high demand for its chips through next year. The company is also heavily investing in its Intel Foundry division, aiming to secure major customers and revive growth in its data center CPU business, despite the substantial capital required.

          <p>President Trump announced the cancellation of a planned federal deployment to San Francisco, following a constructive conversation with Mayor Daniel Lurie and appeals from prominent tech leaders. Mayor Lurie cited recently released crime statistics showing significant declines across the city, including nearly 30% citywide crime reduction and historic lows for violent crime and homicides, as evidence of San Francisco's substantial progress. This decision follows earlier controversy ignited by Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff's call for federal intervention, which he later apologized for. Governor Gavin Newsom and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi praised the reversal, emphasizing the importance of local leadership in addressing public safety concerns and preserving the city's values.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is forecast to intensify into a hurricane by Saturday and a major hurricane by the end of the weekend, posing a significant threat to the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica. The storm's core is moving slowly over very warm Caribbean waters, which is conducive to its strengthening. It is expected to bring anywhere from 8 to 14 inches of rain to portions of these islands through Sunday, with locally higher amounts possible, leading to life-threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides. Hurricane watches and tropical storm warnings are in place for Jamaica and southwestern Haiti, urging residents to prepare for severe weather.</p>

          <p>Anthony Boyd, 54, was executed by nitrogen gas in Alabama for his role in a 1993 murder stemming from a $200 drug debt. Boyd maintained his innocence until his death, criticizing the criminal justice system in his final words. Witnesses described the execution as lengthy and distressing, with Boyd exhibiting shaking and heaving breaths for at least 15 minutes before becoming still. This marks Alabama's seventh use of the controversial nitrogen gas method, which defense lawyers have consistently challenged as constituting cruel and unusual punishment. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately denied Boyd's last-minute appeal to halt the execution, allowing the process to proceed.</p>

The article highlights how Killick exploited systemic loopholes, including legally changing his name twice and a lack of regulation in the building trade, to repeatedly defraud customers. Victims often found no red flags online, instead encountering slick websites and an abundance of seemingly genuine positive reviews. The case has intensified calls for stricter rules on convicted fraudsters and mandatory licensing for builders to protect vulnerable homeowners and restore public confidence in the construction industry, addressing a significant failure in the current system.</p>

          <p>Indian exporters are experiencing a subdued Diwali season due to punishing 50% U.S. tariffs, which have severely impacted labor-intensive sectors like textiles and gems and jewelry.

Manufacturers are grappling with unsold inventory and forced production cuts, with textile exports declining significantly since the tariffs took effect in August.

          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland, Kelly Hayes, has reportedly informed Department of Justice superiors that there is insufficient evidence to indict Senator Adam Schiff for mortgage fraud. This assessment comes despite public calls from President Donald Trump for the criminal charging of Schiff, a prominent critic and prosecutor in Trump's first impeachment trial. While a controversial senior DOJ official is reportedly pressing to keep the case alive, Schiff's lawyer, Preet Bharara, asserted that career prosecutors found the politically-motivated allegations baseless and without merit. Schiff himself previously characterized the probe as a transparent attempt to intimidate and silence his political opponents, raising concerns about political interference in justice.</p>

While the Department for Transport insists expansion will align with climate commitments, the committee's chair noted that technological solutions for decarbonizing aviation, such as sustainable aviation fuel, are not yet commercially viable on a necessary scale.
