          <p>An upcoming heavyweight boxing match in Saudi Arabia pits 20-year-old rising star Moses Itauma against veteran Dillian Whyte. This fight is considered a significant step up for the undefeated Itauma, testing him against a seasoned opponent who has faced top names in the division. Despite Whyte's experience, boxing analysts and commentators cited in the article unanimously predict an Itauma victory, many by stoppage. They point to Itauma's speed, youth, and athleticism as major advantages against an aging and inactive Whyte, viewing this as a potential breakout performance for the young fighter.</p>

          <p>Researchers from the Bank of China have expressed escalating concerns about the long-term sustainability of Washington's ever-increasing national debt. In an article for a central bank-supervised publication, they argued that while U.S. Treasuries are not yet at a default threshold, their current expansion is unsustainable. This sentiment aligns with China's recent actions, as it has been reducing its holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds, which are now at their lowest level since 2009. The researchers recommend that China gradually adjust its holdings and increase reserves of gold and other strategic resources. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Severe monsoon rainfall has triggered devastating floods and landslides across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, resulting in the deaths of at least 307 people. The mountainous Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province has been hit hardest, with numerous homes damaged and a rescue helicopter crashing, killing its five crew members. Authorities have declared disaster zones in several areas as heavy rain is expected to continue, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. Scientists attribute the increasing frequency and extremity of such weather events to climate change, highlighting the region's vulnerability to its effects.</p>

          <p>China's space agency has successfully completed a crucial engine test for its new-generation Long March-10 rocket, a key milestone in its plan to land astronauts on the moon by 2030. The test confirmed that the rocket's 21 YF-100K engines could operate in sync under various power conditions, providing essential data for the mission. The superheavy Long March-10 launcher is designed to be powerful enough to send both the Mengzhou crewed spacecraft and the Lanyue lander into lunar orbit. The mission plan involves two separate launches, with the vehicles rendezvousing in orbit before attempting a lunar landing.</p>

          <p>A high-stakes summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska concluded without a definitive breakthrough on the war in Ukraine. While Trump described the talks as "productive," he stated that "there's no deal until there's a deal" and that key issues remain unresolved. Putin called the meeting a "starting point" for improving U.S.-Russia relations, which he said are at a post-Cold War low. Following the summit, Trump advised Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to "make a deal," while Russian state media portrayed the meeting as a diplomatic victory for Moscow.</p>

          <p>In a wide-ranging interview, English football legend Wayne Rooney discussed pivotal moments from his playing career, his challenging foray into management, and his new role as a television pundit. He credited a conversation with a youth manager at age 14 for turning him away from a troubled path and focusing him on football. Rooney identified the 2005 FA Cup final loss as the result he would most like to change and expressed his intention to be an honest and fair pundit, even if it means criticizing former teammates. He also spoke about his family life and his efforts to educate himself on various subjects off the pitch.</p>

          <p>The summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska is analyzed as a significant diplomatic victory for the Russian leader, who was welcomed with a red carpet despite being shunned by most Western nations. The meeting, however, produced no tangible ceasefire agreement for Ukraine, with Putin reiterating maximalist demands disguised as addressing the conflict's "root causes." Trump's post-summit statement was notably vague, lacking any mention of Ukraine or consequences for Russia's failure to agree to a deal. The key takeaways from the article suggest the event yielded more questions than answers, culminating in Putin's invitation for a future meeting in Moscow.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's government is planning significant changes to its residency rules for mainland Chinese nationals, a move described by critics as an "attack" on cross-strait spouses. Citing national security threats like infiltration and coercion from Beijing, the new policy would require applicants to provide notarized proof of having relinquished their household registration and passport in mainland China. This proposal marks a sharp turn in cross-strait governance, reflecting President Lai's strategy to eliminate dual-status ambiguities he believes could pose a security risk to the island. Applicants would need to submit official certificates or a sworn affidavit to comply with the new requirements.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a crucial 3-2 victory over the San Diego Padres, moving back into a tie for first place in the National League West division. The win helped the team overcome a recent slump and the pre-game news that Max Muncy was placed on the injured list. Pitcher Clayton Kershaw delivered a strong performance over six innings, supported by solid defense and timely offense, including a go-ahead sacrifice fly from Mookie Betts. Teoscar Hernández added a vital solo home run, and the bullpen successfully protected the narrow lead to end a frustrating string of late-game losses.</p>

While the storm is not currently projected to impact the United States mainland, its path is forecast to pass just north of the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico.

However, Trump also acknowledged that the final agreement is contingent on Ukraine's acceptance, noting that Kyiv "has to agree with it" and could potentially reject the terms.

          <p>Democrats in California have unveiled a proposal to redraw the state's congressional district maps, a move aimed at gaining up to five additional U.S. House seats. This effort is framed as a direct response to a similar Republican plan in Texas, which seeks to create more GOP-favored districts at President Trump's urging. The California plan would require a state constitutional amendment and voter approval in a special election. If passed, it could significantly strengthen the Democratic majority in the state's congressional delegation, but it faces legal challenges and criticism for prioritizing partisan advantage over the independent commission-drawn maps currently in use.</p>

The article suggests Putin achieved a strategic victory by being welcomed back onto the world stage on U.S. soil without making any tangible concessions. While a worst-case scenario of Trump unilaterally accepting Putin's terms was avoided, the summit ultimately provided Putin with more time to continue his war, with no clear path to peace established.</p>

          <p>An internal review by the Arkansas Department of Corrections reveals that Grant Hardin, a convicted murderer known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," meticulously planned his prison escape over six months. He exploited lax security in the prison kitchen where he worked to gather supplies and create a fake law enforcement uniform. According to the report, Hardin stated he simply walked up to a gate and directed the tower guard to open it, which they did without confirming his identity. The escape led to the firing of two employees, and the review cited multiple procedural failures, including Hardin's improper security classification at the medium-security facility.</p>
