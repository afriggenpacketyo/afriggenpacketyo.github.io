          <p>The Trump administration has brokered an unusual deal allowing Nvidia and AMD to sell specific AI chips to China in exchange for 15% of the revenue. This arrangement grants the companies export licenses for their H20 and MI308 chips, which were previously restricted, securing their access to the lucrative Chinese market. While investors view the deal as a net positive, as 85% of revenue is better than none, it raises long-term uncertainty and sets a strange precedent for government involvement in corporate sales. The move is seen as a transactional approach by the administration to balance economic interests with national security concerns.</p>

          <p>Cannabis sector stocks experienced a significant rally following a report that the Trump administration is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less restrictive drug schedule. Currently a Schedule I drug alongside heroin, a potential move to Schedule III would be a "gamechanger" for the industry, according to analysts. Such a reclassification would ease tax burdens, open doors for institutional investment, and provide other major benefits to cannabis companies. While many of these stocks are still far below their all-time highs, the news has generated considerable optimism for the future of the approximately $80 billion market. (not investment advice)</p>

This action follows an executive order to "Make the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful" and comes despite official police data showing a 7% decrease in overall crime this year. D.C.

          <p>Ford has announced a significant $2 billion investment in its Louisville, Kentucky, assembly plant to focus on producing more affordable electric vehicles. This funding is in addition to a previously planned $3 billion for a battery park in Michigan, with both projects expected to create or secure nearly 4,000 jobs. The company aims to launch a midsize, four-door electric pickup from the Louisville facility by 2027. CEO Jim Farley stated that Ford took a "radical approach" to design innovative and accessible EVs for American consumers, addressing both performance and cost of ownership.</p>

          <p>Forecasters have identified the formation of Tropical Storm Erin in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, located west of the Cabo Verde islands. The U.S. National Hurricane Center reported that the storm has the potential to strengthen and become the first hurricane of the Atlantic season. While its current trajectory is westward, it is not yet clear if it will pose a direct threat to the United States. This development aligns with predictions for an above-normal hurricane season, with experts anticipating between 13 and 18 named storms, of which five to nine could intensify into hurricanes.</p>

The company is racing to meet a Federal Communications Commission deadline requiring it to have approximately 1,600 satellites in orbit by July 2026. Despite being in the early stages, Amazon is competing with SpaceX's Starlink and has already secured government contracts, with plans to begin commercial service later this year.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defended the government's decision to ban the activist group Palestine Action, stating it is "not a non-violent organisation." Her comments follow the arrest of over 500 individuals for supporting the group, which was proscribed under terror legislation after causing an estimated £7 million in damages. Cooper suggested that some supporters may not be aware of the group's full nature due to reporting restrictions on ongoing prosecutions. Human rights organizations like Amnesty International have expressed deep concern over the arrests, criticizing UK terrorism laws as overly broad and a threat to free expression.</p>

          <p>A court has heard that Kent Labour councillor Ricky Jones was "rabble rousing" a crowd when he allegedly called for far-right protesters to have their throats cut during a counter-protest. At his trial, jurors were shown a video where Jones referred to the opposing group as "disgusting Nazi fascists" and made a throat-slitting gesture. The prosecution argued this occurred in a "tinderbox" atmosphere where violence could have easily erupted, even though the far-right group did not appear. Jones, who has been suspended by the Labour Party, denies the charge of encouraging violent disorder.</p>

The incident has drawn condemnation from press freedom organizations, which note that at least 178 Palestinian journalists have been killed since the war began. With international media largely barred from Gaza, the burden of reporting has fallen on local journalists, making the conflict exceptionally deadly for the press.</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old man has been rescued after being stranded for nine days in the British Columbia wilderness when his truck broke down. Andrew Barber survived by drinking pond water, eating what he could find, and building a makeshift shelter. He was located after a search helicopter spotted his truck, which led them to find where he had written "help" on a rock and "SOS" in the mud. Severely dehydrated and with a leg injury, he was taken to a hospital for treatment and has since been released.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stated that individuals who commit heinous male crimes like sexual assault "probably" forfeit their right to choose their gender. Reflecting on the controversy surrounding transgender offender Isla Bryson, Sturgeon admitted she was partly responsible for the debate on gender recognition losing "all sense of rationality." She also expressed regret for not pausing the gender self-identification legislation, which was ultimately blocked by the UK government. Her comments mark a significant shift in her public stance on the highly divisive issue.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 09:52:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that consumers should carefully evaluate their travel credit cards as major issuers increase annual fees and alter perks. For example, the Chase Sapphire Reserve's annual fee has jumped 45% to $795, while cards from Capital One and American Express are tightening rules for free airport lounge access for guests. Analysts stress that these premium cards are only valuable if the benefits are fully utilized and are not a good fit for those who carry a monthly balance, as high interest rates can quickly negate any rewards. Before applying, consumers should consider their travel frequency and brand loyalty to determine if a card's cost is justified.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady but expected to make cuts later this year, a financial analyst advises savers to act quickly to lock in current high yields. Experts suggest that the window to secure rates above 4% on savings vehicles is closing. For liquid savings, high-yield savings accounts offer attractive rates, though they are variable and will likely fall with any Fed cuts. For those with a defined timeline, certificates of deposit (CDs) or U.S. Treasurys can lock in a fixed rate for a set term, providing a hedge against future rate decreases.

          <p>The British government is considering a major change to driving laws that would require motorists over the age of 70 to pass compulsory eye tests to remain on the road. The proposal is part of a new road safety strategy that may also include lowering the drink-driving limit in England and Wales to match Scotland's. The move follows a coroner's report that called the UK's licensing system the "laxest in Europe" after an inquest into four deaths caused by drivers with failing eyesight. Currently, the UK relies on drivers to self-report visual conditions.</p>

          <p>Finnish authorities have filed charges against the captain and two senior officers of the Eagle S, a Russia-linked oil tanker, for damaging undersea infrastructure. The men are accused of aggravated criminal mischief after their vessel allegedly dragged its anchor for 90 kilometers, severing five submarine cables between Finland and Estonia in December. The incident caused at least 60 million euros in damages and is viewed by Western officials as part of a broader pattern of sabotage linked to Moscow.

The company's revenue grew 35% year-over-year to nearly $1.4 billion, and it significantly narrowed its net loss to just $4.7 million from $32.8 million a year prior. CEO Adam Aron attributed the strong performance to a recovering industry-wide box office and growth in premium offerings.

This passive investing strategy aims to match average market returns, which historically outperforms the majority of active money managers.

This arrangement reverses a previous ban on these chips, which was initially justified on national security grounds. Analysts suggest the deal reflects a shift in strategy, possibly aiming to keep China reliant on U.S. technology rather than spurring its domestic innovation through a complete blockade. The move, likely a result of intense lobbying, blurs the lines between national security policy and government participation in corporate revenue, raising questions about future U.S.-China trade dynamics.</p>
