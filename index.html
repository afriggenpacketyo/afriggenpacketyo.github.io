          <p>On the 90th anniversary of the Social Security Act, former President Trump announced a proposal to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits for most seniors. The plan is part of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" and is being touted as the largest tax break for seniors in U.S. history. The administration also highlighted improvements to the Social Security Administration, such as reduced customer service wait times and efforts to combat fraud, countering Democratic criticism that his policies would harm the program. This article details the administration's claims of strengthening the vital safety net for nearly 72 million Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New Mexico's governor has declared a state of emergency for the city of Española and surrounding areas due to a significant increase in violent crime and drug trafficking. The declaration authorizes $750,000 in emergency funds to provide additional resources to law enforcement and support local communities. This action comes as police calls in the region have more than doubled in two years, and Rio Arriba County faces the highest overdose death rate in the state, largely driven by fentanyl. This is the second such emergency declaration for crime in New Mexico this year, following a similar measure in Albuquerque.</p>

          <p>A Breeze Airways flight from Virginia to Los Angeles was forced to divert to Grand Junction, Colorado, after a passenger became disruptive and violent. According to authorities, the man yelled racist slurs and waved a skateboard, leading to a physical altercation that caused minor injuries to a flight attendant and another passenger. The passenger was reportedly restrained twice by the flight crew but managed to break free both times before being taken into custody by police upon landing. The incident is one of over 1,000 cases of unruly passengers reported to the FAA so far in 2025.</p>

          <p>Low-income Americans are facing increasing difficulty affording air conditioning as energy costs rise, a challenge exacerbated by a Trump administration proposal to eliminate the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). This federal program currently helps over six million households pay their utility bills. Research indicates that climate change has significantly increased wholesale electricity costs, which are passed on to consumers, with electricity prices rising 5.5% in the last year. The White House has called LIHEAP a "failed program," while critics argue its elimination will worsen the financial strain on vulnerable families during periods of extreme heat.

Roberto Salazar, 38, was arrested by Mexican authorities in March and was one of 26 prisoners transferred to U.S. custody this week. Escalante was shot and killed outside his parents' home while preparing to go to work, in what authorities believe was a case of mistaken identity by gang members. Salazar faces charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy, which carry a sentence of life without parole.</p>

          <p>Researchers from Imperial College London have warned that UK cities are increasingly at risk from "firewaves," a term they coined to describe multiple urban wildfires occurring during prolonged hot, dry weather. The warning follows recent heath and gorse fires in London and Edinburgh, which highlighted the vulnerability of urban green spaces. Scientists have developed a model to predict when conditions are ripe for such events, noting that vegetation becomes dangerously flammable after about ten consecutive dry days. This emerging threat, driven by climate change, could overwhelm emergency services and poses a significant danger to homes and infrastructure in densely populated areas.</p>

          <p>An ongoing media revolution is shifting public trust from traditional institutions to independent online creators, with platforms like Instagram and TikTok becoming primary news sources for many Americans. This article argues that while this environment can breed misinformation, a growing cohort of "evidence-based creators" are providing fact-checked, nuanced information directly to their audiences. These journalists and specialists build trust through direct engagement but struggle to compete with viral falsehoods. The author proposes new infrastructure, such as a certification system for credibility and collaborative frameworks for creators, to help this new media ecosystem mature and better serve a public hungry for truth.</p>

          <p>A Washington, D.C. man is facing federal assault charges after allegedly throwing a sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agent during a confrontation. The incident occurred amid heightened tensions over the increased presence of federal law enforcement in the city, which was deployed as part of the Trump administration's public safety emergency declaration. According to the criminal complaint, the man shouted profanities at the officer before throwing the sandwich and was later apprehended. While the administration cites rising crime, local officials point to data showing that violent crime has actually decreased significantly this year.</p>

          <p>Kevin Hochman, CEO of Brinker International, credited a significant boost in marketing spending and effective value offerings for the recent success of its Chili's restaurant chain. The company's marketing budget increased from $32 million to $137 million over three years, fueling strategies that include social media influencer campaigns and a standardized $10.99 value meal. This approach led to a 23.7% increase in same-store sales at Chili's and prompted the company to raise its full-year forecast. Hochman stated that driving growth is the company's primary strategy to combat the inflationary pressures affecting the restaurant industry. (not investment advice)</p>

While analysts consider Perplexity's bid a long shot, it highlights the immense pressure on Google and its parent company, Alphabet.

          <p>Comedian Marc Maron, host of the long-running podcast "WTF," has sharply criticized the modern podcasting scene, calling it a "world of mediocre afternoon drive-time radio."

He specifically targeted the common format of "two or three white guys, sitting behind mics, talking about the last time they s--- their pants as adults." His comments reflect a distaste for a perceived decline in the quality and uniqueness of content now that podcasting has become mainstream.</p>

A key driver of optimism is the company's growing involvement in artificial intelligence, with management reporting that AI infrastructure orders from web companies reached $800 million in the quarter and over $2 billion for the fiscal year. These results suggest Cisco is successfully capitalizing on the demand for AI-related networking equipment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research from UC Riverside reveals that land subsidence in California's San Joaquin Valley, caused by excessive groundwater pumping, is depressing home prices by up to 5.4%. This has resulted in an estimated collective loss of $1.87 billion in home values across eight counties between 2015 and 2021. The phenomenon, where the ground sinks several inches per year in some areas, also causes cracked foundations and damage to infrastructure. Researchers say the findings highlight the significant economic cost of groundwater overuse and add urgency to implementing the state's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act to slow or stop the permanent sinking.</p>

          <p>The announcement of a presidential summit between the U.S. and Russia in Alaska has brought renewed attention to the history of the territory's acquisition. In 1867, the United States purchased Alaska from the Russian Empire for $7.2 million, a deal that was initially criticized as "Seward's Folly" but later proved to be a strategic and resource-rich acquisition. This article notes that even today, some in Russia question the legitimacy of the sale and view the land as historically Russian. The location of the high-stakes meeting between the two world leaders adds a unique historical layer to their modern diplomatic engagement.</p>

          <p>Newly installed temporary barriers have successfully protected Alaska's capital, Juneau, from what could have been catastrophic damage from a record-breaking glacial outburst flood. The Mendenhall River crested at unprecedented levels after a nearby glacier-dammed lake released a massive surge of water, a phenomenon intensifying due to climate change. While some minor flooding occurred, the fortified walls, made of giant reinforced sandbags, held back the worst of the water and prevented the widespread destruction of homes seen in previous years. Officials expressed relief that the proactive measures worked as intended, avoiding a major disaster for the community.</p>

The court decided on procedural grounds that the humanitarian nonprofits who sued did not have the standing to bring the challenge, stating only the Government Accountability Office could do so. This ruling is a major blow to global health and humanitarian programs, as the withheld funds include significant support for HIV/AIDS prevention.
