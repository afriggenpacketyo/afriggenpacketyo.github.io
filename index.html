        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the University of Cologne indicates that while parents find greater meaning in life compared to childfree individuals, they often experience lower life satisfaction, particularly mothers. The research, based on data from the European Social Survey, highlights that the impact of parenthood on life satisfaction varies significantly across countries, with Scandinavian nations showing less pronounced differences between parents and non-parents. Factors such as childcare, financial support, and gender equality play a crucial role in determining parental satisfaction levels, suggesting that societal support and equitable partnerships contribute to a more positive experience for parents. The study emphasizes the importance of viewing children as a societal responsibility rather than solely a parental one, advocating for policies that support families and promote gender equality.</p>

The Health Ministry has launched a national campaign to combat obesity, but it has faced criticism for stigmatizing overweight individuals and overlooking broader economic struggles.

          <p>At least seven people have died after a highway bridge collapsed onto railway tracks in Russia close to the Ukraine border. The collapse in Bryansk brought down several heavy trucks on to a moving passenger train late on Saturday night, with 31 people also reportedly injured. Hours later, a second bridge also collapsed along the Trosna-Kalinovka highway in the Kursk region, injuring a train driver. Authorities are investigating the incidents, with Moscow Railway alleging the first bridge collapsed "as a result of illegal interference in transport operations".</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to publish a strategic defence review outlining significant new investments in national security, intended to send a strong message to hostile states, particularly Moscow. The review is expected to conclude that the UK faces a "new era of threat" and will highlight the immediate dangers posed by Russia and other countries, including China. As part of this initiative, the government will invest Â£1.5 billion in at least six new defence factories, creating 1,800 jobs across the UK. The funding will increase UK munitions spending to Â£6 billion during this parliament, with a focus on long-range weapons and drones.</p>

          <p>An analyst suggests that Donald Trump's approach to China, characterized by a mix of aggression and weakness, increases the likelihood of conflict over Taiwan. Trump's trade policies and tariffs are seen as provocative, potentially pushing China's President Xi Jinping to take action. The analyst argues that Trump's policies are driven by self-interest and fear, leading to a perception that the U.S. is unwilling to defend Taiwan. The piece concludes that this perceived weakness could embolden China to take aggressive actions towards Taiwan.</p>

However, U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff has described Hamas's response as "totally unacceptable." The proposed amendments come as the conflict nears 20 months, with increasing desperation among Palestinians and relatives of hostages. A Hamas statement indicated that the proposal aims for a permanent ceasefire, a comprehensive Israeli withdrawal, and ensured aid flow, while Witkoff described a 60-day ceasefire deal to release half the living hostages.</p>

          <p>Skateboarding powerhouse Japan has welcomed the new Olympic age limit restricting competition to athletes 14 and older from the 2028 Los Angeles Games, despite the potential impact on its medal prospects.

Japan's street skateboarding head coach Daisuke Hayakawa has endorsed the new restriction against the backdrop of increasingly severe injuries being reported among growing children. World Skate Japan has decided not to set an age limit for domestic tournaments amid the latest news.</p>

          <p>An amendment to the Penal Code placing greater emphasis on rehabilitation efforts in prison took effect Sunday in Japan, marking the first time changes have been made to the forms of punishment under Japan's more than a century-old crime laws. Imprisonment is no longer divided into categories of with and without labor, and prison work is no longer mandatory for inmates, allowing more time for rehabilitative guidance and education to reduce recidivism, according to the Justice Ministry. The new system sets up 24 programs tailored to an inmate's age, characteristics, and other factors, including specialized curricula for elderly inmates and those with addiction issues. Inmates will be sent to prisons that can offer appropriate programs for them, with their situations reviewed every six months.</p>

          <p>Dana Chandler has been convicted of the 2002 murders of her ex-husband, Mike Sisco, and his girlfriend, Karen Harkness, after three trials. The case involved circumstantial evidence, including Chandler's history of stalking Sisco and conflicting alibis. In the third trial, Chandler represented herself, but was ultimately found guilty. The first conviction was reversed due to prosecutorial misconduct, leading to two subsequent trials, and Hailey Seel, Chandler's daughter, has been a key witness, testifying against her mother.</p>
