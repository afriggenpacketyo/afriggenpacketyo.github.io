          <p>President Trump refuted China's claims that no trade discussions are happening between the two countries, stating that meetings occurred despite China's denial. This follows China's call for the U.S. to remove unilateral tariffs to resolve trade issues, with Trump and his Treasury Secretary hinting at easing tensions. This comes after increased tariffs from both sides and China restricting critical mineral exports to the U.S., highlighting the ongoing trade disputes between the two economic powers.

Trump mentioned putting pressure on both sides to end the war in Ukraine, following the deadliest attacks Kyiv has seen since last July. These strikes complicate efforts to advance a peace deal, which Trump previously claimed he could quickly achieve, and prompted President Zelensky to cut short his trip to South Africa and return home.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest Reed Bank, a contested area in the South China Sea rich in gas and oil, could become a future conflict hotspot between China and the Philippines, particularly if Manila pursues unilateral resource exploration. The area holds significant oil and gas reserves, but development is stalled due to tensions between the two nations. However, factors like Manila's limited development capacity and careful risk assessment by companies could delay its emergence as a flashpoint.</p>

          <p>During the trial of medical workers accused of negligence in Diego Maradona's death, doctors testified that the soccer legend was a "high-risk" and "very difficult" patient. He was experiencing withdrawal symptoms and required significant care, and hospital authorities disagreed with the decision to continue his recovery outside the hospital. Maradona's former wife and a doctor questioned the decision to move him to a private home instead of a rehabilitation center, and the trial continues next Tuesday.</p>

Japan urged the U.S. to review its protectionist measures, and Trump has called into question Japan's trade barriers, while Japanese officials have dismissed claims of yen devaluation.</p>
