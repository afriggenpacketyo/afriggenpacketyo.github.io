          <p>The United States and the United Arab Emirates have announced a partnership to construct a large artificial intelligence data center in Abu Dhabi, which is described as the largest facility of its kind outside of the U.S. The data center will be built by the Emirati firm G42 in collaboration with several U.S. companies, though the names of these companies have not been disclosed. This facility will boast a 5-gigawatt capacity and span 10 square miles, according to the Department of Commerce. The announcement coincided with President Donald Trump's visit to the UAE as part of a broader Middle East trip, where he engaged with heads of state and revealed multiple deals.</p>

          <p>Mediterranean chain Cava reported sales exceeding expectations for its latest fiscal quarter, demonstrating resilience amidst a challenging environment for the broader restaurant industry. Same-store sales grew by 10.8%, driven by a 7.5% increase in traffic, with consumers showing a preference for higher-priced items. Cava's CFO noted that diners are increasingly choosing Cava over fast food and casual dining options, a trend observed over several quarters. Despite its strong quarterly performance, Cava maintained its same-store sales forecast of 6% to 8% growth, and the company's stock experienced a decline in extended trading due to investor concerns about the conservative outlook.</p>

          <p>A Republican mega-bill encompassing President Donald Trump's legislative agenda faces potential derailment due to opposition from several Republican hardliners concerned about the national debt. Representative Ralph Norman voiced his intent to vote against the bill, and other Republicans, including Chip Roy and Andrew Clyde, are also expected to oppose it. Speaker Mike Johnson faces a challenge in unifying his divided conference to pass the bill, especially with sticking points related to Medicaid and tax reform, including disagreements over the SALT caps. The House Republicans formally unveiled the text of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a comprehensive 1,116-page document.</p>

Police have released CCTV footage of the teens fleeing the scene and an image of a duffel bag believed to have been used to carry the kittens.

Ventura testified about Combs' alleged drug use and its impact on his moods, describing him as potentially "pretty explosive."

          <p>A resolution led by Senator Tim Kaine, aiming to compel the Trump administration to produce a report on El Salvador's human rights practices, failed in the Senate by a vote of 45-50. Kaine argued that the resolution, invoking powers under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, would freeze foreign assistance to El Salvador if the Trump administration did not comply. During the debate, Senator John Barrasso accused Democrats of defending illegal immigrant criminals, while Kaine criticized El Salvador's government for violating the human rights of American citizens. The resolution was also connected to Senator Chris Van Hollen's efforts to bring a deported suspected gang member back to Maryland.</p>

          <p>Florida has become the second state, after Utah, to ban the addition of fluoride to drinking water after Governor Ron DeSantis signed a corresponding bill into law. The decision goes against the advice of public health experts and medical professionals, who assert that it will lead to an increase in tooth decay and cavities, especially among children. DeSantis defended the bill as protecting against forced medication, arguing that individuals should have the choice to use fluoride through toothpaste and mouthwash. The law, which takes effect on July 1, outlaws the use of certain additives in water systems, impacting approximately 100 public water systems across Florida.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Republican-backed bill in the House, encompassing various tax breaks promised by President Trump, does not include the elimination of taxes on Social Security benefits, a suggestion Trump made during a campaign rally. The omission is due to restrictions on altering the retirement program through the reconciliation process, which the Republicans are using to pass the bill. Instead, the bill offers an extra $4,000 deduction for filers aged 65 and older, aiming to provide tax relief to senior citizens. Experts warn that eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits would negatively impact the program's long-term fiscal stability and Medicare, potentially leading to earlier depletion of trust funds.</p>

The specific role of the Guard troops remains unclear, including whether they would provide transportation, security, detain migrants, or participate in arrests. This request follows President Trump's order to increase the deportation force by 20,000 officers, and using Guard forces is seen as the quickest way to achieve this.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a bill to make the $2,000 child tax credit permanent and increase it to $2,500 from 2025 through 2028. After 2028, the credit would revert to $2,000 and be indexed for inflation. However, critics point out that the plan excludes 17 million children from low-income families who do not owe federal taxes and requires both parents to have a Social Security number, potentially affecting 4.5 million children. The current child tax credit is worth up to $2,000 per qualifying child under 17, with up to $1,700 being refundable for 2025.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case concerning President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, focusing on whether a single district court judge can block a policy nationwide. The justices did not consider the legal merits of Trump's order, which seeks to deny citizenship to children born to undocumented migrants. Several justices expressed skepticism about the legality of the order, with Justice Sotomayor stating it violates multiple Supreme Court precedents. The arguments also addressed the history of universal injunctions and the practical challenges of implementing different citizenship rules across states.</p>

Justices questioned whether eliminating nationwide injunctions would allow unlawful orders to remain in place too long.
