          <p>Online fashion retailer Shein has confidentially filed for an initial public offering in Hong Kong, as reported by the Financial Times. This move is seen as an attempt to pressure U.K. regulators who have been slow to approve its long-planned London listing. The Singapore-based company has faced significant scrutiny from Western lawmakers over allegations of forced labor in its supply chain, which it denies, complicating its efforts to go public in major Western markets like New York and London.

          <p>Officials in Yolo County, California, have confirmed the recovery of remains belonging to all seven workers who were missing after a massive explosion at a fireworks warehouse. The incident occurred at an unpermitted facility owned by a county sheriff's lieutenant, destroying structures and sparking an 80-acre grass fire. While the coroner works to identify the victims through DNA testing, federal and state agencies are investigating the cause of the blast, with families of the deceased seeking justice.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting, U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu celebrated recent strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities while discussing the stalled Gaza ceasefire negotiations. Netanyahu nominated Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize for his regional peace efforts. However, significant disagreements persist, particularly over the "day-after" plan for Gaza and the establishment of a Palestinian state, a condition for normalization with key Arab nations like Saudi Arabia.</p>

          <p>In the wake of deadly floods, public records reveal that officials in Kerr County, Texas, have discussed the need for an improved flood warning system for nearly a decade. A 2016 study highlighted the region's high risk of flash flooding and deemed the existing infrastructure "antiquated and not reliable," proposing a new system costing nearly $1 million. Despite these long-standing concerns and recent discussions this year to implement a new system, the project stalled, leaving the community vulnerable to the recent disaster.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) appears to be phasing out the requirement for passengers in standard security lines to remove their shoes at some U.S. airports. Sources indicate the change has been implemented at several airports, including Baltimore and Fort Lauderdale, with travelers at other major hubs also reporting they were not asked to remove footwear. The rule was first implemented nationwide in 2006 following the failed "shoe bomber" attempt, and its relaxation marks a significant shift in airport security procedures.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost 9-1 to the Milwaukee Brewers, extending their losing streak to four games. Starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto had the shortest outing of his MLB career, giving up five runs in a disastrous 41-pitch first inning from which the team could not recover. A three-run homer by Andrew Vaughn and a critical defensive error by Mookie Betts contributed to the early collapse, leaving the shorthanded Dodgers lineup unable to mount a comeback against Brewers' pitcher Freddy Peralta.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has moved to permanently restrict "renovictions," where landlords evict tenants under the guise of substantial remodels to then charge higher rents. The new amendment to the city's "just cause" ordinance would only permit such evictions if a government agency issues an order to vacate the property to address code violations. The city is also developing rules to ensure tenants are properly relocated and compensated during legitimate renovations, aiming to protect renters from displacement.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic flash flood in Texas's Hill Country over the holiday weekend has killed at least 104 people, with many victims being children and staff at a summer camp. The disaster was caused by a confluence of weather systems that dumped massive amounts of rain on a flood-prone region, causing the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in 45 minutes. Officials are now facing scrutiny over the timeliness of warnings and evacuations, as search and rescue efforts continue amid the widespread devastation.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics has projected a 56% decline in its second-quarter operating profit, falling short of analyst expectations. The company is struggling to meet the demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, a critical component for AI processors dominated by leader Nvidia, and is reportedly behind competitors like SK Hynix in this area. Analysts attribute the disappointing forecast to ongoing losses in its chip foundry business and a muted contribution from the high-margin HBM market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Times commentary piece argues that the Trump administration's priorities are misplaced, focusing on immigration enforcement while cutting funds for medical and scientific research. The author contrasts the "show of force" by federal agents in L.A.'s MacArthur Park with budget cuts to agencies like the National Institutes of Health and the National Weather Service. The article suggests that these cuts undermine the nation's ability to respond to real threats like climate change, exemplified by the deadly Texas floods, and a potential pandemic.</p>
