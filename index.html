          <p>This Fox News article explores the concept of a seven-day week, arguing that its origins lie in the Bible, specifically the commandment to work for six days and rest on the seventh. It delves into the historical context, noting how ancient cultures had varying week lengths and how the Soviets attempted to eliminate the seven-day week. The article contrasts the 20th-century view of work as a financial necessity with the modern obsession with busyness, ultimately concluding that a balanced life of meaningful work and sacred rest is the key to productivity and happiness. The article cites studies showing a productivity ceiling of 55 hours a week and suggests that the biblical model aligns with this research, promoting a life that is neither all leisure nor all work.

          <p>A devastating house fire in Brent, London, resulted in the deaths of a 43-year-old mother, her 15-year-old daughter, and two sons aged eight and four. Emergency services responded to the blaze in Tillett Close, Stonebridge, where they discovered the victims. A 41-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody, while another woman in her 70s and a teenage girl were hospitalized. The London Fire Brigade deployed eight fire engines and approximately 70 firefighters to combat the fire, and neighbors recounted hearing smashing and screaming before realizing the adjacent building was ablaze. The investigation is ongoing to determine the cause of the fire.</p>

All potentially contaminated products have been removed from store shelves, and customers can return the pouches for a full refund. The recall follows a similar incident in March when Target recalled its store brand baby food for the same reason.

          <p>Archaeologists have uncovered the base of a sixth-century Byzantine bucket at Sutton Hoo, England, containing cremated animal and human remains. The Bromeswell bucket, depicting a North African hunting scene, has puzzled researchers since its fragments were unearthed in 1986. The new excavations revealed the bucket's entire base, along with a comb and cremated remains, shedding light on its purpose as a burial vessel. Researchers believe the bucket, likely a diplomatic gift or acquired by a Saxon soldier, was used to contain the remains of a high-status individual in the Sutton Hoo community.</p>

          <p>Five years after the murder of George Floyd, Minneapolis is still grappling with calls for police reform, and Police Chief Brian O'Hara is implementing changes to improve safety and community trust. O'Hara acknowledges that Floyd's death remains an "open wound" in the city, and while shootings are decreasing, Minneapolis is one of the few major cities where violent crime has not significantly improved since 2020. The department faces an officer shortage, straining resources, but O'Hara is focused on "getting back to the basics" and restoring pride in the profession. The Justice Department recently ended investigations of several police agencies, but O'Hara stated that reform efforts will continue.</p>

          <p>A power outage struck the Cannes region in France during the final day of the Cannes Film Festival, affecting 160,000 homes. The outage was caused by a fire at a substation and vandalism of an electricity pylon, with officials suspecting a criminal act. Despite the disruption, the Cannes Film Festival announced that the closing ceremony would proceed as planned, using an alternative power supply. The outage caused traffic lights to fail and led to traffic jams, but power was gradually restored throughout the day.</p>

Tapper noted the emergence of a "nonfunctioning Biden" and questioned when it became a real concern about his ability to serve. The discussion delves into the behind-the-scenes perspectives on Biden's performance and the implications for his presidency.</p>

NHS England aims to provide appropriate care in a calm environment, reducing long waits in A&E. While some centers will be new units, others will integrate into existing A&Es.

          <p>The Catholic Archbishop of New Orleans, Gregory Aymond, made a rare court appearance in a federal bankruptcy case concerning claims from hundreds of clergy abuse survivors. Aymond stated his concern for the survivors and his desire to expedite negotiations, as the bankruptcy has dragged on for too long. Attorneys representing approximately 200 of the 600 abuse claimants criticized the proposed settlement plan, with one calling it “dead on arrival.” The settlement would provide $130 million in cash and up to $110 million more from insurance and property sales, but some survivors are pushing for individual lawsuits against the church.</p>

The UCAV, developed by General Atomics, is one of two designs in the first phase of the CCA program, aimed at augmenting crewed fighter aircraft in air-to-air missions. The U.S. Air Force has begun ground testing the CCA designs, with production expected in 2026.</p>
