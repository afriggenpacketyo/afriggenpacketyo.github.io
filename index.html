          <p>A large explosion and subsequent fire at a fireworks warehouse in Yolo County, California, have left seven individuals unaccounted for. The incident, which occurred Tuesday evening, prompted mandatory evacuations in a one-mile radius and caused a smoke plume reaching up to 15,000 feet. Two people were treated for injuries, and the fire spread to nearby grasslands, burning approximately 80 acres. Officials are now conducting a search and investigation while managing road closures and power outages in the rural community.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied bail for Sean "Diddy" Combs following his conviction on two prostitution-related charges, meaning he will remain in custody until his sentencing. The jury acquitted the music mogul of more severe charges like racketeering and sex trafficking, but found him guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution. Prosecutors argued that Combs is a flight risk and has shown no remorse, while the defense contended he is a "model prisoner" and should be released. The judge sided with the prosecution, stating the crimes trigger mandatory detention, and proposed a sentencing date of October 3.</p>

          <p>A federal judge appointed by President Biden has issued a temporary injunction, pausing the Trump administration's plan to reorganize the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The proposed overhaul included laying off about 20,000 employees and consolidating agency divisions. The lawsuit was brought by 19 Democratic state attorneys general who argued the changes would sabotage the nation's healthcare system. An HHS spokesperson expressed disagreement with the ruling, stating the reforms were intended to make the sprawling agency more efficient and focused on public health goals.</p>

          <p>This essay reflects on the brief but impactful career of Ritchie Valens, a foundational figure in rock 'n' roll who died at 17 in a 1959 plane crash. It highlights his innovative ability to blend traditional Mexican sounds with American rock, doo-wop, and soul, creating timeless hits like "Donna" and "La Bamba." The article also discusses the making of the 1987 biopic "La Bamba," emphasizing how the film's re-recorded soundtrack by Los Lobos introduced his music to a new generation. Valens' work is credited with paving the way for future Latino artists to achieve mainstream success.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis argues that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s support for the new Republican budget bill undermines his stated mission to improve national health. The bill proposes significant changes to Medicaid, including work requirements, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates would cause nearly 12 million people to lose health insurance. While Kennedy frames the changes as a way to reduce fraud and focus on the neediest, critics argue that cutting access to care for low-income and chronically ill populations directly conflicts with a public health agenda. The article points out that Medicaid currently funds many of the preventative and supportive services Kennedy champions.</p>

With a slim majority, GOP leadership is working with the White House to persuade holdouts ahead of a July 4th deadline.

Despite entering the tournament with tempered expectations due to a difficult grass-court season and a back injury, her confidence appears renewed. Her strong play, particularly her forehand and movement on grass, has positioned her as a formidable opponent in the upcoming high-stakes match.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is conducting a comprehensive review of weapons deliveries to allies worldwide, prompted by concerns that U.S. stockpiles of critical munitions are dwindling. This review follows a White House decision to limit some weapon deliveries to Ukraine, including Patriot anti-air missiles and 155mm artillery shells. The decision was partly influenced by the high expenditure of munitions during recent conflicts, such as defending Israel and Qatar from Iranian attacks. While the Pentagon insists the U.S. military remains fully equipped for any mission, Ukrainian officials have expressed concern that any delay in aid will embolden Russia.</p>

          <p>Planned Parenthood's CEO, Alexis McGill Johnson, has warned that the Republican spending bill moving through Congress could be "existential" for the organization. A provision in the bill would ban Medicaid funding for one year to non-profits that provide abortions, potentially costing Planned Parenthood about $700 million. This could lead to the closure of nearly 200 health centers, most of which are in states where abortion remains legal, and impact over 1.1 million patients. Proponents of the measure see it as a way to "defund" the organization, while critics describe it as a "backdoor abortion ban" that guts the healthcare safety net.</p>

Another group of moderate Republicans from poorer districts is concerned about the bill's deep cuts to Medicaid, which could harm their constituents. Despite intense lobbying from the White House, these holdouts have created a stalemate, jeopardizing the president's July 4th deadline for signing the legislation into law.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis indicates that the housing affordability crisis, long associated with coastal cities like Los Angeles, is now spreading to the Sun Belt. Cities such as Phoenix, Miami, and Atlanta have seen median home prices increase by over 100% in the past decade, outpacing even New York and San Francisco. This trend challenges the long-held view of the Sun Belt as a "pressure-release valve" for overpriced coastal markets. The article suggests that as these cities hit the limits of urban sprawl, restrictive zoning laws and local opposition to new developmentâ€”factors that drove up California's pricesâ€”are now creating similar problems across the country.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon's chief spokesperson announced that intelligence assessments indicate recent U.S. strikes against three key Iranian nuclear facilities have set back the country's program by approximately one to two years. This evaluation is more measured than President Trump's claims of complete obliteration but suggests significant damage was inflicted, particularly to the centrifuges at the Fordow enrichment site. The assessment, which has evolved since an initial, more conservative estimate, is based on materials including bomber video and external intelligence. The extent of the setback is crucial, as it dictates the timeline before Iran could potentially develop a nuclear weapon.</p>

However, analysts warn that overcoming China's industrial advantage will be extremely difficult within a single presidential term.

          <h2>Trump Administration Withholds Nearly $7 Billion in Federal Education Funding</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has withheld the release of nearly $7 billion in congressionally mandated federal funding for education. The funds were allocated for a variety of state and local initiatives, including after-school programs, English language learning, and teacher training. The administration claims the funds are under review, but critics argue this is an act of impoundmentâ€”an unconstitutional refusal to spend money appropriated by Congress. This move is seen as part of a broader effort by the administration to challenge Congress's spending authority, and it is expected to face legal challenges while disrupting school districts that had already budgeted for the money.</p>

          <p>A federal jury convicted music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs on two counts of transportation for prostitution but acquitted him of more severe charges, including racketeering and sex trafficking. The convictions relate to transporting his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura and another woman for sexual encounters, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years per count. To secure a racketeering conviction, prosecutors needed to prove he ran a criminal enterprise, a complex charge that the jury ultimately rejected. Combs still faces numerous civil lawsuits alleging sexual assault and other abuses, separate from this criminal trial.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has blocked President Trump's executive order that effectively banned migrants from seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. The judge ruled that the president overstepped his authority, stating that neither the Constitution nor existing immigration law grants him the power to bypass legal processes for asylum applications. The administration had justified the ban by declaring illegal immigration an "invasion." The ruling, which has been stayed for two weeks to allow for an appeal, is a significant setback for Trump's restrictive immigration agenda and was praised by civil liberties groups as a protection for those fleeing danger.</p>

The decision is politically significant for Tibetans who resist Chinese rule and is expected to anger Beijing, which insists it has the sole authority to approve the next Dalai Lama.

The goal is for the majority of outpatient care, including scans and follow-up appointments, to occur in these community settings by 2035.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new trade agreement with Vietnam that will impose a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports into the United States. This rate is lower than the 46% levy that was set to take effect next week as part of a broader tariff plan. The deal also includes a steeper 40% tariff on goods that are finished in Vietnam but originate from other countries like China, a practice known as trans-shipping. In return, Trump stated that Vietnam will grant U.S. products "TOTAL ACCESS" to its markets with zero tariffs, a move impacting many major brands that manufacture in the country.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Halts Trump's Policy Restricting Asylum for Migrants at the Southern Border</h2>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked a Trump administration policy that prevented migrants who cross the southern border from seeking asylum. In his ruling, Judge Randolph Moss stated that the president exceeded his legal authority and cannot unilaterally create an "alternative immigration system." The policy was based on an executive order from January in which President Trump declared the border situation an "invasion." The judge stayed his decision for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal, but the ruling represents a significant legal obstacle to the president's restrictive immigration agenda.</p>

          <p>The well-known halftime acrobat Red Panda, famous for balancing bowls on her head while on a unicycle, took a serious fall during a performance at a WNBA game in Minneapolis. While riding her unicycle, which is over seven feet tall, she appeared to lose her balance and fell forward, landing hard on the court. She was seen grabbing her left wrist in pain and was eventually taken off the floor in a wheelchair. Red Panda, born Rong Niu, has been a staple at NBA and other sporting events for decades, and the incident prompted well-wishes from players.</p>
