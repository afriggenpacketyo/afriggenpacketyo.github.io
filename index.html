          <p>Indiana Fever's Sophie Cunningham has publicly criticized former teammate DeWanna Bonner for a perceived lack of professionalism regarding her mid-season departure from the team. On her podcast, Cunningham suggested Bonner should have communicated with teammates before leaving and should expect a negative reception from fans due to how she handled the exit. The controversy stems from Bonner leaving the Fever for "personal reasons" before quickly re-signing with the Phoenix Mercury. In response, Mercury star Kahleah Copper defended Bonner, describing the fan backlash as "distasteful" and unnecessary.</p>

          <p>Michigan's Democratic Governor, Gretchen Whitmer, met with President Trump to discuss key economic issues affecting her state. She urged the president to address the negative impact of his tariff policies on Michigan's automotive industry and requested a three-year delay for changes to the state's Medicaid program. The meeting highlights Whitmer's strategy of maintaining a working relationship with the White House to secure federal investments and support for Michigan. Whitmer has defended this bipartisan approach as beneficial for securing projects like a new fighter mission at Selfridge Air National Guard Base.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have arrested and charged two Los Angeles County residents for allegedly running a scheme to illegally export sensitive, high-power AI microchips to China. Chuan Geng and Shiwei Yang are accused of using their El Monte-based company, ALX Solutions Inc., to ship tens of millions of dollars' worth of technology by mislabeling shipments and using third-party countries like Singapore and Malaysia to conceal the final destination. The exports violated U.S. Commerce Department regulations requiring a license for such sensitive technologies. If convicted, the pair could face up to 20 years in federal prison.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has filed a lawsuit seeking the removal of Democratic State Representative Gene Wu from office, labeling him a "ringleader" of the legislative walkout. Dozens of Democratic lawmakers fled the state to prevent a vote on a Republican-led congressional redistricting plan, denying the House a quorum. Abbott's petition to the Texas Supreme Court argues that Wu and others have abandoned their official duties, justifying their removal. This legal action represents a significant escalation in the political standoff over the controversial redistricting map sought by President Trump.</p>

The baby was found safe and is now in care. The search for Drummond concluded after he was spotted in a wooded area near Jackson, prompting a shelter-in-place order and his subsequent capture by law enforcement.</p>

          <p>A lead weather forecaster explains that despite significant technological advancements, public perception of forecast inaccuracy persists due to several complex factors. The article details how the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, known as the "Butterfly Effect," means tiny initial errors can lead to vastly different outcomes. Communicating vast amounts of data and uncertainty to the public in a simple format also presents a major challenge. The piece explores the future of forecasting, including the potential of AI to create more accurate long-range predictions, but also notes the limitations and the ever-present need for clear human communication.</p>

The 27-year-old deputy, who joined the department in 2020, was arrested and booked with bail set at $90,000, facing serious charges that undermine public trust in law enforcement.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals a split in the U.S. housing market, with median home prices declining in some major metropolitan areas, particularly in the South and West. Cities such as Austin and Miami have seen prices fall from their 2022 peaks, driven by an increase in housing inventory that is giving buyers more leverage. In contrast, housing markets in the Northeast and Midwest remain tight, with limited inventory and persistently high prices. This regional divergence indicates that while the national housing market has cooled modestly, the experience for buyers and sellers varies significantly depending on location.

          <p>During a nine-hour interview with the Department of Justice last month, Ghislaine Maxwell stated that she never saw Donald Trump do anything concerning, according to sources familiar with her testimony. The interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche was requested by Maxwell, who is currently appealing her sex trafficking conviction. The Trump administration is reportedly considering a public release of the interview transcripts. Maxwell's lawyer confirmed she was asked about roughly one hundred different people and did not hold anything back during the extensive questioning.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a proposal aimed at making it easier for companies to operate drones for commercial purposes. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy outlined a new regulatory framework that would create a clear approval process for businesses wanting to use drones for tasks like delivery and infrastructure inspection. Currently, operators must seek waivers on a case-by-case basis, a process critics say stifles innovation. The proposed rule would require commercial drones to meet specific safety standards, including having collision avoidance technology, and would be open for public comment for 60 days.</p>

          <p>The anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out has reported a record number of discriminatory incidents in English football during the 2024-25 season. The 1,398 reported incidents represent the highest total ever received by the organization. While overall reports of racism declined, the report highlights a significant rise in sexism and misogyny, which increased by 67%, as well as increases in faith-based abuse and transphobia. The charity's CEO stated that the findings show discrimination remains "deeply embedded" in the sport and called for stronger action from football authorities and tech companies.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is warning the public after wild pigs in Monterey County were discovered with bright blue muscle and fat tissue. Officials believe the discoloration is caused by the pigs consuming diphacinone, an anticoagulant rodenticide used in agriculture to control squirrels and other pests. The poison contains a blue dye to identify it, which then stains the tissue of animals that ingest it. Authorities are urging hunters not to consume any animal with signs of blue pigmentation and to report such findings, due to the risk of secondary poisoning.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from redirecting funds from a multibillion-dollar disaster prevention program. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 Democratic-led states, which argued that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) could not cancel the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program without congressional approval. The program provides grants to help communities protect critical infrastructure before disasters strike. The judge found that the states showed a realistic chance of irreparable harm if the program were to be terminated.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to launch a pilot program to test coverage of expensive weight loss drugs, like Wegovy and Zepbound, under Medicare and Medicaid. This move could significantly expand access for millions of Americans with obesity who currently cannot afford the treatments, which cost around $1,000 per month. The plan would allow state Medicaid programs and Medicare Part D plans to voluntarily cover these GLP-1 drugs for weight management. If implemented, this would be a major development for drugmakers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk by addressing the significant barrier of limited insurance coverage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has claimed that major financial institutions are discriminating against conservatives by closing their accounts, a practice known as "debanking." In a recent interview, Trump alleged that JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America had unfairly targeted him and others due to their political views. The issue has become a rallying point for some conservatives, though banks maintain that account closures are based on risk assessments and regulatory compliance, not political beliefs. The White House is reportedly preparing an executive order to address the practice, which can leave individuals and businesses without access to essential financial services.</p>

          <p>Byron Black, a 69-year-old inmate with severe health problems including dementia and congestive heart failure, has been executed in Tennessee. The execution proceeded despite a legal battle over his implanted heart defibrillator, which his attorneys argued could cause extreme pain if activated by the lethal injection drugs. The state's courts ultimately overturned a lower court's order to deactivate the device. Black was convicted for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend and her two young daughters. His execution drew sharp condemnation from his lawyers, who described it as a "brutal and unchecked abuse of government power."</p>

The rising temperatures are expected to worsen conditions for crews already battling three large fires in Southern and Central California, including the state's largest of the year, the Gifford fire. While strong winds are not predicted, the combination of extreme heat, low humidity, and dry vegetation creates a dangerous environment where fires can easily start and grow.

He is credited with steering Romania toward democracy and eventual integration with the West, including NATO and the EU. However, his legacy is deeply controversial, marred by accusations that he used violence to suppress dissent, most notably during the 1990 Mineriad, and failed to fully break from the country's corrupt, authoritarian past.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's recurring claim of a "Russia hoax," noting that its meaning has shifted over time while the core assertion remains unsupported by evidence. It recounts the undisputed findings from the U.S. intelligence community and the Mueller report, which concluded that Russia systematically interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump. The piece contrasts these facts with Trump's various claims, from allegations of illegal surveillance to a general "witch hunt." The analysis suggests the "hoax" narrative itself is a successful political strategy to cast doubt on damaging findings and rally supporters.</p>
