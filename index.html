          <p>A Consumer Reports investigation found that over two-thirds of popular protein powders, especially plant-based ones, contain lead levels exceeding its daily safety threshold, with some over ten times higher. While the dietary supplement industry disputes CR's methodology and reliance on California's strict Proposition 65, CR highlights the lack of federal limits on heavy metals in supplements. The article advises consumers to scrutinize labels, consider dairy-based options, and prioritize whole foods, while urging the FDA to establish enforceable lead limits.</p>

          <p>An education watchdog group, Defending Education, claims a University of Minnesota center is supplying K-12 teachers with ethnic studies lessons that promote left-wing ideologies, including defunding the police and Black Lives Matter. The report criticizes this as imposing a specific worldview rather than purely educational content, raising concerns as Minnesota law mandates ethnic studies by 2026-28.

A judge ruled that the case cannot proceed until Mangione appears in person, a right he has asserted. However, federal officials are currently preventing his transfer from New York, where he faces federal and state charges, meaning his Pennsylvania proceedings are stalled until his New York cases conclude.</p>

          <p>Doug Krugman, a former US Marine Corps colonel and combat veteran, resigned after 24 years of service, expressing profound concerns over President Trump's perceived disregard for the Constitution. His resignation followed controversial addresses by Trump to military leaders and was influenced by actions like the pardoning of January 6 insurrections and the administration's refusal of refuge to Afghan allies. Krugman warned of a potential "collapse" of the conventional government system, urging military personnel to question potentially immoral orders.</p>

          <p>Kapil Raghu, an Indian national, was unjustly detained by ICE for a month after police mistakenly identified his perfume bottle, labeled "Opium," as narcotics during a traffic stop. Despite charges being dropped once the substance was confirmed as perfume, an administrative error subsequently revoked his visa status, rendering him unable to work and facing potential deportation. Raghu is now actively seeking to have his immigration status restored following this severe legal and personal ordeal.</p>

          <p>China has accused the United States of intentionally creating "panic" regarding Beijing's recent controls on rare earth exports, while simultaneously indicating an openness to trade talks. This accusation comes amidst President Trump's threats of imposing 100% tariffs in retaliation for China's restrictions on these critical minerals. The US administration is actively working to establish a domestic supply chain independent of China, with discussions around potentially taking equity stakes in companies to counter market manipulation.

          <p>Japan experienced its hottest summer on record in 2025, with temperatures significantly exceeding historical averages, and unusual heat persisting into autumn. Experts attribute this alarming trend to global warming, elevated ocean surface temperatures, and prolonged high-pressure systems. This three-year streak of record highs threatens Japan's agricultural sector, increases heatstroke hospitalizations, and intensifies typhoons, with research suggesting that summers are lengthening so dramatically that spring and autumn could effectively disappear within 30 years.</p>
