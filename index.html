          <p>Pakistan has significantly increased its military spending by roughly 20% to 2.55 trillion Pakistani rupees ($9 billion) in response to recent clashes with India, despite facing severe economic challenges. This decision comes as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's government unveiled its annual federal budget for the 2025-26 fiscal year. The surge in military spending reflects the need to ensure sufficient resources following the conflict with India, with analysts suggesting the military is emboldened to push its agenda more rigorously. The increased budget may lead to cuts in other sectors, including welfare. (not investment advice)</p>
