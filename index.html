Despite the risks, the $TRUMP token's value has surged, benefiting insiders who control a significant portion of the supply. Trading activity has generated substantial fees for insiders, though they've agreed to delay cashing out for 90 days. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has restarted federal student loan collections after a five-year pause, coinciding with significant changes and disruptions to the lending system. Millions of borrowers face plan changes and potential spikes in monthly bills due to the blocking of the Biden administration's SAVE repayment plan. Borrowers also report long wait times for assistance due to staff terminations at the Education Department.

          <p>Attacks on Tesla owners have expanded into broader intimidation campaigns fueled by inaccurate personal data, with sites like "Dogequest" publishing information of individuals mistakenly identified as Tesla owners.

          <p>Cinco de Mayo celebrations are taking place across the U.S., featuring music, tacos, and displays of Mexican culture, though often lacking authenticity. The day commemorates the 1862 Mexican victory at the Battle of Puebla, but in the U.S., it has evolved into a celebration of Mexican American culture. Latino activists and scholars note a disconnect, with commercialization and stereotypes overshadowing the historical significance. Some celebrate to honor their Mexican ancestry, while others find irony in the widespread celebrations given political rhetoric targeting Mexican immigrants.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are divided over repealing Biden-era clean energy tax credits, which are vital for communities like Noatak, Alaska, where residents face high energy costs due to reliance on diesel fuel flown in by plane. The village had planned to expand its solar panel farm using these credits, but the project's future is now uncertain. Senator Lisa Murkowski is advocating for the credits, while fiscal conservatives seek to eliminate them to fund President Trump's agenda.
