          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers announced a $1 million donation to provide direct financial assistance to immigrant families affected by recent immigration enforcement operations in Southern California. The team plans to announce further support for organizations aiding immigrant communities, including the California Community Foundation and the L.A. County Federation of Labor, in response to the impact of these events on thousands of people in Los Angeles. This commitment follows an incident where ICE agents allegedly sought access to Dodger Stadium's parking lots but were denied entry by the organization, an allegation ICE has refuted. The donation aims to uplift the communities of Greater Los Angeles affected by immigration enforcement. The team's action reflects a response to recent immigration operations and protests throughout Southern California.</p>

During the visit, Vance referred to Senator Alex Padilla as "José Padilla," drawing criticism from Bass and Newsom, who noted Vance's prior service with Padilla in the Senate.

          <p>In the case of missing Colorado mother Suzanne Morphew, a prosecutor stated in court that investigators believe they know the location of her body, describing it as being in a "very difficult spot." Suzanne Morphew disappeared on Mother's Day 2020, and her remains were found in September 2023, leading to her death being declared a homicide. Her husband, Barry Morphew, was initially charged with her murder, but the charges were dropped just before trial, and he was arrested again in June 2025. Investigators have explored various leads, including a secret lover and unusual phone activity, but lacked direct evidence until the discovery of her remains.</p>

          <p>Recently unsealed court documents reveal that Vance Boelter, the suspect in the deadly shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, was described as a "prepper" by his wife. Boelter's wife told investigators that he had given her a "bailout plan" and directed her to go to her mother's home in Wisconsin, and that he also had a business partner in Washington involved in a security company and fishing outfit in Congo, Africa. The shootings resulted in the death of Democratic House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and seriously wounded Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. The Hoffmans' daughter triggered a warning that a "politically motivated act was potentially underway" when she called 911.</p>

          <p>A recent deadly border skirmish between Thailand and Cambodia has become a test for China's regional diplomacy, as Beijing seeks to maintain stability in a region crucial to its strategic interests. Analysts suggest China will likely monitor the situation closely while avoiding direct mediation, possibly working with ASEAN to prevent further confrontations. The clash, which resulted in the death of one Cambodian soldier, highlights deep-rooted border disputes in the Indochina peninsula, a key trade gateway for China. The incident underscores the challenges to Beijing's foreign policy of fostering closer regional ties amidst competition with the United States.</p>

The White House maintains that Judge Michael Farbiarz did not have jurisdiction to order Mr. Khalil's release.

          <p>President Trump hinted at potentially firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, criticizing him for maintaining steady interest rates and labeling him a "Total and Complete Moron." Trump has repeatedly attacked Powell for not lowering interest rates more aggressively, though it remains unclear if he has the legal authority to remove Powell before his term ends in 2026. The president argued that Powell's policies are detrimental to the economy and accused him of being a "Trump Hater." The Federal Reserve's interest rate-setting committee has kept its benchmark rate steady, balancing the need to control inflation with concerns about slowing economic growth.

Israel's ambassador to the UN accused Iran of having a "genocidal agenda" and posing an ongoing threat, adding that Israel would continue targeting nuclear facilities until they were "dismantled."

Companies like Accenture and British American Tobacco expect staff to dress comfortably and professionally, while Santander specifies that beachwear is inappropriate. Tailored, formal shorts are generally preferred, and the perception of shorts may differ between men and women.</p>

          <p>A federal appellate court ruled that a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in public school classrooms is unconstitutional, marking a victory for civil liberties groups. The court found that the mandate violates the separation of church and state and would isolate students who are not Christian. The ruling supports an order by a U.S. District Judge, who declared the mandate unconstitutional. While the Louisiana Attorney General intends to appeal, the case highlights the ongoing debate over religion in public schools.</p>
