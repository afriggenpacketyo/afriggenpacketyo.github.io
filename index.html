        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite efforts to reduce reliance on Russian gas and oil, the EU has increased fertilizer imports from Russia since the invasion of Ukraine, now accounting for about 30% of EU fertilizer imports. The European Parliament endorsed a proposal to introduce tariffs on fertilizers imported from Russia and Belarus, gradually increasing to 50% by 2028. This move aims to wean the EU off Russian fertilizer, potentially sourcing it from China, Oman, Morocco, Canada, or the US, or increasing the use of organic fertilizer. While fertilizer producers support the tariffs, farmers are concerned about the lack of affordable alternatives to Russian fertilizer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stopping payments to a debt relief company can lead to cancellation of the account, resumption of collection efforts by creditors, and loss of progress on debt settlements. It can also negatively affect credit scores due to prolonged delinquencies and potential charge-offs. If struggling to keep up with payments, it's advised to contact the debt relief company immediately to explore options such as adjusting the payment schedule or reworking the plan. Alternatives like credit counseling or bankruptcy should be considered if payments are no longer realistic. (not investment advice)</p>

They view this action as a divisive tactic meant to fuel culture wars.

The USNS Harvey Milk was initially named in 2016 during the Obama administration, and the leaked memo suggests that other vessels named after civil rights icons may also be renamed.</p>

          <p>Following a phone call with Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump warned that Putin will likely seek revenge for the recent Ukraine drone attack on Russian airfields. Russia's RIA Novosti reported that Putin told Trump that Ukraine has tried to disrupt negotiations and has essentially become a terrorist organization. The conversation marks the first between the two leaders since Ukraine's surprise attack on Russian airbases.

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized President Donald Trump's tax-cut bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination" and urging lawmakers to "KILL the BILL." Musk argues that the bill will condemn America to "debt slavery" and increase the debt ceiling by 5 trillion dollars. His opposition comes after his departure from the Trump administration, where he led the government-shrinking group DOGE. Musk's criticism is partly due to the bill's cuts to an EV tax credit that benefits Tesla. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court in National Association of Immigration Judges v. Owen has proposed a novel solution to President Trump's efforts to neutralize federal civil service protections. With the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) lacking a quorum due to Trump's firings, the court suggests that federal courts should step in to hear cases brought by illegally fired civil servants. This proposal aims to close a legal loophole that has left federal civil servants unprotected by laws still in effect. The decision draws on the legal theory of "severability," arguing that Congress would not have given the MSPB exclusive authority over civil service disputes if it had known the Supreme Court would strip the MSPB of its independence.</p>
