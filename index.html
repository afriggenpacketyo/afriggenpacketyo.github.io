        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Craig Moffett, a top-ranked analyst, casts doubt on Apple's plan to move iPhone assembly to India, citing unresolved tariff issues. He argues that since iPhone components will still be primarily made in China, the move won't significantly reduce costs related to U.S. tariffs. Moffett also suggests Apple may face resistance in diversifying its supply chain to India, adding that backlash in China over U.S. tariffs could negatively impact iPhone sales. Moffett has a 'sell' rating on Apple and recently lowered his price target for the stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Critics argue that Donald Trump's actions, including his approach to Ukraine and his relationships with allies, are benefiting Vladimir Putin's agenda. Trump's vision for peace in Ukraine seemingly favors Russia, allowing it to retain control of occupied territories and preventing Ukraine from joining NATO. Furthermore, Trump's strained relationships with traditional U.S. allies and his changes to the U.S. government structure are seen as advantageous to Moscow's interests. These actions, whether intentional or not, serve to advance Russia's geopolitical goals.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the phrase "You're okay" is the most dangerous in parenting because it invalidates children's emotions and hinders their emotional development. Saying "You're okay" teaches children to doubt their feelings, short-circuits emotional processing, and can rewire a child's stress response. Instead, parents should validate their children's emotions and provide support to help them process their feelings.</p>
