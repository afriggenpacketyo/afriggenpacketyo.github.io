          <p>Amanda and Nick Thomas are searching for other families affected by the rare PPFIBP1 gene mutation, which their 11-month-old son Jack has been diagnosed with. Jack's condition causes blindness, seizures, and developmental delays, and is considered life-limiting. The couple hopes to connect with other parents to gain insight and offer support, as only 16 cases are known worldwide. The family is also crowdfunding to renovate their home to better accommodate Jack's needs, while coping with Nick's recovery from a stroke and heart surgery, and are trying to make the most of their time with Jack, acknowledging that his life expectancy is uncertain. The family is trying to find answers to their questions, as they had nobody to turn to in the beginning, and they want to provide future support for other families who have children with the same condition.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, deported in error during the Trump administration, has returned to the U.S. to face smuggling charges. The U.S. Supreme Court ordered Trump to facilitate his return after acknowledging an "administrative error" led to his deportation. Abrego Garcia's lawyer calls the charges "fantastical," claiming they are based on statements from individuals facing prosecution or in federal prison. The indictment alleges Abrego Garcia was involved in smuggling undocumented migrants into the U.S. If convicted, Abrego Garcia will be deported to El Salvador after completing his sentence in the U.S.</p>

          <p>South Korea's newly elected progressive president, Lee Jae-myung, is expected to adopt a more "prudent" stance on Taiwan and prioritize strengthening economic ties with Beijing. This shift follows the impeachment of his predecessor, Yoon Suk-yeol, and signals a potential recalibration in Seoul's foreign policy. While Lee is considered more friendly towards China and North Korea compared to Yoon, continuity is expected in trilateral military cooperation with the U.S. and Japan. Under Yoon, Seoul emphasized its commitment to the U.S. alliance and stronger three-way cooperation with Washington and Tokyo.</p>

Following discussions with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Japan's top negotiator Ryosei Akazawa expressed that progress was made, but significant differences persist. Akazawa reiterated Japan's stance that the Trump administration's additional tariffs should be removed promptly due to their adverse impact on the Japanese economy. The leaders of both countries plan to meet around the time of the Group of Seven summit in Canada later this month.</p>

          <p>Thailand and Cambodia are increasing their military presence along their disputed border following a recent deadly clash, raising tensions between the two Southeast Asian nations.

The Thai army also accused Cambodian soldiers and civilians of repeated incursions into Thai territory. Despite mediation efforts from Malaysia and China, both countries remain at odds over undemarcated points along their shared border, which has been a source of contention for over a century.</p>

          <p>MI5 provided false information to its watchdog, the Investigatory Powers Commissioner's Office (IPCO), regarding the handling of a violent neo-Nazi agent. This led IPCO to rewrite a report on the case, omitting findings that contradicted MI5's false evidence given in court. MI5 Director General Sir Ken McCallum apologized to IPCO after the BBC challenged the Security Service's false statements. The agent, known as X, used his Security Service role to coerce and terrorize his then-girlfriend, Beth.

The discovery was made through DNA testing and genealogical research, revealing a mix-up with another baby at the same hospital in east London. This case is one of several instances of babies being accidentally switched in maternity wards from the late 1940s to the 1960s, a period before the widespread use of wristbands for identification. Lawyers anticipate more cases will emerge due to the increasing availability of affordable genetic testing.</p>
