          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 07:06:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eight key OPEC+ member nations, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, have agreed to increase their collective oil output by 548,000 barrels per day in August. This move, which is larger than the anticipated 411,000 barrels, is a response to a steady global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals, including low oil inventories. The decision accelerates the unwinding of voluntary production cuts that were previously implemented to stabilize the market. This production hike aims to balance supply with rising summer demand and mitigate recent price volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the claim that drinking soda, particularly Coke, can cure migraines, a condition affecting 39 million Americans. Doctors indicate that the caffeine in these beverages can act as a nerve disruptor and constrict blood vessels, which may provide temporary relief for some individuals, similar to how caffeine is an ingredient in some painkillers. However, they caution that caffeine can also be a migraine trigger and that relying on sugary sodas is not a cure and can worsen underlying issues over time. Experts suggest healthier alternatives like water with electrolytes, magnesium, or organic coffee for managing headaches.</p>

          <p>Reverend William Barber is leading a revived Poor People's Campaign, a national "moral movement" using nonviolent protest to challenge poverty and systemic injustice under the current political landscape. Drawing on religious tradition, Barber frames policy decisions that harm the poor, such as cuts to healthcare and food aid, as "policy murder." His fusion movement brings together diverse groups to create a moral force aimed at reshaping the nation by confronting not just a single administration, but the deeper political theology that weds nationalism to capitalism. The article questions whether this approach can effectively counter the current assault on democracy and rights.</p>

          <p>FICO has announced it will begin incorporating buy now, pay later (BNPL) loan data into its credit scoring models, a change that could impact millions of consumers. For users who make timely payments, this could help build a positive credit history, especially for younger individuals or those with limited credit. However, it also means that late payments or accumulating too much BNPL debt could negatively affect credit scores, a fair consequence according to experts. While the new scoring model will be available in fall 2025, widespread adoption by lenders is expected to be gradual. (not investment advice)</p>

Key figures like Pete Quinones openly advocate for antisemitic actions and use racial slurs. Experts warn that the OGC represents a new breed of extremist organization focused on building offline social networks to eventually take over society, posing a potential national security threat.</p>

          <p>Michigan's tart cherry industry, which produces 75% of the U.S. crop, is facing an existential crisis due to a combination of factors. Climate change is causing volatile weather, such as a late-April cold snap that is expected to reduce this year's harvest by 70%. Additionally, farmers are struggling with rising land prices due to development, labor shortages for harvesting and processing, and the economic impact of tariffs. These challenges threaten the viability of multigenerational family farms and the broader agrotourism industry built around the state's signature crop.</p>

          <p>A new study by researchers from several prominent Chinese institutions suggests that sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, could help fight cancer. The research, published in the journal Nature, found that the drug may work by strengthening dendritic cells, which are crucial anti-tumor immune cells that often become depleted as cancer progresses. By potentially reversing this process and restoring these "intelligence agents" of the immune system, sildenafil could represent a new form of tumor immunotherapy. The discovery is being hailed as a significant breakthrough with the potential to save lives.</p>

The article critiques the defense's strategy of portraying Combs as a victim of gold-digging accusers while playing to his online fanbase.

          <p>This analysis argues that the U.S. often overestimates the strategic effectiveness of its overwhelming air power, a tendency exemplified by the recent single-night strike on Iran's nuclear sites. The author contends that this approach, which prioritizes a quick show of force over methodical, sustained campaigns, often fails to achieve long-term goals and can undermine allies, as seen with Israel's more extensive operation. The article suggests that the U.S. has a history of tactical successes but strategic failures, and could learn from smaller, more inventive militaries like Ukraine's, which have a more urgent understanding of how to win wars.</p>

          <p>Vicky Pebsworth, a registered nurse recently appointed to the CDC's influential vaccine advisory committee (ACIP), has a decades-long history of anti-vaccine activism. She has publicly argued that vaccines caused her son's autism, a claim refuted by extensive scientific research. Pebsworth has been the volunteer research director for the National Vaccine Information Center, a prominent anti-vaccine organization, and was hand-picked for the role by the new health secretary. Her appointment is part of a broader overhaul of the committee, which has been stacked with ideological allies, raising concerns among medical and scientific experts.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece from a Tehran-based researcher describes how the recent 12-day Israeli bombing campaign has shifted public opinion within Iran. While many Iranians initially held divergent views, the scale of civilian casualties and the West's supportive response to the attacks fostered a unifying sense of patriotism and mistrust. The author argues that the West's perceived double standards, condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine while justifying attacks on Iran, have damaged its moral standing. This has led to a situation where even ordinary Iranians are now considering the idea of a nuclear deterrent as the only reliable defense.</p>

          <p>Democratic leaders believe the recently passed Republican tax-and-spending bill provides them with a powerful message for the 2026 midterm elections. They are focusing their criticism on the nearly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, which they frame as a "cruel" assault on American healthcare that will affect millions of lower-income and elderly citizens. Polling shows that Medicaid is a highly popular program, and Democrats hope to leverage public opposition to the cuts to regain control of the House.

Despite price volatility, institutions are drawn to Ethereum's stability, security, and decade-long track record of uninterrupted operation. This shift suggests Ethereum is solidifying its role as the trusted settlement layer for the future of tokenized finance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's plan to host a UFC fight at the White House is more than a spectacle; it's a form of authoritarian theater. The author, a former MMA commentator, draws parallels between Trump's use of the UFC and Vladimir Putin's leveraging of the sport to project a strongman image. The partnership between Trump and the UFC, the article contends, blends entertainment with confrontational politics, celebrating a brand of nationalistic masculinity and violence. This move is presented as a natural climax for a presidency that has consistently used sports to advance a political cult of personality.</p>

          <p>China has achieved a new milestone in renewable energy with the launch of a large-scale floating solar power station in the coastal waters of Qingdao. The project, developed by state-owned Sinopec, is part of a broader initiative that will become the largest of its kind. Together, the offshore facilities are expected to generate 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, significantly reducing carbon emissions. By placing the solar panels on the ocean's surface, their efficiency is boosted by up to 8% due to the cooling effect of the water, marking a significant breakthrough for the industry.</p>

The author describes the event as a bizarre, yet honest, reflection of American culture, where elite athletes apply extreme dedication to competitive consumption. The article views the contest as a form of punkish satire, holding up a mirror to a society defined by excess and a dysfunctional relationship with food.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the long-standing debate over whether people from different cultures perceive the world differently, using optical illusions as a case study. One recent study suggests people from "carpentered" Western environments see angular shapes where those from rural Namibia see circles. However, another study convincingly debunks this hypothesis for the well-known Müller-Lyer illusion. The author, a perception researcher, concludes that while perceptual diversity is real, it exists within cultures as much as between them, and our experience is always an active brain construction, not a direct window onto reality.</p>

WISE operates on a cost-neutral model for councils, retaining a percentage of the fines it issues. Critics argue the company's financial incentive leads to heavy-handed enforcement and that its penalty notices use intimidating language to coerce payment for minor infractions.</p>

          <p>A 90-day pause on a sweeping set of steep tariffs proposed by the Trump administration is set to expire, creating another cliff-edge moment for the U.S. economy. While the administration claimed it would secure 90 trade deals in 90 days, only a handful of narrow agreements have materialized, leaving businesses facing uncertainty and the prospect of massive new costs. Economists and business leaders warn that even existing tariff levels are contributing to inflation, with costs being passed on to consumers. The administration's strategy is viewed by some as a retailer marking up prices only to announce a sale later. (not investment advice)</p>
