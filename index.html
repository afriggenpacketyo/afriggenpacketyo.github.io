          <p>The Trump administration has warned its global trading partners to finalize new trade agreements by August 1 or face the reinstatement of higher tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that letters are being sent to notify countries that duties will revert to higher April levels if no deal is reached. This "maximum pressure" strategy is intended to accelerate negotiations, with the European Union being a key focus of ongoing talks. While the administration claims progress and expects several deals to be announced soon, the EU has indicated it is prepared to retaliate with its own tariffs on U.S. goods.

          <p>The death of Daniel Park, who was accused of conspiring to bomb a California fertility clinic, is being investigated as a suicide, prompting scrutiny of the Los Angeles Metropolitan Detention Center where he was held. Park was charged with providing material support to his alleged co-conspirator, who died in the May 17 explosion that injured four people. His death in custody closes the only federal prosecution in the case and adds to the mystery surrounding the attack. Attorneys have raised concerns about conditions at the L.A. detention facility, citing reports of unmet medical needs and a recent Inspector General's report on shortcomings in emergency responses.</p>

          <p>In the wake of deadly flash floods in Texas, a disagreement has emerged between state officials and the National Weather Service over the accuracy of storm predictions. While some local officials claimed they were surprised by the flood's unprecedented intensity, the NWS maintains it issued appropriate flood watches and warnings, including a rare "flash flood emergency" alert. This debate highlights the inherent difficulties in forecasting the precise location and severity of extreme precipitation events. The article also notes that staffing shortages and potential budget cuts at the NWS could impact future forecasting capabilities.</p>

Simon explains that the STA has been a foundational element of bilateral relations, providing a politically safe avenue for building trust and fostering immense scientific collaboration. However, in the current geopolitical climate, the agreement is now viewed through a lens of national security, economic competition, and techno-nationalism. The future of the STA is considered a bellwether for the broader US-China relationship, balancing the benefits of open collaboration against risks like espionage and intellectual property theft.</p>

          <p>Before his presidency, Donald Trump ventured into the gourmet food business with "Trump Steaks," a brand that ultimately failed after just two months on the market in 2007. Despite being certified USDA Prime and supplied by a reputable source, the company struggled due to several factors. The steaks were sold exclusively through the Sharper Image catalog and QVC, limiting accessibility and failing to attract the retailer's typical customer base. Ultimately, poor consumer reviews citing a bland taste, grainy texture, and excessively high prices for a frozen product led to its swift demise.</p>

          <p>The July 6 broadcast of "Face the Nation" covered several major news stories, including the devastating flash floods in Texas that have claimed dozens of lives. The program featured an interview with White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, who defended the administration's trade policies and the economic projections for President Trump's new tax and spending bill. Democratic Congressman Tom Suozzi offered a rebuttal, criticizing the bill for increasing the deficit and potentially causing millions to lose healthcare.

          <p>A vessel in the Red Sea was attacked on Sunday, marking the first such incident in months and raising alarms about renewed threats to maritime security in the region. The UK's maritime security agency reported that a ship was fired upon by multiple small vessels near the Houthi-controlled port of Hodeidah, Yemen. This follows a period of calm after US airstrikes targeted the Iranian-backed Houthis, who had previously conducted dozens of attacks on commercial shipping. The new attack, along with recent statements from the Houthi leadership reaffirming their hostility towards the US and Israel, suggests a potential resurgence of disruptions to this vital shipping lane.</p>

          <p>A Domino's Pizza restaurant in Herriman, Utah, was destroyed in a massive explosion after an SUV crashed into the building and ruptured a gas line. The dramatic incident was captured on video, showing the building erupting in flames and debris. Just minutes before the explosion, two bystanders courageously rescued the driver and a passenger from the crashed vehicle. No one was inside the Domino's or adjacent businesses at the time of the crash, and no injuries were reported from the blast itself. The commercial building, which also housed a Jimmy John's and a Supercuts, sustained significant damage.</p>

          <p>Buried within President Trump's recently signed "megabill" is a provision described as a significant victory for the anti-abortion movement since the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The new law will bar Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid reimbursements for any health services it provides, not limited to abortions. Health policy experts warn this will have a devastating impact on reproductive and general healthcare for vulnerable communities, as Planned Parenthood is often the only accessible provider. Activists argue this represents a creative new front in the effort to restrict access to reproductive care nationwide.</p>

          <p>An FBI report reveals that homeowners in New Hampshire have lost over $4 million to quit claim deed fraud between 2019 and 2023. In this scam, criminals known as 'title pirates' forge documents to illegally transfer property ownership, often targeting vacant lands, vacation homes, or properties owned by the elderly. The fraudsters then sell the property or take out a mortgage on it without the real owner's knowledge. To protect against this growing crime, authorities recommend homeowners obtain specific title insurance, register for county alerts on filings in their name, and regularly monitor their properties, especially if they are unoccupied.</p>

          <p>Following a public falling out with President Trump over a massive tax and spending bill, Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party called the "America Party." The tech billionaire, who briefly served in the Trump administration, criticized the new law for "bankrupting our country" and stated the new party aims to offer an alternative to the two-party system. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent responded by suggesting Musk should focus on his businesses rather than politics, alluding to investor concerns. The move marks a significant escalation in the feud between the two prominent figures.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has completed the signing of Spanish international Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad in a deal worth £60 million. The 26-year-old defensive midfielder is expected to be a key addition to the Gunners' lineup, likely joining Declan Rice and Martin Odegaard in a formidable midfield trio. Zubimendi, who has been praised for his tactical intelligence and ability to read the game, rejected a move to Liverpool last summer. His arrival is anticipated to fill the role previously held by Thomas Partey and strengthen Arsenal's squad as they challenge for domestic and European titles.</p>

Notably, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin were absent from the summit in person. Putin, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court, appeared via video to declare that the model of liberal globalization is becoming obsolete as economic activity shifts toward emerging markets.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Flint, Michigan, serves as a cautionary tale for the Trump administration's approach to revitalizing the Rust Belt. While policies like tariffs aim to restore manufacturing, the administration's simultaneous deregulation and cuts to environmental and public health programs are actively harming communities like Flint. The author, a public health researcher from the city, contends that economic growth cannot succeed without addressing the deep-seated social and environmental damage from past industrial decline, exemplified by the water crisis. True revitalization requires investment in public health infrastructure, not just corporate incentives.</p>
