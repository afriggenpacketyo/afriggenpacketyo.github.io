The protest, held in Parliament Square, saw activists displaying placards in support of the group, which is now a criminal offense. The Metropolitan Police had warned that any show of support would lead to arrests, following through on their statement. This action comes after the group was banned for acts of "violence, significant injuries and extensive criminal damage."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American shopping malls are undergoing a significant transformation to survive, replacing vacant anchor stores with non-traditional tenants like churches, entertainment venues, and community hubs. The Dayton Mall in Ohio, for instance, sold a former Sears space to a church, which has drawn thousands of new visitors and revitalized the complex. This trend, driven by the decline of traditional retail, focuses on creating experiential and community-oriented spaces, leading to a surprising rebound in mall traffic. Experts note this "cross-shopping" model, incorporating diverse businesses, is key to the modern mall's success.</p>

          <p>A Jewish student from Columbia University has voiced apprehension regarding the potential election of Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani as New York City's mayor. The student expressed to Fox News that a Mamdani victory would be "scary" for the city's Jewish student population, citing concerns about the candidate's approach to condemning hate. The article also touches upon a broader trend of young Jewish voters potentially shifting their political alignment in response to the changing dynamics within the Democratic Party. It highlights the intersection of campus sentiment and municipal politics.</p>

Trump announced plans to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, suggesting that ending the war would involve "some swapping of territories." This development has raised concerns in Kyiv that Ukraine might be excluded from critical negotiations about its own future, prompting Zelenskyy to engage with European leaders to ensure his country's interests are represented.</p>

          <p>Roland Mehrez Beainy, the owner of the "Trump Burger" restaurant chain in Texas, has been detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and is facing deportation. The 28-year-old Lebanese national allegedly overstayed his non-immigrant visitor visa, which expired in February 2024. ICE stated that all individuals who enter the country illegally or overstay their admission are held accountable, regardless of their political beliefs. Beainy, whose restaurant is known for its pro-Trump theme, denies most of the allegations against him and has a court hearing scheduled.</p>

          <p>A preseason NFL game between the Detroit Lions and Atlanta Falcons was suspended after Lions safety Morice Norris sustained a serious injury. Norris was taken off the field in an ambulance following a tackle in the fourth quarter, prompting both teams and coaches to agree to end the game early. The Lions later reported that Norris was in stable condition with feeling and movement in all his extremities and would remain in an Atlanta hospital for observation. This incident highlights the inherent risks of the sport and recalls similar game suspensions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing significant backlash for its proposal to expand oil and gas drilling across the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, the largest single tract of public land in the United States. The plan would roll back existing protections and open up to 82% of the 23-million-acre reserve to industrial development. Environmental groups, Alaska Native communities, and the public have voiced strong opposition, citing threats to fragile ecosystems, wildlife, and the subsistence rights of Indigenous peoples.

The AVM, likely the true cause of his long-term headaches, was successfully removed via surgery.

This "sustainable intensification" approach is more land-efficient but raises profound ethical questions about animal suffering.

          <p>Stargazers hoping to catch the peak of the annual Perseids meteor shower next week may be disappointed, as a full moon is expected to diminish its visibility. While the shower, known for its bright fireballs, is active from mid-July to late August, the brightest display on August 12-13 will be washed out by moonlight. NASA advises that some meteors might still be visible in the predawn hours, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. The Perseids originate from debris left by the Swift-Tuttle comet and are popular due to their occurrence during summer.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece discusses an incident in Los Angeles where residents, frustrated by government inaction, painted their own crosswalks in the Sawtelle neighborhood to improve pedestrian safety. The city's Department of Transportation quickly removed the DIY crosswalks, citing official processes and liability concerns, which the author argues is symptomatic of the city's broader inefficiency. Following public outcry, the city reversed course and officially repainted the crosswalks. The author uses this event to call for streamlined city processes and greater government responsiveness.</p>

          <p>A Tesla Model 3 owner shared images on Reddit of their vehicle's tire being slashed in broad daylight by an individual who was captured in a photo. The incident is presented as part of a larger, troubling trend of vandalism targeting electric vehicles and their charging infrastructure, which is sometimes attributed to political animosity and misinformation about EVs. Such acts of vandalism not only impose financial and emotional costs on owners but may also deter potential buyers from transitioning to cleaner transportation, slowing progress in reducing air pollution.</p>

          <p>India is undertaking a major upgrade of the Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie (DSDBO) Road, its primary land access to the strategically sensitive Galwan Valley region bordering China. The improvements are designed to accommodate heavy military equipment, including tanks and missile launchers, significantly enhancing India's troop and materiel mobility in the contested area. An alternative route is also nearing completion to reduce reliance on the single road. This infrastructure development is viewed by analysts as a key move to bolster India's defensive posture, prompting calls from Chinese observers for close monitoring.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the administration of former President Joe Biden shares responsibility for the unfolding famine in Gaza by failing to act on early warnings and use U.S. leverage to prevent it. The author contends that despite repeated alarms from the UN and aid groups about Israel's use of starvation as a weapon of war, the Biden administration continued to provide unconditional military support. The article asserts that Biden missed multiple opportunities to enforce U.S. laws that restrict arms to countries obstructing aid, thereby enabling the crisis.</p>

          <p>Yarmouk, a sprawling Palestinian refugee camp on the outskirts of Damascus, remains in ruins years after being a major battleground in Syria's civil war. Once the de facto capital of the Palestinian diaspora with over 160,000 Palestinian residents, the camp is now largely a wasteland of rubble and damaged buildings. A small number of former residents have slowly returned, but face immense challenges, including a lack of basic services like water and electricity. The destruction has not only shattered the physical community but also weakened its status as a symbol of Palestinian identity.</p>

The piece argues that the true danger of gerrymandering is the elimination of politically moderate districts.

          <p>As catastrophic hunger grips regions like Gaza and Sudan, health experts are warning of a dangerous complication known as "refeeding syndrome." This potentially fatal condition can occur when severely malnourished individuals resume eating too quickly, causing a sudden, overwhelming shift in electrolytes that can lead to organ failure. Proper treatment requires a slow, carefully managed reintroduction of nutrients, often using specially formulated therapeutic foods. Aid workers stress that preventing this requires not just food, but safe access for medical personnel to administer aid correctly.</p>
