          <p>Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that Tehran reserves all options to defend its sovereignty after the "outrageous" U.S. attacks on three major nuclear enrichment facilities. According to Iran state-owned media Fars, Iran also launched its 20th wave of missile and drone strikes against Israeli military targets, and the Israel Defense Forces reported sirens blaring due to further Iranian offensives. President Trump addressed the nation on Saturday evening, calling strikes on three of Iran's nuclear sites a "spectacular military success" that "completely obliterated" the country's key enrichment facilities. The International Atomic Energy Agency and Iran's nuclear safety center reported no radiation or contamination at the nuclear centers following the attacks. </p>

          <p>The second China-Central Asia Summit in Astana, Kazakhstan, highlighted Beijing's efforts to strengthen economic and political ties with countries in the region, resulting in agreements worth nearly US$25 billion. China National Nuclear Corporation will lead a project to build another nuclear power plant in Kazakhstan, further cementing Beijing's influence. The European Union is also seeking to expand its ties with Central Asia, eyeing the region's raw materials, while Russia maintains strong security ties with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan through the Collective Security Treaty Organisation.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the United States struck three nuclear sites in Iran, utilizing B-2 bombers to drop Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs and Tomahawk cruise missiles. A U.S. official confirmed that the U.S. used three B2 bombers carrying two bunker-busting bombs each to attack Fordo. Following the strikes, Trump addressed the nation, calling it a "spectacular military success".

          <p>Following U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised President Donald Trump for a bold decision that will change history, which comes after years of Netanyahu lobbying for military action against Iran's nuclear program. While Israel has maintained it could handle the Iranian threat alone, only America possessed the ordnance to penetrate Iran's heavily protected nuclear facilities. Iran claims to have moved its nuclear material prior to the bombing. The future trajectory of the war hinges on Iran's response, with potential options ranging from diplomacy to retaliation against the U.S. or its allies.</p>

          <p>Chinese studies suggest that transplanting cells into the spleen could be a promising method for treating diabetes. Researchers at Nanjing University found that "shielding" islet cells improves their survival after transplantation into the spleen, and that the spleen can be engineered into a transplant hub using nanoparticles. Type 1 diabetes is a genetic autoimmune disorder where the body attacks islet cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. While medication can manage symptoms, there is currently no cure, but this research could transform the spleen into a hub for treating diabetes.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have created a two-kilowatt fiber laser that can operate without heating or cooling systems in extreme climates, ranging from minus 50 degrees Celsius in the Arctic to 50 degrees Celsius in the Sahara Desert. The laser is designed for quick and ultra-portable deployment for defense and industrial applications. The innovation stabilizes laser performance across wide temperature swings through design choices, including 940-nanometer pump lasers with minimal thermal drift and a dual-clad optical resonator. This breakthrough overcomes challenges in maintaining laser stability across diverse environments.</p>
