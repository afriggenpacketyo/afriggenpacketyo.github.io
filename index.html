          <p>The 2025 Salzburg Festival will feature a program centered on themes of power, conflict, and hope, reflecting current global crises. Artistic director Markus Hinterhäuser has curated 174 performances, including operas like Handel's "Giulio Cesare in Egitto" and Verdi's "Macbeth," which explore the downfall of rulers. The festival aims to provide a space for reflection and transformation, continuing its tradition of offering a diverse program for a broad audience. It will also feature numerous Russian artists who have distanced themselves from the Putin regime and a reading by a Ukrainian author.</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess, gaining crucial access to extensive offshore oil reserves in Guyana. The deal was finalized after an International Chamber of Commerce arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal on Hess's assets in the region. Chevron's CEO expressed satisfaction with the outcome, which affirms standard industry practices in corporate mergers. The integration of the two companies is expected to result in some workforce reductions as part of ongoing efficiency efforts.</p>

          <h2>Salvadoran Day Cultural Festival in Southern California Canceled Amid Immigration Raids, Religious Events to Proceed</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 10:11:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Organizers of the annual Salvadoran Day celebration in Southern California have canceled the cultural festival due to recent immigration raids, citing risks for the large number of attendees. However, they will proceed with the traditional liturgical events honoring the Divine Savior of the World, the patron saint of El Salvador. The decision aims to protect the community while still providing a space for prayer and solidarity, with services scheduled for July 19 and August 3. The religious ceremonies allow those with regular immigration status to attend in person, while others are encouraged to join online.</p>

Investigators are also examining the camp director's delay in issuing an evacuation order and the camp's repeated, successful applications to be exempted from flood-risk maps.

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions, rail transport companies from the United States and China are committed to strengthening their cooperation. At a recent industry roundtable in Beijing, representatives from both nations discussed opportunities for collaboration, including on projects in third-country markets. A US embassy official highlighted the potential for synergy, given America's leadership in freight rail and China's expertise in high-speed rail. Chinese state-owned firms noted their extensive use of American equipment from companies like Caterpillar and Cummins, expressing a desire to explore joint investment and operations globally.</p>

          <p>A protest in Epping, UK, outside a hotel housing asylum seekers turned violent, resulting in assaults on police officers and damage to their vehicles. Essex Police reported that what began as a peaceful demonstration devolved into disorder, with fireworks and eggs thrown at officers and the hotel. The disturbance led to a road closure for public safety. Police have arrested two men and are reviewing footage to identify other individuals responsible for the violence, vowing that those involved will "feel the full force of the law."</p>

          <p>More than 140 people aboard the Royal Caribbean ship Navigator of the Seas fell ill with an unidentified gastrointestinal illness during a week-long cruise from Los Angeles. The outbreak was reported to the CDC after the ship returned from a trip to Mexico. The 134 affected passengers and seven crew members experienced symptoms including diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps. In response, the ship's crew implemented enhanced cleaning protocols and isolated those who were sick, while the CDC remotely monitored the situation and will conduct further investigation to determine the cause.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House passed a bill to rescind $9 billion in federal funding, primarily targeting foreign assistance programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The vote was nearly along party lines, with the legislation now heading to the president to be signed into law. The package was altered by the Senate to protect funding for a global AIDS program and some food assistance. Proponents argued the cuts eliminate wasteful spending, while opponents, including the House minority leader, contended they undermine U.S. soft power and threaten vital services for rural Americans.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted an injunction, permitting the Trump administration's layoffs of approximately 1,400 Department of Education employees to continue. The layoffs are part of a broader plan to reduce the agency's size. A lower court had previously blocked the staff reduction, arguing it would hinder the department's ability to perform its duties, such as administering student aid. Education advocates and student aid administrators have expressed concern that the downsizing could lead to significant delays and support issues for students and borrowers, especially amid changes to repayment plans.</p>

The consulate also criticized extra security measures that forced visa applicants to wait outside in the sun for long periods.

          <p>The article explores the profound ethical questions facing AI engineers who are being offered enormous compensation packages by tech giants like Meta. While the work offers immense wealth and the potential for social good, it also carries significant risks, including the creation of socially detrimental AI companions and systems that could deceive or harm humans. Experts warn that as AI becomes more powerful, it could be used for malicious purposes or become uncontrollable. The author argues that working at a frontier AI lab is unethical unless one has a defensible plan to mitigate these dangers, as the financial incentives can easily overshadow safety concerns.</p>

          <p>Deadly sectarian violence has erupted in the southern Syrian city of Suweida, with residents describing horrific scenes of a "bloodbath." Tensions between local Druze and Bedouin tribes escalated into widespread fighting, prompting the deployment of government forces. However, residents and human rights observers report that these forces, along with affiliated foreign fighters, have been accused of committing atrocities against civilians, including summary executions. The UN has documented killings by government-affiliated armed men, while residents feel abandoned and trapped as the conflict rages around them.</p>

A super-injunction was used to prevent reporting on the leak to avoid endangering those on the list. Shapps argued the secrecy was justified to prevent individuals from being targeted and killed by the Taliban.</p>

The doctor's note confirmed there was no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis and stated that the president remains in excellent health.</p>

Mbeumo is noted for his versatility, goal-scoring ability, and strong work rate both in and out of possession. The transfer would be Brentford's largest-ever sale, and analysts see him as a reliable, experienced player who fits the system of new manager Ruben Amorim.</p>

          <p>The article reflects on the racist and Islamophobic attacks faced by New York politician Zohran Mamdani, arguing they expose the deep institutional roots of this prejudice in America. The author draws on personal experiences with profiling and bigotry to contextualize the smears against Mamdani, which included darkening his beard in an ad and clumsy attempts to link him to antisemitism. The piece posits that while personal prejudice exists everywhere, institutional power amplifies it into structural racism. Mamdani's visibility and success, the author suggests, challenge these racist heuristics by providing new, positive information about Muslim men in America.</p>

          <p>Worshippers at a Cincinnati, Ohio, mosque are in shock following the detention of their imam, Ayman Soliman, by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Soliman, who was granted asylum in 2018, was detained during a routine check-in after being notified that his status was terminated. His lawyers state the termination is based on an alleged, and disputed, material support connection to the Muslim Brotherhood via a well-known Egyptian charity. The community fears he is being targeted, possibly in retaliation for a past lawsuit, and that his life would be at risk if he were deported to Egypt.</p>
