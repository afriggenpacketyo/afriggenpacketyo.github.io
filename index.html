          <p>The White House has announced a 90-day delay on a significant tariff hike for Chinese goods, extending a temporary truce in the ongoing trade war. This executive order maintains the current 30% tariff rate, preventing a potential jump to 80% that was scheduled to take effect. The extension provides more time for U.S. and Chinese negotiators to work towards a long-term trade agreement, a move seen by officials as a positive step to avoid major disruptions to global trade. Economists remain divided on the overall impact of the tariff strategy on the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A series of explosions at the U.S. Steel Clairton plant south of Pittsburgh has resulted in at least one fatality and ten injuries, with one employee still missing. The incident occurred Monday morning in the "reversing room" of the coke manufacturing facility, leading to a large-scale emergency response from 14 local fire departments. Officials have stabilized the plant, and a search and rescue operation for the unaccounted-for worker is active. The community and local lawmakers have expressed profound sadness and support for the affected families and workers at the nation's largest coke production plant.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing a period of intense heat, with temperatures expected to reach up to 34°C (93°F) in parts of England, prompting amber heat health alerts. This peak in hot weather coincides with a warning from the national drought group about "nationally significant" water shortfalls affecting agriculture, wildlife, and increasing wildfire risk. The heatwave, driven by warm air from continental Europe, marks what could be the fourth of the summer for some regions. While the heat is expected to ease mid-week, it may rise again over the weekend.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has warned former President Trump that he is prepared to redraw his state's congressional maps to counter a Republican-led redistricting effort in Texas. In a letter, Newsom urged Trump to "stand down" from the Texas plan, which aims to create more GOP-leaning districts, calling it an "affront to American democracy." This development escalates a national "redistricting arms race," as Texas Democrats have fled the state to block the legislative process by denying a quorum. Newsom stated California would act to "neutralize" any gains Republicans achieve in Texas if they proceed.</p>

          <p>An unusual agreement has been reached where U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD will give the federal government 15% of their revenue from AI chip sales to China. This arrangement was a condition for receiving export licenses, which were previously restricted due to national security concerns over China's AI dominance. President Trump confirmed the deal, stating he negotiated the figure down from 20% for the benefit of the country. This revenue-sharing plan is a novel approach to export controls, allowing U.S. companies to compete in the Chinese market while the government collects a portion of the profits.

          <p>President Trump has stated he will know within the first few minutes of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin whether a peace deal for the war in Ukraine is possible. The high-stakes meeting is scheduled for Friday in Alaska, which Trump described as a "feel-out meeting." He indicated that he would not hesitate to tell Putin to "keep fighting" if a deal seems unachievable, raising concerns in Europe and Ukraine about the potential for an agreement that favors Russia. Trump was dismissive of including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the initial talks, suggesting a subsequent meeting could involve all three leaders.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a federal takeover of the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department and the deployment of approximately 800 National Guard members to address what he termed a crisis of "crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor." Citing a public safety emergency under the D.C. Home Rule Act, the administration placed the local police under the control of the Attorney General for up to 30 days. The move, which Trump called "liberation day," comes despite official data showing a significant decline in violent crime in the city over the past year and a half. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser called the unprecedented action "unsettling."</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, to be the new commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The nomination follows the recent firing of the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, whom Trump accused of rigging jobs data. Antoni has been a public critic of the BLS, questioning its methodology and data accuracy in the past. The move has alarmed some economists who fear it will undermine the independence and credibility of the agency, which is responsible for producing key economic data for the United States. The nomination requires Senate confirmation.</p>

A family member used a stun gun, and the sound of the device scared the mountain lion away. The girl was treated for minor injuries at a hospital, and wildlife officers later located and euthanized a mountain lion in the area.

This large salamander, once abundant, is now nearly impossible to find in the wild due to habitat degradation and pollution. By filtering water and searching for genetic traces, scientists can monitor the species' dwindling population without relying on physical capture. While DNA has been found primarily in protected refuge areas, its discovery in one unprotected site offers a small sign of resilience, highlighting the urgent need for greater conservation efforts.</p>

These armed groups have been responsible for widespread terror, kidnapping for ransom, and violence across the region. While the military hailed the operation as a success that eliminated several key leaders, such violence has exacerbated a malnutrition crisis by displacing farmers, and previous operations have not succeeded in quelling the long-term instability.</p>

The article argues that the action, which Trump called "liberation day," treats the District of Columbia as a "personal fiefdom" and sets a dangerous precedent for using armed forces in American cities. It points out that violent crime in D.C. is significantly down, contrary to the administration's claims.

          <p>The U.S. and China engaged in a heated exchange at a UN Security Council meeting regarding influence over the Panama Canal. The U.S. ambassador warned that Beijing's "outsized influence" over the canal's critical infrastructure poses a potential threat to global trade and security. In response, China's ambassador accused the U.S. of fabricating lies as a pretext to regain control of the strategic waterway. Panama's president, who was chairing the meeting, stressed his country's sovereignty and the canal's permanent neutrality. The clash highlights escalating tensions between the two global powers over key geopolitical assets.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, the fifth named storm of the season, has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is expected to strengthen, potentially becoming the first hurricane of the Atlantic season later this week. The storm developed west of the Cabo Verde islands, which experienced flooding, and is currently moving west. Early forecast models project Erin could become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands by the end of the week. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, its development marks an increase in activity during the peak months of the hurricane season.</p>

The project, proposed by New York developer Mack Real Estate, is planned for a site currently used as a parking lot and will include 536 rental units and ground-floor retail space. However, the developer has not provided a timeline for construction, and experts note that building is challenging in the current financial climate due to high interest rates and rising costs.

          <p>Residents of Paterson, New Jersey's third-largest city, are facing a fourth day with little or no water service following a break in a 140-year-old water main. The failure has left thousands with extremely low water pressure and many with no water at all, forcing reliance on portable showers, toilets, and bottled water distribution. Nearly 200,000 customers in the area are under a boil water advisory. Officials now hope to complete repairs by Tuesday night, but the advisory is expected to last until at least Friday, prolonging the frustration and hardship for residents in one of the state's poorest cities.</p>
