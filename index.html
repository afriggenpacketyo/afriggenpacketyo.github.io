          <p>UK newspaper front pages are dominated by condemnation of an Israeli attack in Gaza, with Foreign Secretary David Lammy calling the situation a "horror."

The articles also cover debates on water regulation and build excitement for the Lionesses' Euro semi-final match against Italy, reflecting a mix of grave international concern and national sporting pride.</p>

          <p>Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is scheduled to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House to strengthen security and economic relations amid rising tensions with China. The talks are expected to address China's assertiveness in the South China Sea and a potential bilateral trade deal to avert Trump's threatened 20% tariffs on Filipino goods. Marcos has expressed readiness to negotiate, with Manila even considering zero tariffs on some U.S. products to secure an agreement. The meeting underscores the strategic importance of the U.S.-Philippines alliance in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>The push to develop solid-state batteries for electric vehicles is gaining new momentum, with major automakers like Volkswagen, Nissan, and Toyota targeting commercial production by 2027-2028. These batteries promise higher energy density and improved safety over conventional lithium-ion cells, potentially revolutionizing the EV market. However, some experts express skepticism, citing persistent technological hurdles, high costs, and significant advancements in existing battery technologies that are narrowing the performance gap. The industry remains divided on whether this "holy grail" technology will overcome its challenges to achieve mass adoption.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Minnesota Twins 5-2, relying on power hitting to overcome a generally sluggish offensive performance. Shohei Ohtani hit a two-run homer in the first inning, and Will Smith added two solo home runs, providing the bulk of the team's runs. Despite the win, concerns remain about the team's recent offensive struggles, though the four total home runs marked a positive development. The victory was somewhat marred by an injury to closer Tanner Scott, who left the game with a forearm issue.</p>

Many have labeled the event "atrocious" and a "shambles," demanding refunds for what they describe as a low-quality theatrical performance. The organizer, Layered Reality, defended the creative decision, stating the concept evolved and the show is not a traditional concert.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has threatened former President Jair Bolsonaro with imprisonment after his allies circulated a video of his speech, violating a court-ordered social media ban. The ban, which includes an ankle monitor, was imposed due to allegations that Bolsonaro planned a coup. Justice Alexandre de Moraes gave Bolsonaro's lawyers 24 hours to explain the breach, which occurred when allies shared a video of his address to journalists.

          <p>President Donald Trump's second term has seen a heavy reliance on tariffs, which he wields with the speed and unilateral control typically associated with sanctions to achieve foreign policy goals. This strategy, dubbed the "tariff tango," involves threatening or imposing steep duties on trading partners like China, Mexico, and even allies to address issues ranging from trade deficits to immigration. While the White House defends this as a flexible tool that raises revenue, critics warn that blurring the lines between trade policy and punitive sanctions creates global economic instability and could be linked to de-globalization and conflict.

          <p>In a personal essay, writer Ana Schnabl from the Balkans critiques the Western publishing industry for its narrow expectations of authors from her region. She recounts being advised by a US publisher to focus on themes of cultural or historical trauma, suggesting that stories from the Balkans are primarily valued for their ability to explain the region's tragic past to foreign audiences. Schnabl argues this creates a restrictive environment where writers are expected to self-exoticize and produce narratives of victimhood. She calls for publishers to embrace a wider diversity of stories that challenge these stereotypes and reflect the region's full complexity.</p>

          <p>National Archives documents reveal that former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie received tens of thousands of pounds in discounts on designer clothing while in office. Between 2001 and 2002, Cherie Blair acquired over £75,000 worth of clothes for just £31,000, thanks to "wholesale" discounts negotiated by her personal shopper. The files show that Downing Street officials were concerned about the public perception and potential breach of the ministerial code. They advised the Blairs to repay a portion of the discounts, though it is unclear from the documents if this occurred.</p>

          <h2>UK Rents Have Increased by an Average of £221 Per Month Over Three Years, Zoopla Reports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 22:07:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis by property portal Zoopla indicates that the average monthly rent for a new tenancy in the UK has surged by £221, or 21%, over the past three years. The sharp increase, driven by high demand and insufficient supply, has pushed the average monthly rent to £1,283. This financial pressure is forcing some tenants to turn down job opportunities or rely on parental help for living costs. While the rate of rent increases is now slowing, particularly in major cities, the high costs continue to make homeownership an unattainable goal for many renters. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recently circulated air-to-air photographs of China's J-35 stealth fighter provide the strongest evidence yet that the aircraft is ready for naval operations. The images show two jets with official navy markings, "Flying Shark" tail insignia, and serial numbers, indicating they are part of an initial production run. According to a military analyst, these details suggest the fifth-generation fighter has been formally integrated into the navy's carrier aviation force. The J-35 is expected to be deployed aboard China's newest aircraft carrier, the Fujian, significantly boosting its naval combat capabilities.</p>

          <p>The family of Keith McAllister, the 61-year-old man who died in a tragic MRI accident, alleges the facility's technician was at fault. McAllister was pulled into the machine by its powerful magnet after the technician reportedly invited him into the room to assist his wife without warning him about the dangers of metal. He became trapped by a metal chain he was wearing and remained stuck for nearly an hour, suffering several heart attacks before passing away. The family has clarified that he was authorized to be in the room, contrary to some reports, and the police investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>The preliminary report into the fatal Air India Flight 171 crash has sparked controversy and speculation, particularly regarding the pilots' final moments. The report notes that both fuel-control switches were moved to "cut-off" seconds after takeoff, causing total power loss, and the cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why. While media leaks have begun to focus blame on the senior pilot, India's accident investigation bureau has condemned the reporting as "irresponsible" and "premature." Investigators and pilot associations are urging restraint, emphasizing that a full analysis is needed to determine if the cause was deliberate action, pilot confusion, or a technical malfunction.</p>

The judge's sentence went against a recommendation from the Trump administration's Justice Department for no additional prison time.

His recent online activity includes demanding the Washington Commanders revert to their old name and attacking political opponents, which figures like Joe Walsh and Al Sharpton claim is a deliberate distraction. The accusations come as the administration faces backlash from its own base for its handling of the Epstein files. The White House maintains that the president is being transparent on the matter.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while widely criticized, Donald Trump's universal tariffs have a potential silver lining by exposing the self-defeating internal trade barriers within other countries and trading blocs. Nations like Canada, China, and those in the European Union are being forced to confront their own protectionist policies and regulatory hurdles that hinder economic growth. The pressure from U.S. tariffs has reportedly spurred significant movement toward creating more unified domestic markets in Canada and China.

The majority of those reported missing were tourists who had safely returned home without checking in, leading to a sharp revision in the numbers. After an exhaustive effort, only three individuals remain unaccounted for in the hardest-hit Kerr County. The flash floods killed at least 135 people in the state, with the rapid and destructive rise of the river catching many campers and residents off guard.</p>
