          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications, a program widely used by technology companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers. The executive order, signed by President Trump, aims to ensure that companies are hiring "truly extraordinary people" and not replacing American workers with cheaper labor. This substantial new charge is in addition to existing fees that can already total several thousand dollars per application. Critics of the policy warn it could incentivize U.S. companies to move specialized jobs overseas and discourage international students from studying in the United States.</p>

The "We Are America" marchers, ranging from children to the elderly, were greeted by supporters and members of Congress upon their arrival in the nation's capital. The march was organized to build a movement to hold leaders accountable for what they see as threats to democracy, including mass firings at government agencies. Participants carried a version of the U.S. Constitution created by children, which they presented to lawmakers.</p>

          <p>Veteran actress Glenn Close, 78, has revealed that appearing fully nude in her new movie, "The Summer Book," was her own idea. In an interview, she explained that she felt the act of walking nude in a forest was something her character would do when alone, noting that Finnish culture is more comfortable with nudity. The film, based on a novel by Tove Jansson, centers on the relationship between a young girl and her grandmother as they grieve a family loss. Close stated that she felt so comfortable during the scene that she didn't want to put her clothes back on afterward.</p>

          <p>Michael Eisner, who led Disney for over two decades, has publicly criticized the company's decision to suspend late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. In a social media post, Eisner questioned the lack of leadership from corporations in defending free speech against what he termed "out-of-control intimidation." His comments came after ABC suspended "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" indefinitely following remarks Kimmel made about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

          <p>Estonia has formally requested urgent consultations with its NATO allies under Article 4 of the treaty after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace. The incursion over the Gulf of Finland lasted for approximately 12 minutes, an act Estonia's foreign ministry described as "brazen" and "an extremely dangerous provocation." NATO confirmed it intercepted the aircraft, which were flying without transponders or flight plans. Invoking Article 4 initiates formal consultations among the 32 alliance members when a member's territorial integrity or security is threatened, signaling a serious escalation in regional tensions.</p>

          <p>The future of TikTok in the United States may depend on a licensing agreement for its highly coveted algorithm, a key sticking point in negotiations between Washington and Beijing. The Chinese government has previously vowed to block the sale of the algorithm, which is credited with the app's massive success in intuiting user preferences. A potential deal could involve a U.S. entity licensing the technology from parent company ByteDance, allowing the app to continue operating while addressing U.S. national security concerns. However, questions remain about how such an arrangement would prevent potential data access or content manipulation from China.</p>

A controversial component of the package allows for a limited number of new oil wells in Kern County to stabilize gasoline supply as refineries close.

          <p>A CDC advisory committee has concluded two days of meetings, resulting in significant changes to vaccine guidance. The panel voted to no longer broadly recommend the COVID-19 vaccine for all adults, instead favoring individual decision-making in consultation with a healthcare provider. For children under four, the committee now supports separate shots for measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and varicella (chickenpox) over the combined MMRV vaccine, citing a slightly higher risk of fever-related seizures with the combination shot.

          <p>Recent decisions by the CDC's vaccine advisory committee could create significant disparities in vaccine access, particularly for lower-income families. The panel's recommendation to move away from the combined MMRV shot for young children and its discussions on delaying other routine immunizations may disproportionately affect those relying on the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. While privately insured individuals may retain access to a wider range of options, changes to the VFC program, which is directly tied to the committee's guidance, could limit choices for nearly half of American children. This shift raises concerns about creating a fractured system and potential confusion for parents.</p>

          <p>The Irish-language hip-hop group Kneecap has been banned from entering Canada ahead of a planned tour, with officials citing statements "contrary to Canadian values." The ban is linked to terror offense charges filed in the UK against band member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh for allegedly displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah, which is designated a terrorist organization by the UK. Canadian officials stated the group has "amplified political violence," a claim the band calls "wholly untrue and deeply malicious." The trio, known for their pro-Palestinian advocacy and controversial performances, has threatened legal action against the Canadian government.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced it is ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Syrian immigrants, arguing that conditions in the war-torn country no longer prevent their safe return. The humanitarian program, in place since 2012, has provided a safe haven in the U.S. for Syrians fleeing a brutal civil war. The administration cited national security concerns, calling Syria a "hotbed of terrorism," and stated that TPS is meant to be temporary. Syrians enrolled in the program will have approximately 60 days before their legal status expires, at which point they will be subject to deportation.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation has revealed significant issues with fakes and scams on Walmart.com's third-party marketplace, which has rapidly expanded to compete with Amazon. The report found that shoppers have received counterfeit and potentially dangerous products, particularly in the health and beauty categories. In some cases, fraudulent sellers used the identities of legitimate businesses to create their accounts, a process made easier by what former employees described as a relaxed vetting process. In response to the findings, Walmart stated it has a zero-tolerance policy for counterfeit goods and has recently tightened its vetting procedures.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Ted Cruz has accused China of secretly funding lawsuits filed by U.S. states and cities against the fossil fuel industry. During a Senate hearing, Cruz claimed that Beijing is bankrolling the litigation to undermine American energy producers, but his office has not provided direct evidence to support the allegation. The claim is part of a broader effort by industry allies to counter the wave of lawsuits seeking to hold oil and gas companies financially liable for climate change damages. Environmental advocates characterize the unsubstantiated claim as a tactic to create political cover for legislation that would shield energy companies from liability.</p>

          <p>A journalist for the website L.A. Taco has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department, alleging that officers repeatedly interfered with his right to report on sweeps of homeless encampments. The journalist, Lexis-Olivier Ray, claims he was wrongfully threatened with arrest and, in one instance, handcuffed while legally documenting the clean-ups in public spaces. The lawsuit argues that police and sanitation workers improperly used crime scene tape to restrict press access in non-crime scenes. This case adds to growing scrutiny of the LAPD's treatment of the media.</p>

In a sentencing memorandum, the Justice Department stated that Nicholas Roske aimed to "single-handedly alter the constitutional order" and was motivated by the court's anticipated decision to overturn Roe v.

Musk later denied the report on his social media platform X, calling it "fake news." If the funding round proceeds, the capital would likely be used to acquire the expensive GPUs needed to build out data centers and compete in the AI arms race. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released a new welcome letter for newly naturalized U.S. citizens that shifts focus from the nation's founding ideals to its culture and traditions. Unlike letters from previous presidents, which often spoke of America as an "idea" or an "experiment" in liberty, Trump's message emphasizes the importance of embracing "our values" and assimilating into society. The letter states that new citizens have forged a "sacred bond with our Nation, her traditions, her history, her culture." This rhetorical change aligns with a broader conservative shift away from a creedal definition of American identity toward one based on a shared national culture.</p>

          <p>The recent suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" has brought attention to the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) authority over broadcast television. Networks like ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox operate by licensing public airwaves from the government, which requires them to serve the "public interest, convenience and necessity." FCC Chairman Brendan Carr has used this public interest mandate to justify threatening the licenses of stations airing content he deems inappropriate, a move critics call an unprecedented politicization of the agency's power. While the process to revoke a license is complex and subject to legal challenges, the threats themselves can exert significant pressure on broadcasters.</p>
