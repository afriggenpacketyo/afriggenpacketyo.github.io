          <h2>Putin Proposes Ukraine Talks in Istanbul Amidst Ceasefire Debate</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 03:53:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested restarting direct negotiations with Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15, without preconditions, following calls from Ukraine and its allies for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. This proposal references previous unsuccessful talks held in Istanbul shortly after Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. Putin stated his commitment to serious negotiations, not ruling out a ceasefire during direct talks. The offer comes amidst threats from European leaders to increase pressure on Moscow if a ceasefire is not accepted, with support from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has urged high-level talks to end the ongoing conflict. Optimism that these talks will occur is tempered by the ongoing attacks.</p>

          <p>A Maryland oral surgeon, Dr. James Ryan, is accused of providing his much younger girlfriend, Sarah Harris, with habit-forming anesthesia drugs, ultimately leading to her death. Ryan and Harris became romantically involved after he performed a wisdom teeth surgery on her, and her family alleges that Ryan had been watching her since she was 14. Texts revealed after Harris's death showed Ryan offering and administering drugs like ketamine and propofol, leading to a charge of 'depraved heart murder,' indicating reckless disregard for human life. The article also highlights the power imbalance and control dynamics in their relationship, with Ryan being significantly older and having access to the drugs that fueled Harris's addiction.</p>

          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the United States has remained steady at 6.76%, close to the year's highest levels but lower than the previous year. Mortgage rates are influenced by various factors, including global demand for U.S. Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve interest rate policies, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a sluggish spring home-buying season.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Saudi Aramco's net profit for the first quarter of 2025 decreased by 5% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower crude oil prices and reduced production. The company reported a net income of $26 billion, slightly above analyst expectations, but free cash flow also declined. This signals ongoing financial strain for the Saudi state oil giant, as crude prices remain subdued and global demand slows. Aramco has reduced its performance-linked dividend payout while increasing its base dividend, reflecting efforts to balance shareholder returns with financial realities.</p>

          <p>The newly elected German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is facing criticism for appointing individuals with strong ties to the business world to top cabinet positions, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest and undue influence. The new cabinet includes members from the energy sector and media, leading to accusations of a 'CDU lobbyist cabinet.' While it's becoming more common for people from business to move into government roles, Germany lacks effective rules to curtail potential conflicts of interest. Lobbying is regulated through the Lobby Register, but exceptions and loopholes remain, prompting calls for greater transparency and stricter regulations.</p>

Putin proposed a meeting between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15, stating Russia was “prepared for serious negotiations with Ukraine” and “without any preconditions.” There was no immediate response from Ukraine, but authorities reported an attack by Russian exploding drones shortly after Putin’s announcement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's USAID cuts have significantly impacted healthcare in Africa, leading to a loss of access to medication for HIV patients and the halt of various healthcare programs. The cuts have been a blow to many African countries, with Sub-Saharan Africa being a major recipient of USAID funding. Experts warn that millions could die from treatable diseases due to the loss of US funding.

          <p>China is increasingly channeling its energy investments in Africa into renewable projects, with solar and wind power accounting for 59% of its energy projects on the continent. Between 2010 and 2024, China invested US$66 billion in Africa's energy sector, with one-fifth of its overall energy sector and renewable energy investment and construction activity taking place there. The continent has become a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology, with exports surging 153% from 2020 to 2024. This shift aligns with global trends showing China's energy investment moving from fossil fuels to renewables.</p>
