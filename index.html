          <p>HSBC's first-quarter results exceeded expectations, driven by strong performance in its wealth management and corporate banking divisions. The bank announced a share buyback of up to $3 billion, expected to be completed before the announcement of its 2025 interim results. While profit before tax declined 25% year-on-year, it surged nearly 317% from the previous quarter. The bank cautioned about macroeconomic uncertainties and protectionist trade policies affecting sentiment, but analysts anticipate continued positive impacts from HSBC's restructuring and cost-saving measures.

          <p>A British journalist attended a Reform U.K. rally in Birmingham, noting the party's attempt to capitalize on widespread discontent with the Labour government. Reform U.K., a far-right anti-immigration party, is gaining traction as Britain grapples with struggling public services, culture wars, and economic hardships. The party's campaign launch featured symbolic displays of grievances, such as trash cans and a fake pub with a 'To Let' sign. While Reform U.K. effectively channels outrage, it faces challenges including chaotic leadership and a lack of clear solutions, mirroring issues seen in far-right movements globally.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's pre-election promise to quickly end the Russia-Ukraine war, a ceasefire agreement remains elusive after his first 100 days. While the U.S. has initiated discussions with both Russia and Ukraine, progress has been limited, with each side accusing the other of sabotaging negotiations. Secretary of State Rubio indicated that the coming week is critical for determining whether the U.S. will continue its involvement in ceasefire talks. There are suggestions that Ukraine may have to cede territory, such as Crimea, as part of a potential peace deal, though European diplomats remain skeptical of Russia's commitment to peace.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party is projected to have won Canada's federal election, securing a fourth mandate for the party. The election largely focused on responding to US President Donald Trump's tariff threats and his suggestion to make Canada the 51st state. While it is not yet clear if the Liberals have secured a majority, Carney plans to prioritize navigating the relationship with the US, including negotiations on a new economic and security relationship. The Liberals have also promised a tax cut for middle-class Canadians and a streamlined approval process for energy and mining projects.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberals are projected to have won Canada's federal election, riding a wave of anti-Trump sentiment. The US president's tariff threats and comments undermining Canada's sovereignty played a significant role in the election, making leadership and economic survival defining issues. Carney positioned himself against Trump, warning that Trump "wants to break us so America can own us". The Conservatives made gains but fell short, while the left-wing New Democrats collapsed. Carney plans to begin negotiations on a new economic and security relationship with the US immediately following the election.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberal party has won Canada's federal election, according to projections by Canadian broadcasters. Opposition leader Pierre Poilievre conceded defeat, but the Liberals may not secure a majority. Statements by US President Donald Trump about Canada becoming the US' 51st state played a role during the campaign. Carney's success at the polls will also come as a blow to Trump, who had consistently railed against the Liberals, especially under Trudeau. Carney called for an election just nine days after taking office to seek a "strong, positive mandate" amid the general unpopularity of his party.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party have claimed a victory in the Canadian election, potentially aided by Donald Trump's constant badgering of Canada. The US president's comments about making Canada the 51st US state coincided with a reversal in fortune for the Liberals. The past year has been devastating for incumbent governments around the world, but the Canadian general election broke that trend. The irony, however, is that Trump's derisive focus on Canada may have denied him a northern neighbor run by a politician more in line with his populist conservative priorities than Liberal Carney.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has been back in the Oval Office for a few months, and there have been plenty of historic moments. He says he’s "not joking" about running for a third term, even though it’s constitutionally impossible. The newly created Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, is named after a meme. Trump calls tariffs the "most beautiful word in the dictionary". He signed an executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. Trump has re-established US communications with President Putin, even addressing him directly as Vladimir in a Truth Social post.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to announce measures to ease the impact of tariffs on imported cars and car parts, giving automakers more time to relocate production to the United States. While tariffs of 25 percent on imported vehicles and auto parts will remain, they will be modified to avoid "stacking" with other tariffs, such as those on steel and aluminum. Automakers will also be reimbursed for some of the cost of tariffs on imported components. Despite these changes, substantial tariffs will still raise prices for new and used cars.</p>

          <p>A Vietnamese factory, Dony Garment, is working overtime to prepare for a potential 46% trade tariff imposed by the Trump administration. The factory is rushing through orders for clients in America, but they started diversifying their market back in 2021. Previously they used to export 40% of their garments to America, but now it's closer to 20%. Others in the industry who export all their garments to America could see their businesses destroyed if the 46% tariff is enforced. The Trump administration claims China is using Vietnam to illegally circumvent tariffs.</p>

This victory was spurred by U.S. President Donald Trump's threats of annexation and tariffs on Canada. As of late Monday, the Liberal Party was leading with 161 seats won in Parliament, as opposed to the 150 seats held by the Conservative Party. The majority party appeared to be giving up control when Trump started a trade war with Canada and suggested the country should become a U.S. state.</p>
