Her chances were boosted after her main rival, Belgian Olympic champion Nafi Thiam, unexpectedly withdrew from the competition after the penultimate session. Johnson-Thompson heads into the final two events, the javelin and 800m, trailing the American leader Anna Hall. The British athlete expressed some frustration over a narrowly fouled long jump but remains focused on securing a medal.</p>

          <p>Russia has conducted a massive overnight attack on Ukraine, utilizing over 600 drones and missiles to target infrastructure and residential areas across multiple regions. Ukrainian air defense systems intercepted most of the projectiles, but strikes still resulted in at least three deaths and numerous injuries. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack on the city of Dnipro, where a missile hit an apartment building, calling it a deliberate strategy to terrorize civilians. The attacks come as Ukraine continues to press for stronger international sanctions against Russia.</p>

          <p>Germany is facing a diplomatic dilemma as several key allies, including France, Canada, and the UK, plan to recognize Palestine as a state to pressure Israel. The German government maintains that recognition should be the final step of a two-state solution, a prospect that currently seems remote. Chancellor Friedrich Merz is balancing Germany's historical responsibility for Israel's security with sharp criticism of Israel's military actions in Gaza. This stance puts Berlin at odds with a majority of the German public and growing international pressure to take a stronger position.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive study by the Open Technology Fund has uncovered alarming security flaws in several widely-used VPN services, potentially exposing users in authoritarian states to surveillance and imprisonment. The report highlights issues like opaque ownership structures, with some popular VPNs secretly controlled by Chinese nationals, and the use of weak security protocols. Highly downloaded apps such as Turbo VPN and VPN Proxy Master are named as problematic, giving hundreds of millions of users a false sense of security. The study recommends using transparent, paid services or the Tor browser for maximum privacy.</p>

          <p>Portugal has announced it will formally recognize a Palestinian state, becoming the latest Western country to shift its policy amid the ongoing war in Gaza. This move aligns Portugal with other nations like France, the UK, and Canada, who are preparing similar declarations ahead of the United Nations General Assembly. The decision aims to increase pressure on Israel for a peace process, though it has been denounced by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. This trend highlights a growing diplomatic split between some of Israel's allies over the handling of the conflict.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is being increasingly adopted in the workplace to combat employee burnout by automating repetitive tasks and managing workloads, potentially saving companies thousands per employee annually. Tools like ChatGPT can act as assistants, reducing cognitive load and allowing for early intervention when stress is detected. However, some studies suggest that frequent AI users may experience higher rates of burnout, as efficiency gains often lead to increased workloads rather than relief. The challenge lies in integrating AI to support well-being without inadvertently adding to the pressure.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed a new community policing strategy that would establish police counters in public venues like supermarkets, shopping centers, and libraries. The party argues this move would increase police visibility, build public confidence, and make it easier for citizens to report crimes. To fund the initiative, the Lib Dems suggest abolishing the elected Police and Crime Commissioner roles, which they claim would free up significant funds. This policy announcement comes as the party seeks to address concerns over declining police presence in local communities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order introducing a new $100,000 annual fee for companies applying for H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers. The administration states the measure is intended to curb alleged abuse of the program and encourage companies to hire American workers first. Critics warn that the steep cost will devastate small businesses and start-ups, potentially pricing them out of hiring essential foreign talent and harming U.S. competitiveness. The move marks a significant escalation in restrictions on the visa program, which is heavily used by the tech industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that he ordered a third lethal military strike on a boat in the Caribbean, which he stated was trafficking illicit narcotics for a Designated Terrorist Organization. The strike reportedly killed three individuals, whom the president referred to as "narcoterrorists." This action reflects a controversial policy shift that uses lethal military force, typically reserved for imminent threats, against suspected drug traffickers. Critics have questioned the legal justification for these strikes, raising concerns about whether they could constitute war crimes.</p>
