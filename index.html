          <p>An investigation reveals that dopamine agonist drugs, prescribed for conditions like Parkinson's disease and restless leg syndrome, are causing extreme and harmful side effects in some patients. The article details cases where individuals developed compulsive gambling habits, hypersexuality, and coercive behaviors, leading to family breakdowns and even criminal charges for sexual offenses. Despite manufacturers and regulators being aware of these risks for years, patient warnings remain vague, prompting calls for stronger safety advice. The report highlights the devastating personal impact on patients and their families, who were often unaware that medication was the root cause of the drastic behavioral changes.</p>

          <p>A strike by some employees of Republic Services, a major private waste-management company, is causing garbage to pile up in several American cities, creating health and sanitation concerns. The Teamsters union, representing the workers, is demanding better pay and benefits, arguing their compensation is far below the industry standard. While the company claims the union is unwilling to compromise, the dispute has led to overflowing dumpsters and legal action from municipalities for breach of contract. The strike highlights the critical role of sanitation workers and the leverage they hold, as unresolved negotiations leave residents and businesses to deal with the foul consequences.</p>

          <p>Authorities have confirmed that one of two grenades recovered by Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies is now missing following a deadly incident at a training facility. The other grenade unexpectedly detonated, killing three deputies from the Arson Explosives Detail who believed the devices were inert. The explosion marks the department's largest single loss of life since 1857. An extensive search is underway for the second grenade, and the department has revised its policies to treat all explosive devices as live. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is leading the investigation into the tragic event.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. intends to remove all 16 members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a panel that provides key recommendations for health services like cancer screenings that must be covered by insurance. According to a source familiar with the plan, Kennedy views the independent volunteer panel as overly "woke." While the department stated that no final decision has been made, a scheduled meeting for the task force was recently canceled without explanation. The move signals a potential major shift in the nation's approach to preventive healthcare guidelines and insurance coverage mandates.</p>

          <p>China has taken a significant step in its advanced nuclear energy program by completing the conceptual design for a commercial-scale, fourth-generation fast neutron reactor. The CFR-1000 is a gigawatt-level facility that aims to be more fuel-efficient and is part of a global race to develop more advanced nuclear power sources. The design's completion was announced at an event attended by top officials from China's national energy and atomic authorities. Awaiting final approval, the reactor is projected to become operational after 2030, positioning China as a key player in the future of nuclear technology.</p>

Four years ago, Saied dissolved parliament and began ruling by decree, a move critics labeled a coup. Since then, his government has dismantled judicial bodies and overseen the arrests of most prominent opposition leaders, leading to widespread fear and accusations of democratic backsliding.</p>

          <p>NASA is facing a significant workforce reduction, as nearly 4,000 employees, representing over one-fifth of its staff, have applied to leave the agency through a deferred resignation program. This exodus would shrink NASA's civil servant workforce from approximately 18,000 to 14,000. The departures come as the agency faces a proposed 25% budget cut for fiscal year 2026 and a period of leadership instability. The White House introduced the buyout program to reduce the size of the federal workforce, but the scale of departures at NASA raises concerns about its ability to pursue its ambitious exploration and innovation goals.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom experienced its warmest and sunniest spring on record, leading to a noticeable boom in certain insect populations like ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The warm weather created ideal conditions for aphids, a primary food source, and allowed butterflies to emerge weeks earlier than average, resulting in a strong year after a poor 2024. However, the associated lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year by drying out wetland habitats and affecting egg-laying. While a welcome sight for many, the boom is set against a longer-term trend of declining flying insect populations across the UK.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society explores the story of the Hollywood blacklist, which began in the late 1940s amid investigations by the House Un-American Activities Committee into alleged Communist influence in the film industry. The exhibit focuses on the "Hollywood Ten," a group of writers and directors who were jailed and blacklisted for refusing to answer the committee's questions. It details how the anti-Communist fervor expanded, ruining the careers of hundreds of creatives, and how some, like screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, continued to work under pseudonyms. The exhibit raises enduring questions about free speech, privacy, and democracy.</p>

          <p>A Southern California man has been arrested on federal fraud charges for allegedly conning multiple people he met on dating apps like Tinder and Hinge out of more than $2 million. Prosecutors claim Christopher Earl Lloyd, 39, lied about his financial expertise and professional status to convince victims to invest in fake opportunities. He allegedly created fraudulent contracts and investment schedules to collect money through cash, wire transfers, and payment apps. Instead of investing the funds, Lloyd allegedly used the money for personal expenses, including making a payment on a Lexus. He now faces multiple counts of wire fraud.</p>

          <p>An article explores Donald Trump's unique relationship with golf, portraying it as more than a presidential pastime but as a core part of his business, networking, and competitive identity. Unlike past presidents who used the sport for diversion, Trump has integrated it into his brand, owning numerous high-profile courses and using them for high-stakes political and business meetings away from public scrutiny. The piece describes him as a fiercely competitive player who uses the golf course as a venue for transactional relationships with allies, rivals, and foreign leaders. His passion for the game is evident, though his on-course conduct and championship claims remain a subject of debate.</p>

          <p>Sources report that Ghislaine Maxwell was granted a limited form of immunity before being questioned for nine hours by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. This "proffer immunity" allowed her to answer questions about the Jeffrey Epstein case without fear that her statements could be used against her in the future, a common step when prosecutors seek cooperation. Maxwell's lawyer confirmed she answered all questions but stated no promises were made in return. The high-level meetings are highly unusual and come as the Justice Department faces pressure to release more information about Epstein's network, and as questions swirl about President Trump's connections to the case.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are undertaking a critical mission to save the state's dwindling bighorn sheep population, which has been decimated by disease over the last five years. In a rescue effort, dozens of healthy sheep, including pregnant ewes, were captured from the last disease-free herd and airlifted over 200 miles to an isolated mountain range. The goal is to establish a new, protected colony away from the diseases spread by non-native animals. A recent follow-up visit revealed the relocated herd is surviving and has already produced new lambs, offering a hopeful sign for the species' recovery in the state.</p>

The envoy blamed Hamas, stating its response showed a "lack of desire to reach a ceasefire" and that it was not acting in good faith. The breakdown in talks comes amid dire warnings from the United Nations about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where children are reportedly starving to death due to the blockade and inability to distribute aid. With conflicting demands from Israel and Hamas over the release of hostages and the end of the war, the path to a resolution remains blocked.</p>

          <p>An article examines common health and wellness targets, questioning whether strict adherence to numbers like drinking eight glasses of water or getting eight hours of sleep is necessary for a healthy life. Experts suggest that while these benchmarks provide useful guidance, individual needs vary greatly. For instance, a kidney specialist argues that for most healthy people, thirst is a reliable guide for hydration. While getting sufficient sleep is deemed critical with little room for compromise, experts advise a more flexible approach to exercise and mindfulness, emphasizing consistency over hitting precise targets. The overall message is to incorporate healthy habits without becoming overly fixated on achieving perfect numbers.</p>

The article highlights how open discussions about periods, proper equipment, and tailored training are not only improving performance at the elite level but also helping to reduce the number of young girls who drop out of sports.</p>
