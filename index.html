          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao, marking the end of one of the agency's last remaining crypto enforcement actions. The original complaint, filed in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal signals a potential shift in regulatory approach towards the crypto industry, especially as the Trump administration aims to be more industry-friendly, with the Justice Department having already shut down its crypto enforcement team. Binance is also deepening its ties with World Liberty Financial, a crypto bank project linked to the Trump family. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fast fashion giant Shein is facing increasing challenges as its anticipated London IPO encounters a new obstacle, with the company now considering a Hong Kong listing after failing to secure approval from Chinese regulators. The potential London listing was expected to provide Shein with international legitimacy and access to Western investors, but ongoing scrutiny over forced labor allegations and consumer protection law breaches has complicated matters. An EU investigation found Shein in violation of consumer protection laws due to misleading sustainability claims and deceptive sales tactics. The closure of the U.S.'s de minimis loophole for low-cost goods further compounds Shein's difficulties, contributing to reluctance from Chinese regulators.</p>

          <p>An Argentine court has declared a mistrial in the case of seven health professionals accused of negligence in the death of soccer star Diego Maradona, ordering a new trial without specifying a date. The decision came after one of the judges stepped down due to criticism surrounding her involvement in a documentary series about the case, raising concerns about impartiality. The prosecutor presented a trailer for the documentary, which featured the judge in a way that suggested a lack of objectivity, leading to her recusal and the subsequent mistrial declaration. The case accuses Maradona's medical team of failing to provide adequate care in the weeks leading up to his death in November 2020.</p>

          <p>The deportation of Qian Xuesen, a brilliant Chinese rocket scientist, by the U.S. in 1955 is highlighted as a significant misstep that altered the global balance of power. Despite his contributions to American aerospace and weaponry, Qian was deported amidst McCarthy-era xenophobia, leading him to return to China and establish its modern weapons program. This historical event serves as a warning as the U.S. considers revoking visas of Chinese students in critical fields, echoing past mistakes fueled by fear and prejudice. The deportation of Qian allowed China to close the gap in scientific prowess and challenge American dominance in Asia.</p>

          <p>China has agreed to begin procedures to resume imports of Japanese seafood, lifting a ban imposed after the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Japanese authorities expect China to issue a public notice easing the ban, which has been in place since August 2023, and open registration for Japanese facilities processing marine products. While Japan will continue to seek the removal of remaining Chinese restrictions on food imports from 10 prefectures, this move is viewed as a positive step in resolving tensions between the two countries. The agreement follows third-party monitoring of the water release and marine sampling near the Fukushima plant, which found no abnormal concentrations of radioactive substances.</p>

          <p>A Chinese economist warns that financial sanctions and countermeasures could become a new arena for competition between China and the US, though the chance of Washington launching full-scale financial sanctions against Beijing remains slim. The economist, Lian Ping, suggests the US could target specific Chinese entities initially before expanding the scope to potentially exclude China from the US dollar system. Lian notes that sanctioning China within the Swift system would cause serious damage to the system itself, considering China's significant role in global trade and investment. If China were excluded from Swift, countries with trade ties to China would likely shift to using China's alternative settlement system, CIPS.</p>

          <p>President Trump has criticized conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, calling him a "bad person" who "probably hates America," after a panel of judges ruled against his tariffs. Trump's attack on Leo and the Federalist Society is notable because of their long-standing alliance, with Leo advising Trump on Supreme Court picks during his first term. The president expressed disappointment in the Federalist Society for providing bad advice on judicial nominations. Trump also mentioned Leo's departure from the Federalist Society to pursue other ventures, including efforts to counter liberal dominance in various fields.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has granted the Trump administration's request to temporarily pause a lower-court ruling that struck down most of President Trump's tariffs. The Trump administration had threatened to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court if the tariff ruling was not quickly put on hold. The ruling by the U.S. Court of International Trade had invalidated all of Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs, finding that the law used to enact them did not confer such broad authority to presidents. Trump officials maintain they have alternative options for imposing tariffs if they ultimately lose the case.</p>
