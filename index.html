          <p>Defending champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson is positioned for a potential third world title in the heptathlon, holding third place with two events remaining in Tokyo. Her path to the podium was altered after her main rival, Belgian Olympic champion Nafi Thiam, unexpectedly withdrew from the competition. Johnson-Thompson's performance included a solid long jump, keeping her in the hunt for a medal despite narrowly fouling a significantly larger attempt. The final session will see her compete in the javelin and 800m events to determine the final standings.</p>

          <p>Russia has conducted a large-scale overnight attack on Ukraine, utilizing over 600 missiles and drones, according to the Ukrainian Air Force. While air defense systems intercepted most of the projectiles, the strikes resulted in at least three fatalities and numerous injuries. The attacks targeted infrastructure and residential areas in several regions, including a direct missile strike on an apartment building in Dnipro. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the assault as a deliberate strategy to terrorize civilians and called for a stronger international response.</p>

          <p>The German government is maintaining its position of not recognizing Palestine as a state in the short term, even as allies like France and Canada are expected to do so at the UN General Assembly. Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated that recognition should be the final step of a peace process, a stance critics argue is unrealistic given the current conflict. Germany's policy is complicated by its historical responsibility for Israel's security, which it considers a "reason of state." This creates a difficult diplomatic balancing act as international and domestic pressure mounts for a stronger stance against Israel's actions in Gaza.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive study has uncovered alarming security flaws in several widely used VPN services, potentially exposing users in authoritarian states to surveillance and imprisonment. The report highlights issues like opaque ownership structures, with some popular VPNs secretly controlled by Chinese nationals despite being registered elsewhere. Many of these services, downloaded hundreds of millions of times, use weak encryption protocols and hard-coded passwords, allowing attackers to decrypt user communications. Researchers warn that this creates a false sense of security and advise users to choose transparent, independently audited providers.</p>

          <p>Portugal has announced its decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state, joining a growing number of Western nations shifting their policy amidst the ongoing war in Gaza. The announcement was made ahead of the upcoming United Nations General Assembly, where countries like France, the UK, and Canada are expected to make similar declarations. This move is seen as a way to increase pressure on Israel to pursue a peace process. The decision has been denounced by Israel and its ally, the United States, who argue that it rewards terrorism following the October 7th attack by Hamas.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is increasingly being adopted in the workplace to combat employee burnout by automating repetitive tasks and reducing cognitive load. Tools like ChatGPT can act as assistants, potentially lowering emotional exhaustion and allowing for early intervention when employees are at risk. However, some studies suggest that frequent AI users may experience higher rates of burnout, as the technology can also lead to increased workloads and the pressure to constantly be productive. Experts caution that while AI offers significant opportunities, companies must manage its implementation carefully to avoid simply replacing one form of stress with another.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed a plan for every police force in England and Wales to establish public-facing counters in accessible venues like supermarkets and libraries. The party argues this would enhance public confidence in policing and simplify the process of reporting crimes. The policy aims to counteract the recent decline in traditional police station front counters. Funding for the initiative would reportedly come from abolishing the elected Police and Crime Commissioner roles, a move the party claims would free up sufficient resources for the new community-based desks.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order introducing a substantial $100,000 annual fee for companies applying for H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers. The administration states the measure is intended to curb "abuse" of the program and encourage companies to hire American workers first. The move has drawn sharp criticism from immigration lawyers and business groups, who argue it will price out small businesses and start-ups, harming American competitiveness in key sectors like technology.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that he ordered a third lethal military strike on a boat in international waters suspected of trafficking narcotics. The strike, which occurred in the Caribbean, reportedly killed three individuals described by the president as "narcoterrorists." This action follows a new policy that categorizes drug cartels as terrorist organizations, legally paving the way for the use of military force. The approach is a significant departure from previous methods that relied on law enforcement interdiction and has drawn criticism regarding its legal justification.</p>
