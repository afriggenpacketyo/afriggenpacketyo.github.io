          <h2>Nvidia CEO Urges Japan to Invest in Power Infrastructure for AI Development</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 02:11:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with Japanese officials to discuss the country's potential in AI development, particularly given its strengths in robotics and manufacturing. Huang emphasized that generating intelligence requires significant energy, and Japan needs to invest in new infrastructure to support this growth. Resource-poor Japan is currently balancing the energy demands of data centers with the challenges of restarting nuclear reactors and increasing fossil fuel imports. The discussion also touched on Japan potentially investing in a US$44 billion liquefied natural gas project in Alaska to secure energy resources.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has significantly reduced its exports of critical metals to the United States, impacting US manufacturers who rely on these materials for various products, including smartphones and military equipment. This move is seen as retaliation for US tariffs on Chinese goods, with exports of tellurium and tungsten products experiencing substantial declines or complete halts. China holds a dominant position in the rare earths supply chain, giving it strategic leverage in the trade war. The US-bound shipments of several critical metals fell dramatically in March, according to data released over the weekend.</p>

Khalil's wife, Dr. Noor Abdalla, expressed her distress that her son's first days were being navigated without his father due to ICE's actions.

          <p>CATL, the world's largest supplier of EV batteries, has announced its second-generation Shenxing battery, claiming it can add 520 km (323 miles) of driving range with just five minutes of charging. This announcement positions CATL ahead of BYD, which recently claimed to add 400 km of range in about 5 minutes. If proven feasible on a larger scale, CATL's technology could alleviate consumer concerns about EV range and convenience, putting them ahead of competitors like Tesla and Mercedes-Benz in charging speeds. This rapid charging technology is designed to address range anxiety and make electric vehicles more appealing to consumers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar has fallen below 140 yen for the first time in seven months following criticism from President Donald Trump regarding Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's handling of interest rates. Trump accused Powell of not reducing interest rates preemptively, which put downward pressure on the dollar. Speculation that the US administration will urge Japan to address the yen's weakness during upcoming finance chief meetings in Washington also contributed to the dollar's decline. This currency movement reflects broader economic and political pressures affecting global markets.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students whose student statuses were allegedly unlawfully revoked. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and other groups, claims that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) abruptly terminated records on the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), making the students deportable. The lawsuit argues that ICE's actions were designed to coerce students into abandoning their studies and self-deporting, despite not violating their status. A hearing is scheduled to further discuss the matter.</p>

Harvard President Alan Garber stated that the university would not comply with these demands, leading to the funding freeze.

          <p>The UK government will publish data on the nationalities of foreign criminals living in the country for the first time. This decision follows pressure from the Conservatives, who argued that mass migration fuels crime. Official data indicates that over 19,000 foreign offenders were awaiting deportation at the end of last year. The Home Office aims to better inform the public about the number, origin, and crimes committed by foreign criminals awaiting deportation.</p>

The trend has seen some central banks cut rates to boost growth, though others are hesitant due to inflation and debt concerns. (not investment advice)</p>
