        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns, President Trump's tariffs have not significantly impacted inflation readings, with consumer and producer prices remaining stable in May. Several factors have contributed to this, including companies stockpiling imported goods before tariff announcements, the delayed effect of tariffs on the economy, and limited pricing power due to cautious consumer spending. Economist Aichi Amemiya from Nomura suggests the limited tariff impact in May is due to pre-tariff stockpiling and a delayed pass-through into import prices. The expectation is that the impact of tariffs will become more evident in the coming months as existing stockpiles are depleted and companies begin to pass on the higher costs to consumers.

          <p>Harvey Weinstein's retrial in New York concluded with a mistrial declared on the remaining charge of third-degree sexual assault after the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict. This development followed a partial verdict where Weinstein was found guilty of criminal sexual assault against one woman and not guilty of criminal sexual assault against another. The jury foreperson had previously expressed concerns about feeling threatened by another juror, highlighting the tense deliberations. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg announced his office's intention to retry the sexual assault charge, emphasizing the need for justice and accountability. The judge thanked the jury for their time and said the decision to declare a mistrial did not reflect on them.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Debt settlement can be a viable option for individuals struggling with overwhelming debt, but it's crucial to understand when it makes sense and when it doesn't. Accepting a debt settlement offer may be wise if you've fallen significantly behind on payments and can't realistically catch up, have access to a lump sum of cash, or are considering bankruptcy. However, it's not advisable if you can still manage payments, the tax implications outweigh the savings, or you haven't explored all alternative debt relief options. Understanding your financial situation and weighing all options is essential before agreeing to any debt settlement. (not investment advice)</p>

The study indicates that tipping rates are generally higher in states where people dine out more frequently. The average tipping rate in New Hampshire is 16.07%, while in Utah it is only 4.09%. The study also highlights the increasing trend of Americans spending more on dining out, with such expenditures representing approximately 56% of their food budgets in 2023. The study also mentions that the federal minimum wage for tipped workers is $2.13 per hour, meaning that tips are vital for service industry workers.</p>

California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta filed an emergency request to block the expansion of what they call an "unlawful militarization." The request seeks to prevent the use of federalized National Guard and active duty Marines beyond protecting federal buildings and property.

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled that innocent victims of wrong-house raids and other abuses by federal law enforcement can seek compensation for emotional and physical harms. The decision revives a lawsuit brought by a family whose home was mistakenly raided by the FBI, causing trauma and property damage. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote that the Federal Tort Claims Act permits suits for wrong-house raids involving assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, or abuse of process. The case has been remanded to a lower court for further consideration, and civil rights advocates say there are likely hundreds of cases of wrong-house raids every year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) indicates that the GOP's massive tax and spending bill would disproportionately benefit the highest-paid workers, while negatively impacting low-income families. The bill includes over $3 trillion in tax cuts and about $1 trillion in reduced government spending on programs like Medicaid and food stamps. Families earning less than $55,000 a year would experience a net loss due to benefit cutbacks outweighing any tax savings. The CBO director notes that the changes would not be evenly distributed, with resources decreasing for households at the bottom of the income distribution and increasing for those at the top.

Over the past five years, the foundation's assets have increased from $828 million to over $9.1 billion. This growth is primarily attributed to Nvidia shares donated to the foundation. The foundation is now one of the 15 largest private foundations in the U.S., rivaling well-established philanthropies. The increase in assets will also lead to a growth in charitable giving, with the foundation required to distribute at least 5% of its assets per year.</p>

          <p>As Robert F. Kennedy Jr. takes on the role of Secretary of Health and Human Services, there's a growing call for him to ban ractopamine hydrochloride, a controversial drug fed to pigs to accelerate muscle gain. The drug has been linked to adverse events in pigs, including trembling, inability to stand, and difficulty breathing, and has also raised environmental and human health concerns. While over 165 countries have banned or restricted ractopamine, the FDA continues to allow its use in meat production, citing a "reasonable certainty of no harm to consumers." Critics argue that banning ractopamine would be a significant step towards challenging the factory farm system.</p>
