          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, marking a significant diplomatic engagement after years of strained relations following border clashes. While deep-seated suspicion remains, both nations are exploring potential economic cooperation, partly driven by shared challenges like U.S. tariffs. Despite positive signals such as the resumption of direct flights, significant hurdles including a large trade deficit and China's close ties with Pakistan temper expectations for a long-term strategic partnership. The meeting will test whether mutual economic interests can override persistent geopolitical friction.</p>

          <p>A former Department of Justice employee, Sean Charles Dunn, now faces a misdemeanor assault charge for allegedly throwing a sandwich at a federal officer in Washington, D.C. Prosecutors had initially sought a more severe felony indictment, but a grand jury declined to issue one. The incident occurred as Dunn allegedly shouted profanities at a group of federal officers deployed by the Trump administration to address crime in the city. This case marks the second recent instance where federal prosecutors in D.C. have failed to secure a desired indictment against individuals accused of assaulting federal agents.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered a new trial for three former Memphis police officers convicted of obstruction in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols. The decision was based on arguments that the previous judge, Mark S. Norris, exhibited bias by expressing a belief that at least one officer was involved in a gang. This ruling is a significant setback for the prosecution in a case that has drawn national attention to police brutality. The new trial date has not yet been set, and the order reopens a painful chapter for the community and the victim's family.</p>

They argue that public comments from senior officials, including President Trump and the DHS Secretary, who have labeled Abrego Garcia an "animal" and a gang member, are tainting the jury pool and jeopardizing his right to a fair trial. The request for a gag order follows a previous judicial warning against extrajudicial comments that the attorneys claim government officials have continued to ignore.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones addressed the media to explain the surprising trade of star linebacker Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers. Jones asserted that the move gives the Cowboys a "chance to be a better team," both immediately and in the future, by addressing key weaknesses. As part of the deal, Dallas acquired Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark to bolster its run defense, along with two future first-round draft picks. Jones stated that contract negotiations with Parsons had stalled and that the trade was a consensus decision within the organization to improve the overall roster.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, the city of Biloxi, Mississippi, is still entangled in a dispute with FEMA over funding needed to complete its recovery projects. Mayor Andrew Gilich states that the federal agency still owes the city $34 million for critical infrastructure upgrades, particularly to its sewage and stormwater systems, but has denied requests for increased funds to cover rising costs. This lengthy delay is emblematic of broader issues, with hundreds of other Katrina relief projects across the region remaining unfinished. The situation highlights ongoing frustrations with the federal disaster response bureaucracy.</p>

          <p>California fire investigators are examining whether Hundred Acre, a renowned Napa Valley winery, may have played a role in starting the 6,800-acre Pickett fire. A spokesperson for the winery confirmed cooperation with the investigation, which reportedly centers on the possibility that discarded ashes from the vineyard ignited the blaze. The fire, which started on the winery's property, has threatened hundreds of buildings and prompted widespread evacuations in the region. While the official cause remains under investigation, the focus on the high-profile winery adds a significant new dimension to the incident.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is altering its long-standing "customer of size" policy, which advocates say will create new financial and logistical barriers for plus-size travelers. The airline will no longer guarantee a refund for a second purchased seat, making reimbursement conditional on the flight having at least one open seat upon departure. Previously, Southwest offered a guaranteed refund, a policy that was praised for promoting accessibility and dignity. Critics and community advocates argue that this change, combined with the airline's upcoming shift to assigned seating, represents a significant reversal of its inclusive reputation.</p>

This incident, which resulted in at least 20 fatalities, has drawn widespread international condemnation.

          <p>The UK government proceeded with a major reorganization of local councils in England without commissioning its own independent cost-benefit analysis, a BBC investigation has learned. The Ministry of Local Government based its projected savings of £2.9 billion on a 2020 report from the County Council Network (CCN). However, the CCN has since revised its analysis, now suggesting the mergers could result in no savings or even cost money, depending on the structure of the new authorities. Critics find it astonishing that such a significant overhaul was undertaken without a dedicated government review of its financial implications.</p>

The refugees, who had been living in Delhi, claim their hands were bound and faces covered before being forced into the water with life jackets near the Myanmar coast.

          <p>Canadian officials have issued a warning after an angler discovered an exceptionally large, 26-kilogram grass carp in Lake Huron, a species highly invasive to the Great Lakes ecosystem. Although the captured fish was sterile and unable to reproduce, its presence underscores the ongoing threat these fish pose to native habitats. Grass carp are voracious eaters of aquatic vegetation, capable of destroying wetlands, degrading water quality, and harming native fish populations. Authorities are urging the public to report any sightings and not to release any captured invasive carp back into the water.</p>

          <p>A recent survey of U.S. consumers indicates that Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology is more likely to dissuade potential buyers than to attract them. According to the report, 35% of respondents said FSD would make them less likely to purchase a Tesla, compared to only 14% who viewed it as a positive feature. The findings present a challenge for Tesla, as CEO Elon Musk has positioned the company's future on the success of its autonomous vehicle technology. This consumer skepticism comes amid a sales slump for the company and growing concerns about the safety and marketing of its automated driving systems. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Trump administration official Kari Lake cannot legally fire Michael Abramowitz, the director of Voice of America (VOA). The judge stated that by law, such a removal requires the backing of a congressionally established advisory panel, which President Trump effectively dissolved by dismissing most of its members. The ruling is a significant check on the administration's efforts to exert political control over the federally funded international broadcaster. The court found that the attempts to remove Abramowitz, either through firing or a forced reassignment, were in clear violation of statutory requirements designed to protect VOA's independence.</p>
