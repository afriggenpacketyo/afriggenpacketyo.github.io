            <p>Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of violating the 30-hour "Easter truce" declared by Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed Russian troops shelled over 2,000 times since Sunday, while Russia's defense ministry said it repelled Ukrainian assaults. Donald Trump expressed hope for a deal between the two countries this week. The BBC has not independently verified the claims by either side, but this highlights the continued conflict and mistrust despite attempts at de-escalation. Optimism score: 20</p>

            <p>Senator Amy Klobuchar called for the Supreme Court to hold Trump administration officials in contempt for ignoring a court order regarding the deportation of Kilmar Ábrego García. She suggested appointing a special prosecutor to charge officials responsible for the deportation or refusal to facilitate his return. This follows Justice Alito's dissenting opinion on a related case, criticizing the court's decision to block deportations of Venezuelans.

            <p>Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee warned that President Trump's tariffs could lead to a summer drop-off in economic activity after an "artificially high" start.
