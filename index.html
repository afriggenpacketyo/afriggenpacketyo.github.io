          <p>During a game against the Las Vegas Raiders, Washington Commanders head coach Dan Quinn was inadvertently run over by his own quarterback, Marcus Mariota, who was pushed out of bounds. The collision left Quinn with a bloody nose, but he confirmed to the broadcast team that he was okay and able to continue coaching. The incident occurred in a game the Commanders went on to win decisively, 41-24, with Mariota starting in place of the injured Jayden Daniels and delivering a strong performance with both a passing and rushing touchdown.</p>

This development comes as the White House pushes for a deal to divest the popular social media app from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, due to national security concerns. The proposed arrangement would see U.S. interests control the app's data, privacy, and algorithm, though China has maintained that any deal must comply with its own laws and regulations.</p>

Federal health officials are expected to issue a warning for pregnant women to avoid the painkiller unless necessary for a fever. This move, championed by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has been met with strong opposition from Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, which asserts there is no credible scientific evidence for such a link and warns of the health risks posed by discouraging a safe fever-reducing option.</p>

The building was struck by at least three rounds, shattering a window, though no injuries were reported among the staff. The motive for the attack is still under investigation, but it occurred during a week when ABC faced controversy over its suspension of host Jimmy Kimmel following his comments on the death of Charlie Kirk.

          <p>In the wake of the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has urged Americans to universally condemn political violence, regardless of its source. Speaking on NBC's 'Meet the Press,' Shapiro described the nation as being at an 'inflection point' and called for healing and unity over division. He referenced his own experience with a firebombing at the governor's mansion as well as other violent political acts, emphasizing that while most political speech is protected, incitement to violence is not and leaves lasting scars on society.</p>

          <p>Nationals outfielder Jacob Young made two extraordinary defensive plays that were crucial in his team's 3-2 victory over the New York Mets. In the fifth inning, Young prevented an extra-base hit with a juggling, 'hacky-sack' style catch, kicking the ball back into the air with his foot after it was jarred from his glove at the wall. Later, in the ninth inning, he made a leaping grab to rob Francisco Álvarez of a potential game-tying home run.

The project aims to increase the airport's capacity from 280,000 to 389,000 flights per year, which supporters claim will boost economic growth and create jobs. However, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental groups and local campaigners concerned about the significant increase in noise, traffic, and carbon emissions.

Researchers from the UC Davis California Carnivores Program successfully placed a GPS collar on one of the cubs to monitor her progress.

The storm's immense strength is attributed to ideal conditions, including very warm sea surface temperatures near 30°C and a lack of wind shear.

          <p>According to multiple sources, the Department of Justice under the Trump administration shut down a public corruption investigation into Tom Homan, the president's 'border czar.' The probe allegedly involved an FBI sting operation where agents, posing as business executives, recorded Homan accepting a bag containing $50,000 in cash. The investigation, which began under the previous administration, was reportedly closed after being handed over to Trump's DOJ, raising concerns among some officials about the politicization of the department and the protection of high-profile allies from legal scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Gary Cohn, who served as National Economic Council director in the Trump administration, has stated that the U.S. job market is degrading, a trend he says the Federal Reserve has also acknowledged. He attributes the slowdown in job creation to companies aggressively cutting labor costs in response to rising expenses and the end of post-COVID labor hoarding. Cohn noted that firms are now letting their workforces decline naturally through attrition to protect their profit margins, a shift from the recent past where retaining employees was a primary concern.

          <p>President Trump appeared to dismiss concerns over a new Pentagon directive that severely curtails journalists' ability to report on the U.S. military. The new rules require reporters to pledge not to gather any information not officially authorized for release, or risk losing their press credentials. When asked about the policy, Trump said, 'Nothing stops reporters,' downplaying the impact of the restrictions. The move by the recently rebranded Department of War has been strongly condemned by press freedom organizations as a direct assault on independent journalism and government transparency.</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan has initiated a one-day trial banning traffic from a half-mile stretch of the iconic Oxford Street, calling it the day 'the fight back began to rescue this street.' The event is a glimpse into the mayor's broader plan to permanently pedestrianize the area between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch to increase footfall and improve the shopping experience. However, the proposal has raised concerns from some local groups about the potential for traffic congestion on smaller side streets and reduced accessibility for individuals with mobility issues.</p>

The jets monitored and photographed the aircraft before it continued on its way, with the incident ending without conflict. The interception comes amid heightened vigilance by NATO and EU nations regarding Russian military activity in the region.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has labeled public criticism from U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner as 'unacceptable for somebody who is supposed to be a diplomat.' Kushner had published a letter accusing Macron's government of insufficient action against antisemitism and linking its foreign policy, including gestures toward Palestinian statehood, to endangering Jewish life in France. Macron firmly rejected the assertions, stating that disagreeing with the Israeli government's policies does not make one antisemitic and that such public interference in domestic affairs violates diplomatic norms.</p>
