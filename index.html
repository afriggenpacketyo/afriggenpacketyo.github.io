          <p>Pakistan has accused India of launching air-to-surface missiles targeting multiple air bases, escalating the conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations after weeks of tension following a terrorist attack in Kashmir. The Pakistani military spokesperson condemned the attacks, stating India is pushing the region towards a dangerous war and promising a response. The conflict has intensified with both sides using drones and engaging in gunfire exchanges, leading to civilian casualties and prompting diplomatic pressure from Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Residents near the border are stocking up on supplies, fearing further escalation and potential shortages, while both countries have suspended cricket leagues due to safety concerns.

The judge criticized the government for lacking evidence against her, highlighting her academic commitment and peaceful character.

          <p>Rich Trumka Jr., a commissioner of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), was fired by President Trump and has declared his intention to challenge the dismissal in court, claiming it is illegal. Trumka states his firing occurred after he and two other commissioners opposed allowing members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to work at the agency, fearing they would undermine product safety. Consumer Reports and several Democratic senators have condemned the firings, calling them an attack on the independence of the CPSC, which regulates consumer product safety. DOGE has faced criticism for mistakenly firing essential workers and incurring costs due to legal challenges and lost productivity. Optimism score is 40.</p>

Despite ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the event emphasized Russia's global alliances and its commitment to a new democratic world order.

          <p>As trade tensions between the U.S. and China escalate, analysts are raising concerns about China's potential use of its economic power to destabilize the American housing market. China holds over $1.2 trillion in U.S. mortgage-backed securities (MBS), representing 15% of outstanding mortgage balances, and flooding the market with these securities could trigger higher interest rates and a chain reaction from other nations. Guy Cecala of Inside Mortgage Finance suggests that targeting housing and mortgage rates could be a powerful pressure tactic, while the possibility of Canada and Japan joining China's orbit adds further uncertainty.

          <p>White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller stated that the Trump administration is actively considering suspending habeas corpus for migrants, a move that would curtail the constitutional right to challenge detention in court. Miller justified the potential suspension by arguing that the U.S. faces a national security threat from undocumented migrants "invading" the country. Legal experts contend that only Congress can suspend habeas corpus, and a president cannot do so unilaterally.

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated an investigation into the import of commercial aircraft, jet engines, and related parts, potentially leading to new tariffs under the Trade Expansion Act. The Commerce Department will seek industry input on demand, the role of foreign suppliers, and government favoritism. Tariffs could harm the aerospace industry, which relies on a global supply chain and has a large trade surplus. While Boeing has described the direct effects of existing tariffs as minor, RTX and GE Aerospace estimate significant costs this year. Optimism score is 50.</p>

          <p>White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller said the Trump administration is "actively looking at" suspending the writ of habeas corpus for migrants, which is the constitutional right to challenge in court the legality of a person's detention by the government. Miller justified the potential suspension by arguing the United States is currently facing a national security threat by undocumented migrants "invading" the United States. Miller said that Trump's decision on whether to suspend the writ of habeas corpus "depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not." The writ has been suspended only four times since the U.S. Constitution was ratified. Optimism score is 20.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student, was released from immigration detention after a federal judge ruled her continued detention could chill the speech of millions of noncitizens. Ozturk, a doctoral student from Turkey, had been held at the immigration detention center in Basile, La., for six weeks. Her lawyers accused the government of detaining her in retaliation for speech that is protected by the First Amendment, specifically an essay critical of Israel that she helped to write in a Tufts student newspaper last year.
