          <p>The United States has announced it possesses "credible reports" indicating that Hamas is planning an imminent attack on Palestinian civilians within Gaza. A State Department statement warned that such an action would represent a severe violation of the current ceasefire agreement and would undermine recent mediation efforts. The US has informed other guarantor nations, including Egypt and Qatar, and stated that measures would be taken to protect Gaza's population if the attack proceeds. Hamas has rejected the American claims as false, even as it re-establishes control in the region following a partial Israeli withdrawal.</p>

          <p>Researchers have identified the Nazi perpetrator in a well-known Holocaust photograph, previously titled "The Last Jew in Vinnitsa," with 99% certainty. German historian Jürgen Matthäus, aided by public tips and AI-based facial recognition, determined the gunman is likely Jakobus Onnen, a member of the Nazi Einsatzgruppe C. The photo, now known to have been taken in Berdychiv, Ukraine, in July 1941, was discovered in higher quality within a German soldier's war diaries. While the murderer's identity has been established, the victim kneeling at the mass grave remains anonymous, a common tragedy of the Holocaust in Eastern Europe.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In her new memoir and at a recent summit, former Vice President Kamala Harris described former President Joe Biden's decision to exclude Elon Musk from a 2021 White House electric vehicle event as a "big mistake." Harris argued that despite Tesla's non-unionized workforce, it was illogical to snub the nation's leading EV manufacturer, suggesting the move alienated Musk. The original exclusion was widely seen as a gesture of support for the United Auto Workers union, as the event only featured executives from GM, Ford, and Stellantis. Harris believes the decision had a lasting negative impact on Musk's perspective, who later became a major financial backer for Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>New media reports allege that Prince Andrew attempted to use his police protection detail in 2011 to gather personal information on his accuser, Virginia Giuffre. These claims emerge as King Charles faces calls to strip Andrew of his "prince" title, following Andrew's decision to relinquish his other royal titles and honors. Giuffre, who alleged she was sexually exploited by Jeffrey Epstein's circle and forced to have sex with the prince, settled a civil case against him in 2022. The ongoing revelations and the upcoming posthumous publication of Giuffre's memoir are intensifying pressure on the Royal Family regarding Andrew's conduct.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the United States of committing "murder" and violating his country's sovereignty after a US strike on a boat in Colombian territorial waters. Petro stated the vessel was adrift with a distress signal due to engine failure when it was attacked. The accusation follows President Donald Trump's announcement that the US had struck a "drug-carrying submarine," killing two people. This incident is the latest in a series of deadly US strikes in the Caribbean targeting suspected drug traffickers, which have killed at least 27 people and have been described by UN experts as "extrajudicial executions."</p>

          <p>Large crowds gathered in major US cities for "No Kings" protests, demonstrating against what they view as an unconstitutional expansion of presidential power by the Trump administration. Demonstrators in New York, Washington D.C., and elsewhere voiced concerns over the use of executive orders to dismantle federal agencies and deploy the National Guard without governors' consent. Organizers insisted the events were peaceful, despite some allies of the president attempting to link them with far-left movements. President Trump has dismissed accusations of behaving like a dictator, stating his actions are necessary to address a national crisis, while critics warn of a slide toward authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>Despite a significant summer spending spree, Liverpool's recent run of losses may be linked to the less obvious impacts of Trent Alexander-Arnold's departure to Real Madrid. This article analyzes how the team is missing his unique on-ball quality, particularly his ability to bypass high-pressure defenses with both short and long passes, including with his weaker foot. His absence has diminished Liverpool's capacity for quick, central build-up play and cross-field switches, forcing creative midfielders like Florian Wirtz into deeper, less effective roles. The team's reduced effectiveness in breaking down compact defensive blocks highlights a tactical void left by the influential right-back's exit.</p>

          <p>Several major companies, including Accenture, Lufthansa, and Salesforce, have recently announced significant job cuts, attributing the restructuring to increased efficiency from artificial intelligence. However, some experts, like Fabian Stephany from the Oxford Internet Institute, are skeptical, suggesting that AI is being used as a "good excuse" for layoffs that are actually due to other business reasons, such as overhiring during the pandemic. Critics argue this narrative fuels employee anxiety about AI, while research from institutions like Yale and the New York Fed indicates that AI has not yet caused widespread job disruption. This article explores the debate over whether AI is a genuine driver of current workforce reductions. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>It is common for sexual desire to decrease after the initial passionate phase of a relationship, a phenomenon explained by both hormonal changes and psychological factors. According to couple's therapist Andrea Seiferth, the transition from lust-driven hormones to bonding hormones like oxytocin naturally dampens sex drive over time. For heterosexual women, a disconnect between physical and psychological arousal, often influenced by societal messaging and a lack of prioritized pleasure, can further reduce libido. Experts emphasize that open communication about sexual needs, along with consistent physical affection outside of sex, is crucial for maintaining intimacy and satisfaction in long-term partnerships.</p>

          <p>China's largest airlines, including China Eastern, are now offering free basic Wi-Fi on an increasing number of domestic routes to win back business travelers from the country's extensive high-speed train network. The move is a direct competitive response to the convenience and connectivity offered by rail travel, which has become a preferred option for many professionals. By providing in-flight internet service, airlines hope to attract passengers who wish to remain productive while traveling between major cities like Beijing and Shanghai. This new amenity reflects the intense competition for domestic travelers in China's advanced transportation market.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen capitalized on a disastrous sprint race for McLaren at the United States Grand Prix, cruising to victory after McLaren drivers Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris crashed into each other at the first corner. The incident allowed Verstappen to gain significant points on both his championship rivals, intensifying what McLaren boss Zak Brown had predicted would be a "brutal" title fight. Verstappen further asserted his dominance by securing pole position for the main Grand Prix. While McLaren has been strong this season, Verstappen's relentless form is eroding their drivers' championship leads, making the remainder of the season a tense battle.</p>
