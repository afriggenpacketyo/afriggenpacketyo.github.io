            <p>Japan's Fair Trade Commission issued a cease and desist order to Google for violating anti-monopoly laws. The JFTC found Google required Android device manufacturers to prioritize Google's search apps and services as a condition of licensing agreements. These agreements, in effect as of December 2024, forced manufacturers to pre-install and prominently feature Google Search and Chrome, excluding rival search services to benefit from Google's advertising revenue-sharing model. This action aligns with similar antitrust crackdowns on Google in the UK and the US.</p>

            <p>Ryan Routh, accused of attempting to assassinate President Trump at his Florida golf club, has been granted permission by a federal judge to hire an expert to examine the recovered rifle. However, the judge limited the examination to determining the rifle's operability, setting a May 15 deadline. Routh, who pleaded not guilty, faces charges of attempted assassination and firearm offenses. Prosecutors allege Routh plotted for weeks to kill Trump, aiming a rifle at him before being stopped by a Secret Service agent.

            <p>Premier Li Qiang has called for stronger efforts to boost domestic demand in China and for exporters to diversify their markets, aiming to mitigate external risks amid rising trade tensions with the United States. The premier acknowledged 'profound changes' in the external environment, posing challenges for China's exports. To counter these challenges, China plans to shift its economic focus towards the domestic market, aiming to hedge against external shocks.

            <p>A group of Pacific Palisades and Malibu residents, all over 70, are suing the city of Los Angeles, alleging the Department of Water and Power failed to prevent and contain the January wildfire that destroyed their homes. The plaintiffs claim the city should have ensured reservoirs were filled and fire hydrants were operational. The lawsuit also alleges the DWP ignored wind warnings and kept electrical equipment energized, contributing to the fire's spread. The plaintiffs seek compensation for the loss of their property, with the city of L.A. facing multiple similar cases.</p>

            <p>Brown pelicans in Southern California are filling up wildlife rehabilitation centers, either sick from domoic acid or starving. The domoic acid, a neurotoxin produced in harmful algal blooms, is consumed by fish and affects seabirds and marine mammals. As more adult pelicans become sick, more baby pelicans are left to fend for themselves, leaving their nests prematurely. Officials believe runoff from the Los Angeles firestorm likely elevated this year's bloom, with climate change also contributing to the growth of harmful algae blooms.</p>

            <p>Nvidia expects a $5.5 billion hit due to tightened US export rules to China, requiring licenses for its H20 AI chip. The rules come amid an escalating trade war between the US and China, impacting Nvidia's most popular chip in China. The US government indicated the license requirement addresses the risk of covered products being used in supercomputers in China. Analysts suggest this move could be a negotiating tactic, potentially leading to changes in tariff policy. (not investment advice)</p>
