          <p>Shedeur Sanders, son of NFL legend Deion Sanders, experienced a dramatic slide in the NFL draft, eventually being picked by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round after being widely projected as a first-round pick. Analysts cited concerns about his size and arm strength as potential reasons for the drop. The Browns' decision to draft Sanders was unexpected, considering they had already selected a quarterback in an earlier round. The team is facing uncertainty at the quarterback position due to an injury to their starter, Deshaun Watson, potentially creating an opportunity for Sanders to compete for playing time.</p>

The Browns, who had already drafted a quarterback earlier in the draft, took Sanders, adding him to a quarterback room that includes veterans and another recent draftee.

Coach JJ Redick acknowledged the team's lack of rim protection, suggesting they must compensate with physicality and multiple defensive efforts. With their series deficit, the Lakers must find a way to address their size disadvantage to avoid an early playoff exit.</p>

          <p>Analyst Craig Moffett questions the feasibility of Apple's reported plans to move iPhone assembly from China to India, suggesting it may not significantly reduce costs due to continued reliance on Chinese-made components. Moffett also anticipates potential backlash against Apple in China due to U.S. tariffs, which could negatively impact iPhone sales. He notes that carriers are unlikely to absorb tariff costs, potentially leading to higher prices and decreased consumer demand. Moffett has a 'sell' rating on Apple and a price target significantly below the current market price, citing valuation concerns and potential economic headwinds.</p>

There is also a decline in voter confidence regarding his handling of critical issues such as the economy and immigration.
