          <p>Sunderland has made an "unbelievable start" to the Premier League season, securing 17 points from nine matches and sitting second in the table. This defies expectations for a newly promoted side, especially given their record spending on 15 new players. Coach Regis le Bris attributes their success to a strong team identity, defensive organization, and commitment without the ball, highlighted by influential recruit Granit Xhaka. Their performance suggests a strong challenge to the typical struggles of promoted teams.</p>

The independent candidate, backed by major left-wing parties, pledged to be an inclusive president for all, advocating for peace, neutrality, and addressing climate change. Her opponent, Heather Humphreys, conceded gracefully, acknowledging Connolly's clear mandate. This election marks a significant moment for Irish politics.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral chart claiming the UK is Europe's "sexual assault capital" is misleading, according to a DW fact check. The article explains that cross-country comparisons of sexual assault statistics are problematic due to differing legal definitions, reporting practices, and cultural factors. Experts recommend victim surveys over police reports for a more accurate measure, as the UK's high recorded rate largely reflects its consent-based legal framework and robust reporting. Claims linking immigration to increased sexual assault rates are also deemed false.</p>

          <p>Ladakh is grappling with deep mistrust towards the Indian central government following deadly protests for greater autonomy and statehood. Locals, including those arrested, express frustration over unfulfilled promises and being labeled "anti-national." The discontent stems from India revoking Jammu and Kashmir's special status in 2019, which carved out Ladakh as a union territory. Analysts warn that alienating this strategically vital border population risks national security, as the region borders China and Pakistan.</p>

          <p>The Octagon, a 10,000-square-foot historic home completed in 1801 in Washington D.C., offers a glimpse into early American history. Designed by William Thornton, the first U.S. Capitol architect, it served as a temporary White House for President James Madison after the original was burned. The home, now a museum, is also known for its numerous reported paranormal activities, with staff humorously attributing unexplained occurrences to "friends playing." Currently undergoing renovations, The Octagon will play a part in America's 250th Independence celebration.</p>

When factoring in inflation, transaction costs, and renovations, the actual loss rate is likely higher, contrasting sharply with national home price increases. Experts attribute Manhattan's "lost decade" to factors like tax deduction caps and earlier rent laws. However, the luxury market saw double-digit profits, driven by wealthy cash buyers and strong financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>
