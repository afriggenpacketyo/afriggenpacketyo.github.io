          <p>The United States is set to partially evacuate its embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, due to increasing security risks, with non-essential staff and their families being removed. This decision follows reports that Israel is prepared to launch an operation into Iran, raising concerns about potential Iranian retaliation against U.S. sites in Iraq. The U.S. State Department has also restricted staff movements within Israel, citing heightened regional tensions, even as U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff plans to meet with Iranian officials to discuss the nuclear program. The situation unfolds as nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iran stall, prompting worries about Iran's nuclear ambitions and possible military strikes. </p>

          <p>The UK economy experienced a sharp contraction of 0.3% in April, according to the Office for National Statistics, following a 0.2% growth in March. The decline is attributed to the implementation of global trade tariffs announced by U.S. President Donald Trump and domestic tax increases. Industrial production and services output saw significant declines, while construction output increased, with the tariffs impacting UK exports. The UK was subjected to a 10% "reciprocal tariff" by the U.S., although it escaped a higher 20% levy imposed on EU exports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump Administration has signaled that tariffs are not going away, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirming this stance. With the current 90-day pause on many tariffs set to expire, American consumers are advised to prepare for potential price increases. Financial experts recommend slashing spending, deepening emergency funds, investing in inflation-resilient assets, and seeking opportunities to earn more. By taking proactive steps, consumers can mitigate the impact of rising prices resulting from the ongoing tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite its flaws, “Smart Girls” highlights Wilson’s openness to rap and his willingness to enlist expert help from Matt Dike. Wilson's experimentation with various musical styles has resulted in some of the greatest pieces of music, even if “Smart Girls” is not among them. </p>

          <p>Claims that the proposed “Big Beautiful Bill” will generate substantial economic growth are overstated, despite assertions from President Trump and allies. While extending the expiring provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may provide modest economic benefits, it is primarily a defensive move rather than a catalyst for significant new growth. The bill includes various tax breaks and spending hikes that are not pro-growth, and it is projected to add $2.4 trillion to the national debt. The negative consequences of ballooning federal debt, coupled with the ongoing trade wars, will likely outweigh any modest growth achieved by the tax bill. (not investment advice)</p>
