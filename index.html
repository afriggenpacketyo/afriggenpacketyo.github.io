He highlighted Tron's efficiency, processing transactions in seconds compared to Swift's days-long timeframe, and projected that Tron's transaction volume could reach US$8 trillion this year. Sun also praised Hong Kong for its progressive stance on cryptocurrency, seeing it as a key hub for the virtual asset sector's future growth and innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Demonstrators in cities across Mexico have taken to the streets to demand justice and government action for the more than 130,000 people who have been reported missing. Most of these disappearances have occurred since the "war on drugs" began in 2007, with drug cartels and organized crime groups being the primary perpetrators, though security forces are also implicated. The protests, led by relatives and human rights activists, highlight a crisis the United Nations has called "a human tragedy of enormous proportions," surpassing the tolls of some of Latin America's historical conflicts.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles City Councilmember Ysabel Jurado has publicly opposed plans for a new Home Depot in Eagle Rock, accusing the company of being complicit in federal immigration raids. The opposition follows several operations by federal agents targeting day laborers and vendors in the parking lots of other Home Depot locations, including a recent raid where agents used tear gas. Immigrant rights groups have condemned the raids as acts of terror, while Home Depot has stated it is not notified of planned ICE operations and is required to follow all federal regulations.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed a largely symbolic executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights amid reports of a potential deployment of federal agents for immigration enforcement. The "Protecting Chicago Initiative" prohibits city police from cooperating with federal immigration actions and seeks to bar federal agents from wearing masks while requiring them to display identifying information. The order is a pre-emptive measure against what the mayor's office calls potential unconstitutional federal overreach, though its legal power to compel federal agents is limited.</p>

          <p>In Iowa's 34-7 season-opening victory against Albany, head coach Kirk Ferentz secured his 205th win with the program, moving him into a tie with Ohio State's Woody Hayes as the Big Ten conference's all-time winningest coach. The Hawkeyes' offense, led by a strong running game, dominated the match, with freshman Xavier Williams rushing for 122 yards and a touchdown. Ferentz, who is in his 27th season at Iowa, is the longest-tenured active head coach in college football and humbly downplayed the historic achievement after the game.</p>

          <p>In a reflective article on the death of Google executive Forrest Hayes, the author questions the distribution of blame solely on Alix Tichelman, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. The piece suggests that Hayes was an active participant who created the situation by arranging the meeting on his yacht and asking to be injected with heroin. The author posits that if Tichelman had been the one to overdose, it is unlikely Hayes would have faced the same legal consequences, framing the case as a complex ethical dilemma about shared responsibility rather than a simple criminal act.</p>

          <p>A 10-year-old boy, Weston Halsne, who survived the mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis, has been found to have a bullet fragment lodged in his neck. The fragment is dangerously close to an artery and will require surgery for removal. Halsne had previously recounted how his friend saved his life by acting as a human shield during the attack that killed two other children. His family has started a GoFundMe to help with the unexpected medical expenses as he continues his long road to recovery.</p>

          <p>The BBC is introducing a new dating show, "Stranded on Honeymoon Island," which combines elements of "Married at First Sight" and "Survivor." Hosted by Davina McCall, the series matches couples who, after a brief speed date, are "married" and sent to a remote tropical island where they must survive together in basic conditions. The show's premise is to test whether love can blossom under extreme adversity, stripping away the superficial elements of modern dating to focus on authentic connection and resilience.</p>

          <p>The planned loan of the nearly 1,000-year-old Bayeux Tapestry to the British Museum has drawn fierce opposition from experts in the French art world. They fear the 70-meter-long embroidered cloth, which depicts the Norman conquest of England, is too fragile to be transported without risking irreparable damage. The loan was announced by French President Emmanuel Macron as an act of cultural diplomacy, but critics resent what they see as a high-handed political gesture that overrides the advice of conservation specialists.</p>

          <p>Scientists in the United Kingdom are using an innovative arsenal, including drones and sniffer dogs, to combat the spread of the invasive spruce bark beetle. This pest has devastated millions of spruce trees across Europe and poses a multi-billion pound threat to the UK's timber industry. After discovering that the beetles were being carried over the English Channel by wind, a targeted effort has successfully eradicated them from at-risk areas in southeast England, though climate change could make future containment more challenging.</p>

          <p>Data from the 2024-25 school year in England suggests that attendance during the first week of term is a strong predictor of future absenteeism. According to the Department for Education, over half of the pupils who missed some school in the first week went on to be "persistently absent," meaning they missed at least 10% of the school year. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged schools and parents to prioritize getting children into classrooms from day one to combat the ongoing issue of high absence rates, which have remained elevated since the pandemic.</p>
