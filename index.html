          <p>Initial unemployment claims fell to 218,000, substantially below economists' expectations and signaling continued resilience in the U.S. labor market. This positive development comes amid broader economic strength, as second-quarter GDP growth was revised upward to 3.8% and durable goods orders increased unexpectedly. Despite these strong indicators, which might temper the Federal Reserve's inclination for further easing, financial markets still anticipate additional interest rate cuts later this year.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors are close to deciding whether to indict former FBI Director James Comey, a prominent adversary of President Trump. While the specific charges are unclear, reports suggest they may relate to allegations of lying to Congress in 2020 about the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation. The potential indictment comes amid accusations of presidential pressure on the Justice Department, raising concerns among legal experts about the politicization of prosecutorial decisions and the integrity of the legal process.</p>

          <p>According to a JLL report, investor demand for U.S. office real estate has significantly strengthened, with transaction volume rising 42% year-over-year to $25.9 billion in the first half of 2025. This rebound is driven by lower interest rates and a "flight to quality," with top-tier office buildings seeing the most activity, though secondary properties are expected to gain momentum. With new construction at a historic low and companies stabilizing their space needs, the report suggests a robust recovery for the office sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Attempts to Rebrand Controversial Bill as 'Working Families Tax Cut'</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Facing public disapproval of the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' the Trump administration is attempting to rebrand it as the 'Working Families Tax Cut Bill.' However, critics argue this new name is misleading, as non-partisan analyses show the legislation disproportionately benefits the wealthiest households. The bill provides 45% of its tax cuts to the top 5% of earners while also including significant cuts to Medicaid and food assistance, which could leave many low and middle-income families financially worse off.</p>

          <p>A research team in China claims to have developed a rechargeable hydride ion battery with a specific capacity up to six times higher than conventional lithium-ion batteries. Published in the journal Nature, the breakthrough was achieved using a rare earth-based electrolyte that utilizes negatively charged hydrogen ions (hydride ions) as energy carriers. The team successfully demonstrated a prototype that powered an LED light, suggesting the technology could offer new opportunities for clean energy storage and conversion.</p>

The study, conducted by economists at Arizona State University, found that the economic impact of U.S. Latinos grew by 50% from 2015 to 2023, driven by rising education levels, entrepreneurship, and labor force participation. Experts warn that mass deportation policies could severely undermine this significant economic growth and lead to substantial GDP losses.</p>
