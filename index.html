          <p>President Trump is pursuing a deal with Iran over its nuclear program, setting aside Israeli proposals for a military campaign. He has stated his desire to make a deal that ensures regional and global safety, with ongoing talks led by Steve Witkoff. Significant gaps remain, particularly regarding uranium enrichment, with Iran unwilling to halt enrichment entirely. The deal faces opposition from Republican hard-liners who demand complete denuclearization. The article suggests potential solutions involving long-term freezes, phased removal of sanctions, and American corporate investment to build trust.</p>

          <p>New Jersey Transit executives and union representatives met to resume negotiations as the transit strike, the first in 40 years, entered its second day. The strike began due to stalled contract talks over pay, with the union seeking parity with other area railroads. NJ Transit's chief executive, Kris Kolluri, stated the agency cannot afford the requested pay increases. The strike has disrupted commutes, and the agency has implemented a contingency plan with supplemental buses. Kolluri urged residents to work from home if possible, preparing customers for the possibility that the negotiations would not end the strike.</p>

Russian negotiators' demands, such as troop withdrawals, were viewed as unacceptable ultimatums. Some experts believe the negotiations were primarily for appeasing the U.S., with little expectation of genuine compromise from Russia.</p>

          <p>Arizona Democrats are facing internal strife and concerns about Governor Katie Hobbs's re-election chances in 2026, especially after President Trump won the state last year. The state party is embroiled in a feud between the new chairman and Democratic senators. Hobbs is considered one of the most vulnerable Democratic governors seeking re-election, and the Republican primary is shaping up to be a fierce battle between hard-right and moderate candidates. Her low-key approach and vetoes have caused friction within her own party, making her re-election a challenging task.</p>
