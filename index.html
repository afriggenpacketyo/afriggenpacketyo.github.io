          <p>An anonymous Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agent voiced significant concerns for personal and family safety in an interview. The agent highlighted a more than 700% surge in assaults on officials and criticized a Democratic bill that would require agents to de-mask during enforcement operations. This de-masking, the agent argues, would facilitate doxxing and expose agents and their families to threats from protestors and agitators, who have become increasingly confrontational. The agent asserted that political leaders pushing for these changes would be directly responsible for any resulting harm.</p>

          <p>Zarah Sultana, a suspended Labour MP, has announced her resignation from the party to form a new political entity, potentially with former leader Jeremy Corbyn. Sultana, who was stripped of the whip for opposing the two-child benefit cap, cited the current government's policies on Gaza, poverty, and welfare as key motivators. She aims to challenge what she describes as a "broken" Westminster system, asserting that the established political parties have failed the British people. The Labour Party responded by highlighting its achievements in government over the past year.</p>

          <p>The United States labor market demonstrated continued strength by adding 147,000 jobs in June, surpassing economists' predictions. This performance led to a decrease in the national unemployment rate to 4.1%, its lowest point since February. The government sector saw the largest increase with 73,000 new jobs, primarily in state and local education, while healthcare also contributed significantly. Despite the positive report, economists anticipate a potential slowdown in the latter half of the year due to uncertainties surrounding trade policy and tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's recently passed spending bill includes several new tax breaks that are scheduled to expire at the end of his term in 2028. Among these temporary provisions are federal income tax deductions for tips and overtime pay, capped at certain income levels. The bill also introduces a deduction for interest paid on new auto loans for U.S.-assembled vehicles and establishes "Trump accounts," a new government-seeded savings vehicle for children. These measures, while significant, are not permanent changes to the tax code under the current legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

The research, led by conflict expert Michael Spagat, involved household surveys and is independent of Hamas-administered records. The study found the ministry's figures, while not exaggerated, are a conservative minimum, and also tallied over 8,500 "indirect" deaths from starvation and disease. This research provides a new, grim perspective on the scale of mortality in the conflict.</p>

          <p>The BBC has issued a formal apology after broadcasting a controversial set by the rap-punk group Bob Vylan from the Glastonbury festival. During their performance, the band, who are vocal critics of the war in Gaza, led the audience in a chant of "Death to the IDF." The incident prompted a police investigation, the revocation of the band's U.S. visas, and their agency reportedly dropping them. The BBC's director-general expressed deep regret for the "offensive and deplorable behavior" and announced new policies for broadcasting "high risk" acts.</p>

          <p>The relationship between Russia and Azerbaijan is under significant strain following a series of escalating diplomatic incidents. The crisis began with a police raid in Yekaterinburg, Russia, where two ethnic Azeri men died during their arrest, prompting condemnation from Baku. In an apparent retaliation, Azerbaijani authorities arrested Russian journalists and other citizens in Baku. This friction adds to existing tensions from the 2024 downing of an Azerbaijani plane by a Russian missile, signaling a potential shift in Moscow's influence in the Caucasus region.</p>

The authors argue that shuttering offices like the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL) and laying off expert staff will cripple America's ability to promote global justice. They contend this move sends a message that the U.S. no longer views human rights as a foreign policy imperative.

          <p>An in-depth analysis details how President Trump has leveraged his office to pressure social media companies into settling lawsuits he filed against them for restricting his accounts after January 6. After Meta and X (formerly Twitter) made multi-million dollar payments to his presidential library fund to settle, discussions are now underway with Google's CEO Sundar Pichai regarding the case against YouTube. The article argues this creates a difficult situation where companies must choose between a legal fight they might win and risking the president's wrath, raising questions about the use of executive power.</p>

          <p>India has taken firm control of the second Test against England, largely thanks to a monumental score of 267 from captain Shubman Gill. His epic innings, the highest by an Indian batter in England, propelled the tourists to a massive first-innings total of 587. In response, England's top order collapsed, leaving them at 77-3 by the close of day two. The early dismissals of key batsmen Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope have put England in a precarious position, facing a formidable challenge to avoid a series-leveling defeat.</p>

          <p>While the passage of his "big, beautiful bill" marks a major legislative win for President Trump, it also presents considerable political risks for the Republican party. The legislation, which funds border security and the military through large tax cuts, is projected to add trillions to the national debt, alarming fiscal conservatives. Furthermore, its significant cuts to Medicaid, estimated to affect nearly 12 million Americans, provide a powerful line of attack for Democrats. The debate over the long-term consequences of the bill is set to become a central issue in future political contests. (not investment advice)</p>

Analysts note that while Europe has increased support, it cannot easily replace certain advanced U.S. systems.
