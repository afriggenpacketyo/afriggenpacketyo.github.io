          <p>Google is contending that the Justice Department's proposal to break up the company would weaken the U.S. in the global race with China, particularly in artificial intelligence. The company argues that divesting its Chrome browser unit and opening its search data to rivals would hinder its ability to innovate and compete effectively. Google asserts that it needs to remain intact to maintain its position as a leading American company making scientific and technological breakthroughs. The DOJ's proposal would "hamstring how we develop AI, and have a government-appointed committee regulate the design and development of our products," said Google's VP of regulatory affairs, Lee-Anne Mulholland.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended his use of the encrypted messaging app Signal to discuss sensitive military operations, attributing leaks to former Pentagon officials seeking to undermine the Trump administration. Hegseth confirmed that his chief of staff will remain at the Pentagon in a different role. The controversy stems from reports that Hegseth shared operational details about strikes against Houthis in Yemen with a group including family members, some lacking security clearance. Critics have condemned his actions as a violation of defense department guidelines, while Hegseth portrays himself as a disruptive force against entrenched interests.</p>

          <p>Promoted teams in the Premier League are facing increasing difficulties in staying up, with only one instance between 1992 and 2023 where all promoted teams avoided relegation. Profit and sustainability rules (PSR) hinder promoted clubs, as they often have significantly lower revenues and player wages compared to established teams. Burnley's chief finance officer highlighted the disparity in wages between promoted clubs and top clubs, making it harder for newly promoted sides to compete.
