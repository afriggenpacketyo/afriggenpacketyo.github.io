          <p>The UK Home Office is set to publish the nationalities of foreign criminals for the first time, revealing data on offenses committed and countries of origin. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper ordered the release to better inform the public about foreign offenders awaiting deportation, which numbered over 19,000 at the end of last year. The data is expected to highlight Albanians, Romanians, and Poles as the main nationalities involved in drug production, theft, robbery, and violent assault. Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick welcomed the move, asserting that mass migration is fueling crime across the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US stocks and the dollar experienced a downturn following President Donald Trump's intensified criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom he labeled "a major loser" for not lowering interest rates preemptively. Trump's remarks, made via social media, added to market turmoil already fueled by tariff concerns and recession fears. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all fell significantly, while the dollar index reached its lowest level since 2022. Gold prices, however, hit a record high as investors sought safe-haven assets amidst the economic uncertainty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Commerce Department announced tariffs of up to 3,521% on solar panel imports from Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam, responding to allegations of Chinese subsidies and unfair dumping practices. These countervailing and anti-dumping duties target specific companies, with some Cambodian exporters facing the highest levies. The American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee welcomed the decision, while businesses and consumers who have benefited from cheaper solar products may face increased costs. The International Trade Commission will make a final decision on the tariffs in June, potentially reshaping the US solar market.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang urged Japan to increase its power generation to support the growing demands of artificial intelligence development. During meetings with Japanese officials, Huang emphasized Japan's potential leadership in AI, citing its strengths in robotics and industrial manufacturing. He stressed that energy infrastructure is crucial for industrial growth, particularly for powering data centers. Japan faces challenges in balancing electricity needs with restarting nuclear reactors and importing fossil fuels, leading to considerations of investments in projects like a liquefied natural gas project in Alaska.</p>

          <p>China's restrictions on critical metal exports to the US are having a significant impact, with exports of these minerals plummeting and shipments of some items halting entirely in March, according to customs data. This move is seen as retaliation for US tariffs on Chinese goods, placing pressure on US manufacturers reliant on Chinese rare earths. Exports of tellurium, used in solar panels, fell by 44%, while tungsten rod shipments dropped by 84%. Shipments of molybdenum powder and bismuth products have ceased completely, highlighting China's strategic leverage in the ongoing trade war.</p>

          <p>The US dollar fell below 140 yen for the first time in seven months after President Donald Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not reducing interest rates. Trump's remarks raised concerns about the central bank's independence, leading to a sell-off of the US currency. Speculation also arose that the US administration would urge Japan to address the yen's weakness during upcoming finance chief meetings in Washington. The dollar's decline reflects market uncertainty and potential shifts in monetary policy expectations.</p>

          <p>The sister of James Lee Williams, known as The Vivienne, disclosed that her family only learned about the drag performer's struggle with ketamine addiction after watching Drag Race UK. Williams, who died in January from cardiac arrest caused by ketamine, had kept his addiction a secret to protect his family. His sister, Chanel Williams, is now campaigning to encourage open conversations about substance abuse and for the reclassification of ketamine as a Class A drug in the UK. The family hopes to raise awareness and tackle the stigma surrounding addiction.</p>

          <p>A former top policeman, Sir Paul Stephenson, revisited Britain's court system and expressed his dismay at its continued inefficiency and chaos. Observing proceedings at Westminster Magistrates' Court, he noted that many cases were delayed due to missing paperwork, absent defendants, or probation officers. Stephenson described the system as a "celebration of chaos" and questioned the effective use of public funds. Official figures show a significant backlog in both Crown and magistrates' courts, highlighting a system in crisis.</p>

          <p>The weakening US dollar is creating a complex situation for central banks worldwide, forcing them to consider whether to devalue their own currencies. While a weaker dollar can ease debt burdens and lower inflation, it also complicates export competitiveness. Currency devaluation is being actively considered in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, but central banks must balance this with the risk of capital flight and potential retaliation from the US. The European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank have already taken actions in response to currency pressures.</p>
