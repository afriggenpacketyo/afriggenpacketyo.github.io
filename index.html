          <p>Two American aid workers were injured in a grenade attack at a food distribution site in southern Gaza, an incident the US and Israel have attributed to Hamas. The event occurred amid ongoing Israeli airstrikes that killed 14 people, including a doctor and his children, highlighting the persistent violence in the region. These developments unfold as ceasefire negotiations, mediated by the US, appear to be progressing, with Hamas giving a 'positive' initial response to a new truce proposal. The conflict has led to a severe humanitarian crisis, with many Palestinians killed while seeking essential aid.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has unilaterally paused a significant shipment of military aid to Ukraine, including air defense missiles, claiming concerns about low US weapon stockpiles. This marks the third such halt under Hegseth's leadership, a move that has surprised Congress and European allies. Democratic lawmakers argue there is no evidence of a weapons shortage, stating that stockpile numbers do not justify the suspension. The delay is considered painful for Ukraine, which is facing intensified Russian bombardment of its cities.</p>

          <p>Tech billionaire Elon Musk has announced the creation of his own political party, named the 'America Party,' following an online poll of his followers on the social media platform X. Musk stated that the new party aims to 'give you back your freedom,' asserting that the US currently operates as a 'one-party system' regarding government spending. This move comes after a public disagreement between Musk and Republican President Donald Trump. The announcement suggests a new, disruptive force in the American political landscape.</p>

          <p>Activists are providing critical aid to migrants stranded and injured in the Bialowieza National Park, Europe's last primeval forest on the Poland-Belarus border. Since Belarus began encouraging migrants to cross into the EU, Poland has responded with a border fence and pushbacks, creating a severe humanitarian crisis. Aid workers from groups like Grupa Granica deliver food, clothing, and medical care to people suffering from injuries, often sustained while crossing the five-meter steel fence.

The unconventional memoir was dictated by Twain over four years and is not a linear narrative, but rather a collection of his thoughts on various subjects. Robert Hirst, curator of the Mark Twain Papers, explained that the 100-year embargo was intended to allow Twain to speak freely and candidly without hurting living individuals. The publication is a major literary event, offering an unfiltered look into the mind of one of America's greatest writers.</p>

          <p>An inquiry posed to ChatGPT about tax fairness revealed that while the wealthiest Americans pay an average federal income tax rate of 16%, the primary inequity lies in how different income types are taxed. The AI explained that the US system taxes wages from labor more heavily and immediately than it taxes gains from wealth, such as appreciated stocks. It highlighted the 'buy-borrow-die' strategy, where billionaires borrow against their assets to fund their lifestyle, deferring taxes indefinitely and passing wealth to heirs largely untaxed.

          <p>Rescue teams in Texas have begun the grim task of recovering bodies after a deadly flash flood killed at least 27 people, with dozens still missing. The Guadalupe River rose dramatically, sweeping away campers, including 24 girls from the Christian-themed Camp Mystic. The disaster has been linked to the increasing frequency of extreme weather events due to the climate crisis, which causes the atmosphere to hold more moisture. As search operations continue, questions are being raised about the adequacy of weather forecasting and warning systems in the 'flash flood alley' region.</p>

          <p>The US Social Security Administration (SSA) is facing criticism for sending a misleading email claiming a new bill signed by President Trump eliminates federal income taxes on benefits for most seniors. Critics, including former SSA officials, point out the bill does not eliminate the tax but instead provides a temporary, phased-out deduction. They have condemned the email as a 'blatant political statement' and a 'lie,' arguing that the apolitical agency is being used for partisan purposes. The communication has reportedly caused confusion among recipients, who questioned its legitimacy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One year after Labour's 2024 election victory, a focus group of their voters from Kent expressed a general sense of disappointment with the party's performance in government. Participants felt that promises, particularly on immigration, have not been met and that the party lacks a clear direction, citing recent policy U-turns. While some voters were forgiving, acknowledging the difficulty of turning the country around in a single year, others felt lied to. The discussion also revealed that the rising popularity of the Reform UK party is being noticed, with some considering switching their support.</p>

          <p>James McMurdock, a Reform UK Member of Parliament, has given up the party whip following newspaper allegations regarding his use of the government's COVID-19 Bounce Back loan scheme. The Sunday Times questioned the eligibility of two of his companies which received a total of £70,000 in loans meant for struggling businesses. McMurdock has denied any wrongdoing but stated he requested the suspension as a 'precautionary measure' while Reform UK conducts an internal investigation. He will now sit as an independent, reducing Reform's number of sitting MPs to four.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has recently intensified threats against his perceived opponents, including Elon Musk, prospective NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, and former DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Trump suggested Musk could lose federal subsidies and his citizenship, and that Mamdani and Mayorkas could face arrest. These warnings are seen by democracy advocates as an alarming escalation in the weaponization of state power to silence criticism and dissent. The threats serve as a stark reminder of the president's retribution-focused agenda and its potential chilling effect on free speech and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported eight men with serious criminal convictions to South Sudan, a conflict-ridden country with which none of them have ties. The men, originally from countries in Asia and Latin America, were the subject of a prolonged legal battle where advocates argued they could face torture or death. The deportation proceeded after the Supreme Court clarified that a lower court order protecting the men was no longer in effect. This action marks an unprecedented expansion of the administration's policy of deporting non-citizens to third-party countries, alarming human rights groups.</p>
