          <p>The Senate has blocked California's plan to phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035, a move that could impact the electric car market nationwide. The 51-44 vote, opposed by most Democrats, favors the oil and gas industry and prompts a legal challenge from California, which argues the repeal undermines its authority under the Clean Air Act to set stricter environmental standards. Governor Newsom criticized the decision, stating it would hinder the state's economic and technological competitiveness. The outcome also affects 11 other states intending to follow California's lead, representing 40% of the U.S. auto market.</p>

Hinge Health, founded in 2014, uses software to assist patients in treating musculoskeletal injuries, chronic pain, and post-surgery rehabilitation remotely.

          <p>House Republicans have passed a multitrillion-dollar budget bill, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which could significantly impact household finances.

However, it also includes substantial cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, stricter work requirements, and changes to student loan benefits.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate voted to revoke three vehicle emissions waivers granted to California, a decision Democrats have criticized as an illegal overreach of power. The waivers allowed California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including the state's EV mandate, which requires all new vehicle sales to be zero emissions by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act permits them to overturn rules passed by federal agencies, while Democrats contend this action bypasses the filibuster and sets a dangerous precedent. California Governor Newsom and Attorney General Bonta have announced plans to sue the Trump administration over the vote.</p>

Kennedy Jr., has released its first report identifying poor diet, chemical exposure, lack of exercise, and overmedicalization as key drivers of childhood chronic disease. The report calls for a renewed focus on science and private sector innovation to address these issues. However, current and former federal health officials have criticized the report for misrepresenting facts and omitting other significant factors, such as maternal health and smoking.

          <p>The Trump administration released a report from the MAHA Commission, highlighting a range of factors driving chronic disease among children in the U.S., including obesity, asthma, and behavioral health disorders. The report identifies poor diet, environmental chemicals, chronic stress, lack of physical activity, and overmedicalization as major drivers. The report blames corporate influence in the food, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries. Critics argue the report lacks a thorough discussion of socioeconomic factors and questions vaccine safety, while also pointing out the cuts to public health infrastructure.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated that Harvard had failed to address violence and antisemitism on campus. A federal judge issued an injunction that could block the Trump administration from acting on its threat against international students currently enrolled at Harvard.</p>

          <p>The Republican budget bill, which passed the House, would establish nationwide work requirements for Medicaid recipients, potentially causing millions to lose their health insurance. The bill requires able-bodied adults without children to report at least 80 hours of work or community activity monthly to maintain benefits. Critics argue that this will disproportionately affect low-income individuals and those with irregular work schedules. The Arkansas experience with similar requirements showed that many people lost coverage due to administrative issues, not a lack of employment.</p>
