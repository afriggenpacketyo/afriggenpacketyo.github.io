          <p>A Texas state judge has ordered that the assets of Infowars and its parent company be turned over to a court-appointed receiver. The receiver will liquidate the company's property, including its brand name, to begin paying the $1.3 billion defamation judgment owed to the families of Sandy Hook victims. This move shifts the process out of federal bankruptcy court and is seen by the families' lawyers as a crucial step toward accountability for Jones's false conspiracies. The decision significantly increases the likelihood that Infowars will be shut down and its assets sold.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retailers and importers are facing significant economic pressure as tariffs contribute to rising prices for goods like coffee, tea, and spices. Coffee prices surged 14.5% in July year-over-year, forcing small business owners to raise their own prices to cope with already thin margins. Importers of natural resources not available in the U.S. have limited ability to find alternative sources, leaving them stuck with higher costs. The situation is squeezing small, independent brands that prioritize quality but cannot absorb the financial impact as easily as larger competitors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Attorney General Eric Holder, who now chairs the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, held a virtual meeting with House Democrats to discuss strategies against Republican-led redistricting efforts. The meeting focused on a contentious new congressional map in Texas that Democrats argue is a gerrymandering scheme designed to rig elections. The conflict has escalated with California's governor threatening to redraw his state's map in retaliation, highlighting a deepening national political fight over the drawing of electoral boundaries ahead of midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Paris St-Germain won the UEFA Super Cup, defeating Tottenham Hotspur in a penalty shootout after a dramatic 2-2 draw. The match served as a significant debut for PSG's new goalkeeper, Lucas Chevalier, whose crucial save in the shootout validated coach Luis Enrique's bold decision to start him over Gianluigi Donnarumma. For Tottenham, the late collapse after leading 2-0 was a blow, but the performance also offered promising signs of new manager Thomas Frank's pragmatic, set-piece-focused tactical approach, despite the heartbreaking result.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive study of over 148,000 people in Sweden suggests that drug treatments for ADHD offer significant long-term benefits beyond managing daily symptoms. The research, published in the British Medical Journal, found that taking ADHD medication was linked to notable reductions in the risk of substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminal behavior. These findings provide crucial evidence on the potential risks of not treating ADHD and could help patients and doctors in their decision-making process regarding medication.</p>

          <p>A New York man was arrested for allegedly cyberstalking the widow of Brian Thompson, the UnitedHealthcare CEO who was fatally shot in December. According to the federal complaint, the suspect left multiple profanity-laced and threatening voicemails on the widow's work phone just hours after her husband's murder, celebrating the killing and warning her family. Investigators used the suspect's phone number to track him down. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison for his actions.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Department of Veterans Affairs' independent inspector general has determined that every VA hospital in the country is experiencing "severe" staffing shortages. The number of shortages has increased by 50% in the current fiscal year, with 94% of facilities reporting a severe lack of doctors and 79% a severe lack of nurses. These findings raise serious concerns about access to and quality of care for veterans, especially as they coincide with a department-wide plan to reduce its workforce by 30,000 employees.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is on track to become the first hurricane of the 2025 season. The storm developed west of the Cabo Verde islands, where it has already caused deadly flooding, and is moving westward. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict it will strengthen into a major hurricane by the time it nears the Caribbean islands late in the week. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, its long-term path is still uncertain.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams are now valued at $10.43 billion, making them the second-most valuable franchise in the NFL, according to new rankings from Sportico. This represents a remarkable financial ascent from just a decade ago, when the team was based in St. Louis and ranked last in the league with a valuation of $930 million. The dramatic increase is credited to owner Stan Kroenke's vision, including the team's return to the lucrative Los Angeles market and the construction of the state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium.

          <p>Comedy Central's animated series "South Park" is experiencing its best ratings in years, with viewership for its 27th season surging dramatically. The increase is being attributed to the show's sharp and timely satirical portrayals of President Trump, Vice President J.D. Vance, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The success comes as the show's creators operate under a new $1.5 billion streaming deal with Paramount+, which itself recently settled a lawsuit filed by Trump over a "60 Minutes" interview.</p>
