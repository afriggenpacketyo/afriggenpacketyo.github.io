        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is threatening California with legal action and steep fines over its policies allowing transgender athletes to compete in sports consistent with their gender identity. This action follows a transgender athlete's success in statewide high school track-and-field events. The Justice Department asserts that California's policies violate the rights of female athletes under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, demanding the state cease implementing its bylaw covering transgender athletes. President Trump has also singled out the athlete in question, promising large-scale fines on the state for its policies. The California Attorney General's office has stated they are reviewing the letter and committed to defending laws ensuring students' rights to be free from discrimination. The optimism score is based on the potential disruption and conflict arising from this legal battle over transgender rights.</p>

          <p>CrowdStrike shares experienced a 7% decline in extended trading following the release of a weaker-than-expected revenue forecast by the security software company. While the company's earnings per share surpassed expectations at 73 cents versus an expected 65 cents, revenue aligned with projections at $1.10 billion. The company's costs increased in sales and marketing as well as in research and development and administration, partly because of a broad software outage last summer. For the current quarter, CrowdStrike anticipates adjusted earnings per share between 82 and 84 cents on revenue between $1.14 billion and $1.15 billion, while analysts expected 81 cents per share and $1.16 billion in revenue.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Navy is reportedly considering renaming several naval ships, including the USNS Harvey Milk, named after the gay rights leader and Navy veteran. This potential move is allegedly driven by the Trump administration's desire to "reestablish the warrior culture" within the military. Documents obtained by CBS News indicate that other vessels named after prominent figures like Thurgood Marshall, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Harriet Tubman are also on the renaming "recommended list." Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized the potential renamings as a "shameful, vindictive erasure" of those who fought for equality, while Pentagon officials state the names should reflect the Commander-in-Chief's priorities and national history. The renaming of the USNS Harvey Milk, christened in 2021, would reverse a significant step toward inclusivity within the armed forces. The optimism score reflects the potential for division and controversy surrounding the renaming decision.</p>

          <p>Olympic gold medalist Imane Khelif celebrated Global Parents Day on Instagram amid a report questioning the boxer's gender eligibility.

Khelif has maintained their gender is female, and has filed a lawsuit against detractors on social media. World Boxing has stated Khelif must undergo a genetic sex screening before competing in sanctioned fights, while the IOC has stated that eligibility criteria are the responsibility of the respective International Federation.
