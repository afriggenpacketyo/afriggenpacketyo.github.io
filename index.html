          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 02:52:00 EDT</div>

          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has reportedly paused deliveries of its electric ID.Buzz van to the United States, with sources citing new US tariffs as a contributing factor. This development is part of a broader collection of German news which also highlights difficulties for residents at the German-Polish border due to new reciprocal spot checks. The article frames the VW decision as a significant event for Germany's automotive sector, a key driver of its economy and a source of national pride. This move reflects the ongoing adjustments by European companies to shifting global trade policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has permitted Royal Mail to cease Saturday deliveries for second-class letters, a measure intended to help the company manage costs amid declining letter volumes. Under the reformed Universal Service Obligation (USO), first-class letters will still be delivered six days a week, but delivery targets for both first and second-class mail will be slightly relaxed. Royal Mail welcomed the decision as a step toward ensuring a financially sustainable service. Ofcom stated the reform is necessary for the postal service's survival but emphasized that the company must now implement the changes effectively.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron's state visit to the United Kingdom, marked by royal pomp and pageantry, is being overshadowed by the looming threat of US trade tariffs. While Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer are set to discuss migration, defense, and trade, the primary concern is President Trump's unpredictable tariff regime, which could severely impact European economies. The European Union is reportedly rushing to finalize a trade deal with Washington, but major uncertainties remain. The visit, the first by an EU leader since Brexit, highlights an attempt to strengthen UK-France ties amid significant global economic challenges.</p>

          <p>The European Union remains in a state of uncertainty as a deadline for a trade agreement with the United States passed without a resolution. While President Trump has signaled a deal could be reached soon, the EU has not yet received a formal letter outlining potential new tariffs, unlike over 20 other nations. US officials suggest that the EU has made significant offers to open its markets, but European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen remains cautious, stating the bloc is preparing for all scenarios. The ongoing ambiguity reflects the tense and unpredictable nature of current transatlantic trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former US Secretary of State John Kerry stated that his Democratic party allowed the US-Mexico border to be "under siege" and that they had "missed" on the immigration issue for years. In an interview with the BBC, Kerry remarked that this failure enabled Republicans like Donald Trump to gain a political advantage, even saying, "Trump was right" about the need for a protected border. His comments highlight a significant internal debate within the Democratic party over its pro-immigration policies and how to respond to the Trump administration's aggressive deportation efforts, which are currently facing legal challenges from several California cities.</p>

          <p>Vienna is frequently cited as a model for successful housing policy, largely due to its extensive and stable social housing sector, which comprises 43% of the city's housing units. This system, which serves low- and middle-income households, results in significantly lower rent levels and helps suppress prices in the private market. Originating in the 1920s, the program is sustained by a levy on employee salaries and has resisted the large-scale privatization seen in other European cities. While the article notes challenges related to accessibility for newcomers, it ultimately presents Vienna's long-term political commitment to housing as a basic need as a key lesson for other cities.</p>

Weighing only 74 milligrams, the device is strapped to a bee's back and uses three needles to send electronic pulses into its brain. These pulses create illusions that effectively command the bee's flight, directing it to turn, advance, or retreat. According to the researchers, the remote-controlled bee obeyed the commands with a 90% success rate, marking a significant step in micro-robotics and bio-integrated technology.</p>

The announcement caused a surge in US copper prices, and experts predict it could create a significant premium for the metal within the US compared to global markets.

          <p>The Chinese government is introducing a one-time subsidy to encourage companies and social organizations to hire unemployed young people between the ages of 16 and 24. Employers can receive up to 1,500 yuan for each new hire who is signed to a formal contract for at least three months. This measure is part of a broader effort to stabilize the labor market and support household incomes amid persistent economic pressures, including sluggish growth and trade disputes. Additionally, China's economic planner has allocated 10 billion yuan to expand its "work-for-relief" public works program to generate more jobs.</p>

Infantino has cultivated close ties with Trump, making several appearances alongside him and praising his support for the sport. The new office expands FIFA's US presence and underscores the organization's strategic efforts ahead of the major international tournament.</p>

          <p>The Chinese embassy in South Africa has issued a warning to its citizens about an increasing risk of kidnappings, particularly targeting women. The advisory follows multiple recent incidents across the country and a fatal home invasion in May that targeted Chinese nationals. Analysts suggest that Chinese traders are being targeted due to a perception that they often operate with large amounts of cash outside the formal banking system. The embassy has urged its citizens to avoid going out alone and to take extra precautions to ensure their personal and property safety amid the rising crime wave.</p>

The workers had to navigate back through the damaged section to the sole access point, more than five miles away. A massive response from the Los Angeles Fire Department, including specialized urban search and rescue teams, was deployed to the scene.

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against the state of California, arguing its strict regulations on egg production have unlawfully contributed to a nationwide increase in egg prices. The suit claims that California's laws, which mandate cage-free conditions for hens and apply to eggs sold in the state regardless of origin, create unnecessary red tape and violate federal law. President Trump has vowed to lower egg prices, which have soared due to a major bird flu outbreak. California officials have previously defended the regulations, which were passed by voters to reduce animal cruelty and foodborne disease risks.</p>

          <p>Yemen's Houthi rebels have sunk a second cargo ship in the Red Sea in a week, resulting in at least three crew members killed and many others missing. The Greek-operated vessel, Eternity C, was attacked with rocket-propelled grenades, lost all propulsion, and eventually sank. The Houthis claimed they attacked the ship because it was heading to Israel and stated they took some surviving crew members to a safe location. This latest attack escalates the threat to international shipping in the region, with the Houthis having now sunk four ships and killed at least seven seafarers since November 2023.</p>

This proposal aims to create a clear policy distinction from the Labour government, which recently scaled back its own planned cuts to the welfare system. The Conservatives argue their plan is necessary for sustainability, while Labour warns it could harm disabled British nationals living abroad under reciprocal agreements.</p>

Oxfam contends that government policies biased against the poor and ineffective tax systems allow the super-rich to accumulate more wealth.

In contrast, a flood in Texas just days earlier caught officials by surprise, leading to at least 119 deaths.
