Soliman is currently held on a $10 million bond and is also facing federal hate crime charges in a separate federal court case. Three victims remain hospitalized as of Thursday, with Soliman due back in court on July 15. </p>

Despite beating Wall Street expectations for fiscal first-quarter earnings, the company is navigating tariffs and concerns about a slowing U.S. economy. CEO Calvin McDonald noted that U.S. consumers are being cautious, and the brand plans to implement strategic price increases to mitigate the impact of tariffs. The company expects full-year earnings per share to be between $14.58 to $14.78. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced sanctions on four judges from the International Criminal Court (ICC) for what the U.S. considers "illegitimate actions" targeting the United States and Israel. The sanctions target judges who authorized arrest warrants for Israeli officials and an investigation into U.S. personnel in Afghanistan. The ICC responded by stating it “deplores” the sanctions, calling them an attempt to undermine the court's independence. The U.S. has already sanctioned the ICC’s chief prosecutor, escalating tensions with the court. </p>
