          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized President Trump's latest spending bill, arguing that it undermines efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit and hinders the progress of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk stated that the bill, officially known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, would increase the deficit rather than decrease it, thus countering DOGE's work. Trump responded by saying the bill was necessary to secure votes and that compromises were made. The sweeping bill is projected to raise the federal budget deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next 10 years. (not investment advice)</p>
