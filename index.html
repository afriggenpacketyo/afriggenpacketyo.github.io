          <p>Republicans in North Carolina are attempting to overturn the results of a state Supreme Court election, focusing on technicalities and reinterpreting voting laws. While the effort to invalidate a large number of votes has narrowed, the legal battle could set a precedent for overturning future elections. Legal experts from both parties express concern about the potential implications for the integrity of elections. Optimism Score: 30</p>
