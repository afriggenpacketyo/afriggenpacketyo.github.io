          <p>Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil was released from ICE detention in Louisiana following a federal judge's order, who determined he wasn't a flight risk or community threat. Khalil, a green card holder detained for months, was accused by the Trump administration of posing a "foreign policy" concern due to his pro-Palestinian activism. The judge restricted Khalil's travel to New Jersey, New York, Michigan, Washington, D.C., and Louisiana for immigration proceedings. Khalil expressed relief at reuniting with his wife and son, while the White House and Department of Homeland Security criticized the judge's decision and vowed to appeal, citing national security concerns and allegations of omitted details on Khalil's green card application. The article highlights the conflicting views on Khalil's detention and the ongoing legal battle surrounding his immigration status. </p>

Garcia claims agents bragged about arresting 31 "bodies" and high-fived each other while he was detained. Garcia, a photographer and doctoral student, was filming the agents when he was tackled and arrested, allegedly without being asked for identification or citizenship. He overheard agents saying, "Trump is really working us," during his detention at Dodger Stadium, where he was held with other detainees. Garcia met another U.S. citizen, Adrian Martinez, who was arrested for intervening in the arrest of a man at a Walmart, illustrating a pattern of questionable arrests during immigration enforcement operations. </p>

The shooting caused panic among attendees, and a Vanilla Ice concert scheduled after the game was canceled due to "technical issues".

          <p>All charges against Barry Morphew were dismissed without prejudice, nine days before his trial for the first-degree murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, who disappeared in May 2020. Prosecutors cited the need for further investigation and the belief that they are close to discovering Suzanne's body, while also noting the court's decision to exclude key expert witnesses. Morphew's attorney maintained his innocence and criticized the prosecution's case, highlighting the lack of physical evidence connecting him to the alleged crime. The case has been marked by bizarre twists, including a chipmunk alibi, a tranquilizer gun, a "talking" truck, mystery DNA, and a spy pen, and Barry Morphew has filed a $15 million federal civil rights lawsuit against prosecutors and law enforcement officials stating he was wrongfully arrested, jailed and prosecuted. </p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, but President Trump hinted at a possible "deal" to resolve the conflict. The ruling prevents the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, a federal database for student visa applications. The administration had accused Harvard of failing to address campus antisemitism, leading to the attempt to revoke its student visa system certification. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling, while Harvard vowed to defend its rights and those of its students and scholars. </p>

          <p>The Rhode Island state House passed a bill to ban the sale and manufacturing of certain semiautomatic rifles, commonly known as assault weapons. The proposal now goes to Governor Dan McKee, who supports assault weapons bans, potentially making Rhode Island the eleventh state with such a prohibition. The bill only applies to sales and manufacturing, not possession, similar to a law in Washington state. Critics argue the ban will not curb mass shootings and punishes law-abiding citizens, while gun control advocates call the proposed ban the “weakest assault weapons ban in the country.”</p>

          <p>A prosecutor in the Suzanne Morphew case stated in court that investigators suspect they know the location of her body, describing it as "in a very difficult spot." This update follows the dismissal of murder charges against her husband, Barry Morphew, in April 2022, due to a lack of evidence. The case, which began with Suzanne's disappearance on Mother's Day 2020, has involved bizarre clues such as a chipmunk alibi, a tranquilizer gun, and a spy pen. Despite the challenges, authorities continue to search for Morphew's body and pursue justice in the case. </p>

          <p>A deadly border skirmish between Thailand and Cambodia has tested China's neighborhood diplomacy, as Beijing seeks to maintain stability in a region crucial to its strategic interests. Analysts believe China will closely monitor the situation while avoiding direct mediation, possibly working with Asean to prevent future confrontations. The recent clash, resulting in one Cambodian soldier's death, highlights deep-rooted border disputes in the Indochina peninsula. While the risk of wider escalation is low, the incident may cast a shadow over China's efforts to foster closer regional ties amidst its rivalry with the United States. </p>

          <p>Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil was released on bail after more than three months in detention, following a federal judge's ruling that he was not a flight risk or threat.

          <p>President Trump hinted at potentially firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, criticizing him for maintaining steady interest rates and labeling him a "Total and Complete Moron". Trump has repeatedly attacked Powell for not lowering rates faster, despite uncertainty about his legal authority to remove the Fed chair before his term ends in 2026. The president's frustration stems from concerns that high interest rates could slow economic growth, while Powell emphasizes the need to control inflation. The Fed declined to comment on Trump's remarks, which echo similar criticisms made during his first term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Iranian missile strike wounded 23 people in northern Israel, as both countries continued exchanging strikes, according to emergency services. The attack occurred as European foreign ministers and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi began a diplomatic effort in Geneva. Araghchi stated Iran has "nothing to discuss" with the U.S. as long as Israel continues its strikes, but is open to "dialogue" with others. Britain's foreign secretary, David Lammy, said the Europeans are "keen to continue ongoing discussions and negotiations with Iran", and that they were clear that Iran "cannot have a nuclear weapon". </p>
