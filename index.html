Analysts anticipate the RBA will maintain its current cash rate, though they note increasing tension from recent data showing potential upside risks to inflation. While markets in South Korea and Australia saw gains, Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices experienced declines after reaching a record high the previous week. This activity follows a positive end to the week on Wall Street, where major averages climbed after the release of key U.S. inflation data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a pivotal parliamentary election, Moldova's ruling pro-EU Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) has secured a decisive lead, signaling the country's continued path toward closer ties with the European Union. With the vast majority of votes counted, the PAS party won nearly 50% of the vote, significantly ahead of the pro-Russian Patriotic Bloc. The election was framed as a crucial choice between aligning with the EU or Russia, occurring amidst accusations of foreign interference from both sides. The result solidifies the pro-Western trajectory set by President Maia Sandu, despite ongoing political tensions and challenges from pro-Russian opposition.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, a Marine Corps veteran who served in Iraq, as the lone suspect in the deadly shooting at a Michigan Mormon church. According to police, Sanford rammed his truck into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints building before opening fire on the congregation, killing two people and injuring several others. He then allegedly set the building ablaze before being killed in an exchange of gunfire with responding officers. Sanford served as a mechanic in the Marines from 2004 to 2008, earning several service medals during his deployment for Operation Iraqi Freedom.</p>

Ukrainian officials reported at least four fatalities, including a 12-year-old girl, and over 70 injuries nationwide as the strikes targeted civilian areas, residential buildings, and other non-military infrastructure. The attack prompted defensive military responses from neighboring Poland due to strikes in western Ukraine and occurred just after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's pleas for international support at the UN General Assembly.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that a government shutdown is probable unless Democrats alter their negotiating stance on a new spending bill ahead of the October 1 deadline. In an interview, the president expressed confidence that the public would support his position, which focuses on cutting spending and linking any healthcare negotiations to stricter immigration controls. The White House has already instructed federal agencies to prepare for potential layoffs, signaling its readiness for a shutdown.

          <p>A mass shooting at the American Fish Company, a waterfront bar in Southport, North Carolina, resulted in three fatalities and at least five injuries on Saturday night. Authorities report that the shooter opened fire from a boat before fleeing the scene, also by boat. The U.S. Coast Guard later apprehended a person of interest, Nigel Max Edge, who was detained while at a public boat ramp on nearby Oak Island. Police Chief Todd Coring stated that the investigation suggests the attack was highly premeditated, and Edge now faces multiple charges, including three counts of first-degree murder.</p>

          <p>The state of Oregon has initiated legal action against the Trump administration following the authorization to deploy 200 National Guard members to Portland for 60 days. State Attorney General Dan Rayfield announced the lawsuit, arguing that President Trump lacks the authority to federalize the National Guard for the stated purpose of protecting federal property from protesters. The move comes after the president characterized Portland as "war ravaged" and vowed to suppress protests targeting ICE facilities. Governor Tina Kotek and other local officials have condemned the deployment as an unnecessary and unlawful abuse of power that could escalate tensions rather than ensure safety.</p>

The Eagle S incident prompted Finnish special forces to board and seize the vessel, a historic first since World War II.

          <p>Future Hall of Fame pitcher Clayton Kershaw ended his 18-year regular-season career on a high note, pitching 5 ⅓ scoreless innings to earn his 223rd win as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Seattle Mariners 6-1. In his final outing, Kershaw recorded seven strikeouts, bringing his career total to 3,052 and lowering his career ERA to 2.53, the best among modern-era starters. The Dodgers announced Kershaw will not be on the roster for the upcoming wild-card series against the Cincinnati Reds. However, he may be considered for subsequent playoff rounds if the team advances, leaving open the possibility of one final postseason appearance.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce a new Labour government initiative aimed at eliminating long-term youth unemployment by offering guaranteed paid work placements. Under the plan, young people who have been on Universal Credit for 18 months without employment or education will be provided a placement, with potential benefit sanctions for those who refuse without a valid reason. The policy builds on a previous "youth guarantee" and aims to help young people develop skills for full-time employment. The announcement comes as the number of 16-24 year-olds not in education, employment, or training has reached an 11-year high.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are set to host the Cincinnati Reds in the National League wild-card series after the Reds clinched the final playoff spot on the last day of the season. The Reds mounted an impressive late-season surge, overcoming a six-game deficit in early September to secure their first full-season playoff berth since 2013. Key challenges for the Dodgers will include navigating the Reds' strong starting rotation, led by hard-throwing right-hander Hunter Greene, and containing young superstar Elly De La Cruz. The series will also feature the return of former Dodger Gavin Lux, who was traded to Cincinnati in the offseason.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, acclaimed Chinese author Yan Lianke reflected on his career, the nature of literary awards, and the pressures of writing within a censored environment. When asked about speculation that he is a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, the 67-year-old writer stated that such external pressures no longer affect his work. He emphasized that the magic of great literature lies in its capacity for diverse interpretations and that any human experience is a valid subject for a writer. Lianke, often described as a 'literary anarchist,' is known for his satirical and often-banned novels that critique contemporary Chinese society.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels have finished in last place for the second consecutive year, marking the first time this has occurred in 50 years and extending their streak of losing seasons to ten. This continued lack of success raises significant questions for owner Arte Moreno and team president John Carpino, the only constants in leadership during this period of decline. The article notes that despite changes in management, the team has failed to develop a strong core of young players and continues to be plagued by weaknesses in pitching, hitting, and defense. Key decisions are expected this week regarding the future of General Manager Perry Minasian and Manager Ron Washington.</p>

Some differentiation emerged on criminal justice, with Tony Thurmond expressing his opposition to a recent anti-crime ballot measure that his rivals supported. The candidates also emphasized their immigrant backgrounds in appeals to the state's diverse electorate, as the race to succeed Governor Gavin Newsom in 2026 begins to take shape.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is set to announce a new Labour policy that would require migrants to prove their contribution to society to earn permanent settlement status. Under the proposal, legal migrants seeking indefinite leave to remain would need to demonstrate a high standard of English, maintain a clean criminal record, and perform community volunteer work. This policy aims to create a clear distinction from the rival Reform UK party's proposal to abolish the status altogether. Labour also plans to extend the qualifying period for permanent settlement from five to ten years, reinforcing the principle that the right to remain must be earned.</p>

He posits that unlike the dot-com era, which was fueled by speculative companies with massive debt and little revenue, the AI buildout is being driven by established, cash-rich tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, and Google who see it as a necessity for maintaining market dominance. While acknowledging public skepticism about AI's current tangible benefits, Cramer asserts that the spending is a strategic long-term investment by proven companies, not a speculative frenzy based on unproven business models.

          <p>Asian nations are being urged to monitor the upcoming 2026 review of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), as the outcome could significantly impact their economic interests. Trade and investment from Asia into the three North American countries have grown substantially, with Asian exports to the region reaching $1.7 trillion in 2024. Much of this investment, particularly in Mexico, is driven by a desire to leverage USMCA's tariff preferences and gain better market access. The article suggests that instead of reacting defensively, Asian economies should actively participate in the public consultation process to help shape the debate and protect their growing economic ties.</p>

The event occurred as French authorities reported another migrant death near Boulogne-sur-Mer, adding to the at least 27 fatalities from crossing attempts this year.

His withdrawal significantly alters the race, which now primarily features Democrat Zohran Mamdani, former governor Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa.
