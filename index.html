          <p>The Trump administration has deployed the California National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests over immigration enforcement operations, leading to clashes between demonstrators and authorities. President Trump signed a memorandum deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to address what the White House calls "lawlessness" in California.
