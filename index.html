          <p>Cassie Ventura testified in the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial, detailing her 11-year relationship with the hip-hop mogul. Ventura described Combs as controlling, stating he dictated her appearance and activities, and used his financial power to punish her. She recounted instances of physical abuse, including being hit and kicked, and also described being coerced into "freak offs," sexual encounters with male escorts while Combs watched. Ventura testified that these encounters, often fueled by drugs, left her feeling humiliated and worthless, as she only desired sexual intimacy with Combs himself.</p>

          <p>Israeli fighter jets bombed Khan Younis in southern Gaza, targeting Muhammad Sinwar, a top Hamas leader and brother of Yahya Sinwar. Israeli officials claim the strike aimed to eliminate a hard-line negotiator within Hamas, potentially easing cease-fire negotiations. The attack also targeted a Hamas command center under the European Hospital, resulting in casualties. While Israel accuses Hamas of operating from hospitals, Hamas denies these allegations. The article notes that Hamas's willingness to compromise may decrease in the short term but potentially increase in the long term following the death of a senior leader.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing scrutiny for its contradictory refugee policies, welcoming white Afrikaners from South Africa while simultaneously denying temporary protected status to Afghans who aided U.S. forces. The administration argues that the Afrikaners have been "carefully vetted" and can be easily assimilated, while suggesting Afghans pose national security risks. Critics argue that this policy overtly promotes a narrative of white persecution while betraying those who risked their lives for America in Afghanistan. The article notes that the decision to deny Afghans protected status is based on the claim that Afghanistan's security situation has improved, a claim disputed by experts.</p>

She isolated strains of rhizobia and Azospirillum, which facilitate nitrogen fixation and root growth, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers.

          <p>President Trump has repeatedly vowed not to cut Medicaid, but a House Republican bill to fund his agenda proposes significant cuts to the program. The bill aims to slash Medicaid spending by imposing work requirements, increasing eligibility checks, and penalizing states that offer Medicaid to illegal immigrants. Despite Trump's promises, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would cause millions more Americans to become uninsured. While Trump claims his administration is targeting "fraud" and "abuse" within Medicaid, critics argue that the proposed cuts contradict his pledges to protect the program.</p>

Housing and energy costs were major drivers of inflation, while grocery prices saw a slight decrease. Economists are closely monitoring the impact of Trump's tariffs on consumer prices, although the April data is unlikely to reflect their full effect due to exemptions and front-loading of purchases.

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reversed the firings of over 100 federal employees at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), which protects coal miners from black lung. The decision came after public pressure and reports detailing the impact of the firings on black lung healthcare programs. A federal judge also ordered HHS to halt the dismissals, emphasizing the importance of NIOSH's health screening program.
