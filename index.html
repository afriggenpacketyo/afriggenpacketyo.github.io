          <p>Nathan Gill, the former leader of Reform UK in Wales, has admitted to accepting bribes to promote pro-Russian narratives while serving as a Member of the European Parliament. Between 2018 and 2019, he received money from Oleg Voloshyn, a Ukrainian figure identified by the U.S. as a Russian agent, in exchange for making specific statements and organizing events. Gill's activities were uncovered through WhatsApp messages after he was stopped at an airport under counter-terrorism laws, and he is now expected to face a substantial prison sentence.</p>

          <p>Actress Natalie Dormer, who portrays Sarah Ferguson in an upcoming drama, is refusing to promote the project after a 2011 email from Ferguson to Jeffrey Epstein became public. In the email, Ferguson referred to the disgraced financier as a "supreme friend," a revelation Dormer found inexcusable. In protest, Dormer has donated her entire salary from the series to charities that support children who have experienced abuse, stating that the new information makes it impossible to reconcile her values with Ferguson's behavior.</p>

          <p>Assata Shakur, a prominent Black liberation activist who was born Joanne Byron, has died in Cuba at the age of 78, according to the Cuban government. Shakur had been living in exile on the island since 1979 after escaping from a U.S. prison, where she was serving a sentence for the killing of a state trooper. Considered a freedom fighter by her supporters and a terrorist by the FBI, her death marks the end of a controversial and highly politicized life.</p>

          <p>The New York City medical examiner has confirmed that Shane Tamura, who killed four people at the NFL's headquarters before taking his own life, had Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). This finding aligns with a note found on Tamura, in which he blamed the NFL for concealing the dangers of brain injuries and asked for his brain to be studied. The diagnosis confirms low-stage CTE, a condition linked to repeated head trauma, providing a disturbing context to the tragic shooting event.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has charged former FBI Director James Comey with making false statements and obstruction of justice. The indictment relates to testimony he gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2020 concerning his handling of investigations into Hillary Clinton's emails and Russian election interference. The charges, filed just before the statute of limitations expired, have intensified political controversy, with critics accusing the Trump administration of weaponizing the justice system against a long-standing political adversary.</p>

          <p>A heartwarming moment at a Seattle Mariners game captured national attention after a fan, Glenn Mutti-Driscoll, caught Cal Raleigh's historic 60th home run ball and immediately gifted it to 12-year-old Marcus Rueblos. The boy then chose to return the potentially valuable ball to Raleigh in exchange for a signed bat. In a final act of goodwill, the Mariners organization located Mutti-Driscoll and rewarded his generosity with a meet-and-greet and a signed bat from the star catcher.</p>

          <h2>Democrats Condemn Comey Indictment as a Politically Motivated 'Constitutional Crisis'</h2>

          <p>Leading Democrats have forcefully condemned the federal indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, describing it as a politically motivated act by the Trump administration's Justice Department. Senator Chris Murphy labeled the situation a "constitutional crisis," while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called it a "disgraceful attack on the rule of law." These reactions portray the indictment not as a legitimate legal proceeding but as a dangerous weaponization of the justice system to target a political opponent.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Secretary of Health and Human Services, has confirmed that the Food and Drug Administration is undertaking a safety review of the abortion pill mifepristone. This action follows pressure from Republican state attorneys general and conservative groups who have raised concerns about the drug's risks, especially after access was broadened through telehealth and mail services. While reproductive rights advocates maintain the pill has a long-established safety record, the review could potentially result in new restrictions on its availability.</p>

The crime came to light after Renteria was contacted by law enforcement in a different county, which led Los Angeles police to discover his wife's body at their home.</p>

          <p>The Arlington, Texas Police Department is facing a lawsuit after one of its officers provided transportation to Frederick Spears, who is now accused of murdering his estranged wife, Mary Spears. The ride took him to her home, a direct violation of an emergency protective order issued against him just a day earlier for threatening his family. The police department has since acknowledged that its officers should not have given him the ride, a failure that the victim's family argues led to her death.</p>

Commenting on the recent U.S.-China deal regarding TikTok, he stressed that the key issues to watch are the security of American user data and the ownership of the app's powerful algorithm. Clegg also warned against the trend of data localization, where countries require citizen data to be stored domestically, as it could erode the open internet.</p>
