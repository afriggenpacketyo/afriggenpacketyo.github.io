            <p>The United States is currently facing a significant measles outbreak, raising concerns about the severity and prevention of this highly contagious disease. Health officials confirm the largest outbreak is in West Texas, primarily affecting unvaccinated children and teenagers, with multiple fatalities reported. Measles symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a characteristic rash, potentially leading to severe complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis. Experts emphasize the safety and effectiveness of the MMR vaccine, while also addressing misinformation regarding vitamin A as a substitute for vaccination, underscoring the importance of vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease.</p>

            <p>Influential Chinese commentators suggest that China may retaliate against increased US tariffs by targeting the services sector, where the US holds a significant trade surplus. Potential measures include restricting US firms from government procurement processes and limiting cooperation between Chinese companies and US law firms and consultancies. Other proposed countermeasures include increasing tariffs on US soybeans, banning imports of US poultry and Hollywood films, and investigating US companies in China over intellectual property issues. This escalation signals a potential broadening of the trade dispute beyond goods to include services.</p>

Experts, including former FDA vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks, criticize Kennedy's past anti-vaccine stance, arguing it contributes to vaccine hesitancy.

            <p>Cambodia is facing a 49% tariff rate on its goods imposed by the Trump administration, leading to an existential crisis for Cambodian factories and workers. However, experts say that reshoring manufacturing to the U.S. is highly unlikely, as manufacturers are exploring alternative countries like Egypt, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Indonesia. The Cambodian government is considering fiscal policies, including tax credits, to mitigate the pressure. Moody's analysts suggest that companies will pause executive decision-making until the tariff response from other countries becomes clearer. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts emphasize that these animals are not naturally aggressive and are reacting out of fear due to their illness.

            <p>President Trump has announced a sweeping set of tariffs impacting global trade, including a 10% baseline tariff on almost all foreign imports to the US, with some countries exempt.

China faces an additional 34% tariff on top of the existing 20%, resulting in a total tariff of 104% on Chinese goods imported into the US.

            <p>Palm Springs, California, has installed "Palm Springs Loves Canada" signs to reassure Canadian tourists amidst concerns that Trump's policies are scaring them away. The city relies heavily on Canadian visitors, who contribute an estimated $300 million annually to the local economy. Local businesses and officials are hoping to send a positive message and encourage Canadians to continue visiting Palm Springs. Some Canadian airlines have reduced flights to the area, citing decreased demand.</p>

            <p>President Trump is proceeding with tariffs on numerous countries despite economic concerns, with Beijing vowing to retaliate if the US imposes additional tariffs on Chinese exports. China would face an additional 50% tariff if it retaliates. Trump claims that "many" countries are seeking a deal with Washington, while Beijing vows to "fight to the end" in the trade war. This action comes as Trump continues to push for the revival of the coal industry.</p>

A Maryland court ordered Garcia's return, but the Trump administration claims it cannot compel El Salvador to comply. Immigration experts argue that the case could set a dangerous precedent, potentially undermining due process for immigrants. The US government is paying El Salvador to house prisoners it sends, which suggests the US has some influence.</p>
