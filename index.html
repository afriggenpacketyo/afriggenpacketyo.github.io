            <p>Ukraine's military reported a surge in Russian drone attacks across multiple regions shortly after the expiration of a 30-hour "Easter truce" declared by Moscow, triggering air raid alerts in Kyiv and other cities. Local authorities urged residents to seek shelter amid the escalating threat, with reports of explosions in Mykolaiv. While Russia has not commented on the reported attacks, both sides had previously accused each other of violating the ceasefire. US President Donald Trump expressed hope for a deal between Russia and Ukraine this week, but provided no specifics. Optimism score: 20</p>
