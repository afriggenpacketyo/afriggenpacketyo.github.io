          <p>In Tachikawa, western Tokyo, two men were arrested after breaking into Daisan Elementary School, resulting in minor injuries to five teachers and damage to a window. According to investigative sources, the suspects were called to the school by a parent who was there for a consultation, and no children were harmed during the incident. The Metropolitan Police Department arrested the two men, one in his 20s and the other in his 40s, on suspicion of assault, as the school has an enrollment of around 520 children as of April of last year. Police are investigating the motives behind the disturbance.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a trade agreement with Britain, marking the first deal since imposing tariffs on trading partners. A senior British official confirmed the agreement, noting its potential benefits for both nations, as details remain unclear, discussions have involved lowering British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, and removing taxes on U.S. technology companies. Timothy C. Brightbill suggests the announcement may outline negotiation frameworks for issues like tariff rates, nontariff barriers, and digital trade, with Britain also seeking to lift tariffs on steel, aluminum, and automobiles.</p>

          <p>Despite reporting stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profits, Danish shipping giant Maersk has revised its global container market volume growth forecast for 2025 due to increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, particularly U.S.-China trade tariffs. The company's underlying EBITDA for the first three months of the year was $2.71 billion, up 70% from the previous year, and while Maersk kept its 2025 profit guidance unchanged, it now anticipates container market volume growth between -1% and 4%, compared to the previous forecast of 4%. Maersk CEO Vincent Clerc noted that the trade tensions are primarily a China-U.S. issue and have not yet affected other trade lanes.</p>

The company has factored in the impact of these policies for two months through May, and the tariffs could significantly affect Toyota's performance, as the United States remains its largest market.</p>

The Switch 2 will launch in June at $449.99 with improved features, and investors are hopeful that Nintendo can continue its popularity wave, though pre-orders were delayed in the U.S. due to President Trump's tariffs on countries where Nintendo consoles are manufactured, such as Vietnam.</p>

          <p>According to The New York Times, Britain is set to become the first country to sign a trade deal with the U.S. after the U.S. announced stiff tariffs against various nations. While details remain uncertain, it is speculated that the agreement could either be a finalized deal or a framework for future negotiations, and while the U.K. was spared from higher tariffs, it still faces a baseline 10% levy. U.S. Vice President JD Vance expressed confidence in securing a beneficial trade deal with the U.S., though President Trump has recently contradicted White House officials by stating that the U.S. does not need to sign deals.</p>

          <p>Chinese defense stocks have surged as tensions escalate between India and Pakistan, spurred by Pakistan's alleged use of China-made weapons to down Indian jets. Pakistan's Foreign Minister claimed that Chinese-made J-10C fighter jets were deployed in a clash with India's air force, leading to significant gains for AVIC Chengdu Aircraft and AVIC Aerospace. Shares of China State Shipbuilding Corporation, which builds military and civilian vessels, also saw a slight increase, and Pakistan is the largest buyer of Chinese arms, including fighter jets, air defense systems, naval vessels, and UAVs.</p>

Robinson's attorney has described the lawsuit as a $50 million extortion attempt, calling the allegations vile and false, and promising to ask the court to dismiss the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Smokey Robinson's lawyer has vehemently denied sexual assault allegations made by four women, labeling the lawsuit an attempt to extract millions of dollars from the Motown singer. The lawsuit, filed by former housekeepers, accuses Robinson of sexual assault and his wife of turning a blind eye, and the women claim they feared reporting the incidents due to their immigration status. Robinson's lawyer, Christopher Frost, has stated that he will soon ask a judge to dismiss the lawsuit and will have more to say on the matter, as the accusations are being depicted as vile and false.</p>

          <p>As tensions rise between India and Pakistan, the military strengths of the two nuclear-armed neighbors are under scrutiny, with India possessing one of the largest militaries in the world, while Pakistan has become heavily militarized despite an economic crisis. India's defense expenditure reached £58 billion ($77.4 billion) in 2024, and the country has approximately 1.5 million active service personnel, while Pakistan fields about 660,000 active service personnel and has leaned heavily on China for arms. While India's military is increasingly deployed to face China, Pakistan has built its defense posture and doctrine almost entirely around India.</p>
