          <p>A federal judge in Maryland ordered the government to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the U.S. by April 7th.  Garcia, a Maryland resident with protected legal status, was deported to El Salvador in error as part of a disputed $6 million deal. The Justice Department denied the existence of such a contract, while the judge inferred its existence based on statements by Secretary of State Rubio and DHS Secretary Noem. This case highlights concerns about due process and the treatment of immigrants under the Trump administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump’s high tariffs create a massive arbitrage opportunity, potentially leading to widespread smuggling.  The limited capacity of U.S. customs enforcement makes it difficult to combat the influx of goods from countries with lower prices. This situation mirrors the bootlegging era of Prohibition, with goods flowing across borders to circumvent high tariffs.  The author argues that this situation will ultimately lead to the collapse of Trump's tariff scheme.</p>

          <p>India's parliament passed a bill amending laws governing Muslim land endowments (waqfs), sparking controversy.  The government claims the changes aim to combat corruption and promote diversity by including non-Muslims on waqf boards and increasing government oversight.  However, critics argue this undermines Muslim rights and could lead to the confiscation of religious sites. The bill's passage has heightened concerns about the marginalization of India's Muslim minority.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced another day of significant declines, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq falling nearly 6%, extending losses for the week.  While there was a brief recovery after Trump's comments about Vietnam, the market's downward trend resumed following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech.  Powell's acknowledgment of the tariffs' negative impact on inflation and growth disappointed investors.  However, homebuilder stocks outperformed the broader market, potentially reflecting the possibility of lower mortgage rates due to falling bond yields. (not investment advice)</p>
