          <p>US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth addressed the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, characterizing China as an imminent threat to Taiwan and urging Asian countries to boost their defense spending and collaborate with the US to deter war. Hegseth stated that China seeks to become a hegemonic power and is actively preparing to use military force to alter the balance of power in Asia, referencing a 2027 deadline allegedly given by President Xi Jinping for China's military to be capable of invading Taiwan. In response, the Chinese embassy in Singapore accused the US of being the "biggest troublemaker" for regional peace, citing US military activities in the South China Sea. Hegseth also cautioned Asian countries against seeking economic ties with China, saying Beijing would use it as leverage. The US aims to forge a strong shield of deterrence with allies to prevent war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hamas has submitted its response to the latest ceasefire proposal by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, reiterating its demands for a permanent ceasefire, complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip, and the assurance of continuous humanitarian aid. The group's hostage exchange proposal includes the release of 10 living hostages and the bodies of 18 dead hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz warned Hamas to accept the terms of the deal or face destruction, emphasizing the IDF's continued activity in Gaza. Since the start of the conflict on October 7, 2023, over 54,000 people in Gaza have been killed, and at least 20 hostages remain in Hamas captivity.</p>

Clips from the interview are still available on the official Late Show account on YouTube, with one video having 17 million views. This is not the first time Trump has made this claim, as he previously posted the same video in 2018. Trump has repeatedly expressed his displeasure with CBS' 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris and has sued the network for $20 million, claiming "deceitful editing."</p>

          <p>Obese patients in England and Wales are being denied hip and knee replacements due to their BMI, despite NICE guidelines stating BMI should not restrict access to surgery. Patients are required to lose weight before being eligible, but waiting lists for NHS weight loss programs are long, and some services have closed. The Royal College of Surgeons criticized the policy, warning it could cost patients their mobility, while a former health minister called for more action to tackle the obesity crisis. Research indicates that financial pressures drive the use of BMI thresholds, creating inequalities in access to care.</p>

Kennedy Jr., now the nation's top health official, has declared autism an "epidemic" and launched a federal effort to find the environmental toxin responsible for the rise in autism rates.

They have identified hundreds of genes associated with autism, building a case that genetics are the primary driver. Researchers fear Kennedy's fixation on outside toxins could distract from genetic research that has facilitated the development of new therapies for those with profound autism.</p>

The Trump administration denied Milwaukee's request for support after laying off the lead exposure team within the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health. Milwaukee has pushed ahead with its own inspections and lead water service line replacements, but local officials lack the federal expertise to guide their epidemiological investigations. This situation highlights the potential consequences of a federal government that is unwilling to respond to health crises, leaving cities to fend for themselves.</p>

Employees who feel like they're lower-status tend to use more jargon. There's jargon that won't die, like "synergy," but new words buzz all the time. Buzzwords are really about people using poetry to distract from the fact that all they're doing is trying to make money, because that's all most buzzwords are — metaphors.

While the militant group says it will release 10 living and 18 deceased hostages still held in Gaza, there appear to be other details that need to be worked out before a ceasefire is declared. Hamas is still seeking other demands, according to reports in Arab and Israeli media, wanting a comprehensive withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a permanent end to the war. More than 54,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel since the war began nearly 20 months ago when Hamas militants attacked Israel, killing about 1,200.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to unveil a major review of the military, the strategic defence review, amid concerns about a "new, dangerous era" with a malevolent Russia and uncertainty over US commitment to European defense. The review will underline the importance of nuclear weapons, the UK's commitment to Nato, and modernizing the forces. It will also stress the need for greater public participation in protecting the country, including announcements about British industry creating more defense kit, expanding the cadet forces, and bolstering the number of men and women in the military reserves. Critics suggest the review may not bring about substantial changes in capability, despite the government's ambitious rhetoric.</p>
