        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool has reportedly accepted a deal worth approximately £65.5 million from Bayern Munich for Colombian forward Luis Diaz. The 28-year-old was left out of a recent pre-season match amid the transfer speculation and has been permitted to travel for a medical examination. This move follows Liverpool's recent acquisitions of forwards Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike, as they reshape their attacking lineup. Diaz joined Liverpool in 2022 and had his most prolific scoring season in 2024-25, netting 17 goals across all competitions.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is celebrating a successful weekend as two of its major films, "Superman" and "F1," each crossed the $500 million threshold in worldwide ticket sales. The success of "Superman" is a significant early victory for the new leadership at DC Studios, marking their first major theatrical release under a new 10-year plan. For Apple, which Warner Bros. distributed "F1" for, this achievement establishes a new record for its highest-grossing theatrical release, underscoring the benefits of its strategic partnership with IMAX for the film's production and exhibition.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump held trade discussions with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at his Turnberry resort in Scotland. Trump expressed that there was a 50-50 chance of striking a major trade deal, a sentiment echoed by positive signals from senior EU officials. The meeting occurs under the threat of significant U.S. tariffs on EU goods if an agreement is not reached, potentially leading to a trade war. The visit also includes planned meetings with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Thomas Massie and Democratic Representative Ro Khanna are jointly pushing for the release of documents from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, extending beyond a single reported letter. Massie argued for obtaining financial records and details of Epstein's plea bargain to "follow the money." The bipartisan pair is seeking a discharge petition to force a House vote on legislation that would mandate the release of the files, with protections to redact victims' names. This effort comes amid criticism of House Speaker Mike Johnson for adjourning for recess, which delayed a potential vote.</p>

          <p>Disney and Marvel's "Fantastic Four: First Steps" achieved a successful opening weekend, earning an estimated $118 million in domestic ticket sales and $218 million globally. This strong performance, alongside the recent success of "Superman," suggests that well-made superhero films can still attract large audiences, countering narratives of "superhero fatigue." The film's positive reception, with an 88% "Fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, marks a potential turning point for Marvel, which has seen inconsistent box office results and critical reviews for some of its recent post-"Endgame" releases.</p>

          <p>U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson stated he would have "great pause" about any potential pardon or sentence commutation for Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking.

          <p>CBS's decision to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in 2026 is fueling debate about the viability of the traditional late-night talk show format. While some view it as a one-off financial decision, others see it as a sign of broader industry pressures from declining TV ad revenue and shifting viewer habits. The genre faces mounting production costs against a backdrop of dwindling linear TV audiences, with much of the remaining ad spend gravitating toward live sports. The future of "Jimmy Kimmel Live" at Disney, with a contract ending in 2026, is now seen as the next major test for the genre's survival.</p>

          <p>According to a BBC analysis, Israel's recent announcement of a "tactical pause" in Gaza and aid airdrops is more of a political gesture than a solution to the humanitarian crisis. The move is seen as a response to intense international condemnation from key allies like Britain, France, and Germany, who have blamed Israel for the starvation in Gaza. The analysis argues that these measures are insufficient and that Israel's claims of not restricting aid are not accepted by the UN or its own allies. The UN and other agencies refuse to cooperate with the new Israeli-backed GHF aid system, calling it inhumane and militarized.</p>

Analysts suggest a "K-shaped" economy is emerging, where lower-income consumers are pulling back on spending due to economic uncertainty and high interest rates.

          <p>The United States and China are reportedly set to extend their current tariff truce by another three months during trade negotiations in Stockholm. The original 90-day suspension of most tariffs, agreed upon in May, was due to expire on August 12. According to sources, the extension will involve a commitment from both nations to refrain from imposing new tariffs or otherwise escalating the trade conflict. While the talks are not expected to yield major breakthroughs on specific issues like industrial overcapacity, they aim to maintain a de-escalated environment for continued dialogue.</p>

          <p>Verdence Capital Advisors CIO Megan Horneman has issued a warning that the stock market, currently trading at record highs, is overly complacent and "pricing in the perfect situation." She points to significant risks, including the looming August 1 trade deadline with the EU, uncertainty over Federal Reserve policy, and technically overbought conditions, particularly in growth stocks. Horneman suggests that if the prospect of rate cuts diminishes and trade tensions escalate, the market could be vulnerable to a valuation correction. She advises investors to ensure their portfolios are appropriately allocated to navigate the potential volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Rhode Island has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from imposing new funding restrictions on organizations that serve vulnerable populations. The lawsuit, brought by a nationwide coalition including six Rhode Island groups, challenges requirements that force grant recipients to align with the administration's views on gender identity and diversity. The groups argued the conditions would force them to abandon inclusive practices or censor support for transgender people. The ruling is a critical, temporary victory for providers serving domestic abuse survivors, LGBTQI+ youth, and unhoused communities.</p>

          <p>A protest by approximately 300 demonstrators on the Greek island of Syros successfully prevented an Israeli cruise ship from docking, sparking a heated national debate. The protestors, carrying Palestinian flags, gathered to show that greeting Israeli tourists was unacceptable while Palestinians in Gaza face starvation. The incident has highlighted a split in Greek public opinion, with some condemning the protest as racist while others support it as a statement against the Israeli government's actions. The event reflects a broader shift in sentiment, as recent polls show support for the Palestinian side has grown in Greece during the conflict.</p>

          <p>A joint investigation by CBS News and the Marshall Project has found that new mothers are having their lives turned upside down by routine hospital drug tests that can produce false positives. The report highlights cases where mothers lost custody of their newborns after testing positive for opiates from ingesting common foods like poppy seed bagels. Despite a Supreme Court ruling limiting non-consensual testing for law enforcement purposes, many hospitals test routinely, and laws in at least 27 states require them to report positive results to child welfare authorities, often before a more accurate confirmatory test is completed.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in fighting in three populated areas of Gaza to allow aid agencies to use secure land routes. This move comes in response to mounting international pressure and warnings of famine, with recent images of emaciated children fanning global criticism. While the UN's food agency welcomed the step, it reiterated that a full ceasefire is necessary to properly address the crisis. The Hamas-run Health Ministry reported six new deaths from malnutrition as the pause began, and Israel stated its offensive would continue in other areas.</p>

The plan includes a one-time $1,000 government contribution for children born within a specific timeframe, with funds growing and being withdrawable tax-free after age 18. However, some financial analysts argue that while the initial bonus is appealing, other established methods like 529 education plans and Roth IRAs offer more significant long-term benefits. Whole life insurance policies are also presented as a powerful alternative for locking in low premiums. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent global trials of a four-day, 32-hour workweek have shown significant boosts in employee happiness, and the reason extends beyond just having more free time. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, a key factor is that the compressed schedule forces employees and teams to become more effective and productive. By eliminating busywork and streamlining processes, workers feel more in control and successful in their roles, which enhances their overall well-being. This sense of increased professional competence and team spirit is a powerful, and previously unexpected, driver of the positive outcomes observed in the studies.</p>
