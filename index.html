          <p>Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have seen an 86% surge in SUV sales volume in South Africa between January and August, capturing 15% of the market. This growth is primarily driven by brands like Chery and Haval. While Japanese leaders Toyota and Suzuki still hold larger volumes, their individual market dominance is declining. This shift indicates a significant change in consumer preference and market dynamics within the South African automotive sector.</p>

          <p>President Trump has commuted the prison sentence of former New York Republican Congressman George Santos, who was serving over seven years for wire fraud and identity theft. Trump stated Santos was "horribly mistreated" in prison and would be released immediately. Santos' attorney expressed gratitude, while Congressman Nick LaLota criticized the decision, arguing Santos' crimes warranted a longer sentence. This commutation, not a pardon, means Santos' record remains, sparking debate over justice and political influence.</p>

          <p>Extreme damage from Typhoon Halong in remote Alaska villages could displace over 2,000 residents for at least 18 months. Governor Mike Dunleavy's request for a major disaster declaration highlighted the destruction, with 90% of homes in Kipnuk destroyed and many others uninhabitable. Federal and state officials are working to airlift evacuees to Anchorage and secure temporary housing, facing challenges due to the harsh Arctic climate. The long-term displacement signifies a profound disruption to the lives and traditional lifestyles of these Alaska Native communities.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holding's cloud unit has introduced Aegaeon, a computing pooling solution that reportedly cut the number of Nvidia GPUs needed for its AI models by 82%. Beta testing showed a reduction from 1,192 to 213 Nvidia H20 GPUs for serving dozens of models up to 72 billion parameters. This innovation, detailed in a research article, addresses resource inefficiency in cloud services where many AI models are served concurrently but some are only sporadically used.

          <p>This article honors Liu Huaqing, the former commander of the Chinese navy, as a revered strategist and visionary technocrat. Liu is credited with directing the comprehensive modernization of China’s naval forces to world-class standards, earning comparisons to American strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan. Born in 1916, Liu joined the Red Army at 13 and rose through the ranks before being transferred to the newly established PLA Navy in 1952. His leadership laid the foundation for China's "blue sea strategy," transforming its naval capabilities.</p>

          <p>The Orionid meteor shower is set to peak next week, offering a "fireworks spectacle" visible until November 7, with the best viewing between midnight and dawn. These fast-moving meteors, originating from Halley's Comet debris, are known for their bright, long streaks of light. Viewers can expect around 15 meteors per hour during the peak around October 22. To best experience this celestial event, observers are advised to find a dark spot away from city lights and look towards the constellation of Orion after midnight, without the need for binoculars or telescopes.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, under the Trump administration, has terminated a consent order that prohibited Citibank from discriminating against its Armenian American customers. The order, which mandated $24.5 million in penalties and redress, was ended three years early, with the agency citing Citibank's compliance and steps to prevent future violations. Citibank had been accused of applying stricter criteria or blocking accounts for applicants with Armenian surnames, with some employees using derogatory terms. California Senator Adam Schiff criticized the decision, viewing it as prioritizing corporations over victims of discrimination.</p>

          <p>A community clinic near Johannesburg has become a flashpoint in South Africa, where the anti-migrant group Operation Dudula is blocking foreigners from accessing public health facilities. Activists demand South African IDs, turning away those with passports from neighboring countries, despite the constitution guaranteeing healthcare for all residents. The group, now a political party, argues for prioritizing South Africans due to overburdened public systems and limited resources. Human rights lawyers condemn these actions as deeply problematic and lawless, while the government struggles to intervene effectively against the growing movement.</p>

          <p>Ahead of Diwali and Dhanteras, India's traditional gold-buying festivals, the market is bustling despite soaring gold prices, which have topped $1,440 for 10g. Jewellers are adapting by designing lighter, more elaborate pieces to counter stagnant customer budgets. A significant trend this year is a shift towards buying gold and silver for investment rather than solely for jewelry, reflected in bullion market data and a surge in gold ETFs. India's central bank is also a major buyer, diversifying foreign exchange holdings. While volumes may fall, value demand is expected to hold up, though some families are priced out.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant turnaround in its fentanyl epidemic, with fatal overdoses falling by 25% in 2024, saving nearly 30,000 lives. This decline is largely attributed to a commitment to harm reduction policies, which prioritize drug users' health over criminalization. North Carolina, a leader in this trend, utilizes programs like law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD) and expanded access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT) like methadone. Naloxone, an overdose reversal drug, has also been administered over 16,000 times, further contributing to the reduction in fatalities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The North Pacific Ocean experienced its warmest summer on record, with sea surface temperatures over 0.25C above the 2022 high, spanning an area ten times the Mediterranean. Climate scientists are puzzled by this "warm blob," as temperatures exceed most climate model predictions. While natural variability plays a role, researchers suggest a recent change in shipping fuels, reducing Sun-reflecting aerosols, might be a primary factor. This marine heatwave has already impacted weather in Japan, South Korea, and the US, and could potentially lead to a colder early winter in the UK and Europe.</p>

Tesla's board disagreed, urging shareholders to approve the plan. This recommendation comes ahead of the November 5 annual meeting and follows a Delaware court ruling that rescinded Musk's 2018 pay package, which is currently under appeal.

His crew testified they were duped into the operation, believing they were fishermen. Prosecutors highlighted the sophistication of the weapons, which fueled Houthi attacks on international shipping.

          <p>Los Angeles County has tentatively agreed to pay an additional $828 million to settle over 400 more sexual assault claims against county employees, following a historic $4 billion settlement in April. These claims, dating back decades, allege mistreatment and sexual assault in foster care and juvenile detention facilities. The settlements stem from a 2020 California law that suspended the statute of limitations for childhood sexual assault victims. Authorities are also investigating allegations of fraud, where some plaintiffs were reportedly paid to file claims.
