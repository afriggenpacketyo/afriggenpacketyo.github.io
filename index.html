          <p>The U.S. government is collaborating with L3Harris Technologies to modify a used Qatari government jumbo jet, potentially serving as the new presidential plane due to ongoing delays with Boeing's retrofit of two 747s. Former President Trump, frustrated by Boeing's delays and over $2 billion in cost overruns, hinted at considering alternatives. Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg stated they are working with the customer to revise the program plan for earlier delivery while maintaining safety and quality. The White House and both L3Harris and Boeing have declined to comment on the matter, leaving the future of the Air Force One replacement uncertain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With rising inflation and high interest rates, many Americans struggle with debt, leading to increased credit card debt and delinquencies. Defaulting on debt, typically after 90-180 days of missed payments, can severely damage credit scores, leading to difficulties in securing loans and other financial products. Creditors may pursue debt collections, legal action, wage garnishment, or property liens, and added fees can quickly inflate the outstanding balance. It's crucial to contact creditors early to explore hardship programs and consider debt relief options like consolidation loans or credit counseling to avoid the long-term financial and emotional stress of defaulting.

Ultimately, policies that prioritize children's access to food, housing, healthcare, and education are seen as more effective in creating a pro-child society.</p>

          <p>A minerals deal between the United States and Ukraine could channel significant funds into a joint investment fund to aid Ukraine's reconstruction post-war. However, the actual extraction and profit generation from Ukraine's untapped resources may take years, and the deal lacks security guarantees that Ukraine sought. The nine-page agreement establishes a fund jointly managed by Kyiv and Washington, with revenues from new mineral, oil, and gas projects. While the deal aims to tie former President Trump to Ukraine's future, its specifics remain vague, and Ukrainian officials express hesitation due to the lack of detail.</p>

          <p>Colleges are increasingly relying on consultants, often owned by private equity firms like EAB and Ruffalo Noel Levitz (RNL), to find applicants and calculate scholarships, influencing the price families pay. These firms use algorithms to offer precision-guided discounts based on applicant quality, tracking digital interactions and gathering extensive data. Critics argue this “financial aid optimization” resembles arbitrage, potentially disadvantaging lower-income families. While these consultants help colleges attract students and manage data, concerns are growing about the ethics and potential for algorithmic collusion in college pricing.</p>

          <h2>Automakers Report Sales Surge Amid Tariff Fears</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Automakers like Ford, Hyundai, and Kia reported significant year-over-year U.S. sales increases in April, driven by consumers rushing to purchase new vehicles ahead of potential price hikes due to tariffs. This "tariff fear-buying" was supported by special discounts and promises not to raise prices. However, demand slowed in late April as inventories tightened and prices increased, leading to concerns about lower sales in the future. While automakers benefited from the consumer rush, the long-term impact of tariffs on the auto market remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Health organizations are calling for urgent government action to protect babies and children from nutritionally poor, sugar-laden food, advocating for stronger regulation of the baby food market. This follows a BBC Panorama investigation that found baby food pouches from leading UK brands failed to meet key nutritional needs. The Obesity Health Alliance (OHA) urges mandatory sugar limits on baby food and drinks, schemes to help low-income families access healthy food, and sugar warnings on food labels. The letter also warned of "a worsening health crisis", with more children shifting from a healthy weight to being overweight or obese while at primary school, particularly in poorer areas.</p>
