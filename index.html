          <p>Hurricane Iona has become the first hurricane of the season in the central Pacific Ocean, rapidly intensifying from a tropical storm. Currently a Category 1 storm, it is located hundreds of miles southeast of Honolulu and is not expected to pose a direct threat to the Hawaiian Islands. Forecasters anticipate Iona will strengthen to a Category 2 hurricane before gradually weakening as it moves westward over the next few days. The storm follows several others in the eastern Pacific, highlighting an active hurricane season in the region.</p>

          <p>University of Colorado football coach Deion Sanders has disclosed that he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of bladder cancer, which required surgery to remove his bladder. Despite the serious health challenge, his oncologist now considers him cured, and Sanders has affirmed his intention to coach the team this season. The 57-year-old coach, who has previously dealt with significant health issues including foot surgeries and blood clots, shared the news to address recent absences. He has returned to campus and is preparing for the upcoming season, which begins in late August.</p>

          <p>The American Medical Association (AMA) has voiced "deep concern" following reports that the Trump administration may dismiss all members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). The independent panel provides crucial, evidence-based recommendations for preventive care, such as cancer screenings, which influence insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act. This move follows the recent firing of an entire vaccine advisory committee, raising fears of political interference in public health. An HHS spokesperson stated that no final decision has been made on the task force's future.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell's lawyers have petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to hear an appeal of her 2021 sex trafficking conviction, arguing it violates a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) made with Jeffrey Epstein. The defense contends the agreement, which they claim promised immunity to Epstein's co-conspirators, should be honored nationwide and was not limited to Florida. Federal prosecutors maintain the NPA was geographically restricted to Florida and does not apply to the New York case against Maxwell. The appeal emphasizes that trust in the justice system relies on the government honoring its agreements.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles luxury real estate market is demonstrating significant strength, highlighted by Paris Hilton and Carter Reum's recent $63 million purchase of a Beverly Hills mansion. This sale, along with several other multi-million dollar deals, has positioned California at the forefront of the nation's most expensive home sales for the month. Real estate agents attribute the robust market to demand from buyers displaced by wildfires and increasing interest from foreign investors, particularly from China. The activity suggests a continuing trend of high-value transactions in exclusive neighborhoods like Beverly Hills and Bel Air.</p>

          <p>Scotland's First Minister, John Swinney, has declared that securing a majority of Scottish National Party (SNP) seats in the 2026 Holyrood election is the only pathway to a second independence referendum. He asserted that independence will be the central theme of the SNP's campaign, arguing that a democratic mandate would pressure the UK government to grant another vote. Critics from opposing parties and even a former SNP official have questioned the strategy, suggesting the party has run out of ideas and is not as popular as it was before the 2014 referendum.</p>

          <p>A five-day walkout by resident doctors in the UK has led to a record number of "derogation" requests from hospitals, asking for striking staff to return to work due to patient safety concerns. NHS England reported 58 such requests, with the British Medical Association (BMA) stating hospitals asked for over 125 doctors to come off picket lines. The BMA claims some requests were inappropriate, as trusts had not adequately planned for the strike, while the NHS argues that delays or refusals by the union risk patient safety. The strike is part of an ongoing dispute over pay.</p>
