          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed former judge and Fox News host Jeanine Pirro to the position of U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia in a 50-45 vote. The confirmation occurred amid a contentious political climate, with Senate Republicans pushing through a small number of President Trump's nominees before a recess. Democrats raised objections to Pirro's nomination, citing her past defense of Trump's 2020 election fraud claims and her potential to politicize the office, which led to a walkout during her committee hearing.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the dismissal of Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after the July jobs report showed weaker-than-expected hiring and significant downward revisions for previous months. Trump alleged the numbers were inaccurate and politically motivated, a claim disputed by economists who warned the move threatens the integrity of nonpartisan federal data. The firing drew criticism from both policy experts and some Republican lawmakers, who expressed concern about politicizing economic statistics that are crucial for market stability.

          <p>A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts federal immigration agents from conducting "roving" raids based on factors like race or speaking Spanish. The decision affirms that agents must have reasonable suspicion before detaining individuals, a ruling stemming from lawsuits against Trump administration sweeps in Southern California. While immigrant advocates praised the decision for protecting constitutional rights, the Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling, stating it undermines their efforts to remove criminals and that arrests are based on illegal status, not ethnicity.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel has initiated an investigation into Jack Smith, the former special counsel who led probes into Donald Trump, for potential violations of the Hatch Act. The inquiry follows a referral from Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's prosecutorial actions were politically motivated to harm Trump's 2024 election prospects. The Hatch Act restricts the political activities of federal employees, and this investigation will examine whether Smith's conduct constituted illegal political interference before he resigned in January.</p>

          <p>Fifteen people were arrested following clashes between anti-migrant groups and counter-demonstrators at protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers across England. Demonstrations in London, Newcastle, and Manchester saw significant police presence to manage the confrontations, with several arrests made for public order offenses. The protests come as the government announces plans to phase out the use of hotels for asylum seekers by 2029, a move it claims will save £1 billion annually while it works to reform the asylum system.</p>

          <p>Rangers head coach Russell Martin publicly lambasted his players' performance following a disappointing 1-1 draw against Motherwell in their first league match of the season.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered a strong performance in his first start after a long stint on the injured list, striking out eight batters over five innings. However, his return was spoiled by two home runs from Tampa Bay's Yandy Díaz, who took advantage of the short right-field wall at the Rays' temporary ballpark, leading to a 4-0 Dodgers loss. Despite the result, Snell's effective pitching and command were promising signs for the Dodgers' rotation as they look toward the postseason.</p>
