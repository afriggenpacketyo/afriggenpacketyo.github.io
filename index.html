          <p>Senator Josh Hawley has been a key figure in advocating for the reauthorization and expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA). The Senate's version of the "One Big Beautiful Bill" includes a significant expansion of RECA, potentially compensating individuals in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alaska, along with "downwinders" exposed to nuclear radiation. This expansion aims to cover those affected by toxic waste exposure, and the proposal also allows claims for increased atmospheric testing and adds uranium mine workers to the eligible beneficiaries. Hawley views this as a major victory for those affected by nuclear exposure, emphasizing the country's support for them. The optimism score is intended to reflect the positive impact of this legislative progress on affected communities.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has declined to rehear President Trump's challenge to a $5 million civil judgment, which stemmed from a 2023 jury verdict finding him liable for battery and defamation of writer E. Jean Carroll. The case involved Carroll's claim that Trump attacked her in the 1990s and subsequently defamed her by denying the incident. While a three-judge panel initially declined to overturn the judgment, Trump sought a hearing before the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, which was ultimately denied. Carroll's attorney expressed satisfaction with the decision, emphasizing that Trump remains liable for sexual assault and defamation; he is also appealing a separate $83 million defamation award to Carroll.</p>

          <p>The recent fatal crash of an Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner in Ahmedabad, India, has ignited discussions regarding aviation safety. The crash, which killed all but one of the 242 people on board, occurred shortly after takeoff and involved the aircraft hitting a medical staff hostel. Authorities have launched a formal investigation, focusing on the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder to determine the cause, which could range from human error to technical malfunction. In response, India's aviation regulator has ordered safety checks on the entire Boeing-787 fleet, and the incident has renewed concerns about air safety in the world's fourth-largest and rapidly expanding air market.</p>

          <p>Israel launched a major operation against Iran, targeting nuclear facilities, scientists, and military commanders, which prompted a retaliatory response from Iran, launching over 100 drones at Israel. The U.S. Secretary of State stated that the U.S. was not involved in Israel's strikes, and warned Iran not to target U.S. interests. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that the IDF had begun "Operation Rising Lion," aiming to diminish the Iranian threat to Israel's survival. This exchange has heightened concerns about an escalating regional conflict, potentially involving other actors like the Houthis in Yemen and impacting U.S.-Iran nuclear talks.</p>

The University of Michigan's survey of consumers indicated across-the-board improvements, with the headline index rising to 60.5, surpassing expectations. This improvement coincided with a softening in rhetoric surrounding President Trump's tariffs, leading to a 90-day negotiation period that showed promise, particularly with China.

          <p>Israel's strikes on Iran and Iran's subsequent response have sent tremors through global financial markets, with oil prices surging. This surge has raised concerns about a potential period of higher energy prices, affecting everything from petrol and food to holidays. The attacks prompted an immediate market reaction, with Brent Crude rising before settling around $75 a barrel; the situation is very significant and concerning. The key factors determining the long-term impact include the duration of the conflict, involvement of other countries, and potential disruptions to shipping in the Strait of Hormuz.</p>

          <p>Following Israeli strikes on military leaders and nuclear sites, Iran has declared it considers the attacks a "declaration of war." Experts suggest that a diplomatic de-escalation appears unlikely, and Iran's Supreme Leader has vowed a "bitter and painful" fate for Israel. The situation stems from a lack of effective diplomacy between Iran and the US in nuclear negotiations, allowing Israel to act undiplomatically. While Iran has spread its nuclear facilities across multiple locations, its response to the strikes could involve striking back, potentially targeting US facilities if the US is believed to be involved.</p>

The real danger, according to the analysis, is the potential for the military to begin seeing itself as an independent actor with its own political interests, which could undermine the foundations of American democracy.</p>

          <p>Psychological research suggests that far-right narratives about social breakdown, as seen in the context of the LA immigration protests, could lead to increased support for US President Trump and authoritarianism.

Studies indicate that people who perceive society as unstable are more likely to favor authoritarian leaders who promise order and control. Reducing fear and insecurity and clarifying the meaning and purpose of politics may help counteract the appetite for authoritarian leadership.</p>

          <p>Tesla has announced new versions of its Model S and Model X vehicles in the U.S., accompanied by a $5,000 price increase. The upgraded cars feature enhancements including better battery range, improved aerodynamics, and aesthetic upgrades. Tesla is touting a 410-mile range for its Model S Long Range, achieved through new wheel designs and a more aerodynamic car body. The new vehicles also include a new suspension design for a smoother ride and improved interior noise cancellation, although some owners are rethinking purchases due to CEO Elon Musk's public persona (not investment advice).</p>
