          <p>Brandon Blackstock, the ex-husband of singer Kelly Clarkson, passed away at 48 from melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer, after a three-year battle. Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the U.S., and melanoma has a significantly higher chance of spreading to other parts of the body compared to other types. Experts emphasize that early detection through regular skin checks is crucial, as melanoma is almost always curable with surgical removal in its initial stages. Prevention methods include using broad-spectrum sunscreen, wearing protective clothing, and avoiding indoor tanning beds.</p>

          <p>England winger Jack Grealish has completed a season-long loan move from Manchester City to Everton, becoming the club's sixth summer signing. The 29-year-old stated that conversations with manager David Moyes were key to his decision, expressing excitement to join the club and repay the support from fans. Grealish, who joined City for a record £100m in 2021, fell out of favor last season and aims to rejuvenate his career at Everton. The move also provides him an opportunity to regain his spot in the England national squad.</p>

The slain officer, David Rose, was a 33-year-old Marine veteran and a recent police academy graduate. Documents found at the gunman's home revealed his discontent with COVID-19 vaccinations as a potential motive for the attack.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has intensified his pressure on the Federal Reserve, threatening a "major lawsuit" against Chairman Jerome Powell and demanding an immediate interest rate cut. In a social media post, Trump criticized Powell's management of renovations at the Fed's headquarters, calling him a "loser" and blaming him for incalculable damage due to being "Too Late" on policy decisions. The Fed has kept rates steady in 2025 after several cuts in 2024, defying Trump's demands for more aggressive reductions to lower government borrowing costs.</p>

Economists suggest that the effects of the Trump administration's tariff policies are becoming more evident in the prices of goods like household furnishings and apparel.

          <p>A new UK law requiring online platforms to implement age verification to prevent children from accessing adult material has generated significant controversy. The Online Safety Act has led major pornographic sites to block UK visitors who do not verify their age, while other platforms like Spotify and Reddit have also introduced checks. The measures have faced backlash from users over privacy concerns and have drawn criticism from U.S. politicians like Vice President JD Vance and House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, who fear the law infringes on free expression and unfairly targets American tech companies.</p>

          <p>Liverpool is reportedly increasing its efforts to sign Crystal Palace and England center-back Marc Guehi before the summer transfer window closes. With only a year left on his contract, Palace's chairman has indicated the 25-year-old captain could be sold to avoid losing him on a free transfer next year. While initial talks have been held, sources suggest Guehi may need convincing that a move to Anfield is the right step for his career. The amount of playing time he would receive will be a critical factor in his decision, especially in a World Cup year.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis argues that proposed federal cuts to Medicaid, estimated to cause 10 million Americans to lose health insurance, will shift costs onto other parts of society rather than eliminate them. Uninsured individuals often turn to federally qualified health centers and hospital emergency rooms, placing financial strain on these institutions. Hospitals, acting as "insurers of last resort," provide billions in uncompensated care, costs which are indirectly subsidized by taxpayers. Furthermore, a lack of insurance is linked to increased medical debt, personal bankruptcy, and poorer health outcomes, which ultimately reduces overall economic productivity.

          <p>This article argues that the Trump administration's recent focus on protecting eagles from wind turbines is a disingenuous tactic to obstruct renewable energy development. While turbines do pose a threat to birds, the author notes that far greater dangers include climate change, cats, and buildings. The piece points out the irony that the administration is simultaneously weakening broader environmental protections that have been crucial for the bald eagle's recovery. The administration's actions, such as opening up wilderness to drilling and cutting bird-monitoring funds, suggest its true priority is not wildlife conservation but rather undermining the wind power industry.</p>

Despite posting a net loss due to non-cash IPO-related charges, the strong top-line growth reflects increasing interest from financial institutions, especially following supportive crypto legislation signed by the Trump administration.

According to the arrest warrant, Pinkerton told the victims, aged 13 to 19, that it was normal for a pastor to kiss boys on the lips.

If Ukraine's President Zelensky rejects such a one-sided deal, he could be cast as the obstacle to peace, potentially leading Trump to turn against Kyiv.
