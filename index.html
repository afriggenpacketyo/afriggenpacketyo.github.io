        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced his intention to change how international law, particularly Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, is interpreted in British courts. The goal is to prevent unsuccessful asylum seekers and foreign criminals from avoiding deportation by claiming their home country's prison or healthcare systems are inferior to the UK's. Starmer stated this is a necessary response to modern mass migration challenges, emphasizing that genuine refugees would still be protected, while aiming to streamline the removal of those without a right to remain. This move is seen as part of a broader strategy to appear tough on immigration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Representative Ralph Norman and several Republican colleagues have reintroduced a proposal for a constitutional amendment that would prevent members of Congress from receiving their salaries during a government shutdown. The resolution argues that if federal workers are impacted by funding lapses, lawmakers should not be exempt from the financial consequences of failing to pass appropriations bills. This "No Work, No Pay" style proposal aims to incentivize Congress to fulfill its constitutional duty to fund the government and avoid political deadlocks. The measure would require a two-thirds majority in both houses and ratification by three-fourths of the states.</p>

          <p>Veterans and a retired general have strongly criticized an address by War Secretary Pete Hegseth to 800 of the nation's top generals and admirals, calling it insulting and a waste of resources. Hegseth's speech focused on topics like physical fitness standards, lethality, and critiques of diversity initiatives, which some veterans felt condescendingly lectured senior officers on military ethos. The unprecedented meeting, followed by a politically charged speech from President Trump referring to an "enemy within," raised concerns about the politicization of the military. While some of Hegseth's points on fitness standards for women sparked nuanced debate, the overall tone was viewed as divisive.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive investigation has identified approximately 170 U.S. hospitals, encompassing nearly 30,000 patient beds, that face a significant risk of severe flooding. Many of these facilities are not designated as being in flood zones by outdated FEMA maps, leaving them unprepared for climate change-driven storms that could cut off access and force evacuations. The article highlights that the Trump administration has dismantled federal programs designed to protect critical infrastructure, exacerbating the danger to these essential healthcare facilities.

          <p>Recently surfaced images on Chinese social media appear to show a new, tailless prototype of China's sixth-generation stealth fighter, possibly designated the J-50. The photos show the aircraft on a runway without the nose-mounted air data boom, a sensor used during early test flights. Chinese military observers suggest that the removal of this equipment could signify that the development program has reached a more advanced stage. While Chinese authorities have not officially confirmed the authenticity of the images, they are fueling speculation about the progress of the country's advanced military aviation technology.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The concept of having a "best friend" provides significant psychological benefits, offering a deeper level of trust, support, and intimacy that contributes to overall well-being and staves off emotional loneliness. Research indicates that the quality of friendships, particularly having a close confidant, is more important than the sheer number of friends. While the act of ranking friends may seem juvenile, psychologists suggest humans subconsciously categorize their social connections to manage limited emotional energy, investing more in a small inner circle. This prioritization helps maintain strong, reliable bonds that function similarly to kin, which is crucial in an era of increased mobility.</p>

          <p>California has ended a long-standing program that allowed solo drivers of designated clean-air vehicles to use carpool lanes, affecting over half a million motorists. The change is expected to alter commute patterns, though experts are uncertain about the immediate impact on overall traffic congestion, particularly on already gridlocked freeways. The incentive was originally created to promote the adoption of electric and low-emission vehicles, a goal officials say has been successful, with such cars now making up nearly 25% of new sales. While former decal holders face longer commutes, the move may free up space in carpool lanes and encourage more genuine carpooling.</p>

          <p>According to a KFF analysis, health insurance premiums for 22 million people enrolled in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace are projected to more than double in 2026 if enhanced subsidies are not extended. These subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of 2025, currently cap what households pay for insurance at 8.5% of their income. The potential expiration is a key point of contention in federal government funding negotiations, with Democrats pushing for an extension.

          <p>The small town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia, has embraced its local legend of the Mothman, a mysterious winged creature reportedly sighted in 1966. The annual Mothman Festival now draws over 20,000 visitors, transforming the town's economy and filling once-vacant storefronts with tourists year-round. The event celebrates the cryptid with costumes, music, and tours, creating a vibrant atmosphere that has put the town on the global map for paranormal enthusiasts. The legend, which became intertwined with the tragic 1967 Silver Bridge collapse, has provided the community with a unique identity and a significant economic boost.</p>

          <p>Republican officials are continuing a legal and legislative push to impose new restrictions on voting by U.S. citizens living abroad, including military members and their families. The efforts are largely focused on challenging the eligibility of citizens born overseas who have never resided in the U.S., with lawsuits filed in swing states like Arizona and North Carolina. Additionally, a new House bill, the PROVE Act, aims to create stricter residency requirements nationwide. Voting rights advocates fear these moves could disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of voters and are a partisan reaction to demographic shifts among the overseas electorate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In China, ride-hailing companies like DiDi are implementing policies to address a growing number of customer complaints about unpleasant odors in vehicles. The issue is often linked to the country's economic slowdown, which has pushed many unemployed individuals into the gig economy, with some drivers living in their cars to save money. While companies are using customer ratings to temporarily suspend and retrain drivers, critics argue this approach fails to address the root cause of overwork and low pay. The situation highlights the harsh realities faced by gig workers in a saturated market where an oversupply of drivers competes for fewer rides.</p>

          <h2>The Word 'Hoax' Traces Its Origins to a 17th-Century Magician's Catchphrase</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word "hoax" has a surprising origin, evolving from "hocus pocus," the famous incantation and stage name of a 17th-century English magician named William Vincent. The phrase itself may be a satirical corruption of the Latin Eucharistic prayer, "Hoc est enim corpus meum," reflecting the anti-Catholic sentiment of the era. Vincent used "Hocus Pocus" as a brand, repeating it during his tricks until it became a shorthand for magic and deception itself. Over time, the spoken phrase "hocus" was shortened to "hoax," which entered the lexicon around 1800 to describe a grander, more elaborate deception.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data from UK Finance shows that half of all adults in the United Kingdom now regularly use mobile payment services like Apple Pay or Google Pay. This represents a significant shift in consumer habits, with usage growing from 34% in the previous year. The trend is most pronounced among younger demographics, with 78% of 16 to 24-year-olds using mobile payments, but adoption is increasing across all age groups. As consumers become more comfortable using their phones for transactions, the use of physical contactless cards has slightly declined, and cash has become even less common for payments.</p>

The issue has been traced to a shared base formula and has raised "significant concerns" about the testing practices of a specific U.S.-based laboratory.
