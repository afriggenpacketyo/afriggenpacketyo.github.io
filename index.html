          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated that his primary objective for the approaching national election is to ensure the ruling coalition maintains its majority in the House of Councillors. The Liberal Democratic Party, along with its coalition partner Komeito, currently holds control of the upper house. Ishiba emphasized the importance of addressing the rising cost of living amid inflation and increasing rice prices, considering this election a critical test for his minority government. The Prime Minister also addressed potential coalition hurdles, indicating the need for policy alignment beyond just one agreeable item. Optimism surrounding Japan's political stability is tempered by economic concerns. </p>

          <p>The United States launched airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, joining an Israeli-led offensive aimed at dismantling Iran's nuclear program, as stated by President Trump. The attacks targeted sites at Natanz, Isfahan, and Fordow, with Trump claiming a "spectacular military success" that "totally obliterated" Iran's nuclear program. However, the extent of the damage remains uncertain, and the potential for escalation is a significant concern given the complex US-Iran relationship. The US intelligence community had previously assessed that Iran halted its efforts to build a nuclear weapon in 2003, but recent reports suggest Iran has been increasing its uranium enrichment activities since 2018. The potential for wider conflict is significant, given the mutual distrust and long history between the two nations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's political team has initiated a PAC to challenge Rep. Thomas Massie's congressional seat in 2026 after Massie questioned Trump's authority to strike Iran. Massie, a fiscal conservative, co-sponsored the War Powers Resolution aimed at preventing Trump from acting against Iran without congressional approval. Trump criticized Massie on social media, claiming he is a "grandstander" who does not have the support of MAGA Republicans. The move signals a new strategy to hold congressional Republicans accountable for opposing Trump's legislative agenda, with the PAC being led by key figures from Trump's 2024 campaign. The conflict highlights divisions within the Republican party regarding foreign policy and presidential authority.</p>

          <p>Major US health insurers, including UnitedHealthcare and Kaiser Permanente, are collaborating to streamline the prior authorization process to expedite patient care. The initiative aims to create a standardized online system for submitting prior authorizations, reduce the number of claims requiring prior authorization, and accelerate response times. The changes, set to take effect in 2026 and 2027, are intended to alleviate administrative burdens on doctors and reduce delays for patients needing medical care. The American Academy of Family Physicians acknowledges the initiative as a positive step, with the ultimate impact to be assessed based on patient and physician experiences.

          <p>A report from Third Way suggests that proposed health-care cuts in the Republican "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" could significantly increase families' medical debt. The budget bill proposes substantial cuts to Medicaid and Affordable Care Act coverage, potentially causing millions to lose health coverage. This loss of coverage could lead to increased medical debt, with some families facing debts as high as $22,800. The White House argues the cuts aim to eliminate waste and abuse in government programs, while critics warn of the detrimental impact on families' financial stability. The proposed changes may increase the number of people with medical debt by 5.4 million.</p>

          <p>Three years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, abortion numbers in the U.S. are increasing, even in states with bans, according to data from #WeCount. In 2024, providers performed 1.14 million abortions, the highest number in recent years, indicating that bans have not stopped the need for abortion care but have made access more difficult. Telehealth abortions are on the rise, especially in rural areas, facilitated by "shield laws" that protect providers treating women in states with bans. Anti-abortion activists are challenging these shield laws in court, and access to mifepristone, a common abortion drug, is also under assault. Despite these challenges, organizations like the Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project are optimistic about continuing to provide access to abortion care.</p>

          <p>Compass has filed a lawsuit against Zillow, alleging that the online real estate platform's new policy violates antitrust laws. The policy bans listings from Zillow if they are posted on other services for more than 24 hours before appearing on Zillow. Compass claims that this "Zillow ban" is an attempt to stifle competition by leveraging Zillow's market dominance. Compass argues that its three-step marketing strategy, which includes private exclusives and "coming soon" listings, benefits sellers but is undermined by Zillow's policy. The lawsuit aims to protect consumer choice and prevent Zillow from coercing agents and listings into adhering to its business model.</p>

          <p>The IRS may be preparing to garnish wages for unpaid taxes if multiple notices have been received, including a Final Notice of Intent to Levy. A federal tax lien filing indicates the IRS is willing to use legal remedies to collect, and direct contact with an employer signals imminent garnishment. To avoid wage garnishment, taxpayers can request a Collection Due Process hearing, set up a payment plan, or explore hardship options. Taking proactive steps to address tax debt is essential to protect income and financial stability. The IRS is generally willing to work with taxpayers who communicate and make good-faith efforts to resolve their debt.</p>

          <p>Home sales in the U.S. experienced their slowest May in 16 years, with existing home sales down 0.7% compared to the previous year. Affordability remains a key challenge, with home prices significantly outpacing wage growth. Despite a rise in the number of homes for sale, the market continues to favor sellers in many areas, though the condo market is experiencing a more significant shift towards buyers. The median single-family home price in May was $427,800, a modest increase from the prior year. Uncertainty about the economy and job security are contributing to buyer hesitancy, though potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve could improve market conditions.</p>

          <p>The government has outlined a 10-year industrial strategy that includes plans to lower energy costs for thousands of businesses by exempting them from certain green energy levies. This measure, which could reduce energy bills by up to 25%, is part of a broader strategy to boost economic growth and stabilize the UK amidst global challenges. The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs for over 7,000 manufacturing firms, while the British Industry Supercharger scheme will increase discounts for energy-intensive firms. The strategy also includes measures to improve skills, attract global talent, streamline planning processes, and boost research and development spending. Not all sectors are included, leading to disappointment from retail and leisure businesses.</p>

          <p>President Trump has called for "everyone" to maintain low oil prices amidst escalating conflict in the Middle East following U.S. strikes on Iran. He warned that allowing prices to rise would play "into the hands of the enemy." Trump also urged the Department of Energy to increase domestic drilling. His comments followed U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, which heightened concerns about potential disruptions to Middle East energy supplies. The oil market has remained relatively stable despite the attacks, with futures trading largely flat. Trump's remarks reflect his ongoing focus on energy prices and their potential impact on the U.S. economy.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman indicated she would favor an interest rate cut at the next policy meeting in July, provided inflation pressures remain contained. Bowman believes President Trump's tariffs are likely to have a limited impact on prices, paving the way for lower rates. She supports adjusting the policy rate to bring it closer to a neutral setting and sustain a healthy labor market. Bowman's comments align with those of fellow Governor Christopher Waller, suggesting a potential shift in the Fed's monetary policy. This shift comes as economists express concerns about the impact of tariffs on inflation, though recent measures have shown little impact so far. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States conducted airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, targeting Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. The operation, codenamed Midnight Hammer, involved 125 U.S. military aircraft and utilized precision-guided weapons, including GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators. Initial assessments indicate severe damage to all three sites, though the full extent is still being evaluated. Iran has threatened retaliation, and analysts speculate potential responses include attacks on American military bases or a blockade of the Strait of Hormuz.
