        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A disagreement between Germany's Economy and Environment ministers has highlighted a growing rift within the ruling coalition regarding energy policy. The dispute arose after the Economy Minister, a conservative, attended a meeting of pro-nuclear EU states, despite Germany's official nuclear phase-out. This action contradicts the stance of the Environment Minister from the Social Democratic Party, revealing deep divisions on how to achieve climate neutrality, especially with concurrent plans to build numerous new gas-fired power plants. The conflict underscores the government's struggle to create a cohesive and concrete plan for its 2045 climate goals.</p>

          <p>The upcoming boxing match between Julio CÃ©sar ChÃ¡vez Jr. and Jake Paul is being framed by both fighters as a legitimate and critical contest, not a staged spectacle. For ChÃ¡vez Jr., son of a boxing legend, the fight represents a chance to revive his career after personal struggles and prove his superior boxing skills. For Paul, a victory would further his quest for legitimacy in the sport beyond his social media fame and silence critics who claim he faces weak opponents. Both men have dismissed any notion of the fight being fixed, insisting that much is on the line for their respective futures in boxing.</p>

          <p>A chief economist at a major Chinese investment bank argues that China holds a significant "comparative advantage" in the global race to develop stablecoins. This advantage stems from its mature third-party payment platforms, WeChat Pay and Alipay, which already function similarly to stablecoins by being pegged 1:1 with the national currency. The economist, Peng Wensheng, noted that these platforms are backed by central bank money and operate under a well-established regulatory framework. This perspective emerges as Chinese state media encourages policymakers to remain proactive in the evolving landscape of global digital currencies. (not investment advice)</p>

The new establishment is designed as a six-suite wellness retreat, blending the building's original Western architecture with Japanese design elements.

          <p>A new 30-meter giant slide at a popular tourist spot in Kitakyushu, Japan, has been shut down shortly after its grand opening due to safety concerns. The closure was enacted after four separate users sustained broken bones while riding the slide, which is located at the top of Mt. Sarakura. The incidents, including one involving a tourist from Taiwan who broke her shin, prompted the local government to suspend operations of the attraction, which had only been open to the public since April 25.</p>

          <p>The European Union has formally proposed new international trade restrictions on all species of eel, a move that faces strong opposition from Japan. The proposal, submitted under the Washington Convention treaty, would mandate that any eel exports, including the Japanese eel, require a permit proving legal capture. If adopted, these regulations would take effect in June 2027, significantly impacting the global eel market. Japan, a major consumer of eels, has been a vocal opponent of such curbs on the trade.</p>

This move comes after the Department of Homeland Security attempted to terminate Harvard's ability to enroll international students, a decision currently blocked by a federal judge.

The move, part of Labour's new ten-year health strategy, will eliminate bodies such as Healthwatch England and the National Guardian's Office, which advocate for patients and support whistleblowers. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the goal is to simplify a system he described as overly complex, aiming for "more doers and fewer checkers." Critics, while welcoming potential efficiency, caution that the vital functions of these bodies must not be lost in the restructuring.</p>

Access to the estate grounds has already been terminated, and residents have reportedly been ordered to leave their homes starting in January.

The new approach, with teams in their home cities and draftees in a Los Angeles theater, was marred by technical glitches like audio failures and awkward virtual interactions. Critics argue the decentralized format lacks the excitement and personal touch of the old system, where all participants were in one arena.

          <p>U.S. federal prosecutors have charged 11 individuals in connection with a massive, Russia-based scheme that attempted to defraud the Medicare program of $10.6 billion. The indictment alleges the transnational criminal organization purchased legitimate medical equipment companies to submit fraudulent claims for equipment that was never provided. The personal information of over a million Medicare recipients was stolen and used in the scheme, which successfully received approximately $41 million from Medicare and an estimated $900 million from supplemental insurers. The international operation allegedly laundered its proceeds through shell companies and cryptocurrency.</p>

          <p>China's solar manufacturing industry is experiencing a significant downturn, grappling with a domestic supply glut and a fierce price war that has caused prices to plummet by up to 80% since 2023.

The gloomy mood was palpable at a recent industry conference in Shanghai, where top executives were absent and attendance was reduced.

          <p>A new Tulane University study reveals that parts of New Orleans' flood protection system are sinking at an alarming rate, in some areas nearly two inches per year. This rate of subsidence is faster than the rise in sea levels, potentially degrading the city's defenses against storm surges. The research, which used satellite radar data, identified sinking hotspots around industrial sites and in the reinforced concrete flood walls built after Hurricane Katrina. The findings serve as a stark warning that without ongoing monitoring and maintenance, the multi-billion dollar system's level of protection could be compromised.</p>
