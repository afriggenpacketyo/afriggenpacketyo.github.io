          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers experienced a frustrating 3-0 shutout loss against the Arizona Diamondbacks, managing only three hits and struggling to generate offense. This defeat halted their recent four-game winning streak, raising concerns about their hitting performance as they enter a crucial stretch against teams below .500. Pitcher Blake Snell showed a noticeable dip in fastball velocity, allowing three runs over five innings, including a costly two-run home run. The article highlights the Dodgers' inability to capitalize on a favorable schedule, a challenge also faced by the San Diego Padres who similarly lost, leaving the division race unchanged. The outcome underscores that beating less formidable teams is not always straightforward in baseball.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's efforts to expand expedited deportations for undocumented migrants within the U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the administration's broad application of the expedited removal statute, which bypasses judicial review for many, likely violates individuals' due process rights. This decision is a significant blow to President Trump's immigration agenda, which aimed to rapidly deport a million people annually. The article emphasizes that while the judge did not question the statute's constitutionality at the border, its application to long-term residents in the interior requires due process. The ruling underscores the judiciary's role in scrutinizing executive power in immigration matters.</p>

The Sparks maintained a lead through the first half, but the Fever surged after halftime, with Aliyah Boston and Odyssey Sims leading their offense in Caitlin Clark's absence. The game's outcome was decided in the final 30 seconds, as a critical offensive rebound and a late turnover by the Sparks allowed Indiana to secure the win. The article highlights that the Sparks currently sit in ninth place, trailing the Golden State Valkyries by two games for the final playoff spot with only seven regular-season games left.</p>

The ruling applies to 10% baseline tariffs on virtually every country and higher "reciprocal" tariffs.

          <p>Satellite images analyzed by Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab reveal the construction of an extensive earthen wall, over 31km long, around the besieged Sudanese city of el-Fasher. This "berm" is being built by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and is believed to be intended to trap civilians inside, deepening the siege conditions. El-Fasher is the last army stronghold in Darfur, where RSF and allied militias are accused of targeting non-Arab ethnic groups.

          <p>Chinese equity markets are experiencing a significant rally, capturing the attention of both domestic retail and global investors seeking more attractive investment opportunities. The Shanghai Composite Index recently reached a 10-year high, signaling a reversal of prior underperformance and an exodus of foreign capital. Investment directors like Jian Shi Cortesi of GAM Investments anticipate further market growth, driven by a rotation of domestic savings out of low-yield fixed-income products and Beijing's strategic emphasis on technological innovation, particularly in advanced manufacturing and AI. The article highlights a growing sentiment among global asset managers that Chinese equities offer "undervalued innovation" and considerable upside potential. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 600,000 Venezuelans living and working in the US. The Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a lower court's ruling, finding that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim that the Homeland Security Secretary lacked authority to vacate a prior TPS extension. The court emphasized that Congress designed TPS to be "predictable, dependable, and insulated from electoral politics."
