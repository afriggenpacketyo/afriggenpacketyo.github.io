          <p>The Trump administration has announced that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is pausing over $11 billion in projects due to the ongoing government shutdown. According to White House budget chief Russell Vought, the shutdown has depleted the agency's ability to manage these funds, forcing a halt to what are described as "lower-priority projects" in major cities like New York and San Francisco. This move is presented as a direct consequence of the funding lapse, highlighting the tangible impact of the political stalemate on national infrastructure and federal operations.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a new record, topping $4,300 per troy ounce as investors seek a safe haven from deepening economic uncertainty. This rally is being driven by several factors, including the prolonged U.S. government shutdown, ongoing international trade disputes, and the prospect of lower interest rates, all of which increase the precious metal's appeal. The significant increase, with gold futures up nearly 60% since the start of the year, reflects growing investor anxiety about the stability of the broader economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an effort to boost tourism, Travel Portland has updated its website to reassure potential visitors about the city's safety, directly refuting recent critical comments from President Trump. The organization characterizes the ongoing anti-ICE demonstrations as "typically peaceful" and notes that the protest site is isolated from major tourist areas. This portrayal is strongly contested by the White House, which describes the situation as "radical violence," highlighting the conflicting narratives surrounding the city's public order.</p>

He later allegedly lied on his visa application by denying any involvement in terrorist activities and became a legal permanent resident in 2024, settling in Louisiana.</p>

          <p>For the first time, the U.S. military has taken survivors into custody following a strike on a suspected drug-carrying semi-submersible in the Caribbean. This incident is the latest in a series of deadly attacks authorized by President Trump, who asserts the U.S. is in an "armed conflict" with drug cartels. The capture of survivors raises complex legal questions regarding their status as potential prisoners of war or criminal defendants, as human rights groups criticize the strikes as extrajudicial executions.</p>

Their concerns stem from the quiet appointment of a committee to review the restructuring of liberal arts programs, a new state law that weakens faculty governance, and a recent essay by the university's provost that was critical of the "identity-studies framework" in higher education.</p>

This diplomatic role is allowing Cairo to reassert its strategic importance in the region and attract significant foreign investment. Meanwhile, Qatar is focused on ensuring the ceasefire holds to solidify its indispensable role as a negotiator, leveraging its unique position of hosting Hamas's political leadership at the request of the U.S.</p>

          <p>The family of Alice Webb, a mother who died last year after undergoing a non-surgical Brazilian butt lift, has expressed fury after discovering the practitioner involved is still operating in the cosmetics industry. A BBC investigation found that Jordan Parke, known as the "Lip King," is illegally selling prescription-only weight-loss injections on social media. This revelation has intensified calls for stricter government regulation of the largely uncontrolled cosmetics industry to prevent further harm.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is currently debating the concept of a "neutral" interest rate—a level that neither overly stimulates nor restricts economic activity. Pinpointing this theoretical rate is a critical challenge, as its estimated value will determine how much further the Fed can cut its benchmark rate without risking inflation. The outcome of this debate has significant long-term implications for the cost of borrowing on everything from mortgages to car loans for years to come. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This editorial posits that the United States is transitioning from a system governed by the "rule of law" to one of "rule by law," where the justice system is increasingly used as a political weapon by the executive branch. The article cites the recent criminal charges against prominent Trump critics, including former national security adviser John Bolton, as evidence of this dangerous trend. It argues that this weaponization of the law imperils a core element of American democracy and aligns with a broader slide toward authoritarianism.</p>

She contrasted this with the bikini-clad female characters common in the James Bond films she watched as a child.</p>
