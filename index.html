          <p>Frederick Forsyth, the acclaimed author of thrillers such as *The Day of the Jackal*, has died at the age of 86 after a brief illness, leaving behind a legacy of over 25 books and 75 million copies sold worldwide. Forsyth's career began in the RAF and later transitioned into journalism, working for the BBC and Reuters before revealing his involvement with MI6 for over two decades. His plots often drew from real-life experiences, and his debut novel, *The Day of the Jackal*, about an assassination attempt on Charles de Gaulle, became an instant success and was adapted into a film and TV drama. Forsyth's publisher lauded his professionalism and journalistic rigor, noting his ability to craft thrilling and contemporary stories.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has deployed 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to protests against federal immigration enforcement actions, bypassing California Governor Gavin Newsom's authority. This action follows Trump's previous consideration of using the military to quell protests in 2020, and this time, he has a more supportive Pentagon, with the Secretary of Defense indicating potential mobilization of active-duty Marines if violence continues. Newsom has deemed Trump's move unlawful and intends to sue the administration, citing a violation of the U.S. Constitution, arguing that Trump's actions are an assault on democracy and free speech, as he seeks to suppress dissent and punish those exercising their right to protest.</p>

          <p>A federal judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million lawsuit against Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and Lively's publicist, Leslie Sloane, with the judge ruling that some of the claims can be amended by June 23. Baldoni accused the defendants of civil extortion and defamation after Lively filed a complaint in December alleging sexual harassment and retaliation by Baldoni on the set of "It Ends With Us," allegations Baldoni denies. A similar defamation lawsuit filed by Baldoni against The New York Times, which initially reported Lively's complaint, was also dismissed. Lively's legal team hailed the decision as a victory, while representatives for Baldoni did not immediately comment.</p>

The ACIP's recommendations determine vaccine eligibility and insurance coverage, making this a potentially impactful move. Further updates are expected as this story develops.</p>

          <p>An activist boat, the Madleen, carrying 12 activists including Greta Thunberg, was intercepted by Israeli forces while attempting to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza and towed to Ashdod. The organizers, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, stated the boat was carrying a symbolic amount of aid in defiance of the Israeli naval blockade, which Israel maintains is necessary to prevent weapons from reaching Hamas. Israeli authorities said the activists are undergoing medical examinations and will be deported to their home countries, dismissing the effort as a publicity stunt. The FFC argues that the blockade is illegal and characterized Israel's actions as threatening unlawful force against civilians.</p>

Symptoms of salmonella poisoning include diarrhea, fever, vomiting, and stomach cramps, and the CDC advises consumers to discard or return recalled eggs and disinfect any surfaces they may have contacted.

Short-term CDs, ranging from three months to one year, offer higher rates compared to long-term CDs, providing an opportunity to earn a sizable return while maintaining relatively quick access to funds. While high-yield savings accounts offer similar flexibility, CD rates remain fixed throughout the term, protecting against market volatility. Experts advise shopping around for the best rates before committing, but caution against delaying as rates are currently declining. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Topgolf Callaway Brands' stock experienced a significant jump after director Adebayo Ogunlesi purchased approximately $2.5 million worth of shares, signaling investor confidence in the company. Ogunlesi, a founding partner and CEO of Global Infrastructure Partners and a board member at BlackRock and OpenAI, has a strong reputation on Wall Street. Despite the recent surge, Topgolf Callaway shares are still down for the year and have delivered a negative return since Callaway's acquisition of Topgolf in 2020. Ogunlesi's purchase is his first since June 2023, during which time shares have dropped considerably.</p>

          <p>A recent Gallup poll reveals a growing divergence in support for abortion rights between men and women, with 61% of women identifying as "pro-choice" compared to only 41% of men. This gap has widened significantly since the overturning of Roe v Wade, and women have become more supportive of abortion rights since the decision. Men's declining support may indicate a return to pre-Roe norms, while women remain energized by the issue, and the shift may be tied to changing political views among young men. Men are also less likely to believe that abortion should be legal in all or more circumstances.</p>

          <p>Premiership rugby bosses have voiced concerns about the proposed R360 rugby event, questioning its viability and potential impact on the existing rugby structure. The R360 event, planned to run in two blocks, could clash with domestic rugby in Europe and risk players' international careers, as England is contractually obligated to pick players from Premiership clubs. With new tournaments and agreements already in place, the start-up competition risks undermining recent gains, and rugby needs roots rather than pop-ups, emphasizing the importance of the international game, club game, and community game.</p>
