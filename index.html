          <p>Columbia University requested assistance from the NYPD to remove pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupying the campus library, citing safety concerns and the presence of non-affiliated individuals. Acting University President Claire Shipman stated that the decision was necessary due to disruptions and injuries to public safety officers. New York City Mayor Eric Adams affirmed the city's commitment to peaceful protest but condemned lawlessness, emphasizing the safety of Jewish students. Governor Kathy Hochul echoed the sentiment, stressing the unacceptability of violence and vandalism. The university has been under pressure from the Trump administration regarding its handling of pro-Palestinian protests, including threats to federal funding.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering cutting $26 million in funding for US national parks, targeting programs related to climate change, DEI, and LGBTQ issues. Proposed eliminations include "Scientists in Parks," a program providing opportunities for students and early-career scientists. These cuts follow previous reductions to the National Park Service, the Department of the Interior, and the US Forestry Service. Critics argue that these actions risk the preservation of national parks and could negatively impact rural economies that rely on park-related tourism.</p>

This move aims to reduce borrowing costs for businesses and individuals, although it may result in lower returns for savers. The decision is influenced by UK inflation rates and broader global economic uncertainty, including the potential impact of President Trump's tariff policies.

          <p>President Trump nominated Dr. Casey Means, an ally of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to serve as the U.S. Surgeon General. Means replaces Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, whose nomination was withdrawn due to concerns over her credentials and alignment with Kennedy's health agenda. Means, a proponent of the "Make America Healthy Again" movement, has expressed views aligning with Kennedy's claims that unhealthy food and lifestyle choices contribute to health conditions. Her appointment has sparked debate, with some questioning her views on vaccines.</p>

          <p>Three former Memphis police officers were acquitted on all state charges, including second-degree murder, in the death of Tyre Nichols, a Black man whose fatal beating sparked nationwide protests. The jury reached the verdict after deliberating for over eight hours, finding Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith not guilty. Civil rights attorney Ben Crump expressed outrage at the verdict, calling it a "devastating miscarriage of justice." Nichols' family has also filed a $550 million lawsuit against the city of Memphis and the police department.</p>

          <p>The California State Bar's botched rollout of a new exam, intended to save money, could cost the agency an additional $5.6 million. The State Bar plans to offer free exams, book in-person testing sites, and return to the traditional exam system. The Senate committee approved an independent review of the exam after test takers reported technical glitches and poorly worded questions. The State Bar has filed a lawsuit against Meazure Learning, the vendor that administered the February test, accusing them of fraud and breach of contract.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering deporting immigrants to Libya, a move that legal experts argue would violate US and international law. Sending immigrants to Libya, which has a history of human rights abuses and exploitation of migrants, would contravene the principle of non-refoulement.
