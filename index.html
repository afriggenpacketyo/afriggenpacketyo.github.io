        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal judges in New Jersey have invoked a rare power to replace interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a former personal lawyer for President Trump. The judges appointed her first assistant, Desiree Leigh Grace, to lead the office, a move praised by Democratic Senator Cory Booker. The decision was criticized by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who accused the judiciary of partisan activism. Habba's tenure was marked by controversial charges against Democratic politicians, and she faced significant opposition to her permanent confirmation.</p>

          <p>A House Appropriations Committee has passed an amendment to rename the Kennedy Center's Opera House after former First Lady Melania Trump. The proposal, introduced by Republican Rep. Mike Simpson, passed on a 33-25 vote and was praised for recognizing her support for the arts. Democrats criticized the move as divisive, part of a trend by Republicans to honor the Trump family. The First Lady traditionally serves as the honorary chair of the Kennedy Center, and President Trump recently appointed new board members who elected him as chair.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the U.S. will likely extend the upcoming August 12 deadline for trade tariff negotiations with China. The current 90-day suspension of heavy tariffs was established to allow for ongoing talks, which are set to continue in Stockholm, Sweden. Bessent expressed optimism about the trade relationship, hoping to also discuss issues like China's manufacturing surplus and its support for Russia. This development follows a period of intense trade conflict where both nations had imposed tariffs exceeding 100% on each other's goods.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appellate court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 10,000 people from Afghanistan and Cameroon. While acknowledging the plaintiffs have a plausible case, the court found insufficient evidence to block the policy during the ongoing lawsuit. The Department of Homeland Security defended the decision, stating TPS was never meant to be permanent, while advocacy groups warned of dire consequences for those affected. The administration argues conditions in both countries have improved, a claim disputed by critics and contradicted by State Department travel advisories.</p>

          <p>Amid rising inflation and financial uncertainty, many seniors are considering reverse mortgages to access their home equity. This financial tool allows homeowners aged 62 and older to receive payments that are repaid only when the home is sold or the owner passes away. However, the article advises seniors to carefully weigh this option against other home equity products like HELOCs, which may have lower interest rates. Potential borrowers should also assess their actual need for funds and consider the impact on their beneficiaries' inheritance. (not investment advice)</p>

The rally was fueled by heavy mentions on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum and significant trading volume, with about 22% of the company's available shares being sold short.

The system, called e-OPRA, involves a titanium rod implanted directly into the femur, which connects to a robotic limb and integrates with reconnected muscle pairs. This myoneural interface allows the prosthesis to respond to the user's intended movements, enabling actions like kicking a ball with intuitive control. Trial patients reported improved mobility, confidence, and a feeling that the prosthetic was a true part of their body.</p>

While current CD rates have declined from their 2024 peaks, they remain substantially higher than in previous years, still offering a predictable return. For example, a 2-year CD might earn over $1,600 today, compared to over $2,300 on a higher-rate account a year ago. The comparison highlights that while earnings have decreased, CDs still present a valuable savings tool, especially with potential future rate cuts looming. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Laura Anne Jones, a Conservative Member of the Senedd (Welsh Parliament), has defected to Reform UK, becoming the party's first representative in that body. Announced by party leader Nigel Farage, the high-profile move has angered Welsh Conservatives, who said voters would feel "very let down." Jones stated that she felt the Conservative Party was "unrecognisable" and that Reform UK was better listening to the people. The defection follows recent polling suggesting Reform could become the largest party in the next Senedd election.</p>

          <p>Bill Cosby has spoken out about the death of Malcolm-Jamal Warner, who played his son Theo Huxtable on "The Cosby Show." In an interview, Cosby said he and co-star Phylicia Rashad embraced over the phone, mourning their "dearly beloved friend." A spokesperson for Cosby stated the news was as devastating as when Cosby learned of his own son's death in 1997. Cosby praised Warner's dedication as an actor and recalled their last conversation about Warner's successful music career, for which he won a Grammy.</p>

          <p>General Motors executives claim the company has secured the number two position in the U.S. electric vehicle market, trailing only Tesla. On a recent earnings call, GM's CFO stated that the company's "inherent advantage" lies in its manufacturing flexibility, allowing it to pivot between producing EVs and internal combustion engine (ICE) cars based on fluctuating consumer demand. This contrasts with Tesla's EV-only lineup, which GM suggests leaves it "overexposed" to market volatility. GM CEO Mary Barra reaffirmed that a profitable EV future remains the company's "North Star."</p>

After decades of joint recovery efforts, remains found on the mountain site were identified as Hall's using anthropological and DNA analysis.

          <p>The long-standing alliance between Donald Trump and media mogul Rupert Murdoch is showing signs of strain over reporting on Jeffrey Epstein. Trump has filed a lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal, a Murdoch-owned paper, for a story about a lewd birthday message he allegedly sent to Epstein in 2003. The article suggests this legal battle is a significant development in the complex relationship between the two powerful figures. The controversy over Epstein continues to create political and personal challenges for the former president, even with his media allies.</p>

This income-driven plan calculates payments as a percentage of a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10%, with a $10 minimum payment. It offers loan forgiveness after 30 years and provides a $50 monthly credit per dependent. For new borrowers after July 2026, RAP and a standard repayment plan will be the only two repayment options available.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues that President Trump's approach to Ukraine is inconsistent, creating an unpredictable environment for the war-torn nation. While the administration recently allowed a transfer of Patriot anti-missile systems, it also gave Russia a 50-day period before considering new sanctions, effectively allowing Moscow's bombing campaign to continue unabated this summer. This pattern of offering some aid while simultaneously creating obstacles suggests a strategy that strings Ukraine along without providing the decisive support needed for victory. The analysis posits this approach benefits Russia by giving it time to press its military advantage.</p>
