          <p>After Chris Smith was shot on a first date in Farmersville, Illinois, his dog Tiki, a beagle-terrier mix, huddled with him and provided warmth during the 12 hours before he was rescued. Smith was found with a gunshot wound to the head, while his date, Leslie Reeves, was dead at the scene. Smith, who doesn't remember the shooting, was told by EMTs that Tiki likely helped him survive the cold temperatures in the house caused by a broken door. Smith has since recovered, returned to singing in his band, and started a motivational speaking business.</p>

          <p>In 1993, Jeanie Childs was found murdered in her Minneapolis apartment, having been stabbed over 60 times. The crime scene contained a rare clue: bloody, bare footprints, which investigators determined belonged to the killer because Childs was wearing socks. Decades later, the footprints and DNA evidence led to Jerry Westrom, who was convicted of the murder in 2022, though he maintained his innocence. The case highlights the advances in forensic technology and the persistence of law enforcement in solving cold cases.</p>

The author contrasts Europe's commitment to high-speed rail with America's underfunded and often neglected rail system, and notes the environmental and social benefits of train travel.
