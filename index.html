        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Poland is preparing for a presidential election that could significantly impact the pro-European, center-left government's reform plans. President Andrzej Duda, a national-conservative, has been blocking the government's initiatives, leading to public disappointment. The election pits Rafal Trzaskowski, backed by the government, against Karol Nawrocki, supported by the opposition PiS party. The outcome will determine whether the government can advance its agenda, including restoring the rule of law and liberalizing abortion legislation, or remain in a stalemate, as the article points out that Tusk is likely to be on tenterhooks until the very last vote is counted.</p>
