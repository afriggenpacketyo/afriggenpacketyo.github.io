            <p>Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen met with Kilmar Ábrego García in El Salvador, who was mistakenly deported by the Trump administration despite a court order protecting him. The senator reaffirmed his commitment to securing Ábrego García's return to the US and criticized the administration's handling of the case. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele mocked concerns over Ábrego García's well-being, indicating he would remain in custody. The White House condemned Van Hollen's visit, labeling Ábrego García an MS-13 terrorist, a claim his lawyers deny. This incident highlights the ongoing legal and political battle surrounding immigration and deportation policies.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is implementing port fees on Chinese ships to revive shipbuilding in the US and challenge China's industry dominance. The fees, starting in 180 days, will increase over the next three years, based on cargo weight, container count, or vehicle number. This move aims to address what the US Trade Representative (USTR) considers unfair advantages gained by China. However, concerns arise that these measures could disrupt global trade already affected by existing tariffs. Experts note cargoes are being redirected to European ports, potentially raising prices for US consumers.</p>

            <p>Hamas has formally rejected Israel's latest ceasefire offer, stating its readiness to negotiate a deal involving the release of all remaining hostages in exchange for an end to the war and the release of Palestinian prisoners. The group said it would not accept partial deals that serve Netanyahu's political agenda. The rejection comes as Israeli strikes killed at least 37 people in a tented area for displaced civilians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run civil defence agency. The war began on 7 October 2023, with Hamas' attack on Israeli communities.</p>

            <p>A 20-year-old student, Phoenix Ikner, opened fire at Florida State University, killing two and injuring six others. The alleged gunman used his mother's former service weapon, a handgun she owned after the force upgraded its weapons. The suspect, who was shot by police and taken to the hospital, was a member of the sheriff office's youth advisory council. The motive for the shooting is currently unclear. President Trump called the shooting "a shame" and reiterated his support for the Second Amendment.</p>

The company plans to seek FDA approval for the drug as a Type 2 diabetes treatment in 2026 and for weight management by the end of this year. The pill offers a potential alternative to injectable GLP-1 medications.</p>

            <p>Fire services in England are facing a significant funding shortfall compared to the police, receiving 50% less compensation for tax increases. The government is providing police forces with extra funds to cover the rise in employers' National Insurance contributions, while fire services are only receiving top-up funds covering half of the increase. This shortfall is equivalent to the cost of a fully-staffed fire engine, according to one fire service. The National Fire Chiefs Council says fire services will be £20m short of the £40m needed to cover national insurance increases.</p>

            <p>A pilot project in the UK, SeaCURE, is testing the feasibility of removing carbon from the sea as a means of fighting climate change. The project aims to determine if pulling carbon from seawater, where it is present in greater concentrations, might be more efficient than capturing it directly from the air. The process involves treating seawater to release carbon dioxide, concentrating it, and then returning the low-carbon water to the sea. The project is currently removing a small amount of carbon but has the potential to be scaled up.</p>

            <p>Housing affordability has become a major concern for Canadian voters, particularly younger generations, influencing the upcoming federal election. With cities like Vancouver facing impossibly high home prices, young people struggle to afford housing, impacting their life choices. Each major federal party has presented plans to address the crisis, primarily focusing on increasing housing construction. However, some experts argue that more comprehensive solutions are needed, including addressing the wealth older homeowners have gained from the housing crisis. (not investment advice)</p>
