          <p>A new draft of a major crypto bill in the U.S. Senate includes a provision to ensure that stocks and other securities do not get reclassified as commodities if they are tokenized. The legislation, known as the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, seeks to establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets, defining the jurisdictions of the SEC and CFTC. Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis expressed hope that the bill will pass both the Senate Banking and Agriculture Committees in the coming months and reach the president's desk by the end of the year.

          <p>The U.S. executive aircraft fleet, including the two primary jets known as Air Force One, is aging, with some planes in service for over three decades and replacements facing significant delays. The article details the complexities and high-security requirements of presidential aircraft, such as anti-surveillance technology and air-to-air refueling capabilities, which contribute to production challenges with Boeing. Recent mechanical issues on planes used by the Vice President and Secretary of State have underscored the urgency of modernization, though new aircraft are not expected for several more years.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has informed Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, that it now intends to deport him to the African nation of Eswatini. This marks at least the fourth country targeted for his removal, following a mistaken deportation to El Salvador and subsequent threats of removal to Uganda and Costa Rica. Abrego Garcia's case is highly complex, involving an ongoing asylum claim and federal smuggling charges, which his lawyers argue are retaliatory. The move highlights the administration's use of agreements with third-party countries to accept deportees who are not their own citizens.</p>

Emerson, who had consumed psychedelic mushrooms days prior and was suffering from depression, stated he believed he was in a dream and was trying to wake up. The flight, carrying over 80 people, was safely diverted, and no one was injured. In court, he expressed deep regret for endangering passengers and damaging public trust in the airline profession, accepting a plea deal that includes probation and community service.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order creating a formal designation for countries that wrongfully detain U.S. nationals, enabling the government to impose punitive measures like sanctions and travel restrictions. The policy is modeled after the existing framework for state sponsors of terrorism and aims to deter nations from using American citizens as political bargaining chips. The move was praised by families of formerly detained individuals, including Paul Whelan and the daughter of Robert Levinson, as a powerful deterrent against what they describe as an escalating practice of hostage-taking by rogue regimes.</p>

The unemployment rate also rose to 4.3%, its highest level since 2021, while job numbers for June were revised to show a net loss, the first since 2020. Economists attribute the faltering job market to factors including the Trump administration's tariffs, which create business uncertainty.

          <p>A major immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG battery factory under construction in Georgia resulted in the detention of 475 individuals, a majority of whom are South Korean nationals suspected of working illegally. Homeland Security Investigations described it as the largest single-site enforcement operation in the agency's history, stemming from a criminal probe into unlawful employment practices. The South Korean government has expressed "concern and regret" over the raid, urging the U.S. to respect the rights of its citizens and ensure the legitimate activities of its investors are not infringed upon.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has ruled that the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Venezuela and Haiti was illegal. The decision by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen blocks the administration's move, stating that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem acted unlawfully and without proper authority in her rapid effort to revoke the protections. TPS allows individuals from countries facing war or natural disasters to live and work legally in the U.S. on a temporary basis.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to officially rename the U.S. Department of Defense as the Department of War, restoring the name it held until 1947.

The move, which will require congressional approval to be made permanent, is largely symbolic but has drawn criticism from Democrats who argue it promotes conflict.

The recent weak jobs report signals potential economic trouble ahead, which could threaten the market's upward momentum. Analysts suggest that many portfolios are over-concentrated in a few mega-cap tech stocks and recommend diversifying into value and defensive sectors that have not participated as much in the recent rally.

          <p>An analysis by The Atlantic highlights the Trump administration's ongoing difficulty in filling key government positions, resulting in a reliance on a small circle of advisors holding multiple roles simultaneously. For example, Secretary of State Marco Rubio is also serving as acting National Security Adviser and acting head of the National Archives. This practice of "dual-hatting" raises concerns about effective governance, potential conflicts of interest, and the administration's ability to carry out its statutory and political objectives with a short-staffed executive branch.</p>
