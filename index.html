          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has publicly predicted the collapse of Spirit Airlines, stating the budget airline's business model is fundamentally flawed and unsustainable. Speaking at an industry conference, Kirby asserted that Spirit, which recently filed for bankruptcy for the second time in a year, cannot survive with a model predicated on low fares and numerous fees that customers dislike. His comments reflect a broader critique of the ultra-low-cost carrier model, which faces intense competition from major airlines' basic economy offerings. Spirit Airlines has not formally commented on Kirby's latest remarks.</p>

          <p>Keith Rabois, the newly appointed board chair of Opendoor, has stated the online real estate company is significantly overstaffed and plans to cut its workforce by approximately 85%, from 1,400 to around 200 employees. Rabois criticized the company's remote work culture and diversity initiatives, vowing a return to in-person collaboration to fix what he described as a "broken" culture. This announcement follows the appointment of a new CEO and comes amid investor pressure to address the company's significant cash burn.

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has paused a planned £200 million investment in a Cambridge research facility, a project that was expected to create 1,000 jobs. This decision follows the company's cancellation of another major UK project in January and comes shortly after US-based Merck scrapped its own £1 billion UK expansion. The move is seen as a significant setback for the UK's life sciences industry, occurring amid pressure from the Trump administration for pharmaceutical firms to increase investment in the United States. AstraZeneca cited a constant reassessment of its investment needs as the reason for the pause.</p>

The company raised $425 million after pricing its IPO above the expected range, valuing it at approximately $3.3 billion. Despite posting significant losses in the previous year and the first half of the current year, the strong market debut reflects investor interest in the regulated crypto platform. The Winklevoss brothers, early bitcoin investors, have long advocated for smart regulation in the digital asset space. (not investment advice)</p>

The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is now investigating 11 current and former officers over accusations that include excessive force, discriminatory comments, and misogyny. This is not the first time the station has faced such scrutiny, as a 2022 IOPC report revealed similar disgraceful behavior.

          <p>Utah authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson in connection with the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah Valley University event. The suspect was apprehended after a 33-hour manhunt, reportedly after his own father recognized him from FBI photos and urged him to surrender. Investigators found a rifle and cartridges with anti-fascist and other messages, and are exploring a political motive, as a family member noted the suspect's recent politicization and dislike for Kirk's views. Formal charges, including aggravated murder, are expected to be filed early next week.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to send National Guard troops to Memphis, Tennessee, to address urban crime, framing it as part of a broader strategy targeting Democratic-run cities. The decision was reportedly welcomed by Tennessee's Republican governor and senator, though the city's Democratic mayor had previously requested financial resources for crime prevention instead of a military deployment. Trump stated the action was part of an "aggressive push" to combat violent crime and also suggested he might bring in the military if needed. This follows similar deployments in Los Angeles and Washington D.C.</p>

          <p>The Broward County Sheriff's Office has fired six more deputies and disciplined eleven others for their mishandling of domestic violence reports made by Mary Gingles before she was murdered.

The case has highlighted systemic failures and a lack of urgency in responding to domestic violence, particularly the failure to use Florida's red flag law to remove firearms from the alleged perpetrator despite numerous warning signs.</p>

          <p>The White House has strongly criticized The Washington Post for its coverage of the murder of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska, who was fatally stabbed on a train in North Carolina. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt accused the outlet of defending criminals by citing experts who called the idea of confining mentally ill individuals for minor offenses "draconian." The White House argues that the suspect, a career criminal, should have been incarcerated due to his extensive arrest record, a sentiment echoed by the suspect's own mother. The administration contends that soft-on-crime policies in Democratic-led cities are responsible for such violent incidents.</p>

Governor Cox, who has a history of promoting bipartisan cooperation, directed his message particularly to young people, acknowledging they are inheriting a country where politics feels dominated by anger.

          <p>A UK High Court has ordered the suspended CEO of Pride in London, Christopher Joell-Deshields, to hand back access to the organization's bank accounts and company devices. Joell-Deshields was suspended amid an investigation into allegations of financial misconduct, including the personal use of sponsor-donated vouchers, and bullying. Following his suspension, he allegedly took control of all company accounts, raising concerns about the organization's operational stability. While consenting to the court order, representatives for Joell-Deshields stated that his cooperation is not an admission of guilt, and he denies any wrongdoing.</p>

          <p>With a record $7.6 trillion held in money market funds, investors are watching closely as the Federal Reserve is expected to begin cutting interest rates. While some on Wall Street anticipate a "wall of cash" will move into riskier assets like stocks and bonds as yields on cash-equivalents fall, other experts are skeptical. Analysts note that a significant portion of these funds are held by institutional and corporate investors who are unlikely to shift their strategy. They argue that only a drastic rate cut to near-zero levels, similar to past economic crises, would trigger a substantial outflow from these high-yield savings vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 15:13:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As mortgage rates in the U.S. fall to their lowest levels in nearly a year ahead of an anticipated Federal Reserve rate cut, prospective homebuyers are advised to act strategically. Experts emphasize that timing is crucial, as lenders often adjust rates in advance of formal Fed decisions, meaning the best opportunities may be fleeting. Furthermore, securing the lowest rates requires a high credit score, so potential buyers should focus on improving their creditworthiness now. The article also reinforces the importance of getting pre-approved to demonstrate seriousness to sellers and reminds buyers of the adage to prioritize finding the right home over waiting for the perfect rate.

          <p>Veteran character actor Clifton Powell has publicly named Jeff Witjas of APA as the agent who he claims fired him for accepting a role in the 2005 film "The Gospel." In a recent interview, Powell recalled the agent dismissively referring to the project as "another one of those little Black movies," prompting a defiant response from the actor. Powell, known for roles in films like "Ray" and "Rush Hour," stated that he has always prioritized working and providing for his family over agency preferences. He credited this mentality with maintaining his prolific career, which now spans nearly 300 credits.</p>

          <p>Ekrem Imamoglu, the jailed mayor of Istanbul and a prominent rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, appeared in court Friday on charges of falsifying his university degree. Prosecutors, who are seeking a prison sentence of over eight years and a political ban, allege he used fraudulent documents. Imamoglu maintains his innocence, calling the indictment absurd and politically motivated, as a university degree is required for presidential candidates in Turkey. His arrest in March on separate corruption charges sparked widespread protests, and he is considered a leading opposition candidate for the 2028 presidential election.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its plan to prevent Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid reimbursements for one year. The decision lifts a lower court's injunction, allowing a provision from a recent spending bill to take effect. Planned Parenthood estimates that up to 200 of its clinics, many in rural or underserved areas, could be forced to close, impacting over a million patients who rely on Medicaid for services like cancer screenings and contraception. The reproductive health organization has called the move a "backdoor abortion ban" and plans to continue its legal fight.</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot this week, rose from a teenage activist to a central figure in Donald Trump's MAGA movement without ever holding public office. He founded Turning Point USA (TPUSA) in 2012, building it into a powerful and well-funded organization focused on conservative activism on college campuses. A staunch Trump loyalist, Kirk became a key advisor and close personal friend of the Trump family, credited with mobilizing young voters and influencing administration staffing. His advocacy for hard-right positions and his organization's get-out-the-vote efforts were considered crucial to Trump's political success.</p>

          <p>Spain's government has summoned Israel's acting ambassador to protest comments from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office that accused the Spanish prime minister of making a "genocidal threat." The diplomatic row escalated after Spain announced measures to pressure Israel over the war in Gaza, including a weapons embargo and blocking fuel deliveries. The statement from Netanyahu's office was a response to Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez's remarks about his country's limited ability to stop the Israeli offensive alone. This incident marks the latest in a series of retaliatory diplomatic actions between the two nations.</p>
