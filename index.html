          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake near Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has triggered extensive tsunami warnings and advisories across the Pacific. Hawaii is under a high-level warning, with officials urging residents to seek higher ground as waves of up to 10 feet are possible. Tsunami waves have already reached parts of Japan and Russia, while the entire U.S. West Coast is under an advisory. The event is one of the strongest earthquakes recorded globally in recent years, prompting emergency proclamations and evacuations in affected regions.</p>

          <p>South Korean firm LG Energy Solution has announced a significant $4.3 billion contract to supply batteries to an undisclosed major corporation, with the deal effective until 2030. While the company maintained confidentiality, reports suggest the counterparty is electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla. The agreement, which could be extended, involves the supply of lithium iron phosphate batteries, although it's unclear if they are for vehicles or energy storage systems. This deal highlights LG's expanding manufacturing presence in the United States, including new facilities in Michigan and Arizona. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom is set to issue an executive order that will allow local governments, including Los Angeles, to bypass a state duplex law in areas with high wildfire risk. The order specifically targets Senate Bill 9, which permits up to four housing units on single-family lots, aiming to prevent increased population density in fire-prone neighborhoods like Pacific Palisades. This decision follows urgent requests from Los Angeles city officials, who raised concerns that new development under SB 9 could dangerously strain evacuation routes during future wildfires.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a significant potential shift in its Middle East policy, stating it will recognize a Palestinian state by September if Israel does not agree to end the Gaza crisis. Foreign Secretary David Lammy explained the move is intended to 'affect the situation on the ground' and create a pathway to peace amid immense suffering. The decision has drawn mixed reactions, with some UK politicians calling for immediate, unconditional recognition, while others criticize it as political posturing. Israel's Prime Minister condemned the announcement, highlighting the deep diplomatic complexities of the ongoing conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is moving to revoke its 2009 'endangerment finding,' the scientific basis for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the action as a major deregulatory move intended to increase consumer choice and reduce costs, claiming it would save Americans $54 billion annually. This decision would dismantle the foundation for rules limiting emissions from vehicles and power plants. Critics and environmental scientists have condemned the proposal, calling it scientifically baseless and warning it will worsen climate change impacts and face immediate legal challenges.</p>

Despite the cautious outlook, Singapore's GDP grew 4.3% year-over-year in the second quarter, avoiding a technical recession.

The plan would involve the legislature drawing new maps and calling a special election for voters to approve them, a strategy aimed at protecting the Democratic majority in the House.

          <p>Australia's headline inflation rate fell to 2.1% in the second quarter, its lowest level since early 2021 and below economists' expectations. This figure brings inflation to the lower end of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) target range, strengthening the argument for a potential interest rate cut. While the RBA has held its policy rate steady to ensure inflation remains controlled, this new data, combined with a weaker global growth outlook, has led some analysts to predict a rate reduction at the next meeting. The slowdown was driven by a fall in transport costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Sean 'Diddy' Combs are petitioning for his release from federal prison on a $50 million bond ahead of his October sentencing for prostitution-related convictions. In their court filing, the defense team argues that Combs is not a flight risk and faces threats of violence in detention. The motion also frames his conduct as part of a consensual 'swinger' lifestyle, asserting he should not be jailed for hiring adult male escorts. Combs was acquitted of more severe sex trafficking and racketeering charges but has remained in custody since his arrest.</p>
