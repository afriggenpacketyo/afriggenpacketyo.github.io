          <p>U.S. airlines are increasingly relying on checked bag fees, generating over $7 billion in revenue last year, surpassing pre-pandemic levels according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Airlines attribute this shift to rising operational costs, including fuel and wages. Southwest Airlines, known for not charging for the first two checked bags for over 50 years, will now charge $35 for the first checked bag, while JetBlue has introduced Uber-style surge pricing for bag checks during peak travel. American, Delta, and United each made over $1 billion from checked bags last year, with revenues climbing since the pandemic-induced travel halt in 2020. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A second suspect, William Duplessie, has been arrested in connection with the kidnapping and torture of an Italian tourist in Manhattan, allegedly aimed at stealing his cryptocurrency. Duplessie turned himself in after his alleged accomplice, John Woeltz, was arrested the previous week. The victim reported being held captive for 17 days, during which he was threatened, assaulted, and forced to smoke crack cocaine. Police found Polaroid photos of the victim tied up and tortured, along with firearms and drugs, during a search of the SoHo home rented by Woeltz. This incident follows a series of similar kidnapping plots targeting crypto entrepreneurs in France, highlighting a growing trend of cyber-related crimes.</p>

          <p>Two inmates remain at large after a group of ten escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans on May 16. Three more escapees were recaptured, adding to the five previously taken into custody.

Authorities have arrested at least 11 people accused of assisting the escapees, including a jail maintenance worker allegedly coerced into turning off the water to the toilet.

          <p>Tesco has introduced AI-powered cameras at some self-checkouts to combat shoplifting, leading to customer mockery and privacy concerns. The technology identifies when an item isn't scanned properly and shows a replay to the shopper, accompanied by a message prompting them to try again. Some shoppers have jokingly compared the technology to VAR in football, while others worry about increased surveillance. The move comes as shoplifting in the UK has hit record highs, costing retailers billions of pounds annually.</p>

While Trump previously issued commutations for some Jan. 6 defendants, Ticktin hopes to secure full pardons that would clear their criminal convictions.

          <p>Deborra-Lee Furness has officially filed for divorce from Hugh Jackman, two years after the couple announced their amicable separation. Furness filed the paperwork in New York, and only a judge's signature is required to finalize the divorce. The couple, who were married in 1996 and share two children, stated that their journey was shifting and they decided to separate to pursue individual growth. Jackman has since been linked with his "Music Man" co-star Sutton Foster.</p>

          <p>Three major wildfires continue to burn north of Duluth in northeastern Minnesota, while large fires also rage in Canada's Manitoba and Ontario provinces. Firefighters have made significant progress, and all Minnesota evacuations were lifted on Memorial Day. As of Tuesday afternoon, the Minnesota fires cover about 30,000 acres. The U.S. Forest Service believes the Jenkins Creek Fire was "human caused," and investigations are ongoing. Interactive maps regularly updated by the National Interagency Fire Center provide details on the affected areas.</p>

With the death of their parents, they are finding themselves without a safety net and ending up on the streets.

Senator Lindsey Graham is leading a bipartisan effort to impose sweeping sanctions on Moscow, despite Trump's hints at a potential economic partnership with Russia after a peace deal. While Trump has expressed frustration with Putin's actions, it's unclear if this signals a change in his broader view on U.S. involvement in the conflict.

One likely reason for the high insider sales is the extended period of poor returns for venture capital firms and a desire for liquidity after a multiyear drought in IPOs. (not investment advice)</p>

While Trump has acknowledged Putin's goal of conquering all of Ukraine, his focus remains on evading blame for the ongoing conflict rather than taking meaningful action.

Instead, federal statutes and court-ordered reforms are the only effective tool for police reform.

The island's abundance of food also contributes to the puffins' thriving population.
