        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent Romanian presidential election saw Nicusor Dan, a liberal and pro-European mayor, elected as president, owing significantly to the votes of ethnic Hungarians and Moldovans with dual citizenship. These groups, particularly ethnic Hungarians who defied Hungarian PM Viktor Orban's support for a hard-right candidate with anti-Hungarian sentiments, voted overwhelmingly for Dan, contributing substantially to his victory. This outcome underscores the importance of minority groups in preserving liberal democracy and Romania's Euro-Atlantic trajectory. The Republic of Moldova is highly impacted by Russian aggression, so the election of Dan is a huge win for them.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry's appeal against the UK government's decision to reduce his police protection has failed, with the courts ruling that he misunderstood how Royal Family protection is organized. The case centered on Ravec, the body authorizing security for senior royals, and its decision to adjust Harry's security after he stepped back from royal duties and moved abroad. The courts found that Ravec had carefully considered the matter and acted fairly, leading to the rejection of Harry's legal arguments. This article provides a background on Ravec's role, its response to Harry's decision, and the legal reasons for his defeat.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' sexual assault trial continues with testimony from ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura, male escorts, ex-assistants, and former Homeland Security Investigations agents. Legal experts offer differing views on the prosecution's case, with some suggesting the defense is effectively using the prosecution's witnesses to support their arguments. Witnesses have testified about Diddy's violence towards Cassie, his controlling behavior, and the 'freak offs,' while other witnesses claim these encounters were consensual. The prosecution is trying to prove Diddy helmed a criminal enterprise used to sexually exploit women, but reasonable doubt looms heavy in these first two weeks of trial.</p>

          <p>Birmingham City Council has obtained a court order to prevent the obstruction of waste vehicles leaving depots, as refuse workers continue their strike action. The authority estimates that over 12,000 tonnes of waste have accumulated due to disruptions caused by pickets, leading to concerns about public health. The strike, now in its 11th week, centers on proposed pay cuts for bin lorry drivers, with the union blaming government-appointed commissioners for the lack of progress. The court order is intended to ensure waste collection services can resume, addressing the growing piles of uncollected refuse bags.</p>

          <p>The Chinese Anti-Doping Agency (CHINADA) has denounced the Enhanced Games, a competition that endorses the use of banned substances, and called on the global sports community to oppose it. The Enhanced Games, set to debut in Las Vegas in May 2026, includes events like swimming, athletics, and weightlifting for athletes using performance-enhancing drugs. CHINADA criticized the event as a distorted competition that turns sports into a drug contest, threatening athletes' health and the spirit of sport. The organization believes the games lure athletes with high prizes, feeding public appetite for a "gladiator show."</p>

The Child Poverty Taskforce is considering measures like scrapping the two-child benefit cap, a policy preventing most families from claiming benefits for additional children. The delay has drawn criticism from the SNP, who call it "disgraceful," and from charities, though some suggest it allows for a more effective strategy. The government maintains it is committed to reducing child poverty and has already taken steps to support low-income families.</p>

          <p>Despite Israel allowing limited humanitarian aid into Gaza after weeks of total blockade, aid agencies warn of an impending famine due to insufficient supplies and logistical challenges. Though hundreds of trucks are ready at the border, movement to distribution points is slow due to security clearances and infrastructure damage. The UN and other organizations struggle to distribute aid effectively amidst ongoing conflict, hindering access to essential resources for the population. The article states that the price of bread has exploded, and that almost the entire population in Gaza is expected to face crisis or worse acute food insecurity.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Gen Z Embraces 'Quiet Quitting' for Better Work-Life Balance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 01:20:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of Japanese workers, particularly those in their 20s, are embracing "quiet quitting," prioritizing work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. This trend marks a shift from previous generations who prioritized company loyalty and long hours, with young workers now seeking more "me time" and questioning the sacrifices made by their parents. Experts attribute this change to factors like cost-cutting by companies, the impact of the pandemic, and a desire to avoid the overwork culture that led to "karoshi," or death by overwork.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israeli soldiers and Palestinian detainees have told the Associated Press that Israeli troops are systematically forcing Palestinians to act as human shields in Gaza, sending them into buildings and tunnels to check for explosives or militants. The dangerous practice has become ubiquitous during 19 months of war. In response to these allegations, Israel's military says it strictly prohibits using civilians as shields â€” a practice it has long accused Hamas of using in Gaza. The AP spoke with seven Palestinians who described being used as shields in Gaza and the occupied West Bank and with two members of Israel's military who said they engaged in the practice, which is prohibited by international law.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers overcame a blown save and a rain delay to beat the New York Mets 7-5 in 13 innings, but the victory came at a cost to their already strained pitching staff. Clayton Kershaw's start was cut short by rain, forcing the bullpen to cover 11 innings, while closer Tanner Scott blew a three-run lead in the ninth. Despite the challenges, the Dodgers persevered, with Teoscar HernÃ¡ndez driving in the go-ahead run in the 13th. This win highlights both the team's resilience and the ongoing concerns about the pitching staff's workload.</p>

          <p>A fire that broke out at a factory near Tokyo's Haneda Airport caused delays to some flights before being almost completely extinguished.

One firefighter suffered smoke inhalation but is not in danger. The affected building, located in an industrial area about 2 kilometers north of the airport, is reportedly an industrial waste-related facility.</p>

          <p>Adrian Newey, who recently joined Aston Martin's Formula 1 team, has identified weaknesses in the team's tools, particularly the driver-in-the-loop simulator, which he says is not correlating well and requires significant improvement. Newey, signed to a lucrative five-year contract, emphasized that addressing these shortcomings is crucial for Aston Martin's quest to become a competitive team and ultimately world champions. He estimates that fixing the simulator issue will be a two-year project. Currently, Aston Martin is seventh in the constructors' championship after seven races this season.</p>

          <p>A former people smuggler detailed how he used yachts to transport Vietnamese migrants into private marinas across south-east England, highlighting the ease and low risk of this method. Private marinas, described as having minimal security, are vulnerable to exploitation by smugglers. The ex-soldier also described smuggling Albanians in cars onto ferries, where they then jumped into lorries mid-journey. Border Force acknowledges the concerning risk and states they are reviewing vulnerabilities, but security at harbors and marinas remains the responsibility of private operators.</p>

However, Taiwanese Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung said in a briefing last week that the office remained in Pretoria. Taiwanâ€™s only official diplomatic ally in Africa is eSwatini, and only a limited number of countries host commercial or trade offices for the island.
