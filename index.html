          <p>The Colorado Rockies secured a remarkable 17-16 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates in a wild game after trailing by nine runs in the first inning. Despite being down 9-0 early and later 15-6, the Rockies mounted a relentless comeback, culminating in a walk-off two-run homer by Brenton Doyle in the bottom of the ninth. According to sports statisticians, this was one of the few times in modern baseball history a team has won after allowing nine or more runs in the first inning.</p>

          <p>U.S. markets experienced a turbulent week, ending with a four-day losing streak for the S&P 500 after a weak July jobs report and President Trump's firing of the BLS commissioner. The week was also marked by the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady, hotter-than-expected inflation data, and the announcement of new "reciprocal" tariff rates on trade partners like Canada. Major tech earnings from companies like Amazon and Apple added to the volatility, leaving investors to navigate a complex mix of economic signals and political uncertainty.

          <p>A recent political panel discussion highlighted a notable shift in President Trump's approach to the conflict in Gaza, suggesting a break with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the humanitarian crisis. According to analysis from The Wall Street Journal's Alexander Ward, the Trump administration believes it has leverage over Netanyahu, but this may be overestimated due to Netanyahu's own domestic political pressures. The conversation indicates growing friction and complexity in the U.S.-Israel relationship as the conflict continues to unfold.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that a potential pardon for music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs is "more difficult" due to Combs's past hostile statements against him. While remarking that he considers Combs "sort of half-innocent" following a mixed verdict in his federal trial, Trump acknowledged that the past criticism clouds his judgment on the matter. Combs was convicted on two prostitution-related charges but acquitted of more serious racketeering and sexual assault-trafficking counts, and is awaiting sentencing.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from RentCafe reveals how much apartment space a budget of $1,500 per month can secure in major U.S. cities, highlighting significant regional differences. In Manhattan, that amount gets a renter an average of just 216 square feet, while in Wichita, Kansas, it can afford a spacious 1,329 square feet. The data illustrates the extreme housing affordability crisis in large coastal cities compared to the Midwest and South, where land is more available and housing demand is lower.

The analysis positions "Panicked" as part of a trilogy of recent specials where Maron uses his cantankerous and ruminative voice to find humor in emotional vulnerability and existential dread.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in Miami has found Tesla partly responsible for a 2019 fatal crash involving its Autopilot technology, ordering the company to pay more than $240 million in damages. The case involved a driver who, while distracted, crashed into a parked vehicle, killing one person and injuring another. The verdict holds that Tesla's technology shared significant blame and that the company failed to ensure its system was safe, a decision that could embolden more lawsuits against the automaker as it develops its driverless technology.</p>

The report confirms that incriminating emails, which were central to the theory that Hillary Clinton's campaign fabricated the Russia narrative, were likely a composite created by Russian intelligence hackers. This finding contradicts the idea of a U.S.-led conspiracy and instead reinforces the original intelligence assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>
