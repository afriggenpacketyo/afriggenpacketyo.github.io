          <p>Israel initiated "Operation Rising Lion," conducting airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and military commanders in response to an alleged Iranian plan to destroy Israel. In response, Iran launched over 100 drones at Israel, which were largely intercepted by Israeli air defenses and potential interceptions in Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Iranian state media reported that the Israeli strikes hit Tehran and Natanz, killing IRGC leader Hossein Salami and other senior figures, though the IAEA confirmed that the Fordo nuclear site and Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant were not impacted. The exchange has snarled international air travel, with Dubai International Airport reporting cancellations and delays due to airspace closures over Iran, Iraq, and Syria.</p>

          <p>The newly elected Mark Carney government in Canada has introduced Bill C-2, the Strong Borders Act, which grants law enforcement broad powers to access citizen data and aligns Canadian refugee policies with those of the U.S. The bill amends the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, giving the immigration minister extensive authority to cancel immigration documents and suspend intake. Privacy laws are also upended, granting police greater access to electronic information without a warrant in "exigent circumstances," potentially leading to a surveillance state. Critics argue that the bill infringes on due process and privacy rights, disproportionately affecting women, racialized claimants, and LGBTQ+ individuals, while validating exaggerations about drug cartels attacking Americans from the north.</p>

          <p>Israel launched strikes across Iran, targeting the country's nuclear program and resulting in a state of emergency in Israel. The Israeli military claims the strikes hit dozens of military targets, including nuclear facilities, and that Iran has launched a counter-attack involving around 100 drones. Iranian state media reported that residential areas in Tehran were hit, and Hossein Salami, chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards, was killed, as well as nuclear scientists. The US stated it was not involved in the strikes, while international reactions varied, with Australia expressing alarm over the escalation. Iran has long maintained that its nuclear program is for civilian purposes only, a claim that many countries and the IAEA dispute.</p>

          <p>Following Israeli airstrikes on Iran, investors are fleeing to safe-haven assets amid fears of escalating regional conflict, driving up prices for assets like gold and U.S. Treasuries. Gold prices surged to nearly a two-month high, while Treasury yields fell, and European and U.S. stock futures declined sharply. The U.S. dollar, Swiss franc, and Japanese yen also rose as investors sought stability during heightened volatility. Oil prices experienced the most dramatic reaction, jumping as much as 13% due to concerns about potential supply disruptions. Prime Minister Netanyahu stated that the operation against Iran's nuclear program will continue as long as necessary, while the U.S. clarified its non-involvement and prioritized protecting American forces in the region.</p>

          <p>Japan's Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya has expressed strong condemnation of Israel's attack on nuclear and military sites in Iran, citing concerns about escalating regional tensions. Iwaya stated that the military action was "extremely regrettable" despite ongoing talks between Washington and Tehran, urging both countries to exercise "utmost restraint." Japan, heavily reliant on crude oil imports from the Middle East, has historically maintained friendly relations with both Iran and Israel. The Japanese government is taking measures to ensure the safety of its nationals living in the region and will continue diplomatic efforts to prevent further deterioration of the situation.</p>

          <p>Portadown, County Armagh, experienced its fourth consecutive night of disorder, although at a lower level than previous nights, with a crowd throwing bricks and masonry at police. The unrest began after a peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault in Ballymena, resulting in 41 officers injured and 15 people arrested. Police issued warnings and maintained a heavy presence in Portadown, where around 400 protesters gathered, while Ballymena saw a reduced police presence and no further violence. An anti-racism protest in west Belfast, attended by around 100 people, passed off peacefully.</p>

          <p>Iran and Israel have been adversaries for decades, with Iran expressing a desire to eliminate Israel and Israel considering Iran its primary foe. However, prior to the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the two nations were allies, with Iran being among the first to recognize Israel in 1948. Relations shifted dramatically after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini came to power, leading Iran to criticize Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories and support groups like Hezbollah against Israeli interests. Despite some Iranians questioning this hostility, the current Iranian leadership maintains an antagonistic stance towards Israel, denying the Holocaust and supporting anti-Israel groups.</p>

          <p>Following the imposition of reciprocal tariffs on imports from China by the United States, Beijing has implemented measures to support Chinese exporters in shifting their focus to the domestic market. One strategy involves promoting the increased use of letters of credit (L/Cs), which serve as a guarantee to sellers that payments for goods or services will be made on time. Domestic L/Cs, issued by major Chinese banks, offer payment security and enhance credit, addressing key concerns for Chinese firms. Unlike international L/Cs, domestic ones can be used for both physical goods and services.</p>

          <p>The Mechanical Engineering Industry Association (VDMA) in Germany, representing medium-sized manufacturers, is calling for the EU to impose trade barriers to protect against China's "unfair state subsidies." This marks a shift from previously praising the Sino-German economic relationship. The VDMA's position paper advocates for countervailing duties on imports from third countries violating EU anti-dumping or anti-subsidy rules, specifically targeting China's aggressive export policies. The industry group asserts that Chinese companies receive heavy government subsidies and sometimes disregard technical regulations, creating an uneven playing field that requires government intervention.</p>

Kim Jong Un, who reportedly reacted angrily to the failed launch, oversaw the second launch at Rajin Port, with state media reporting that the ship has been fully restored. Experts are questioning whether the repairs are genuinely complete given the speed of the relaunch. Kim Jong Un has made developing a nuclear-armed navy a priority and plans to build two more of these destroyers in the coming year.</p>

          <p>Markets in Asia opened lower, and oil prices surged after Israel attacked Iran's capital amid rising tensions over Tehran's nuclear program. U.S. benchmark crude oil rose significantly, as did Brent crude, while Tokyo's Nikkei 225, Seoul's Kospi, Hong Kong's Hang Seng, and the Shanghai Composite Index all experienced declines. The Economist Intelligence suggests that Asian markets are expected to recover quickly due to limited exposure to the conflict and growing ties to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq composite all rose, supported by encouraging inflation data and Oracle's strong performance, offsetting a loss for Boeing following the Air India crash.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israel would continue attacking Iran to eliminate its nuclear program, with strikes targeting nuclear fuel production, bomb assembly, and missile delivery facilities. Israel claims that Iran was in the final stages of assembling nuclear weapons, though this claim is difficult to verify. Israel's actions are seen as an attempt to break Iran's immunity from direct attack, which it had previously maintained through its network of proxies in the Middle East. By attacking Iran directly, Israel aims to weaken Iran's deterrent power and prevent it from achieving nuclear statehood.</p>

          <p>Israel launched strikes against Iran, with Defense Minister Israel Katz stating a state of emergency was declared following the preemptive strike, anticipating a missile and drone attack. Air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv after the announcement, and the U.S. clarified it did not provide assistance or have any involvement in the Israeli strike. The IDF said the strikes hit Iran's nuclear program, marking an escalation in the ongoing tensions between the two nations. This action comes amid continued concerns over Iran's nuclear ambitions and regional influence.</p>

          <p>India is seeking to develop its domestic rare earth supplies in response to China's export restrictions, with experts suggesting it could become an alternative for partners like the U.S. The world has been grappling with a rare earths shortage due to China's curbs, affecting auto manufacturers in India, the U.S., Japan, South Korea, and Germany. Indian officials are considering leveraging India Rare Earths to increase rare earth magnet production, and India's Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal called China's pause in exports a "wake-up call" for the world and an opportunity for India. China currently dominates the rare earth elements market, producing roughly 60% of the world's supply and processing almost 90%.</p>

          <p>The owner of a nightclub in the Dominican Republic, Antonio Espaillat, and his sister Maribel Espaillat, have been arrested following a roof collapse in April that resulted in the deaths of 236 people. Authorities have accused the Espaillats of "immense irresponsibility and negligence" for failing to prevent the collapse. Prosecutors allege that the Espaillats tried to intimidate or manipulate company employees who could serve as witnesses in the case. A former employee claimed he warned Antonio Espaillat that the roof could collapse before the April 7 party, and he is holding the Espaillat family responsible if anything happens to him.</p>

He emphasized that digital assets do not represent any risks or comparison to gold and should not be marketed as "gold 2.0" due to their different characteristics.
