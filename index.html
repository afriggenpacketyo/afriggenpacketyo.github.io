          <p>Nintendo has revealed the Switch 2, set to launch on June 5th for $449.99, featuring a larger screen and faster performance compared to its predecessor, which sold over 150 million units since 2017. The new console will maintain the original Switch's hybrid functionality, allowing use as both a handheld device and a console connected to a television. However, preorders will be delayed due to President Trump's "reciprocal tariffs". The device will launch with "Mario Kart World," alongside other games like "Donkey Kong Bananza" and "Street Fighter 6."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to block the return of a Maryland man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The Solicitor General argues that a federal court cannot compel the president to engage in foreign diplomacy, which they claim is necessary for Garcia's return. Garcia, who had protected legal status, was sent to a mega-prison in El Salvador following an "administrative error." The lower courts ruled that Garcia must be returned to the U.S., emphasizing the government's lack of due process.</p>

          <p>As bonds regain popularity amid a crashing market driven by President Trump's tariffs, investors are increasingly favoring actively managed bond strategies over passive, index-based approaches. ETF experts note that active bond managers have historically outperformed their indexed counterparts with greater consistency than active stock managers. Factors like swift changes in treasury bond yields and the perceived flaws in core bond indexes like the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (AGG) contribute to this trend. This shift reflects a desire for more flexibility and expertise in navigating the complexities of the fixed-income market (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>U.S. stock markets experienced significant volatility, fluctuating between losses and gains as investors assessed the potential economic impact of President Trump's tariffs. The S&P 500 briefly entered bear market territory before rebounding on reports of a potential tariff freeze, only to resume its decline. Economists at Goldman Sachs have increased the odds of a recession to 45%, citing the tariffs as a major factor. Investors are concerned that the tariffs will negatively affect U.S. economic growth and drive up inflation (not investment advice).</p>

The Scottish Open was a lifetime goal; one he realised by winning in East Lothian last July. In his own words, it was the stuff of “absolute fairytale”.</p>

          <p>U.S. oil prices have fallen below $60 a barrel to their lowest level since 2021, driven by fears that President Trump's global tariffs will push the U.S. and global economy into a recession. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude hit a session low of $58.95 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent also experienced a significant drop. The decision by OPEC+ to increase production has further contributed to the downward pressure on oil prices. Trump touted the steep fall in oil prices early Monday, but worries are mounting that tariffs could lead to higher prices for businesses (not investment advice).</p>

There are three levels: a 7% drop halts trading for 15 minutes (if before 3:25 PM ET), a 13% drop also halts trading for 15 minutes (if before 3:25 PM ET), and a 20% drop suspends trading for the rest of the day.

While stock markets can be linked to the economy, they are not the same, and pension investing is a long-term game. The popularity of tariffs in the US is low, and the move is thought to be about an economic proxy war with China. The question of whether the markets will recover is uncertain, as economists raise the chance of recession in the US, UK, and globally (not investment advice).</p>
