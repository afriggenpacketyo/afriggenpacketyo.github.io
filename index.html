          <h2>Commerce Secretary Stands Firm on Tariffs Amid Market Turmoil</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a global stock market sell-off following President Trump's tariff announcements on April 2, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick affirmed that the tariffs are proceeding as planned. Lutnick stated that the White House is not considering postponing the implementation, emphasizing the President's commitment to resetting global trade imbalances. Global stocks have already erased billions in market value since the tariff declaration, and Lutnick's remarks align with Treasury Secretary Bessent's stance on maintaining the course. The tariffs, which include a 10% duty on all imported goods and higher levies on imports from 57 countries, are set to take effect on April 9.&#x20;</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller reiterated his stance against tariffs exceeding 10% in a social media post, distancing himself from President Trump's tariff plan that includes rates as high as 50%. Druckenmiller has consistently opposed tariffs above this threshold, viewing them as a consumption tax with shared burden between domestic and foreign entities. Stock prices have sharply declined following Trump's tariff announcement, causing market losses not seen since the Covid-19 pandemic. Druckenmiller's comment serves as a direct response to the current administration's tariff policies and their impact on the market. &#x20;</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge has issued a scathing rebuke of the Trump administration for mistakenly deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man with legal protection from deportation, to a dangerous prison in El Salvador.

The Justice Department has appealed the ruling, while a lawyer arguing the case on behalf of the Trump administration was put on leave.

          <p>The UK government is relaxing regulations for car firms ahead of the 2030 ban on petrol vehicles, aiming to support the industry amid potential impacts from US tariffs. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander announced the changes to provide more flexibility to manufacturers transitioning to all-electric vehicles. Smaller UK firms will be allowed to continue producing petrol cars beyond the 2030 deadline, and some hybrid vehicles can remain on the market until 2035. Opposition parties have criticized the measures as insufficient to protect the sector from the effects of President Trump's tariffs.</p>

          <p>California has an opportunity to reduce emissions and improve climate resilience by investing in climate-smart agricultural practices. Despite passing a $10 billion climate bond, the state underfunds programs that help farmers adopt environmentally friendly methods. These programs, which include planting perennials and using cover crops, increase soil carbon and improve water retention. Investing in these practices can benefit farmers economically and reduce pollution, but the state legislature needs to provide adequate and consistent funding.</p>
