          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to push for the passage of a budget bill, facing opposition from both conservative and moderate factions. Conservatives sought deeper spending cuts, while blue-state Republicans demanded changes to the state and local tax deduction (SALT). A manager's amendment was released with provisions addressing Medicaid work requirements and clean energy subsidies, as well as increasing the SALT deduction to $40,000 for households with incomes up to $500,000. The bill aims to address the deficit but faces challenges in garnering enough support for passage. </p>

          <p>An NYPD inspector, Terrell Anderson, was transferred from his command of the candidate assessment division after it was discovered that he had overridden negative psychological reports for 80 prospective officers.

          <p>Senate Republicans are moving to revoke three vehicle emissions waivers in California, which set stricter standards than federal regulations, a move Democrats are calling "the nuclear option." These waivers include regulations on tailpipe emissions and the state's EV mandate, aiming to phase out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn these waivers, while Democrats contend that such a vote would be illegal and set a dangerous precedent. The California Air Resources Board claims the state has never had a waiver revoked in 50 years and is prepared to sue the federal government if the waivers are overturned. </p>

          <p>The city of St. Louis failed to activate its tornado sirens before a deadly tornado struck, killing five people and injuring dozens. Mayor Cara Spencer placed the city's emergency manager on administrative leave pending an investigation into the failure to warn residents. The city's emergency management agency did not activate the alarms, and a backup system at the Fire Department was broken. The mayor's office has changed the siren activation protocol to prevent similar failures in the future. </p>

          <p>The Justice Department is shifting the priorities for a grant program that provides millions of dollars to local police departments, eliminating language that encouraged initiatives to help "underserved populations" and build trust. Instead, the Trump administration is prioritizing "immigration and border security," "violent crime prevention," and "uplifting the image of the law enforcement profession." This shift in grant instructions has raised concerns about which police agencies will be granted money and what programs will be approved for federal help. </p>

          <p>President Trump confronted South African President Ramaphosa about land seizures from white farmers, falsely accusing the government of systemic persecution. The article contrasts Trump's attacks on South Africa with his own use of eminent domain to seize land for the U.S.-Mexico border wall. The article highlights the experience of Richard Drawe, a Texas farmer who reluctantly agreed to allow the government to build on his land, underscoring the president's selective concerns for human rights. </p>

The legislation would hold individuals or companies liable for producing unauthorized digital replicas and establish a notice-and-takedown process for victims. </p>
