          <h2>Trump Administration Reportedly Seeks Minimum 15-20% Tariffs on EU Imports</h2>

          <p>According to a Financial Times report, President Donald Trump is pushing for a minimum tariff of 15-20% on all imports from the European Union, escalating demands in ongoing trade negotiations. The talks appear to have stalled ahead of an August 1 deadline, as the EU had hoped for a more modest 10% baseline tariff similar to its deal with the U.K. This move reflects Trump's persistent focus on the U.S. trade deficit with the bloc, a stance that has previously caused significant market volatility.

          <p>Illinois Senator Richard Durbin has claimed that FBI agents reviewing files related to Jeffrey Epstein were instructed to specifically "flag" any documents that mentioned President Donald Trump. In letters to the Justice Department and FBI, Durbin cited information that a rushed, large-scale review of records was conducted by personnel who may have lacked proper expertise. This allegation adds to the political pressure surrounding the handling and transparency of the Epstein investigation files.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has warned the public after 38 cases of botulism poisoning were linked to the use of suspected unlicensed Botox-like products over the past six weeks. Botulism is a rare but life-threatening condition, and affected patients have experienced severe symptoms like difficulty swallowing and breathing. Health officials are urging individuals seeking cosmetic procedures to verify their practitioner's qualifications and ensure that all products used are officially licensed to prevent serious harm.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's government has reduced its spending on hotels for asylum seekers by nearly one-third, from £3 billion to £2.1 billion in the past fiscal year. According to Home Office data, this saving was achieved by moving individuals into cheaper accommodations like shared housing and by renegotiating contracts. However, experts warn that a recent surge in small boat crossings could increase the reliance on hotel accommodations again, challenging the government's goal of ending their use.</p>

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have announced they will take no further action against the Irish rap group Kneecap following a criminal investigation into their performance at the Glastonbury festival. The investigation was launched over on-stage comments related to a band member's upcoming court case. After consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service, police concluded there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction, ending a controversy that the band labeled "political policing intimidation."</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order creating "Schedule G," a new classification for federal employees in policy-making roles who can be hired and fired at will. The White House claims this will dismantle the "deep state" and streamline operations, but critics argue it is another attempt to politicize the civil service. This move is similar to the controversial Schedule F and aligns with conservative plans to give the executive more direct control over the federal workforce.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to wear an ankle monitor and adhere to a nighttime curfew amid fears he might flee the country while on trial. Bolsonaro is accused of plotting a coup to prevent his successor from taking office in 2023, charges he denies. The restrictions, which also bar him from social media, follow pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened tariffs on Brazil over what he calls a "witch hunt."</p>

          <p>In a late-night vote, House Republicans passed a bill to claw back $9 billion in federal funding, a key demand from President Trump. The measure, which passed 216-213 along party lines, cuts approximately $8 billion from foreign assistance programs and $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS. The vote was briefly delayed by procedural maneuvers from Democrats related to the release of files concerning Jeffrey Epstein, but the package ultimately advanced to the president's desk.</p>

While plans to dismantle the agency appear shelved, a White House council is expected to recommend changes that emphasize state leadership and reduce what it calls a "bloated bureaucracy." Critics caution that shifting more financial burden to states could be unsustainable, as they heavily rely on federal resources during major disasters.</p>

          <p>For retirees who are "house rich but cash poor," a reverse mortgage can be a tool to supplement Social Security benefits by converting home equity into income. This article outlines three ways this can work: creating a steady monthly payment stream, providing a lump sum or line of credit for unexpected costs like healthcare, or enabling a retiree to delay claiming Social Security to receive a larger monthly benefit later. The loan typically does not require repayment until the homeowner moves or passes away. (not investment advice)</p>
