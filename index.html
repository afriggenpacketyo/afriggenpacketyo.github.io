          <p>The BBC accompanied injured Gazan children as they were airlifted to Jordan for medical treatment after 19 months of war. One mother expressed relief at seeing Jordan's peaceful landscape, a stark contrast to the constant bombing in Gaza. Thirty-three children have been evacuated to Jordan, with plans to bring 2,000 sick children for treatment, although Jordanian sources cite Israeli delays and restrictions as impediments. The UN warns of a famine risk for Gaza's 2.1 million residents due to the Israeli blockade, with one mother describing the situation as 'horrible beyond words'.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) has agreed to disband after 41 years of armed insurgency against the Turkish state, a decision greeted with both celebration and questions. Experts suggest the move could fundamentally alter Turkey's political landscape, impacting parties like the pro-Kurdish DEM. Key uncertainties remain, including the surrender of weapons, the fate of PKK members, and the potential for a new organization to emerge. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan emphasized that merely laying down arms is insufficient; the PKK must dismantle its illegal structures and adopt an accountable organizational model.</p>

          <p>Argentina's President Javier Milei issued a decree curbing immigration, mirroring policies of the Trump administration. The measures tighten citizenship requirements, mandating two years of uninterrupted residency or significant financial investment. Immigrants seeking residency must show proof of income and clean criminal records. The decree facilitates the deportation of migrants who enter illegally or commit minor crimes. Foreigners will now be charged for public health care and education, with universities permitted to introduce fees for foreign studies. Milei's government aims to 'make Argentina great again,' sparking criticism and concerns about Argentina's tradition of openness.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economy is experiencing a boom driven by pharmaceutical exports, particularly from Novo Nordisk's diabetes and weight loss medications, Wegovy and Ozempic. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects Denmark's growth to moderate in the coming years but believes potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry will have limited impact. Danish drugmakers rely on a 'merchanting and processing' system, with most value attributed to intellectual property and manufacturing contracted to other countries. The IMF notes that direct impacts from U.S. tariffs are expected to be limited, but heightened trade tensions pose risks.</p>

Trump lauded al-Sharaa, a former insurgent, contrasting with past U.S. policy. The Qatari base houses approximately 8,000 U.S. troops, and Qatar has invested significantly in its development. Trump and the emir of Qatar signed agreements, including a deal for Qatar to purchase American-made MQ-9B drones.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is considering doubling the release of stockpiled rice to address near-record high prices, potentially releasing 100,000 tons per month for three months. This supplements the 321,000 tons auctioned between March and April. The decision comes after average rice prices rose to record highs before recently declining. The shortage is attributed to a poor harvest in 2023 and increased rice consumption due to a surge in foreign tourists. The government is also considering relaxing buyback requirements for distributors to encourage participation in auctions.</p>

          <p>Since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, numerous attempts to achieve a lasting peace in Ukraine have failed. Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed a new round of ceasefire negotiations in Istanbul, which was rebuffed by European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. No lasting ceasefire has been achieved since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, with numerous short-term agreements repeatedly breached. Both nations have accused each other of violating these agreements, as well as ceasefires declared by just one side. This article details a history of broken ceasefires in the conflict.</p>

The law seeks to prevent unfair treatment of software suppliers, such as product screening outside normal assessments.
