          <p>Northampton Saints delivered a stunning 37-34 victory over Leinster in the Investec Champions Cup semi-final at Aviva Stadium, fueled by a desire for revenge after last year's defeat. Alex Mitchell emphasized the team's fearless approach, punching Leinster in the face during the first 20 minutes, which the Irish province wasn't expecting. Tommy Freeman scored a hat-trick, and Henry Pollock added a searing try, while Leinster responded after half-time but lacked the clinical edge to regain the lead. Phil Dowson, Saints' director of rugby, highlighted the belief within the group despite being written off by many, emphasizing the significance of their defensive effort at the end.</p>

          <p>Israel announced the mobilization of thousands of reserve soldiers to reinforce its military operations against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, signaling a potential shift in tactics. The move raises concerns about an expanded offensive in Gaza, where humanitarian aid has been restricted for over two months.

The bill provides most students attending accredited private schools with $10,000 per year, students with disabilities with up to $30,000 per year, and home-schooled students with $2,000 a year.

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a law making over 5 million students eligible for state funds to attend private schools, allocating $1 billion for the program's first two years. The law allows eligible students to receive up to $10,000 a year to attend private schools beginning in the 2026-27 school year. Supporters say the law empowers parents to choose the best learning environment for their children, while opponents argue it drains money from public schools and primarily benefits wealthier families. The new law makes Texas the 16th state to offer public funds for private education to all students.</p>

          <p>Federal officials conducted a sweep of a large homeless encampment in Oregon, forcing dozens of people to relocate to other wooded areas. With limited housing options, many displaced individuals moved to nearby forests, highlighting the ongoing challenges of homelessness in the area. The removal, described as the largest eviction of a homeless camp in recent history, has raised concerns about the lack of long-term solutions for the homeless population. Advocates emphasize that the action is merely shifting the problem rather than addressing the root causes of homelessness.</p>
