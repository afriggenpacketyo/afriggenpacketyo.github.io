          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a 17% tariff on most fresh tomatoes from Mexico, citing unfair trade practices after negotiations failed. Proponents believe this will protect U.S. tomato growers, who have seen their market share shrink significantly as Mexican imports now constitute about 70% of the U.S. market. Conversely, opponents, including business groups and U.S. companies with operations in Mexico, warn the tariff will increase tomato prices for consumers and could provoke retaliatory actions from trading partners. The Commerce Department's decision aligns with the administration's broader protectionist trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla is defending its Autopilot technology in a Miami federal court against a wrongful death lawsuit. The case stems from a 2019 crash where a Model S using Autopilot struck a parked vehicle, killing a 22-year-old woman and severely injuring her boyfriend. The plaintiffs argue that design defects in the Autopilot system failed to prevent the collision. Tesla counters that the driver was distracted and responsible for the crash, stating the technology is an assistance system and does not make the car self-driving.</p>

          <p>Bob Becker, an 80-year-old from Fort Lauderdale, has made history by becoming the oldest person to complete the Badwater 135, a notoriously difficult 135-mile race through California's Death Valley. Becker finished the ultramarathon with approximately three hours to spare, successfully settling a "score" after missing the 48-hour cutoff by just 17 minutes the previous year. Having started running marathons at age 60, Becker's achievement highlights his remarkable endurance and determination. He credited his success to his dedicated support crew and coaches.</p>

His death occurred just days before a scheduled court appearance, preventing the case from proceeding to trial.

          <p>A provision in the recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" will allow some U.S. car buyers to deduct auto loan interest from their taxes. Starting with vehicles purchased in 2025, qualifying taxpayers can deduct up to $10,000 in loan interest, even if they take the standard deduction. The tax break is limited to new, U.S.-assembled passenger vehicles and is phased out for single filers earning over $100,000 and married couples earning over $200,000. This new deduction replaces the federal tax credit for electric vehicles, which is being eliminated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Economists and trade experts are warning that President Trump's recent wave of tariff threats against dozens of countries, including Mexico and the European Union, is fostering significant economic uncertainty. With an August 1 deadline looming, businesses are left in a "dense fog," unable to determine if the threats will become policy. The administration has defended its aggressive use of tariffs as a tool to ensure fair trade and advance other policy goals. However, critics argue the conflicting justifications and lack of comprehensive trade deals are making it difficult for businesses and consumers to plan for the future. (not investment advice)</p>

The 23-year-old had a strong season, scoring 15 goals and providing eight assists.

Despite the interest in Ekitike, sources insist that the club has no intention of selling Isak, who has been linked with other top European clubs.</p>

          <p>The recent deadly flash floods in Texas are highlighting critical gaps in the nation's primary tool for identifying flood risk, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) flood maps.

This leaves many homeowners and communities unprepared and uninsured for their true level of risk. Newer climate-adjusted models suggest that far more properties are at risk than FEMA maps indicate, a reality now reflected on real estate websites.</p>

          <p>President Trump is facing rare criticism from his own base after telling them to "not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein." In a social media post, Trump defended his administration's handling of the Epstein files and dismissed the matter, a move that undermines a core belief within the MAGA movement about uncovering a "deep state." The backlash has been intense, as many supporters had believed Trump's presidency would expose alleged conspiracies surrounding Epstein. This comes after the Justice Department's conclusion that no "client list" existed and Epstein's death was a suicide, findings that are widely rejected by his base.</p>
