          <p>In an excerpt from her upcoming memoir, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon recounts her arrest during a police investigation into the SNP's finances, calling it the "worst day of my life." She expresses disbelief over the police raid on her home and the subsequent legal proceedings, from which she was later cleared of any wrongdoing. The memoir also delves into deeply personal topics, including the pain of suffering a miscarriage and her views on sexuality, which she describes as not being binary.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly presented an award to President Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, intended for a senior CIA official whose son was killed fighting for Russian forces in Ukraine. The award, a Soviet-era Order of Lenin, was meant for Juliane Gallina, a deputy director at the CIA, in recognition of her son who died in 2024. This gesture is viewed as a psychological tactic by Putin to highlight a sensitive situation, as the CIA had previously stated the son's actions were a personal tragedy and not a national security issue.</p>

          <p>Chicago's severe budget shortfall is drawing comparisons to the expensive platform of New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani, sparking debate over the potential fiscal impact of his proposals. While Chicago's mayor warns of finances at a "point of no return," critics in New York fear Mamdani's democratic socialist agenda, which includes free transit and childcare, could strain the city's budget. Mamdani's rivals, including incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, argue his plans are fiscally irresponsible and anti-business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has directed the Pentagon to develop military options for potential use against drug cartels that the administration has designated as foreign terrorist organizations. While officials state that any military action is not imminent, the directive authorizes planning for operations against groups like the Sinaloa Cartel and MS-13. This move follows an executive order from January and allows for the use of various elements of national power, including the Department of Defense, to target these groups, which Secretary of State Marco Rubio described as being armed like armies.</p>

          <p>An American man from Dallas, identified as 52-year-old Asher Watkins, was killed by a Cape buffalo while on a trophy hunting safari in South Africa's Limpopo province. The safari company that organized the expedition confirmed he was fatally gored during the hunt in what they described as a sudden and unprovoked attack. The Cape buffalo is known for being one of the most dangerous animals to hunt in Africa, often responsible for injuries and deaths each year. The incident highlights the inherent risks of big-game hunting.</p>

This decision comes after Chelsea signed two new strikers, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap, during the summer transfer window.

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing a record $1.21 trillion and average interest rates near 22%, many Americans are struggling with compounding interest charges. This article outlines several strategies to combat this debt, including transferring balances to a 0% APR credit card to pause interest accumulation. Other methods discussed are enrolling in a card issuer's hardship program, paying off the balance before the statement closing date, and consolidating debt with a lower-interest personal loan to halt the cycle.

          <h2>Why a CD Laddering Strategy Is Advantageous in the Current Economic Climate</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-08 13:27:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Given the current economic environment of high but potentially falling interest rates, a CD laddering strategy offers a timely advantage for savers. This approach involves opening multiple certificates of deposit with staggered maturity dates, allowing savers to lock in today's favorable rates while maintaining flexibility. With the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates, acting now secures higher returns, and using a mix of short-term CDs ensures that some funds become accessible relatively soon, providing liquidity in an unpredictable economy without incurring early withdrawal penalties.

          <p>Archaeologists from East Carolina University may have discovered the remains of La Fortuna, a Spanish privateer ship that exploded during an attack on a North Carolina port in 1748. The team found four shipwrecks at the Brunswick Town/Fort Anderson State Historic Site, with wood samples from one wreck suggesting it was built with materials from Spanish Caribbean colonies. The location of the find is near where a cannon believed to be from La Fortuna was recovered in 1985. The recovered timbers are now being conserved for further study.</p>

Traveling at 130,000 mph, the comet poses no threat to Earth and will pass closest to the sun in late October. Hubble's observations have helped narrow down the size of its icy core to no more than 3.5 miles in diameter. While most scientists view it as a natural phenomenon, some, like Harvard professor Avi Loeb, suggest its unusual characteristics warrant investigation into whether it could be an object of artificial origin.</p>

This follows the Trump administration's designation of several Latin American cartels as terrorist organizations, a move that Secretary of State Marco Rubio said allows for the use of American military and intelligence power against them.</p>

Citing high-profile cases where citizens, including children, were detained or deported, the lawmakers sent letters to DHS oversight offices requesting data on how many Americans have been affected. They argue that aggressive tactics, particularly in Latino and Native American communities, are violating civil rights.
