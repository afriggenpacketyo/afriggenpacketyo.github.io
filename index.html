          <p>An essay in the New York Times discusses President Biden's metastatic prostate cancer diagnosis and its implications, highlighting the renewed concerns about his health and overall fitness for office, particularly given his age and signs of decline. The author, a geriatrician and palliative care doctor, emphasizes the importance of facing the realities of aging, especially for those in positions of power, and planning for potential health challenges. While metastatic prostate cancer is treatable, the article underscores that Biden's frailty makes cancer and its treatment more difficult, raising questions about his ability to withstand the rigors of a second term. The author urges leaders to prioritize forthright information and planning, rather than denial, to ensure the well-being of the country.</p>

          <p>Lowe's reported its first-quarter earnings, slightly missing sales expectations but beating earnings estimates, and reaffirmed its full-year forecast, supported by growing sales to home professionals. CEO Marvin Ellison attributed the company's resilience to investments in stores, technology, and customer service, which helped navigate near-term market uncertainties and housing market headwinds. While demand from do-it-yourself customers has slowed due to high interest rates, Lowe's is focusing on attracting more sales from professionals, including the acquisition of Artisan Design Group for $1.3 billion. The company expects full-year sales to range from $83.5 billion to $84.5 billion, with comparable sales flat to up 1% year over year.</p>

Many firms plan to achieve large-scale production this year, buoyed by recent tariff reductions between the US and China. Li-Gong Industrial aims to produce 1,000 units of its Lidian D1 humanoid robot, initially for manufacturing applications like car assembly, with plans to expand into service roles in the future. Shenzhen DX Intech Technology, which develops robotic receptionists and tour guides, is also expanding production and eyeing overseas markets, particularly the US, due to lowered tariffs.</p>

          <p>A Chinese research team from the PLA Air Force Early Warning Academy in Wuhan assessed the US military's tactical nuclear air strike capabilities against China and surprisingly identified the 70-year-old B-52 Stratofortress bomber as the greatest threat. The study, published in Modern Defence Technology, simulated a US Air Force penetrating counterair (PCA) operation and found the B-52 to be the most significant threat across all combat phases, including deployment, penetration, and strike. The PCA strategy relies on advanced platforms like F-35A stealth fighters and B-2 Spirit bombers, but the research highlighted the destructive potential of the B61-12 air-launched tactical thermonuclear bombs carried by the B-52.</p>

          <p>Volatile lumber prices are once again causing concern in the U.S. housing market, potentially exacerbating the affordability crisis for builders and consumers. Softwood lumber prices surged 23% year-over-year in April, with futures rising amid fears of increased U.S. duties on Canadian lumber and sawmill closures. The U.S. currently imposes a 14.5% duty on Canadian lumber, which accounts for a significant portion of U.S. supply, and this rate could increase to 34.5% following a regulatory review. Experts warn that higher tariffs and supply instability could stall new development, as nearly 100 million U.S. households cannot afford a median-priced home.</p>

          <p>President Trump visited House Republicans to pressure them to support the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' aimed at advancing his domestic agenda, but faced resistance from various factions concerned about specific details. Despite Trump's entreaties, many Republicans remained unconvinced, seeking further changes to the bill, which includes extending tax cuts, increasing military and immigration enforcement spending, and cutting Medicaid and other social programs. Speaker Mike Johnson negotiated with lawmakers to address their concerns, particularly regarding Medicaid changes and state and local tax deductions, hoping to secure enough votes for passage. The legislation is predicted to result in around 10 million Americans becoming uninsured, according to the Congressional Budget Office.</p>

          <p>Target has lowered its full-year sales outlook, citing weaker discretionary spending, consumer uncertainty regarding tariffs, and negative reactions to the company's decision to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.

CEO Brian Cornell attributed many of the company's problems to the economy, but acknowledged the need for improvement, noting that Target is losing market share in many merchandise categories.

The report also highlights the struggles of fast-food workers, who earn an average hourly wage of $15.07 and spend a significant portion of their salary on meals from their employers.

          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba dismissed farm minister Taku Eto after controversial remarks about receiving so much rice from supporters that he doesn't need to buy any, sparking public outrage amid soaring rice prices. Ishiba appointed Shinjiro Koizumi, a popular political figure, as the new agriculture chief in an attempt to regain public trust. Eto's dismissal came shortly after the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries decided to release additional rice from its emergency stockpiles to lower prices, which have doubled from a year earlier. The latest scandal comes as Ishiba prepares for a House of Councillors election this summer.</p>

          <p>Four British former special forces soldiers set a record by climbing Mount Everest in under five days without acclimatizing on the mountain, using a high-speed expedition aided by xenon gas. The team, including a UK government minister, summited the world's highest peak early on Wednesday, using xenon to pre-acclimatize to low oxygen at high altitudes. The use of xenon remains disputed within the mountaineering industry, with some criticizing it, but organizers say it made the fast ascent possible. The team reached the 8,849-meter summit after starting their climb on May 16, taking four days and approximately 18 hours.</p>

          <p>Official data indicates that UK inflation has risen to its highest rate in more than a year, reaching 3.5% in April, driven by an increase in household bills. The rise in inflation, which exceeded economists' expectations, is attributed to higher water, gas, and electricity prices. The Bank of England, which aims to keep inflation at 2%, may now be less likely to implement two interest rate cuts this year, with some economists suggesting only one cut is probable. Water and sewerage prices saw the largest rise in 37 years, while a sharp increase in airfare costs also contributed to the inflation increase.</p>

          <p>Treasury yields increased as investors worried that a new U.S. tax bill could worsen the country's deficit, compounded by Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. The 30-year Treasury bond yield rose to 5.023%, while the 10-year yield climbed to 4.533%. Investors are closely monitoring discussions around President Trump's budget bill, with some Republicans seeking larger deductions for state and local taxes, which could further increase the deficit. Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio warned that the Moody's downgrade poses a greater threat to U.S. Treasurys, as the credit agency isn't considering the risk of the federal government printing money to pay its debt.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent trip to the Middle East has been lauded for its focus on using the American private sector as an instrument of national power and for avoiding traditional nation-building projects. Trump brought captains of American industry to meetings with Gulf states, positioning the U.S. as a commercial and strategic partner rather than just an arms merchant or human rights scold. In exchange, Americans are expected to benefit from hundreds of billions of dollars in new investment. Trump's willingness to navigate Middle East politics without being constrained by domestic concerns has allowed him to take actions that other presidents could not.</p>

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán have all faced challenges in their relationships with the Trump administration. Trump's focus on big-money deals and quick wins, particularly in the Middle East, has led him to prioritize relationships with wealthy monarchs over ideological alignment, resulting in frustration among some of his most prominent global allies.</p>

From January to April, Japan welcomed approximately 14.45 million foreign arrivals, exceeding the 11.60 million recorded in the same period in 2024. Authorities are struggling to manage overcrowding in popular areas and encourage tourists to explore the countryside, with the number of foreign visitors this year potentially reaching 45 million or 46 million.</p>

Judges stated that the act's provision for "open-air recreation" naturally includes camping.

In April, sales were down but still rose 4.8 per cent year-on-year, to 4,785 tonnes.
