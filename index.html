          <p>China's cyberspace administration has summoned Nvidia to address national security risks associated with its H20 AI chips, which are designed for the Chinese market. The inquiry follows reports of potential "backdoors" and calls from U.S. lawmakers to embed tracking technology in advanced semiconductors. This development adds another layer of geopolitical complexity for Nvidia, as it tries to navigate U.S. export controls while catering to the significant Chinese market. The company had previously anticipated resuming H20 chip shipments after a temporary ban.</p>

French ministers condemned the remark as discriminatory and unacceptable, also criticizing the use of force by Spanish police against a trip counselor.

          <p>Malaysia's transport minister, Anthony Loke, has indicated that several Malaysian airlines, including AirAsia, are interested in China's C919 passenger jet. The growing interest is driven by a need to diversify aircraft procurement and address long delivery backlogs from established manufacturers like Airbus and Boeing. China's state-owned COMAC is promoting the C919 as a more readily available and cost-effective alternative for narrowbody airliners. This development highlights China's increasing competitiveness in the global aviation market, particularly within Southeast Asia.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has sanctioned Brazilian Supreme Court Judge Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing a case against former President Jair Bolsonaro, for allegedly suppressing free expression. In a related move, President Trump signed an executive order raising tariffs on Brazil to 50%, linking the action to the "politically motivated persecution" of Bolsonaro. Brazilian President Lula da Silva condemned the measures as an unacceptable interference in the country's sovereignty and justice system. This escalation marks a significant downturn in diplomatic and trade relations between the two largest economies in the Americas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia's pioneering national ban on social media for young people, aimed at tackling a perceived youth mental health crisis, is facing scrutiny from experts. While the policy enjoys strong public support, some researchers argue there is insufficient evidence of a direct causal link between social media use and poor mental health. Critics suggest the ban is an oversimplified solution to a complex problem and could push young users to less-regulated corners of the internet. The debate highlights the challenge of balancing child protection with the need to educate youth for a digitally-saturated world.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed the pervasive issue of organized crime gangs operating through high street shops in the UK, primarily selling illegal tobacco and vapes. In Newport, Wales, 19 such shops have been shut down in nine months, but the problem persists as criminals quickly reopen or relocate. The trade is linked to wider criminality, including forced labor, drug dealing, and intimidation, leaving local residents feeling unsafe. Trading Standards officers describe the situation as an "endless battle," hampered by limited enforcement powers and the elusive nature of the gang leaders.</p>

          <p>Meta's shares surged after the company reported second-quarter financial results that significantly exceeded analyst expectations, calming fears about its position in the AI race. The company's revenue hit $47.5 billion, driven by the success of its AI-powered advertising tools, which improved ad conversions on both Facebook and Instagram. CEO Mark Zuckerberg reaffirmed the company's commitment to heavy investment in AI, projecting spending of up to $72 billion this year. The strong performance is seen as a major validation of Zuckerberg's costly, long-term AI strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

The agreement represents a significant shift from the previous free trade arrangement, which had near-zero duties. While U.S. officials hailed the deal, South Korean officials expressed some regret over the new tariffs and noted differing interpretations of how profits from the investment would be shared.

          <p>A new Republican-led proposal to redraw Texas's congressional map is facing fierce opposition from Democrats, who label it a "grossly unfair" and "deeply undemocratic" gerrymander. The draft map, encouraged by President Trump, aims to flip five Democratic-held House districts into GOP-leaning seats by fracturing minority communities. Democrats warn this move could dilute the representation of Black and Latino voters and set a dangerous precedent for partisan redistricting nationwide. The plan must still pass the GOP-controlled state legislature, but it has intensified the political battle over voting rights and representation in Texas.</p>

          <p>China's official Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.3 in July, indicating a fourth straight month of contraction and missing analyst expectations. The decline is attributed to seasonal factors, extreme weather, and the ongoing trade tensions with the United States, which have led some businesses to shift orders to other countries. Sub-indexes for new orders and employment also remained in contraction territory, signaling persistent weakness in the world's second-largest economy. The data suggests that the economic impact of U.S. tariffs may become more apparent in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

The automaker, which manufactures most of its vehicles in the U.S., has already incurred an extra $800 million in duties in the second quarter alone. The costs are attributed to sustained high tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as levies on aluminum and steel. This announcement highlights the significant financial strain that President Trump's trade policies are placing on major American corporations. (not investment advice)</p>
