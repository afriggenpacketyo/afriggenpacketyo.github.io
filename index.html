          <h2>North Korea's Attempt to Launch Destroyer Fails, Kim Jong-un Vows Punishment</h2>

          <p>North Korea's attempt to launch a new navy destroyer failed, resulting in damage to the ship's hull. Kim Jong-un called the incident a "criminal act" caused by carelessness and vowed to punish those responsible. The ship lost balance during the launch, tearing holes in its hull. The launch failure is a significant embarrassment for Kim, who has touted his country's military buildup. The article mentions the North's successful missile launches from another destroyer last month, and their receipt of Russian military technology in return for artillery shells.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Actions Undermine Netanyahu's Image as Geopolitical Strategist</h2>

          <p>The article argues that Donald Trump's recent actions in the Middle East, excluding Israel from key decisions and pursuing negotiations with Iran, have damaged Benjamin Netanyahu's image as a geopolitical genius. By cutting Israel out of regional decision-making and pursuing negotiations with Iran, Trump has revealed Netanyahu to be less influential than previously perceived. The piece contends that Trump's actions have exposed Netanyahu's carefully cultivated political persona and made him look irrelevant on the international stage.</p>

          <p>A homeowner in Norway awoke to find a 440-foot container ship had run aground just meters from his house. The ship, NCL Salten, ran ashore for an unknown reason, causing damage to a heating pipe in the homeowner's cabin. The homeowner, who slept through the incident, was alerted by a neighbor who had repeatedly tried to ring his doorbell. None of the 16 crew members were injured, and the cause of the incident is under investigation.</p>

          <h2>Senate Blocks California's EV Mandate, Setting Up Legal Battle</h2>

          <p>The Senate has voted to block California's plan to phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles, setting up a legal battle. The move was made possible by deploying an unusual legislative tactic. The vote is a victory for the oil and gas industry and for Republicans who muscled through the vote. The repeal could affect other states that were planning to follow California's standards. The Senate is setting up a legal battle with California on environmental policy.</p>
