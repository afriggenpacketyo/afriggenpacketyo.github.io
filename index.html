          <p>Small businesses in the U.S. are experiencing financial strain due to the Trump administration's changing tariffs on Chinese goods. Bobby Djavaheri, owner of Yedi Houseware Appliances, faced a 145% tariff increase, significantly impacting his business's low-margin operations. While tariffs have since been reduced to 30%, the financial volatility and increased shipping prices continue to pose challenges. Businesses are now contemplating whether to pay the current tariff rate or wait for potential further reductions, with some utilizing foreign trade zones and bonded warehouses to defer payments. Djavaheri expresses concern about the government's lack of support and anticipates struggling to remain afloat this year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Parliament is revisiting the assisted dying bill, which has undergone substantial revisions since its initial approval. The government quietly revised its impact assessment, reducing the estimated number of assisted deaths in the first year from 787 to 647, which has drawn criticism from MPs who describe the process as "chaotic." Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, asserts that the updated version is improved and urges MPs to support it. The bill proposes that a panel of experts, including a legal professional, psychiatrist, and social worker, would oversee the process, rather than a High Court judge.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers are on the brink of striking due to disagreements over pay raises, with a potential walkout expected to affect over 300,000 commuters. Negotiations between NJ Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) are ongoing. NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri aims for a fair wage agreement that is also fiscally responsible for fare payers and taxpayers. Gov. Phil Murphy may declare a state of emergency if a strike occurs, and NJ Transit has a contingency plan to accommodate a limited number of riders, encouraging remote work where possible.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments concerning the authority of federal courts to issue nationwide injunctions, potentially limiting the ability to halt unconstitutional government actions. The cases involve President Trump's executive order to eliminate birthright citizenship, which contradicts the 14th Amendment. The Solicitor General argued that the constitutionality of the executive order is not the issue, but rather the power of a federal court to issue nationwide injunctions. A decision to end nationwide injunctions could lead to inconsistent laws across different federal districts, creating a patchwork of regulations until the Supreme Court resolves the issue nationally.</p>

The FDA has already requested more clinical data from Novavax before approving its COVID vaccine, and officials are questioning the necessity of COVID vaccines for children under 12.

The presentation suggests a need to refocus on FEMA's core mission and manage expectations regarding its role in disaster response. Acting Administrator David Richardson has stated his intention to push responsibilities down to the states and increase cost-sharing, aligning with President Trump's vision for a smaller FEMA.</p>

The Bank of Japan had previously cautioned about potential moderation in the country's economy due to global trade policies.

          <p>A brain-dead pregnant woman in Georgia is being kept on life support to allow her fetus to develop, due to the state's strict abortion laws. The family is upset that Georgia's law, which restricts abortion once cardiac activity is detected, doesn't allow relatives to have a say in whether a pregnant woman is kept on life support. The fetus has fluid on the brain, raising concerns about its health. Bioethicists debate whether life support is legally required in this case, given the overturning of Roe v. Wade.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed former Sheriff Alex Villanueva’s $25-million lawsuit against Los Angeles County, alleging defamation and violation of rights due to a "do not rehire" designation. The lawsuit claimed that Villanueva lost employment opportunities because of the designation, which stemmed from a county panel's determination that he had harassed two officials. The judge found insufficient evidence to prove that Villanueva had been harmed or that the designation had caused him to lose out on a desired position. While the federal claim was dismissed, state matters are still pending.</p>

Ventura acknowledged loving Combs for over a decade but testified that his behavior became violent and coercive over time. The defense argued that Combs, while admitting to mistakes and domestic violence, never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone.</p>
