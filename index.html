The high-security prison houses over 600 inmates, including those convicted of terrorism. Authorities are investigating how the weapon, which was not prison-made, was smuggled into the facility. Earlier reports had warned about contraband entering the prison, including weapons brought in by drones, and the Prison Service has vowed to push for the strongest punishments against the perpetrator.</p>

          <p>World Boxing announced that it will implement mandatory gender tests for all male and female fighters in its competitions to ensure fairness and safety. The decision follows controversy surrounding Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, whose gender was questioned after she won gold at the Paris Olympics. The new policy requires athletes over 18 to undergo a PCR genetic test to detect the SRY gene, an indicator of biological sex, and athletes seeking to compete in women's categories will undergo additional screening if initial tests show male chromosomal material. The federation has informed the Algerian Boxing Federation that Khelif must submit to a gender test before competing in the upcoming Eindhoven Box Cup.</p>

          <p>Actress Loretta Swit, best known for her role as Maj. Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan on the TV series "M*A*S*H," has died at the age of 87 at her home in New York City of natural causes. Swit's character was a foil to Alan Alda's Benjamin Franklin "Hawkeye" Pierce on the show, which aired for 11 seasons on CBS. The show, adapted from Robert Altman's 1970 film, maintained an anti-establishment ethos and addressed issues such as racism, sexism, infidelity, and PTSD among service members.

          <p>Federal health officials report that a salmonella outbreak linked to recalled cucumbers has sickened nearly four dozen people across 18 states, leading to at least 16 hospitalizations. The recalled cucumbers, grown by Bedner Growers Inc., were sold at three Bedner's Farm Fresh Markets locations in Florida and distributed to stores, restaurants, and other locations in multiple states by Fresh Start Produce Inc. The CDC advises consumers to throw away cucumbers if they cannot determine their origin and to wash surfaces that may have come into contact with the contaminated produce. Symptoms of salmonella infection include diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps, and severe cases may require medical treatment.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's tenure as a "special government employee" leading the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has come to an end, with President Trump praising Musk's efforts to overhaul the federal government. While Musk initially promised to cut $1 trillion from the federal budget, the initiative's savings have fallen short of that goal, with estimates ranging from $170 billion in savings to $135 billion in costs. Musk defended DOGE's work and expressed confidence that it will achieve the $1 trillion goal "over time". Despite public disagreements with Trump over domestic policy, Musk said he would continue to serve as a "friend and adviser" to the president.</p>

          <p>Florida Rep. Greg Steube has drafted the "Make Autorail Great Again (MAGA) Act," which aims to rename the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) to "WMAGA" in honor of President Donald Trump. The bill would withhold $150 million in federal funding from WMATA until it is renamed and the METRO rail system is rebranded as the "Trump Train." Steube argues that WMATA needs a "fresh identity," particularly with upcoming global events in the region, and cites a 1966 law granting congressional "consent" for WMATA's establishment as justification for the proposed changes.</p>

          <p>Republican Sen. Joni Ernst faced criticism at a town hall in Iowa over concerns that proposed cuts to Medicaid under President Trump's legislative agenda could harm vulnerable individuals. Constituents expressed fears that people would die due to loss of access to healthcare, to which Ernst responded, "Well, we all are going to die." She defended the bill, stating that it aims to protect those eligible for Medicaid while removing ineligible individuals with other benefit options. The House-passed bill includes Medicaid reforms, extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts, and increases spending in areas like border security and defense, adding $3.8 trillion to the national debt.</p>

          <p>England secured a 108-run victory against the West Indies in a Women's ODI match, fueled by centuries from Amy Jones and Tammy Beaumont. The opening stand between Jones and Beaumont was England's fifth-highest partnership in women's ODI history and their highest against the West Indies. England's clear plan was to adjust to the slow bowling attack, preserve wickets, and accelerate in the final overs, setting a strong platform for Sciver-Brunt and Lamb to further increase the score. West Indies' batting line-up heavily relies on their captain, making the total feel far beyond their reach.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated Paul Ingrassia, a 30-year-old conservative lawyer with ties to antisemitic extremists, to lead the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, a government ethics office. If confirmed, Ingrassia would oversee the agency that enforces the Hatch Act and protects whistleblowers. Jewish civil rights leaders have raised concerns about Ingrassia's associations, including his work on the legal team for Andrew Tate, who has promoted antisemitism, and his appearance at a rally for Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes. Some conservative commentators have also criticized Ingrassia's social media posts about Israel.</p>

This partnership could provide a stable source of sales from the U.S. government for Reality Labs, improving operating losses and diversifying Meta's revenue stream. Anduril plans to leverage Meta's investments in consumer-grade hardware and software to build out the final product, with prototypes expected to be delivered to the Army this year.</p>

          <p>Investors tracking gold prices should monitor the market closely in June, as the climate is right for another price spike due to upcoming inflation readings and a Federal Reserve meeting. While the price of gold is down from a recent record high, experts predict it could rise again, potentially reaching $4,000 per ounce. Regardless of short-term fluctuations, gold prices typically rise over time, making it a reliable hedge against inflation and a tangible asset to hold. Investors can explore cost-effective ways to invest, such as fractional gold and dollar-cost averaging, while limiting gold to 10% or less of their overall portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>
