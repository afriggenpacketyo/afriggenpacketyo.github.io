This epic journey spans five continents and 21 countries, aiming to demonstrate that attending the sport is achievable for a wider audience, not just the wealthy. Burgess, who uses only his annual 28 days of leave from his tech job, is strategically managing costs by varying attendance days and staying in budget accommodations like capsule hostels.

          <p>India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and China's Xi Jinping are attempting to reset their strained relationship at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, driven by shared concerns over US tariffs. India faces 50% tariffs on goods to the US due to Russian oil purchases, while China's economy is impacted by high US levies. This meeting marks a potential turning point for the two economic powerhouses, despite long-standing border disputes and other geopolitical fault lines. Both nations seek to leverage their strengths to reduce reliance on the United States and reshape global trade flows.</p>

          <p>Biologists near the California-Oregon border are using innovative methods, including drones that blast AC/DC's "Thunderstruck" and Scarlett Johansson movie clips, to protect cattle from wolves. This experiment aims to create non-lethal deterrents for the recovering gray wolf population, which has led to increased conflicts with ranchers. While the technology is expensive and has limitations in wooded areas, early trials show success in scaring wolves and interrupting hunts. The goal is to foster coexistence by reducing livestock losses and the associated stress on ranchers.</p>

          <p>Germany is experiencing a notable shift in drinking habits, with overall beer sales declining to their lowest in over 30 years, while non-alcoholic beer sales have more than doubled since 2013. Breweries like Erdinger are adapting, with non-alcoholic options now comprising a quarter of their production and being promoted at sporting events. This trend reflects a growing health consciousness among younger Germans, who are consuming alcohol more mindfully. Despite the shift, traditional full-strength beer remains a significant part of German culture, particularly at festivals.</p>

          <p>The BBC is launching a new dating reality show, 'Stranded on Honeymoon Island,' which combines elements of 'Love Island,' 'Married at First Sight,' and 'Survivor.' Couples, matched by experts after a brief speed date, are "married" and then stranded in beach huts on a remote tropical island. Contestants describe the experience as challenging, citing mosquitoes, extreme heat, and lack of amenities, which strip away superficiality. The show aims to test if genuine love can develop under isolated, adverse conditions, appealing to slightly older contestants seeking deeper connections.</p>

          <p>The historic Bayeux Tapestry, depicting the 1066 Norman invasion, will close in France as opposition mounts against its planned move to the British Museum in London next year. French art experts fear the nearly 1,000-year-old, 70-meter-long masterpiece is too fragile for transport, with a petition against the move gathering 60,000 signatures. Despite a French official defending the move, citing a study that found it transportable, concerns persist about irreparable damage from vibrations during the journey. This cultural exchange highlights tensions between diplomatic gestures and heritage preservation.</p>

          <p>UK government scientists are employing an unusual arsenal, including drones, sniffer dogs, and atmospheric dispersion models, to combat the eight-toothed spruce bark beetle, a major threat to British forests. This beetle, which has devastated European spruce trees, is now arriving in the UK via wind, not just imported wood. The innovative methods have successfully eradicated the beetle from at-risk areas in southeast England. However, climate change, causing stressed trees and larger beetle populations in Europe, poses an increasing challenge to ongoing conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>A California state bill, SB 256, aimed at requiring investor-owned utilities like Southern California Edison to remove decommissioned power lines to mitigate wildfire risks, has failed in Sacramento. The bill's author, Senator Sasha Renée Pérez, expressed frustration, citing The Times' reporting that an idle Edison line was a leading hypothesis for the destructive Eaton fire. Despite utilities withdrawing formal opposition, the bill died before a committee vote, raising concerns about "shadow lobbying" and accountability in preventing future catastrophic wildfires, which have devastated communities.</p>

          <p>Florida's temporary "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention center is shutting down, two months after opening, following a judge's order. The facility, located in the Everglades, became a symbol of President Trump's immigration policies and faced conflicting reports on conditions. Families of detainees allege serious medical neglect and lack of legal access, with one inmate reportedly suffering severe hemorrhoids and an infection. Despite government appeals, the Department of Homeland Security is complying, but also plans for more "brick-and-mortar" facilities, indicating a continued focus on detention.</p>
