          <h2>Former President Trump to Visit Federal Reserve Amid Criticism of Chair Powell</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 00:15:58 EDT</div>

          <p>The White House announced that President Donald Trump will visit the Federal Reserve, a move seen as an escalation of his public pressure campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell. This marks the first official presidential trip to the central bank in nearly two decades, challenging the long-standing tradition of respecting its political independence. Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates and has openly contemplated his removal, despite legal questions about his authority to do so. The visit places Trump's criticism directly at the institution's doorstep, creating a remarkable symbolic challenge to its autonomy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tensions between Thailand and Cambodia have escalated into armed conflict, with soldiers from both nations exchanging fire in a disputed border area near the ancient Prasat Ta Muen Thom temple. Both countries accuse the other of initiating the hostilities, which follow a rapid deterioration in diplomatic relations. The clash occurred after Cambodia downgraded diplomatic ties in response to Thailand closing border crossings over a land mine incident that injured five Thai soldiers. This conflict is the latest in a series of confrontations over contested territories, inflaming nationalist sentiments and destabilizing regional relations.</p>

          <h2>States Increasingly Override Local Zoning to Address Affordable Housing Crisis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 00:01:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a nationwide housing affordability crisis, several states are enacting legislation to compel local municipalities to allow for more dense and affordable housing development. In Utah, where the median home price has soared to over $500,000, state laws now require cities to adopt strategies for cheaper housing, though enforcement remains a challenge. This top-down approach aims to combat restrictive local zoning rules, often referred to as NIMBY-ism, which limit construction to single-family homes and drive up prices. While developers and advocates see it as necessary, some local officials criticize the mandates as an overreach that diminishes community control and strains infrastructure.</p>

          <p>China and Russia have restarted their joint oceanographic expeditions for the first time in five years, signaling a renewed commitment to bilateral scientific cooperation. A team of 25 scientists set sail from Vladivostok on a 45-day mission aboard a Russian research vessel to study the effects of climate change in the Bering Sea and the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The research will focus on deep-sea environments and sediment processes to better understand climate evolution over the last 126,000 years. This collaboration underscores the two nations' shared scientific interests and strategic ambitions, particularly concerning the Arctic region.</p>

          <p>The MLS All-Star game proceeded with its usual entertainment, but the absence of its biggest star, Lionel Messi, has intensified discussions about the event's relevance and format. While the game provided a platform for top players from MLS and Mexico's Liga MX to showcase their skills, Messi's decision to skip the festivities highlighted a potential disconnect between the league's traditions and the priorities of global superstars. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the need to re-evaluate the All-Star game, citing fixture congestion and the challenge of making the event compelling for players. Messi's no-show is seen by some as a sign of respect for meaningful competition, prioritizing his team's official matches.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has dealt another blow to former President Donald Trump's effort to end birthright citizenship, ruling his executive order on the matter is unconstitutional. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court's decision, stating that the proposed interpretation of denying citizenship to many individuals born in the United States violates the Constitution. This legal challenge is one of many filed against the order since it was signed. The principle of birthright citizenship is rooted in the 14th Amendment, which was ratified in 1868 to grant citizenship to formerly enslaved people.</p>

          <p>A major new study indicates that walking just 7,000 steps per day can significantly reduce the risk of major health issues like dementia, cancer, and heart disease. Published in The Lancet Public Health, the research suggests this more attainable target could be more effective at motivating people than the widely cited but less evidence-based 10,000-step goal. The 10,000-step benchmark originated from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign, not scientific research. This analysis of data from over 160,000 adults found that for most conditions, health benefits tended to level off after 7,000 steps, providing a practical new guideline for daily activity.</p>

The incident, which sparked international outrage, occurred after a newborn baby was found abandoned in an airport bathroom, leading authorities to remove women from a flight for examination.

Internal documents show extensive cuts to monitoring programs, with seven national testing initiatives completely paused.

These pelagic snails, known for their vibrant purple shells and bubble rafts for flotation, usually inhabit warmer tropical waters. Their appearance in Southern California, the first confirmed sighting by Scripps in a decade, coincides with unusually warm offshore water temperatures. While a direct link to climate change is not confirmed, scientists suggest that continued warm water trends could lead to more frequent sightings of such species outside their normal habitats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research published in the British Medical Journal suggests that many commercially available at-home health test kits provide inaccurate or misleading results and lack proper regulation. A study from the University of Birmingham analyzed 30 self-test kits for conditions like bowel cancer and vitamin deficiencies, finding that few provided clear accuracy statements or guidance on next steps. Researchers warn that without better oversight, these kits could lead to false reassurance or create unnecessary burdens on the NHS. In response, the UK's medical device regulator has stated it is overhauling safety standards for these increasingly popular products.</p>

          <p>USC's highly touted freshman basketball player, Alijah Arenas, has suffered a serious knee injury that will require surgery and sideline him for at least six to eight months. The injury, which includes a meniscus tear and a bone bruise, is a major setback for both the player and the Trojans' upcoming season. Arenas, a five-star recruit who graduated high school a year early to join USC, was expected to play a significant role for the team. Given his status as a top NBA draft prospect, the lengthy recovery time raises questions about his future and whether he will play for USC at all.</p>

          <p>A coalition of Los Angeles business leaders has filed a ballot initiative to completely repeal the city's gross receipts tax, a move they argue is necessary to combat an "anti-job climate." The tax, which is levied on a company's revenue rather than its profit, generates over $800 million annually for the city's general fund. Proponents claim its elimination would stimulate the economy, but city officials warn it would create a massive budget hole and force drastic cuts to essential services like police and fire departments. This proposal escalates an ongoing battle between business and labor groups over the city's economic policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea has successfully avoided a technical recession, with its economy growing by 0.6% in the second quarter, surpassing economists' expectations. The growth was primarily driven by a strong 4.2% increase in exports, particularly in semiconductors and petroleum products, as firms reportedly expedited shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. While the export surge provided a boost, analysts express caution about the sustainability of this growth, as domestic consumption remains modest and global trade faces uncertainty. The data comes as South Korea continues to negotiate a trade deal with the U.S. to avoid significant tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed three executive orders aimed at accelerating U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence, including one specifically targeting what he termed "woke Marxist lunacy" in AI models. The order requires federal funding recipients to maintain politically neutral AI, free from "ideological dogmas such as DEI." Other orders are designed to streamline permitting for data center construction and promote the export of American AI technology. The moves are part of a broader White House AI action plan that emphasizes deregulation to win the global AI race, particularly against China, while echoing conservative grievances about perceived liberal bias in technology.</p>

While the agreements are not explicitly aimed at Beijing, they reflect a U.S. incentive to contain China's dominance in the region. However, some experts note that Chinese firms are already ahead, having increasingly localized their production within Southeast Asia.</p>
