            <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the United States holds a significant advantage over China in the escalating trade war, asserting that China's escalation was a "big mistake." He highlighted the disparity in export volumes between the two nations, suggesting that China has more to lose from raising tariffs. Bessent also mentioned that Japan is eager to negotiate trade deals, and he anticipates other countries with large trade deficits to follow suit. The administration hopes to generate jobs and revenue through tariffs, aiming to reshore manufacturing operations to the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>China has strongly criticized US Vice-President J.D. Vance for referring to the Chinese as “peasants” during the escalating trade war, labeling his remarks as “ignorant and disrespectful.” This criticism comes after President Trump imposed additional tariffs on Chinese imports. Vance defended the levies by stating that the US borrows money from Chinese peasants to buy goods they manufacture, which he argues is not a recipe for economic prosperity. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman responded by saying it was surprising and pathetic to hear such ignorant and disrespectful words from the vice president.</p>

            <p>Walmart's membership program, Walmart+, is proving to be a significant driver of store traffic and online sales amidst tariffs and recession fears. Walmart reports that nearly 50% of spending across its website and app comes from Walmart+ members, who shop twice as much and spend nearly three times as much as non-subscribers. Chief Growth Officer Seth Dallaire describes the program as a "frequency driver," with rising spending per subscriber and strong growth through Walmart+ Assist, a program offering discounted memberships to those on government assistance. The growth of Walmart+ allows the company to keep grocery prices low and invest in other areas to maintain competitiveness. (not investment advice)</p>

Andrei Quinn-Barabanov from Moody's notes that companies will wait to see the tariff responses from other countries before making any decisions about relocating supply chains. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent believes that tariffs will bring jobs back to the US and generate revenue, but Andre C.

            <p>Vietnam's efforts to appease Donald Trump appear to have failed, as the US has imposed a significant 46% tariff that threatens its economic growth. This move has damaged the US's reputation as a reliable partner in Southeast Asia, potentially pushing countries like Vietnam closer to China. Xi Jinping is expected to capitalize on the situation by portraying China as a steadfast partner. While Southeast Asian nations are wary of relying too heavily on China, Trump's tariffs may undermine their goodwill towards the US and its policies in the region.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to resume deportations of migrants claimed to be members of a Venezuelan gang, but clarified that those subject to removal have the right to judicial review. The court split 5-4, granting the Justice Department's request for emergency relief. Justice Sotomayor issued a dissent, accusing the administration of disregarding the rule of law. The ruling confirms that detainees are entitled to notice and a chance to challenge their deportation, though the venue for that challenge is now in the district of confinement.</p>

It occurs when the immune system is constantly activated, disrupting normal bodily functions.

Strategies to reduce inflammation involve adopting an anti-inflammatory diet, limiting refined carbohydrates and alcohol, exercising, getting sufficient sleep, spending time in nature, de-stressing, taking Vitamin D, and reducing exposure to polluting chemicals.</p>
