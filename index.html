          <p>Nottingham Forest is reportedly in advanced discussions to appoint Sean Dyche as their new head coach, following the recent sacking of Ange Postecoglou just 17 minutes after a 3-0 defeat by Chelsea. The Premier League club, currently 18th in the table with only one win in eight games, is eager to finalize a deal with Dyche, who has emerged as the leading candidate. Other potential managers, including Roberto Mancini and Marco Silva, have been considered, but complexities like Silva's large release clause make Dyche the standalone choice. This move aims to bring stability to a season marked by significant upheaval and poor performance.</p>

          <p>Virginia Giuffre's posthumous memoir, "Nobody's Girl," reveals her profound fear of dying as a "sexual assault slave" within Jeffrey Epstein's circle. The book, published months after her death, details alleged sexual encounters with Prince Andrew on three occasions, including one with Epstein and other young women. Prince Andrew, who settled a civil case with Giuffre in 2022, consistently denies the accusations. The memoir paints a harrowing picture of abuse by powerful individuals, adding further scrutiny to Prince Andrew as Buckingham Palace anticipates more negative attention.</p>

          <p>Harper Lee's family describes her newly found stories, collected in "The Land of Sweet Forever," as revealing a "brilliant writer in the making." These short stories, written before "To Kill A Mockingbird," offer insights into her evolving craft and include early versions of characters and settings familiar to fans. While some elements, particularly regarding race relations, are uncomfortable through a modern lens, her family emphasizes their significance in understanding her development and the continuing relevance of her work. The discovery provides a unique glimpse into the formative years of an American literary icon.</p>

          <p>British number three Katie Boulter's challenging run of form persisted with a straight-sets loss to world number 44 Eva Lys in the first round of the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo. The 29-year-old Briton was defeated 6-2 6-1 in just 74 minutes, marking another early tournament exit. Boulter has not progressed beyond the second round of any event since the Nottingham Open in June, highlighting a disappointing season. This defeat follows a similar straight-sets loss in the Japan Open, underscoring her current struggles on the court.</p>

          <p>Apple's new iPhone 17 has significantly outperformed its predecessor, with sales up 14% in the US and China, its two largest markets. Analysts attribute this robust demand to substantial improvements in the standard iPhone 17 model, including an enhanced display, increased storage capacity, and the upgraded A19 chip. In China, sales of the base iPhone 17 have nearly doubled compared to the iPhone 16 during its initial availability period, with strong momentum continuing into October. The iPhone 17 Pro Max is also experiencing high demand, particularly within the US market.</p>

          <p>The Rugby League Ashes series returns after a 22-year hiatus, with England preparing to face Australia at Wembley, evoking memories of Great Britain's memorable 1994 victory. Dual-code legend Jonathan Davies, whose iconic 50-meter try secured that win, expressed a desire for a new generation to create their own Wembley moments. The article draws parallels between the 1994 and 2025 series, including Australia's status as World Cup holders and coaching changes. This highly anticipated series aims to rebuild respect for the international game and offers England a chance to break Australia's long-standing Ashes dominance.</p>

This growth, driven largely by robust domestic consumption and successful EU integration, has seen its real GDP double since joining in 2004. Despite political divisions and fiscal challenges, Poland's dynamic economy and well-educated workforce position it as a potential future economic powerhouse in Europe. (not investment advice)</p>

Directors and industry leaders express concerns about the practicality of such tariffs and the broader message of protectionism.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets opened higher on Monday, with China's stocks rising despite the release of weaker-than-expected GDP data. China's economy grew 4.8% in the third quarter, in line with Reuters' analyst forecasts, and its benchmark lending rates remained unchanged. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained over 2%, while mainland's CSI 300 rose 0.74%. Japan's Nikkei 225 surged almost 3% to a new high following news of a coalition government agreement. This market resilience suggests investors are looking past immediate economic concerns, potentially anticipating future policy support or finding value in current conditions.

          <h2>UK Military Granted New Powers to Shoot Down Drones Near Bases</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British soldiers are set to receive new powers allowing them to shoot down drones that pose a threat to military bases. Defence Secretary John Healey will unveil these plans, aiming for faster, more decisive action against drone incursions. This development follows multiple mystery drone sightings at British airbases used by US forces last year, and widespread drone disruptions across Europe. While initially limited to military sites, the "kinetic option" could be extended to civilian locations like airports. Existing protocols primarily focus on diverting or disrupting drones, making this a significant escalation in defensive capabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China imported no soybeans from the US in September, marking the first time in seven years that shipments fell to zero, amidst an ongoing trade dispute. High tariffs imposed by China and the trading of old-crop US beans contributed to this decline, with South American shipments surging instead. Brazil and Argentina accounted for the vast majority of China's record-high September soybean imports. This situation puts US farmers at risk of significant losses and could lead to a supply crunch in China early next year if trade talks do not yield a breakthrough. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shrapnel from an artillery round, fired during a US Marine Corps celebration attended by Vice President JD Vance, prematurely detonated and struck at least two vehicles on a California highway. The incident occurred during a live munitions demonstration over Interstate 5 near Camp Pendleton, prompting the California Highway Patrol to close a 17-mile stretch of the busy freeway. Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the event as dangerous, accusing Trump and Vance of putting lives at risk for "vanity projects." No injuries were reported, but an investigation has been initiated into the mishap and the decision to fire live rounds over an active freeway.</p>

          <p>Bereaved families are calling for a public inquiry into the UK government's alleged "repeated failures" to protect vulnerable individuals from a website promoting suicide. A report by the Molly Rose Foundation claims authorities were warned 65 times about the online forum and similar sites, which have been linked to at least 133 deaths from a toxic chemical. Campaigners argue that coroners' warnings have been ignored and that the government's response has been fragmented. They seek accountability and systemic changes to prevent further tragedies, especially given new powers granted to Ofcom under the Online Safety Act.</p>
