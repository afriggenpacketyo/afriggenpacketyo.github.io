          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released an analysis projecting that the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a tax and immigration bill supporting President Trump's agenda, could increase the deficit by $2.4 trillion over the next decade. The CBO also estimates that 10.9 million more people will be uninsured by 2034 due to changes in healthcare provisions within the bill. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise criticized the CBO report, arguing that it does not account for potential economic growth, while President Trump is scheduled to meet with the Senate Finance Committee to push for the bill's passage, despite some GOP senators expressing concerns. The legislation narrowly passed the House in May, but faces challenges in the Senate. (not investment advice)</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that trade talks are stalled, suggesting the leaders need to intervene, although it's uncertain if a call has been arranged. Trump criticized Xi's toughness in negotiations on Truth Social, while China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi cited the Trump administration's "negative measures" as undermining China's interests. Washington and Beijing are blaming each other for violating a trade agreement reached in Switzerland on May 12, and this has led to a stalemate in trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry began confirmation hearings for Michael Boren, President Trump's nominee to lead the U.S. Forest Service. Boren, an investment consultant and Idaho ranch owner, has a history of conflicts with the Forest Service, including disputes over land use and mining claims within the Sawtooth National Forest. Senator James Risch addressed these disputes, noting that conflicts between private landowners and the federal government are common in the West, and Boren himself accused the Forest Service of being "aggressive" at times. Boren emphasized his commitment to forest management and increasing timber production on federal lands, aligning with Trump's agenda, and stated that he feels uniquely positioned to support the Forest Service.</p>

          <p>Environmentalists protested an energy conference in Anchorage, Alaska, led by Republican Governor Mike Dunleavy and featuring top Trump administration officials, including Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

The officials defended their policies, with Zeldin commenting on the seemingly happy wildlife he observed and Burgum asserting that wildlife and development can coexist, while Wright dismissed clean and renewable energy as inaccurate marketing terms. Representatives from Asian countries were also present, as the administration seeks to advance a massive liquefied natural gas project in Alaska.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have discovered a massive gas giant planet, TOI-6894b, orbiting a small red dwarf star, TOI-6894, a pairing that challenges existing planet formation theories. The planet, slightly larger than Saturn but half its mass, orbits its star in just over three days. The discovery was made while searching through data from NASA's TESS space telescope and confirmed by ground-based telescopes, and the researchers are intrigued by the planet's unusually cold temperature compared to other gas giants. The James Webb Space Telescope is scheduled to observe the planet, which scientists hope will help them understand how such a massive planet could form around such a small star.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is urging continued surveillance of norovirus outbreaks due to the emergence of a new strain, GII.17, which caused an unusually early start to the norovirus season last year. The GII.17 strain has displaced the previously dominant GII.4 strain, raising concerns about whether norovirus season could start early again. Several other countries also experienced shifted or larger waves of norovirus after GII.17 surged to dominance, and the CDC is monitoring outbreaks through its CaliciNet laboratory database. The agency cautions that there is insufficient data to predict whether GII.17 will remain dominant and cause an earlier onset of the norovirus season this year.</p>

          <p>Eighteen years after the disappearance of three-year-old Madeleine McCann from Praia Da Luz, Portugal, detectives are searching again for clues, this time focusing on scrubland and abandoned buildings near the resort. The initial investigation was criticized for being unstructured, with the apartment not properly sealed off and tensions arising between Portuguese and British police. In 2020, German prosecutors identified Christian BrÃ¼ckner as a suspect for Madeleine's murder, but he has denied any involvement. The renewed search feels like it is happening too late, with potentially crucial data about who was in the town that night seemingly overlooked in the initial investigation.</p>

However, maintaining balance between Beijing and Washington remains challenging due to South Korea's position within the China-South Korea-Japan dynamic and the South Korea-Japan-US alliance.

          <p>An individual was arrested at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City in connection with the bombing outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, last month. The person may have provided material support for the bombing, but it is unclear if they knew about the bombing, and the bomber, identified as 25-year-old Guy Bartkus, died in the blast. The explosion, which injured four others, was caused by a device more powerful than low-grade explosives, and investigators say Bartkus had access to chemicals that could be used to create a homemade explosive device. The FBI is continuing to investigate the incident.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50% has sparked a discussion about the impact of tariffs on consumers and companies, and tariffs can protect domestic businesses but also lead to higher prices for consumers. The article uses charts to illustrate how tariffs affect consumer and producer surplus, highlighting the trade-offs between protecting domestic industries and promoting free trade. While tariffs can be a tool to achieve specific objectives, their broad-based implementation can create uncertainty and hinder business planning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that leprosy existed in the Americas for at least one thousand years before European colonization, caused by the bacteria species Mycobacterium lepromatosis. Researchers analyzed ancient remains from Canada and Argentina, finding that the bacterial genomes were of distinctive branches of the lepromatosis species. The findings challenge the previous belief that Europeans brought leprosy to the Americas via Mycobacterium leprae, and the discovery highlights the complex relationship between pathogens and humans throughout history. The study also helps in understanding modern cases of leprosy and how it could jump from animals to humans.</p>

          <p>The trend of men shaving off their eyelashes is explored as a sign of evolving male beauty standards influenced by the manosphere and incel-adjacent spaces. This practice is linked to an emphasis on hypermasculinity and a rejection of anything considered feminine, and the article contrasts this with the feminist movement's efforts to empower women to create relationships with their bodies independent of male approval. The pursuit of extreme beauty standards, whether by men or women, can lead to body dysmorphia, and the act of shaving eyelashes is seen as a self-sabotaging act driven by contempt toward women.</p>
