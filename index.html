          <p>Tensions escalated in Ventura County when U.S. Border Patrol agents conducting a raid on a marijuana facility clashed with protesters. Agents deployed tear gas and less-than-lethal rounds, resulting in several injuries, while protesters later pelted federal vehicles with rocks. California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom's office, condemned the raid, describing the tactics as inhumane and fear-inducing. The incident highlights the ongoing friction between federal immigration enforcement and local communities in the state.</p>

          <p>A 33-year-old former teacher in South Carolina, Nicole Ballew Callaham, has been charged with multiple counts of criminal sexual conduct with a minor. Authorities allege the misconduct began in 2021 and involved a prolonged pattern of abuse and grooming behavior with a male student in his early teens. The victim came forward after turning 18, and Callaham, who has since resigned from her teaching position, faces similar charges in an adjacent jurisdiction where the abuse also allegedly occurred.</p>

However, interest remains high among travelers from Vietnam and the Philippines, possibly due to large diaspora communities and cultural influence.

          <p>In a commentary piece, Australian minister Ed Husic reflects on the 30th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide, sharing the story of a survivor who now lives in Australia. The author argues that the world repeatedly witnesses mass suffering, declares "never again," and then fails to prevent the next tragedy, citing Rwanda and Srebrenica as past examples. The article questions how much longer it will be before the international community takes decisive action to stop the suffering in Gaza and break this painful cycle.</p>

          <p>Tesla has submitted an application to test and deploy its Robotaxi service in the Phoenix metropolitan area, a key market currently dominated by its rival, Waymo. This expansion follows the recent launch of a pilot program in Austin, Texas, where Tesla's vehicles operate with a human safety supervisor on board. The move signals Tesla's push to catch up in the autonomous vehicle space, though its initial Austin deployment has faced some documented issues and regulatory scrutiny.</p>

This trend is driven by a generational shift towards planned parenthood and more couples and single women turning to IVF and egg-freezing. Despite a slight increase in the birth rate in 2024, significant social and financial pressures, including high costs and demanding work cultures, remain major barriers for many who wish to start families.</p>
