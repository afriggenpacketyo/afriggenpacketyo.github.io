          <p>Tyler Robinson, 22, has been identified as the suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah university event. His capture was facilitated after his own father recognized him from distributed photographs and encouraged him to surrender through a youth pastor. Authorities revealed that evidence, including surveillance footage and a rifle with engraved bullet casings, points to a planned attack. The investigation, which culminated in an arrest after a 33-hour manhunt, also indicated the suspect had become more politically motivated in recent years.</p>

Following a pre-game meeting with Trump, the Yankees secured a 9-3 victory, with Judge hitting two home runs. Judge humorously suggested that the team should have Trump around more often given their strong offensive performance. Trump, who was in attendance on the anniversary of the September 11th attacks, later praised Judge's athletic ability during a television appearance.</p>

          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff publicly acknowledged being inspired by data analytics firm Palantir, particularly its high market valuation, while also remarking on its expensive software prices. During a technology conference, Benioff noted that Palantir's prices are the "most expensive enterprise software" he's ever seen, humorously questioning if he should raise his own company's prices. This commentary continues a public rivalry between the two tech leaders, whose companies occasionally compete for significant government and enterprise contracts, adding another layer to their competitive dynamic.</p>

The agent who was struck then discharged his firearm, fatally wounding the suspect. The injured agent was hospitalized with severe injuries and is reported to be in stable condition following the incident.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has placed agent Anthony Pough on administrative leave and revoked his security clearance following a negative Facebook post he made about the recently slain conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. In his post, Pough suggested Kirk's rhetoric invited bad karma. Secret Service Director Sean Curran issued a memo to staff emphasizing the need for impartiality and warning that agents must be part of the solution to rising political violence, not contributors to the problem. The agency has launched an investigation into the matter, stating it will not tolerate behavior that violates its code of conduct.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Citing a slowdown in consumer demand for electric vehicles in North America, Stellantis has announced that its Ram brand will no longer develop a full-size all-electric Ram 1500 pickup truck. The project had already faced multiple delays from its original 2024 launch target. Instead, the company will focus on releasing an extended-range electric truck, which includes a gas engine to generate electricity, now named the Ram 1500 REV. This strategic shift is part of a broader reassessment of product strategy under new Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, who is focused on re-establishing profitable growth.</p>

          <p>A significant water supply failure at the U.S. naval base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, has forced the relocation of migrants housed at the Migrant Operations Center. The disruption, caused by structural damage to an underwater pipeline, has raised further doubts about the base's capacity to handle large numbers of migrants. Critics argue the incident highlights that Guantánamo's infrastructure is inadequate for such purposes and that holding migrants there is a costly theatrical measure rather than an efficient or safe solution. Water is not expected to be fully restored for at least another week, with all migrants now being held in a former terrorist detention facility.</p>

Patel pleaded guilty to federal charges and was sentenced to prison.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a $125 million lawsuit against Uber, alleging the ride-sharing company systematically discriminates against passengers with disabilities. The lawsuit claims Uber violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by refusing service to individuals with service animals or mobility devices like wheelchairs. It also accuses the company of improperly charging fees for service animal shedding or for cancellations when service is unlawfully denied. Uber has stated that it disagrees with the allegations and maintains a zero-tolerance policy for confirmed service denials, emphasizing its commitment to accessibility.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has announced that the EU will fast-track its review of the planned 2035 ban on new internal combustion engine cars. The decision comes in response to significant pressure from European automakers, who cite challenges such as high costs, dependency on Asia for batteries, and intense competition from Chinese electric vehicles. Carmakers are advocating for a relaxation of the regulations to allow for other low-emission technologies, like hybrids, beyond 2035. Environmental groups, however, are urging the EU to remain firm on the original deadline to drive innovation.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, market watchers are focused on the record $7.6 trillion held in money market funds. Some economists believe that as yields on these cash-equivalent accounts fall, a significant portion of this money will flow into riskier assets like stocks and bonds, potentially fueling a market rally. However, other experts are skeptical, arguing that the vast majority of these funds belong to institutional and corporate investors who are unlikely to shift their strategy. They contend that only a return to near-zero interest rates would cause a substantial outflow from these funds. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts suggest that timing is critical, as lenders often adjust rates in advance of formal Federal Reserve actions, meaning the best window to act may be brief. It is also crucial for buyers to have a high credit score to qualify for the most favorable rates. Finally, the article emphasizes the importance of getting pre-approved to make serious offers and advises against waiting for even lower rates if the right home is already available.
