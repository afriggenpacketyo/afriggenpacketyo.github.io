          <p>At least 26 people were killed and 17 others wounded in Kashmir after gunmen opened fire on tourists in Pahalgam, marking the worst civilian attack in years. The attack, which has not been claimed by any group, occurred as U.S. Vice President JD Vance was visiting India. Indian authorities are searching for the attackers, and many fear the incident will negatively affect the tourism industry.

          <p>The UK government borrowed more than anticipated in the past year, reaching £151.9bn due to increased spending on pay and benefits. This figure exceeds the official forecast of £137.3bn. The figures come as Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to attend the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank to meet fellow finance ministers and push for a US trade deal. The government's borrowing rules are "non-negotiable" and they are going through every penny of taxpayer money spent, line by line, for the first time in 17 years to tear out waste.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ceasefire talks between Ukraine and Russia in London have been downgraded, with key US officials no longer attending. This comes amid speculation that Russia might be willing to halt its invasion along current front lines in return for US recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea, which Ukrainian President Zelensky has rejected. Meanwhile, Putin unilaterally called a temporary ceasefire for the Easter weekend but UK Defence Secretary John Healey told the House of Commons on Tuesday that British military intelligence had found no evidence of a let-up in attacks. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people have been killed or injured on all sides since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022, and nearly seven million Ukrainians are currently listed as refugees worldwide.</p>

Gavin Newsom is clearly running for president in 2028, and he makes news by appearing on Fox and right-wing podcasts. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) is gaining attention as a potential presidential candidate, drawing large crowds and raising significant funds. Despite her uber-liberal record, some see her as an exciting figure with charisma and the ability to mobilize voters, while others question her viability in swing states.</p>

          <p>Singapore's inflation remained at a four-year low in March, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 0.9% year-on-year. The Monetary Authority of Singapore attributed the increase to higher costs of food and private transport. This reading comes as Singapore prepares for a general election on May 3. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong acknowledged that cost-of-living pressures are a "real concern" for Singapore, citing global disruptions and trade wars.</p>

The attack, which occurred in Pahalgam, is the region's worst assault on civilians in years. A little-known militant group called The Resistance Front claimed responsibility, citing discontent at "outsiders" settling in the region. The attack has drawn condemnation from international leaders, and India has accused Pakistan of fueling terrorism in the region, a claim Pakistan denies.</p>

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and tech-focused Nasdaq Composite both ended Tuesday trading 2.7% up, erasing losses of the previous day.
