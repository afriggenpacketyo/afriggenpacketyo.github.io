          <p>David Allen, a British heavyweight boxer, was defeated by Arslanbek Makhmudov in a unanimous points decision at Sheffield Arena. Allen, making his first headline appearance at the venue, was supported by a large crowd, but Makhmudov's power proved decisive. Allen showed resilience, landing some significant blows in later rounds, but ultimately fell short. Despite the loss, Allen expressed gratitude for the support and affirmed his intention to continue boxing, having previously retired and returned to the sport. The optimism score is based on Allen's resolve to continue despite the setback, coupled with the absence of severe injuries. </p>

Beutner's social media accounts briefly featured campaign imagery, but it was quickly removed. If Beutner enters the race, he would be the most significant challenger to Bass. The article also highlights challenges faced by Mayor Bass, including a budget shortfall and criticism over her handling of emergencies. The optimism score reflects the potential for positive change in Los Angeles leadership, balanced by the city's ongoing challenges. </p>

          <p>A federal appeals court temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard troops in the Chicago area, amidst protests at Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. The court upheld a ruling denying the White House's request to deploy troops, but allowed the troops to remain under federal control. This legal standoff mirrors a similar situation in Portland, Oregon. The optimism score is based on the court's decision to limit federal intervention in local affairs, which is seen as a victory for state and local law enforcement. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration mistakenly issued reduction-in-force notices to employees in key CDC offices due to a coding error during the government shutdown. Workers involved in responding to Ebola and measles outbreaks were among those affected. The MMWR report, a respected CDC science journal, was also impacted. A federal health official stated that those mistakenly laid off would receive a formal notice rescinding their elimination, but hundreds of HHS employees will still lose their jobs. The optimism score is based on the correction of the coding errors, but is tempered by the fact that overall, the shutdown still has negative impacts. </p>
