          <p>Rep. Don Bacon, a centrist Republican in a key Nebraska swing district, has confirmed he will not seek re-election, setting up a major battle for his seat. Bacon, who has been a notable critic of former President Donald Trump, represents a district that voted for Democratic presidential candidates in both 2020 and 2024. His departure is seen by Democrats as a prime opportunity to flip a House seat as they aim to reclaim a majority. The announcement has immediately made Nebraska's second congressional district a top target for both parties ahead of the 2026 midterms.</p>

          <p>A coalition of more than 70 authors, including prominent names like Dennis Lehane and Lauren Groff, has publicly petitioned major publishing houses to commit to not releasing books created by AI. Their open letter expresses deep concern that machine-generated content devalues art and could replace human writers, editors, and narrators. The authors are requesting specific safeguards, such as ensuring AI tools are not trained on copyrighted material without consent and compensation.

          <p>The U.S. Senate voted against advancing a War Powers Resolution that aimed to restrict President Trump's ability to take further military action against Iran without congressional approval. The measure, proposed by Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, failed in a 53-47 vote, with most Republicans and one Democrat opposing it. This vote occurred after recent U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and amid a fragile ceasefire. The outcome underscores the deep partisan divisions on matters of foreign policy and presidential war-making authority.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the state of the Democratic party one year after a widely criticized debate performance by Joe Biden against Donald Trump, which is framed as a turning point. The event shattered any remaining illusions about Biden's condition and preceded a series of setbacks, including Trump's subsequent election victory. The party is now depicted as rudderless, struggling with internal divisions between progressives and moderates, and lacking a clear national leader. The analysis suggests Democrats must look toward the 2028 election to find a new direction.</p>

          <p>Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip have killed at least 60 people, according to Hamas-run health officials, with one attack hitting a stadium sheltering displaced people. The ongoing violence continues as President Trump stated that a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be reached within the next week. Despite the president's optimism, talks have been stalled for months, and a recent proposal was rejected by Hamas. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza remains dire, with residents facing catastrophic hunger and continued danger.</p>

          <p>The victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary has elicited varied reactions from conservatives. While some, like Donald Trump, have labeled him an extremist, others at a recent conservative conference expressed a grudging respect for his effective grassroots campaign against establishment candidate Andrew Cuomo. Many conservatives view his rise as a localized New York phenomenon that is out of step with the rest of the country. The event highlights the ongoing national debate about the direction of the Democratic party.</p>

          <p>According to a Chinese Middle East expert, Beijing is expected to maintain a cautious stance despite potential requests for military support from Iran following its recent conflict with the U.S. and Israel. While Iran's defense minister sought a larger Chinese role in de-escalation, China is unlikely to provide significant weapons aid. This is due to its strategic interest in balancing relationships with all regional powers, including Israel and other Western-aligned states. The analysis suggests that neither Beijing nor Washington has enough influence to completely halt the strategic ambitions of Iran or Israel.</p>

          <p>A real estate agent with a decade of experience advises prospective homebuyers to use the "80-10-10 Rule" to determine if a property is the right fit. This guideline suggests that the ideal house should have 80% of the features you love and cannot change, like location or architectural style. Another 10% should consist of elements you can improve over time, such as paint or countertops, while the final 10% are imperfections you can live with. This framework helps buyers move beyond an unrealistic search for the "perfect" house. (not investment advice)</p>

Following recent U.S. airstrikes on Iran, commentators noted that Gabbard appears to be aligning intelligence assessments with President Trump's political preferences. This trend is viewed as dangerous by intelligence professionals, who strive to avoid such influence, and runs contrary to Gabbard's stated goal of rooting out politicization.
