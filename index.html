          <p>A new survey from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression reveals a majority of U.S. university students now oppose allowing controversial speakers on campus, regardless of their political leaning. The report highlights a growing intolerance for opposing viewpoints and an increased acceptance of disruptive tactics, including violence, to silence speech. This trend is seen across the political spectrum, with the Israel-Palestine conflict, abortion, and transgender rights identified as the most difficult topics for open discussion.</p>

          <p>In excerpts from her upcoming book, former Vice President Kamala Harris describes the decision to let then-President Joe Biden run for reelection as "recklessness" that should not have been left to an "individual's ego." Harris reveals she felt his inner circle undermined her and fueled negative narratives about her performance, believing her success would dim his. While defending his capability, she acknowledges his age was a factor and that she was in the worst position to advise him against running.</p>

          <p>Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison has surpassed Elon Musk as the world's wealthiest individual, with his net worth reaching an estimated $393 billion. The shift was driven by a massive 40% surge in Oracle's stock price following a highly optimistic forecast for its cloud infrastructure and AI-related business. The company has seen soaring demand for its data centers from AI firms, contrasting with a recent decline in the stock value of Musk's company, Tesla.</p>

Trump is scheduled to speak with Poland's president, having previously pledged to support the country's defense. The incident drew a sharp rebuke from Poland's Foreign Minister, who criticized Trump's peace efforts with Russia, while the U.S. Ambassador to NATO reaffirmed the commitment to defend all allied territory.</p>

This financial literacy initiative comes as outstanding student debt approaches $1.7 trillion and default rates remain at record highs. While the goal is to help borrowers make more informed decisions, experts question the department's capacity to launch the effort following significant staff layoffs and a massive backlog of applications for income-driven repayment plans.

Tuchel has also focused on selecting players who fit his system, such as those with a natural tendency for off-the-ball runs, and leveraging club-level partnerships to build chemistry quickly.</p>

          <p>Uber is partnering with Joby Aviation to allow customers to book helicopter rides directly through its app, with the service potentially launching next year. The move follows Joby's acquisition of Blade Air Mobility, which already operates helicopter and seaplane flights in locations like New York City. The integration aims to offer aerial transportation in major cities worldwide, with airport connections identified as a high-value option for consumers seeking to bypass ground traffic.</p>

          <p>Hope, an 11-year-old polar bear at Jimmy's Farm and Wildlife Park in Suffolk, has died after failing to recover from a necessary dental operation. The wildlife park, which houses Europe's largest polar bear enclosure, stated that the procedure was conducted by a large, experienced veterinary team but was ultimately unsuccessful. Hope was one of several bears relocated to the park from a closed zoo in Sweden, and her death was described as a profound loss for the conservation community.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that meat from endangered shark species, such as the great hammerhead, is being sold in U.S. grocery stores and online under ambiguous or incorrect labels. Researchers used DNA barcoding on 29 shark products and found that 93% were vaguely labeled as just "shark," with nearly a third of samples coming from endangered species. The authors warn this practice not only threatens vulnerable populations but also poses health risks to consumers, as some species contain high levels of mercury.</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has overturned the 1964 conviction of Choi Mal-ja, who was found guilty of grievous bodily harm for biting off part of her sexual attacker's tongue while defending herself. Now 79, Choi was inspired by the #MeToo movement to seek a retrial, where the court ruled her actions constituted justifiable self-defense. The landmark decision reverses a decades-old ruling that had punished a victim of sexual violence while giving her attacker a suspended sentence.</p>

          <p>The producer price index (PPI), a measure of inflation at the wholesale level, unexpectedly fell by 0.1% in August, contrary to economists' expectations of an increase. This marks the third time this year the gauge has shown deflation, feeding market speculation that the Federal Reserve will implement a rate cut at its upcoming meeting. The report indicated falling prices in the services sector and only a marginal increase in goods prices, providing positive news on inflation fundamentals. (not investment advice)</p>

While researchers caution that non-biological processes could also be responsible, they describe the finding as the most compelling candidate yet in the search for past life on Mars.</p>
