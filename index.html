          <p>Following a deadly Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv, President Trump issued a rare public rebuke to Vladimir Putin, urging him to stop the strikes. Despite the attack, Trump insisted that peace talks between Ukraine and Russia are making progress, emphasizing his desire to save lives and stating he has no allegiance to either side. The administration is pushing for a swift end to the conflict, though negotiations face resistance from both countries regarding territorial concessions. Trump's special envoy is scheduled to meet with Putin, and the administration is considering potential penalties against Russia depending on the progress of negotiations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the U.S. government to expedite permits for seabed mining in both international and U.S. territorial waters. This move circumvents a decades-old treaty ratified by nearly all major coastal nations except the United States, which considers international waters off-limits to such industrial activity.

This incident brought back memories of the previous year when Schoen's son influenced the team's decision to draft quarterback Jayden Daniels. The Giants have addressed their quarterback situation by signing veterans Jameis Winston and Russell Wilson during the offseason, giving them flexibility in the draft. Penn State edge rusher Abdul Carter has also been linked to the Giants in the first round.</p>

          <p>This NPR segment examines the effectiveness of protests against the Trump administration, drawing parallels to the American Civil Rights movement and the March on Washington in 1963. The Civil Rights Act and the National Voting Rights Act of 1965 were signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson just months after the March. The piece questions whether current protests can achieve similar political goals, considering the complexities and challenges of influencing policy through demonstrations in the modern era.</p>

          <p>Warnings of empty store shelves are surfacing as CEOs of major retailers alert President Trump that a prolonged trade war could result in shortages.

Hegseth has denied sharing classified war plans over Signal, but questions remain about his communication practices and sharing information with personal advisors, including his wife, who is not a government employee.

Despite reporting better-than-expected first-quarter results, Intel's revenue and profit guidance fell below expectations due to uncertainty caused by tariffs. The company anticipates the total market for its chips could shrink if consumers reduce spending, and while Intel can mitigate some tariff impact, it expects costs to increase.

          <p>Police fatally shot a 30-year-old man at Toronto's Pearson International Airport after responding to a "dispute" near Terminal 1 departures.

The incident led to temporary road closures around the terminal, but flights continued to operate normally. Authorities confirmed there was no known threat to the public, and the Ontario police's Special Investigations Unit is investigating the shooting.</p>
