          <p>In Polson, Montana, individuals accused of crimes who require mental health care are often confined in small jail cells due to a lack of adequate mental health services. These individuals, some held for months, face isolation and deteriorating mental states while awaiting an opening at the Montana State Hospital. The situation in Lake County reflects a nationwide problem of insufficient mental health crisis care, with nearly half of local jail inmates in the U.S. having a mental illness. Montana officials acknowledge the issue and have allocated funds for jail-based mental health stabilization services, but advocates emphasize the urgent need for more inpatient beds and community-based services. </p>

          <p>Brood XIV, a massive group of periodical cicadas, is emerging across the eastern United States, particularly in Kentucky and Tennessee, with smaller appearances along the East Coast. These cicadas, known for their loud buzzing and synchronized behavior, spend 17 years underground as larvae before emerging in unison to mate. The timing of their emergence is linked to soil temperature, with cicadas surfacing when the soil reaches 64 degrees Fahrenheit. Adult cicadas remain above ground for 4 to 6 weeks, during which they mate and lay eggs before dying, continuing the cycle. </p>

This order is viewed as a direct assault on the Constitution and is connected to other controversial policies, such as visa revocations and deportations. Times Opinion reached out to dozens of legal scholars to identify the most significant unconstitutional or unlawful actions by Mr. Trump and his administration in the first 100 days of his second presidency, and to assess the damage. The scholars are also assessing the damage caused by these actions and determining whether they fall within the president's powers. </p>

Small businesses have faced significant challenges due to COVID-19 mandates, supply chain disruptions, labor market issues, and inflation. While the Trump administration has expressed a desire to prioritize Main Street, small businesses continue to struggle with government-imposed battles, such as tariffs.

          <p>President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), spearheaded by Elon Musk, aimed to combat waste and fraud within the federal government. Despite initial promises of significant savings and efficiency improvements, DOGE has faced numerous setbacks and legal challenges in its first 100 days. Claims of substantial savings have been inaccurate and overstated, and many initiatives have been reversed or delayed due to legal issues and public backlash. DOGE has reshaped the federal workforce through firings and buyouts, and it has amassed unprecedented power over government data, raising concerns about data privacy and abuse. </p>

          <p>President Trump faces the challenge of uniting Republicans in Congress to pass his budget bill, which includes extending tax cuts, raising the debt ceiling, and increasing defense and border security spending. Republicans hold a narrow majority in both the House and Senate, and internal divisions over spending cuts and program priorities pose a significant obstacle. House committees are instructed to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending, while the Senate has a $4 billion floor for cuts, creating a major point of contention. The process will test the GOP's ability to overcome internal divides under tight margins in both chambers. </p>

          <p>Financial stress, stemming from job loss, market volatility, and economic uncertainty, can significantly damage mental health, with research suggesting that a person's perception of their financial situation is more impactful than the actual financial change itself. Experts recommend acknowledging grief after a job loss, seeking side hustles to utilize existing skills, and embracing uncertainty by focusing on immediate steps and information gathering. Self-care practices like adequate sleep, exercise, and social connections are also crucial in managing financial distress and improving one's outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A review of the 2025 NFL draft highlights the Jacksonville Jaguars as a winner for trading up to select Travis Hunter, a versatile player from Colorado. The Atlanta Falcons are seen as losers for overpaying for pass-rushers and dealing with a prank call incident. Dillon Gabriel, a quarterback selected by the Cleveland Browns, is also considered a loser due to the media attention surrounding Shedeur Sanders, who was also drafted by the Browns. Caleb Williams of the Chicago Bears is a winner for gaining new offensive weapons, while Howie Roseman of the Philadelphia Eagles is praised for his strategic draft selections. </p>

          <p>Marriage registrations in China continued to decline in the first quarter of the year, prompting local governments to offer cash rewards to young couples in an effort to encourage marriage. In the first three months of 2025, 1.81 million couples registered for marriage, a decrease of 159,000 compared to the same period last year. The country is also streamlining its marriage registration rules, allowing couples to register without returning to their place of household residency. Last year, China recorded the lowest number of new marriages since 1980. </p>

Danny Murphy suggests that Liverpool should consider additions at center-back, depending on Arne Slot's view of existing players. Liverpool's immediate defensive priority looks be at left-back, but the emergence of Conor Bradley has delivered what looks like an ideal replacement at right-back if Alexander-Arnold leaves. </p>
