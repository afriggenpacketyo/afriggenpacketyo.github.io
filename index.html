        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several UK councils are proceeding with legal action to prevent hotels from housing asylum seekers, despite a recent Court of Appeal ruling that overturned an injunction in Epping Forest. The ruling was seen as a setback for local authorities who argue the practice breaches planning laws and creates public safety risks. Two councils have confirmed to the BBC they will continue their legal fights, with Epping Forest considering an appeal to the Supreme Court. The situation has sparked protests and counter-protests across England and Scotland, highlighting the deep divisions over the government's immigration policies and the significant costs of using hotels for accommodation.</p>

          <p>Andriy Parubiy, the former speaker of Ukraine's parliament and a key figure in the pro-European Euromaidan protests, has been shot and killed in the western city of Lviv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the killing, and authorities have launched a major manhunt for the suspect, who was reportedly disguised as a food delivery courier. Parubiy was a prominent statesman who played a pivotal role in Ukraine's national security following Russia's 2014 aggression and joined the territorial defense after the full-scale invasion. The assassination has been described by former President Petro Poroshenko as a "shot fired at the heart of Ukraine."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump's broad "reciprocal tariffs" imposed on most trading partners are illegal, stating they represent an overreach of emergency economic powers. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which Trump used to justify the levies, does not grant the president the authority to impose taxes like tariffs. The tariffs will remain in place until mid-October to allow for a likely appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, creating significant uncertainty for businesses and global trade relations. The final outcome could have major implications for presidential authority and the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has ordered a nationwide audit of public housing to identify and remove residents living in the U.S. illegally. HUD Secretary Scott Turner announced that Public Housing Authorities have 30 days to verify the citizenship or eligible immigration status of all tenants, stating that American citizens must be prioritized for limited housing resources. The directive, part of a broader collaboration with the Department of Homeland Security, has been praised by some Republicans for enforcing existing laws. However, critics argue the move could divert critical staff resources from serving eligible Americans, including seniors and veterans.</p>

          <p>After a landmark study identified agricultural pollution as a major contributor to Iowa's severe water quality problems and high cancer rates, funding for publicizing the findings has been abruptly withdrawn. The two-year, $1 million study produced a report linking farm industry practices to contaminants in the state's drinking water sources. However, over $400,000 remaining in the budget, which was earmarked for public awareness and community outreach, was recently "zeroed out" without explanation by Polk County officials. Critics and environmental advocates fear this move is an attempt by agricultural interests and allied politicians to suppress the report's controversial findings and impede necessary reforms.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor Rebecca Patterson has warned that President Trump's attempts to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook pose a significant threat to the central bank's political independence. Patterson, a former chief investment strategist at Bridgewater Associates, argues that politicizing the Fed could erode its credibility and lead to severe long-term economic consequences, such as higher inflation and a weaker currency. She suggests that while markets might initially react positively to politically motivated interest rate cuts, the sustained damage to institutional integrity would ultimately harm the U.S. economy. Patterson believes this could be the first step in an effort to stack the Fed with loyalists. (not investment advice)</p>

The Palestinian Authority condemned the action as a violation of U.S. commitments as the UN's host nation and is urging international partners, including the EU, to pressure the Trump administration to reverse its decision.

This event marks a significant escalation, as the Houthis have been launching missiles at Israel and targeting Red Sea shipping in what they claim is solidarity with Palestinians.

Menzies was convicted for the 1986 abduction and murder of Maurine Hunsaker. The court's decision sends the case back to a lower court to re-evaluate his mental fitness, citing a significant question about his competency.

Following Trump's social media post urging a return to the old logo, the company announced it would restore its traditional branding, stating, "We said we would listen, and we have."

          <p>Photographer Zed Nelson's new book, "The Anthropocene Illusion," examines the contrived and paradoxical ways humans interact with the natural world they are actively altering. Nelson traveled to 14 countries over six years, capturing images of curated experiences like staged safaris in Kenya and zoos with painted backdrops that create a facade of the wild. The project highlights how, as society becomes more disconnected from genuine nature, it increasingly creates hyper-managed, artificial versions to satisfy a craving for what has been lost. The photos reveal the cracks in these illusions, serving as unwitting monuments to the very environments and species being destroyed.</p>

The recent shift in discourse, with Western academics and human rights groups now using the term "genocide," is attributed not to a moral awakening but to the fact that images of starvation are more palatable for Western consciences than bombed bodies, allowing for performative grief without confronting complicity.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas experienced a 12% year-over-year drop in visitor numbers in July, marking the sixth straight month of decline for the city's tourism industry. Despite the decrease in foot traffic, Nevada's gaming revenue remained strong, with casinos reporting a 4% increase in winnings, suggesting that those who do visit are spending more. The head of the Las Vegas tourism authority, Steve Hill, pushed back against narratives that the city has become overpriced, arguing it remains a value destination and pointing to strong convention bookings for the coming months. Resorts are responding to visitor concerns with promotions like waived fees and free parking. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Israeli official has stated that humanitarian aid, including airdrops and truck deliveries, will soon be slowed or halted in parts of northern Gaza as the military expands its offensive against Hamas. The Israeli army has urged residents of Gaza City to evacuate south, calling the area a "dangerous combat zone." Aid organizations and the Red Cross have warned that a mass evacuation is impossible to conduct safely under current conditions and would worsen the dire humanitarian crisis, with famine already declared in the city. As some residents begin to flee, the death toll in Gaza has risen to over 63,000, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted two civilian workers, John Floyd and Nelson Wu, for their roles in the 2021 jet fuel spill at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility in Hawaii. The indictment alleges they provided the Navy with false information about a May 2021 spill, causing the Navy to mislead regulators about the amount of fuel leaked months before it contaminated the drinking water for 90,000 people. This is the first indictment related to the incident, which sickened 6,000 people and led to the decision to close the WWII-era facility. Previous investigations have cited shoddy management and human error as causes for the spill.</p>

In response, Ukraine's military reported successful strikes on two Russian oil refineries in Krasnodar and Syzran. The aerial exchange comes amid stalled international peace efforts, with European foreign ministers discussing further sanctions and the potential freezing of Russian assets to deplete Moscow's resources for the war.</p>

          <p>Ultra low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in less than twelve months, just months after emerging from a previous reorganization. The airline plans to continue normal operations during the restructuring, honoring tickets and loyalty points while paying employees as usual. CEO Dave Davis stated that more work is needed to position the company for the future, acknowledging ongoing struggles with rising operational costs and significant debt. The move comes as the carrier faces intense pressure from larger airlines and has issued warnings about its ability to stay in business amid adverse market conditions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved this year's updated COVID-19 vaccines, but with narrower eligibility criteria than in previous years. The new shots are officially authorized for adults aged 65 and older and for younger individuals with specific medical conditions that place them at high risk for severe illness, such as asthma, diabetes, and heart conditions. While federal officials state that anyone can receive a vaccine after consulting a doctor, the more limited approval may restrict access for healthy younger people. This change could also create confusion for parents and pregnant individuals, who now fall under a "shared decision-making" framework with their healthcare providers.</p>

          <p>American authorities, including the FBI, are increasingly alarmed by the growing interest among far-right extremist groups in using commercially available or homemade drones for domestic terrorist attacks. Online chatter within these circles frequently references the effective use of FPV (first-person viewer) drones in conflicts like the war in Ukraine and by drug cartels, viewing them as critical tools for a potential insurgency against the U.S. government. Evidence has emerged of military-trained neo-Nazis with drone operation skills advocating for their use in reconnaissance and attacks on critical infrastructure, raising significant national security concerns.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the University of California system should sue the Trump administration over the illegal suspension of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal research grants rather than negotiate a settlement. The author, who is co-counsel in a successful lawsuit brought by Harvard researchers, points out that federal courts have already ruled the administration's actions were unlawful and violated the First Amendment. The article contends that settling would be a form of capitulation to extortion, setting a dangerous precedent and forcing the university to use education funds to pay a settlement, while potentially agreeing to ideological demands like ending gender-affirming care.</p>

The author laments the repetitive cycle of tragedy, grief, and inaction that follows such events in America. The piece highlights the words of the school's principal, Matthew DeBoer, who invoked an African proverb: "When you pray, move your feet." This serves as a powerful plea for the community and the nation to move beyond words and thoughts, urging for concrete actions to be taken to prevent future violence and protect children in places where they should feel safest.</p>
