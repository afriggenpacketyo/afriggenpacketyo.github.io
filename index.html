        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated that the U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is progressing better than anticipated, despite recent violence. While in Israel to support the fragile peace plan, Vance acknowledged difficulties, such as recovering all hostage remains, but emphasized that no American troops would be deployed to Gaza. The agreement has seen incremental steps, including the exchange of hostages and remains, yet its long-term viability is questioned by critics like ex-Israeli official Alon Pinkas, who fears Prime Minister Netanyahu may resume military operations. The plan's success hinges on the challenging demilitarization of Gaza, a point of contention for both sides.</p>

          <p>Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, leaving hundreds of thousands in the Chernihiv region without power as winter approaches. Ukrainian officials report that ongoing drone strikes are hampering repair efforts, with President Zelenskyy accusing Russia of using the cold as a terror tactic. These bombardments coincide with diplomatic maneuvers, as U.S. President Trump plans to meet with Russian President Putin in Budapest to discuss a peace settlement. European leaders have voiced support for negotiations to begin based on current front lines, a condition Moscow has so far rejected.</p>

          <p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized President Trump's construction of a new ballroom at the White House, stating, "It’s not his house. It’s your house. And he’s destroying it." The privately-funded, $200 million project involves modernizing the East Wing to accommodate large events and state visits, which the Trump administration says will benefit future presidencies at no taxpayer expense. The project has drawn condemnation from other prominent Democrats who label it as out of touch while many Americans face economic hardship. The White House defended the construction as a "historic beautification" and a long-needed upgrade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has announced there are no immediate plans for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, walking back Trump's earlier statement about a potential summit in Budapest. A preparatory call between the U.S. Secretary of State and the Russian Foreign Minister was described as "productive," making an in-person follow-up unnecessary for now. This development follows reports of a tense meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, where Trump allegedly pushed for territorial concessions. Despite this, Trump later publicly endorsed a ceasefire based on current front lines, a proposal Russia continues to oppose.</p>

          <p>Rabbi Angela Buchdahl, the first Asian American woman to lead New York's Central Synagogue, champions a message of "radical compassion" rooted in her experiences as a Korean Jew. In her sermons and new memoir, "Heart of a Stranger," she emphasizes that her feeling of being an outsider cultivated a deep sense of empathy, which she believes is central to faith and community building. Buchdahl uses her platform to address contemporary issues like rising antisemitism and the Israel-Hamas war, urging her global online following to maintain their shared humanity. She credits her mother's resilience for inspiring her to lead with dignity and strength.</p>

          <p>American cattle ranchers are expressing concern over President Trump's proposal to import beef from Argentina, arguing it fails to address fundamental threats to the U.S. beef supply chain. The domestic industry is already grappling with a resurgent threat from the flesh-eating screwworm parasite near the Mexican border and persistent drought conditions that have shrunk the U.S. cattle herd to its lowest level since 1951. Ranchers and industry groups like the National Cattlemen's Beef Association contend that government intervention will disrupt the market and harm rural producers without lowering consumer prices. They urge a focus on biosecurity and domestic support instead.</p>

The books were removed earlier this year following executive orders from President Trump and guidance from the Secretary of Defense aimed at prohibiting materials promoting "gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology."

          <p>Following the audacious daylight robbery of crown jewels from the Louvre museum in Paris, a French criminology expert predicts that authorities will likely apprehend the suspects but will not recover the priceless artifacts. The thieves left behind significant DNA evidence and tools, including a crane lift and power saw used to access the gallery. The stolen items, including a tiara commissioned by Emperor Napoleon III, are considered historically priceless but could be worth millions if broken down and sold on the black market. The heist has been labeled a national embarrassment, exposing significant security vulnerabilities at the world-famous museum.</p>

This case is the first "bellwether trial" among many lawsuits alleging that tech companies knowingly designed addictive features that cause mental health damage to minors, increasing legal pressure on the social media industry to address child safety.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team is set to face rival Australia in a World Cup group stage match, offering a chance for redemption after a humiliating Ashes defeat earlier in the year. Both teams are currently unbeaten and have already secured spots in the semi-finals, reducing the pressure of the match but heightening its psychological importance for England. Australia will be without their captain and leading run-scorer, Alyssa Healy, due to injury, potentially giving England an advantage. England's new coach, Charlotte Edwards, has fostered a more relaxed and resilient mindset in the team, focusing on winning pragmatically rather than an overly aggressive style.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska has publicly warned President Trump against his proposal to import beef from Argentina, stating that the plan would hurt American cattle ranchers without effectively lowering consumer prices. In a social media post, Fischer argued that government intervention in the beef market would undermine the one bright spot in a struggling U.S. agriculture economy. She urged the administration to focus on trade deals that benefit domestic producers rather than imports that could pull the rug out from under ranchers who are just breaking even.

          <p>The fitness trend of wearing weighted vests to intensify workouts can offer benefits but also carries risks, according to CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook. He explained that the added weight can help burn more calories and increase cardiovascular workload, but individuals with underlying health conditions should consult a doctor first, as it acts like a "mini stress test." While inconclusive on bone health benefits, the vests may improve muscle strength and help prevent falls if used correctly. Dr. LaPook advised starting with a low weight, ensuring a proper fit to avoid joint stress, and listening to one's body to prevent injury.</p>

GM now projects full-year adjusted earnings between $12 billion and $13 billion, signaling strong performance heading into the fourth quarter.

While some data suggests affluent mothers face unique pressures related to intensive parenting, a broader look at research indicates they generally report higher overall life satisfaction. Studies show that factors like education and income significantly improve happiness for parents. The analysis concludes that parenthood involves a trade-off between meaning and happiness that varies by social context, suggesting that robust, family-friendly social policies benefit all parents, regardless of their income level.</p>
