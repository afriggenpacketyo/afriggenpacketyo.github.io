The bank's profit rose by 15% to $4.74 billion, with revenue climbing 6% to $15.06 billion. The global banking and markets division saw a 10% revenue increase, fueled by a 27% surge in equity trading revenue, while asset and wealth management revenue experienced a slight decline.

            <p>Negotiations between the Trump administration and Iran on a potential renewed nuclear agreement have commenced positively, despite unresolved issues and uncertain conditions. There is growing optimism regarding a deal and improved communication between the U.S. and Iran. Iran's weakened economy and regional position, coupled with internal discontent, are driving its interest in securing a deal sooner. Trump's administration faces fewer constraints than Biden's, potentially leading to a more successful outcome, as Trump is already seen as an Iran hawk and re-implemented sanctions after entering office.</p>

            <p>A recent survey indicates that over 60% of CEOs anticipate a recession within the next six months, fueled by escalating tariff turmoil. Nearly three-fourths of surveyed CEOs believe tariffs will negatively impact their businesses in 2025, with many opposing Trump's proposed levies. An index of CEOs' views on current business conditions has plummeted, reaching its lowest point since the early months of the pandemic. Despite these concerns, slightly over half of the respondents foresee improved business conditions over the next year. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Mothers of young children often experience persistent exhaustion, characterized by brain fog, sleepiness, and general discombobulation, even when getting adequate sleep. This phenomenon, termed 'Mom Fatigue,' seems to disproportionately affect mothers compared to fathers, despite similar sleep patterns. The problem may stem from interrupted sleep, sleep debt, and the relentless mental load of childcare and household management. Experts recommend 'wakeful rest' or zoning out for a few minutes each day to combat this problem, allowing mothers to reset their brains amidst the constant demands of their daily lives.</p>

            <p>As Americans grapple with increasingly packed schedules, finding time for friendship requires careful planning and coordination, often weeks or months in advance. The demands of work, family, and personal activities leave little room for spontaneity, leading many to schedule social time with the same precision as business meetings. While Americans have as much free time as they did two decades ago, socializing has become less of a priority, with more time spent in solitude. This trend highlights the challenges of maintaining friendships in a culture that often prioritizes busyness and individual pursuits.</p>

The sudden withdrawal of aid has crippled the systems that enabled people to obtain their AIDS medicines, leading to a resurgence of the virus and increased illness.

            <p>The UN is appealing to Donald Trump to exempt the world's poorest and smallest countries from "reciprocal" tariffs, warning of potential "serious economic harm." The UN identifies 28 nations singled out for higher tariffs despite their minimal contribution to the U.S. trade deficit. These countries, unlikely to pose a threat to the U.S. economy, face tariffs that could significantly impact their economies. The UN highlights the importance of reassessing the treatment of small and vulnerable economies during the current 90-day pause on higher tariffs, advocating for exemptions that would offer little advantage to U.S. trade policy.</p>

            <p>Major stock markets in Asia and Europe experienced gains following the U.S. announcement of temporary tariff exemptions for key consumer electronics. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index led the regional surge, with tech stocks performing particularly well. The exemptions, initially suggesting relief for tech companies, were tempered by President Trump's indication that the reprieve would be temporary. The market's reaction reflects the sensitivity to trade policy changes and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding U.S.-China trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>
