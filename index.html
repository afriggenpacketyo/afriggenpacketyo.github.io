          <p>Japan's exports experienced their steepest decline in eight months, falling 1.7% year-over-year in May, driven by an 11.1% drop in exports to the U.S. and an 8.8% decrease to China. The decline in automobile exports, particularly to the U.S., contributed significantly to the overall downturn, raising concerns about potential tariffs and trade policies. The Bank of Japan has warned that trade uncertainties could moderate the country's economic growth, leading to a slowdown in overseas economies and a decline in domestic corporate profits. Concerns persist regarding potential U.S. tariffs and their impact on Japan's GDP (not investment advice).</p>

The judge stated that the policy is rooted in prejudice towards transgender Americans and would cause them psychological distress and fear for their safety.

The U.S. military is sending assets to the region, ostensibly for defensive purposes, but also to provide options for direct assistance to Israel if needed.

Despite these disruptions, the summit addressed issues such as trade, Ukraine, and climate change. Leaders discussed potential trade deals, including a Canada-US agreement, and expressed support for a peaceful resolution in Ukraine. The summit also highlighted the challenges of balancing competing interests and maintaining unity among member nations.</p>

          <h2>Australia Removes Plasma Donation Restrictions for Gay and Bisexual Men</h2>

          <p>Australia has lifted blood and plasma donation restrictions for gay and bisexual men, becoming the first country to remove all sexual activity-based restrictions on plasma donation. The changes, approved by the country's health products regulator, are estimated to expand the donation pool by 625,000 people. The new rules allow most people in a sexual relationship of 6 months or more with a single partner to donate blood, regardless of their gender or sexuality. Lifeblood hopes the changes will provide a much-needed boost to supplies.</p>
