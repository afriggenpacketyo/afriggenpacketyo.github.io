        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England is widely anticipated to lower its main interest rate to 4%, marking the fifth reduction since the previous August. This decision comes in response to rising unemployment, which reached a four-year high, and a contracting UK economy, partially attributed to US trade tariffs. While the move is expected to lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, it highlights the challenge of stimulating growth amid persistent inflation, which remains well above the central bank's 2% target. The economic outlook is further clouded by forecasts of potential stagflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 has struck near Russia's Kuril Islands, prompting a tsunami warning for the Kamchatka coast. Russian officials have projected a relatively small tsunami wave, with heights ranging from 3 to 19 centimeters, affecting several coastal districts. The United States Geological Survey registered the quake at a slightly higher magnitude of 7.0, though the Pacific Tsunami Warning System confirmed there was no threat to Hawaii. This marks the second notable earthquake to occur in the region within a little over a week.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian forces have reportedly used a drone to strike a major oil depot near the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, causing a large fire and temporarily suspending flights at a nearby airport. In retaliation, Russia launched missile attacks on the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, destroying homes and injuring at least seven civilians. This exchange follows a week of intense conflict, including a deadly Russian assault on Kyiv. Russia's defense ministry claimed to have intercepted 93 Ukrainian drones overnight, while Ukraine reported shooting down 61 of 83 incoming Russian drones and missiles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A popular TikTok trend involving Labubu dolls has led to a surge in dangerous counterfeit products, which authorities are actively seizing. Trading Standards officers in London discovered millions of pounds worth of fake goods, including dolls that pose a serious choking hazard as their parts easily detach. These counterfeits, often sold at a fraction of the price of authentic dolls, are produced quickly with substandard and potentially toxic materials. The high demand and limited supply of genuine dolls, partly due to scalpers using bots for bulk purchases, have created a lucrative market for these unsafe fakes.</p>

          <p>Four municipal workers have died in Gyoda, Japan, after an incident at a sewage pipe inspection site. The tragedy occurred when one worker fell into a manhole, and three colleagues who attempted a rescue also fell in. All four men, who were in their fifties, were later pronounced dead at a hospital. Authorities suspect the cause of death may be hydrogen sulfide poisoning, as rescuers detected high concentrations of the toxic gas emanating from the manhole. An investigation is underway to determine the exact circumstances that led to the fatal accident.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that significant reductions in air pollution in East Asia over the past decade may have unintentionally hastened the pace of global warming. Efforts, particularly in China, have cut sulfur dioxide emissions by an estimated 75% since 2013, improving public health. However, these aerosol pollutants also had a cooling effect by reflecting sunlight and seeding clouds, and their removal has reduced this protective masking. The research suggests that this reduction in air pollution has likely contributed up to 0.05 degrees Celsius to the planet's average surface warming rate since 2010.</p>

The piece suggests the attacks have damaged international law, pushed Iran closer to China, and ironically increased the likelihood of Tehran pursuing a nuclear weapon for self-defense.

Democrats have been using procedural rules to slow the confirmation process, forcing lengthy roll call votes for each nominee.

          <p>Researchers at the Beijing Institute of Technology claim to have developed a sophisticated electronic warfare technique that can create a protective "storm eye" for friendly forces. The system uses a swarm of drones that can simultaneously jam enemy communications while precisely canceling out the jamming signals at allied positions. By adjusting their signals' waveforms, amplitude, and timing, the drones can generate a targeted "null" where friendly communications remain clear. This represents a significant advance over traditional omnidirectional jamming, which often disrupts both enemy and friendly signals indiscriminately, offering a more precise and strategic capability.</p>

          <p>A 54-year-old man in Polk County, Tennessee, was arrested after authorities discovered 14 improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in his home. Police were executing a warrant for Kevin Wade O'Neal, who had allegedly threatened public officials and law enforcement. During the arrest, officers noticed a smoldering device in his bedroom and evacuated the property. A bomb squad later confirmed the presence of 14 IEDs, which police say O'Neal tried to detonate while they were in the house. He now faces multiple charges, including 11 counts of attempted first-degree murder.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the wife of a Marine Corps veteran and a mother of two young children, has been released from ICE custody after being detained for two months in Louisiana. She was arrested in May during what she believed was a routine green card interview, due to an old deportation order she was unaware of. Her husband, Adrian Clouatre, said he felt betrayed by the arrest, which occurred while his wife was still breastfeeding their infant daughter. Her case highlights the Trump administration's "hyper-enforcement environment," where deference previously given to military families is often superseded by new priorities.</p>
