          <p>Japan, historically pacifist, is shifting its focus towards global arms exports to deepen ties with allies and bolster its defense industry. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba are actively promoting defense exports, aiming to improve interoperability with Western countries, especially in security fields. This shift addresses concerns about the poor condition of Japan's defense industrial base, which has suffered from reliance on U.S. weapon imports. By exporting arms, Japan aims to achieve economies of scale, reduce costs, and ensure a more stable demand for domestic production, moving beyond limited domestic demand from the Japan Self-Defense Forces. The country wants to be a more proactive contributor to peace. Optimism for stability and peace is high due to the country's defensive goals.</p>

          <p>The State Department has raised its travel advisory for Israel to Level 4, urging U.S. citizens not to travel there due to ongoing armed conflict, terrorism, and civil unrest. This escalation follows retaliatory strikes between Israel and Iran, resulting in casualties on both sides. The advisory also warns against travel to the West Bank and Gaza, citing terrorism and armed conflict, respectively, advising those in Gaza to prepare for indefinite stays due to border closures. The U.S. Embassy in Israel is closed, and House Speaker Mike Johnson has postponed his trip to Israel's parliament. The State Department has allowed family members of government employees and some non-emergency government workers to leave the region. The current security environment in the region is highly unpredictable.</p>

          <p>Former MLB player Zack Cozart, a previous supporter of President Trump, has stated he would withdraw his support if the U.S. enters a war. This declaration came as Trump called for mass evacuations in Tehran amidst heightened tensions between Israel and Iran. Trump is cutting short his attendance at the G7 summit in Canada due to the ongoing conflict, with the White House emphasizing that American forces are maintaining a defensive posture. Cozart previously voiced strong support for Trump, but the prospect of war has altered his stance. The White House is maintaining that the President's actions are to defend American interests.</p>

          <p>President Trump is cutting his trip to Canada for the G7 summit short, returning to Washington due to escalating tensions in the Middle East. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt cited "what's going on in the Middle East" as the reason for the early departure. Trump stated he had spoken to everyone regarding Israel and Iran, suggesting a deal might be imminent, while also urging Iran to negotiate before it's too late. This decision comes as Israel and Iran exchange airstrikes, with the U.S. maintaining it is not involved in Israel's strikes but has assisted in intercepting Iranian missiles. There is hope that the situation will de-escalate with diplomatic solutions.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have released details of President Trump's tax bill, including contentious elements concerning Medicaid funding and state and local tax deductions (SALT). The Senate proposes steeper cuts to Medicaid by lowering provider taxes, while permanently extending the $10,000 SALT deduction, differing from the House's version that raises the deduction to $40,000. This divergence has already drawn criticism from House Republicans, threatening the bill's passage, while Senate Republicans are also calling for a $5 trillion increase in the debt ceiling. The Senate version includes provisions to end taxes on tips, overtime, and auto loan interest, but reduces the Child Tax Credit increase compared to the House. The bill aims to pass by early July, but disagreements remain.</p>

          <p>President Trump has instructed ICE to prioritize deportations from Democratic-run cities, following protests against his administration's immigration policies. He stated that these cities are the core of the Democrat Power Center, accusing them of using undocumented immigrants to expand their voter base. The administration has also directed ICE to halt arrests at farms, restaurants, and hotels due to concerns about the impact on key industries. Opponents of the immigration policies have protested, and Trump's call for stepped-up enforcement came as he was heading to the G7 economic summit. The President says his aggressive policy is taking long time workers away from hotel, agriculture, and leisure industries.</p>

          <p>Social media and video networks have surpassed traditional TV channels and news websites as the main source of news in the U.S., according to research. Over half of the population (54%) now gets news from platforms like Facebook, X, and YouTube, exceeding TV (50%) and news sites (48%). The rise of personality-driven news, exemplified by figures like Joe Rogan, poses challenges for traditional publishers. The report also notes a trend of politicians favoring sympathetic online hosts over mainstream interviewers. Despite their popularity, online influencers and personalities are identified as a major source of false information.</p>

          <p>Israeli aircraft struck the headquarters of Iran's state broadcaster in Tehran, interrupting a live broadcast and causing casualties. The Israeli military had issued evacuation orders for the area prior to the strike, claiming the target was a communications center used by the Iranian regime. Iran's foreign ministry condemned the attack as a war crime, while residents of Tehran were reportedly fleeing the city. The strike followed earlier reports of Iranian missiles hitting areas in Israel, and Israeli claims of achieving air superiority over Tehran. The action escalates tensions between the two countries.</p>
