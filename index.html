          <p>A new exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, examines the divisive legacy of the Plattenbau, the prefabricated concrete tower blocks common in the former East Germany. Initially hailed as a solution to post-war housing shortages and a symbol of socialist utopianism, these buildings later became associated with the painful economic and social transformations following German reunification. The exhibition uses art to explore the collective memories, social changes, and architectural significance of these structures, which once housed nearly a quarter of the GDR's population. It aims to foster a nuanced understanding of this architectural heritage beyond simple nostalgia or condemnation.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Chinese Encounters with America," profiles twelve influential Chinese individuals whose experiences in the United States fostered a period of significant cultural and scientific exchange. The book's editors argue that the optimism and shared interests that once defined the relationship have faded amid rising geopolitical competition and mutual distrust. Through stories of figures like scientist Xie Xide and diplomat Ji Chaozhu, the volume serves as a reminder of the benefits of cooperation. The editors suggest that China's emergence as a major power triggered a downward spiral, replacing an era of engagement with a climate of fear.</p>

          <p>Nikos Michaloliakos, the convicted leader of Greece's neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party, has been granted early release from prison, sparking anger among left-wing parties and the public. A judicial council allowed the 67-year-old, who was serving a 13-year sentence, to serve the remainder at home on health grounds. Michaloliakos was convicted in 2020 for running a criminal organization responsible for violent attacks on immigrants and political opponents, including the murder of an anti-fascist musician. Critics argue the release sends a message of impunity for fascism and undermines the justice served in the landmark case.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel faced criticism after incorrectly announcing that a suspect in the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk was in custody, only to retract the statement less than two hours later. While the FBI successfully apprehended the actual suspect a day later, the initial misstep during the high-pressure manhunt drew sharp rebukes and raised questions about Patel's leadership. Critics pointed to the confusion caused by conflicting reports from the FBI and local law enforcement. A spokeswoman for Patel defended his actions, stating the ultimate success of the mission was what mattered most during the intense investigation.</p>

          <p>Numerous individuals, including teachers, firefighters, and a Secret Service employee, have been fired or suspended from their jobs due to social media posts critical of or celebrating the assassination of far-right activist Charlie Kirk. The dismissals follow a campaign by conservative figures to identify and expose people making comments deemed objectionable, with some activists encouraging followers to contact employers. The Trump administration has also vowed to take action against military members and foreign nationals who appeared to condone the killing. This widespread clampdown on speech has ignited a debate over free expression and professional consequences in a hyper-partisan environment.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have approved a bill that would permit state colleges and universities to offer preferential admission to applicants who can prove they are descended from individuals enslaved in the U.S. before 1900. Authored by Assemblymember Isaac Bryan, the legislation is part of a broader package of bills aimed at providing reparations for the legacy of slavery. Supporters argue the bill is narrowly tailored to focus on lineage rather than race, thereby complying with California's ban on affirmative action. If signed by the governor, the measure is expected to face legal challenges and potential conflict with the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, historians of the American Civil War are noting disturbing parallels between the political turmoil of the 1850s and the current moment in the United States. Scholars point to similarities in widespread political violence, deep societal polarization (then called sectionalism), and disillusionment with the Supreme Court. While cautioning that the country is not on the brink of another civil war, they highlight how the reaction to violence and the rise of paramilitary-like political movements echo the escalating tensions that led to the nation's deadliest conflict. The experts stress the urgent need to lower the political temperature.</p>

          <p>A column posits that President Biden, who initially positioned himself as a transitional "bridge" to a new generation of leaders, became a roadblock by seeking a second term. This decision delayed the national ambitions of figures like Kamala Harris and Gavin Newsom, leaving Harris with only 107 days to mount a full presidential campaign after Biden's eventual withdrawal. The article suggests that Biden's late exit, not Harris's campaign, drained the party's energy and put it at a disadvantage. It frames Harris's recent memoir as a valid critique of the difficult circumstances she inherited rather than a simple "pity party."</p>

California Democrats, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, aim to counter this by creating more favorable Democratic districts, temporarily bypassing the state's independent redistricting commission.

          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ruled that Meta violated the freedom of expression of porn star Esperanza Gómez by deleting her Instagram account, which had over five million followers. The court found that the company removed her account without a clear justification and applied its content moderation policies inconsistently, as similar accounts remained active. The ruling affirms that social media posts are constitutionally protected in Colombia and orders Meta to make its moderation and appeals processes more transparent. It represents a significant check on the power of major tech platforms to regulate user content without due process.</p>

          <p>Boxing analysts are divided ahead of the highly anticipated fight between Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez and Terence Crawford, a bout that pits Crawford's technical mastery against Álvarez's size and power advantage. Crawford, an undisputed champion at welterweight, is moving up two weight classes to challenge the undisputed super-middleweight champion, creating a classic boxer-versus-puncher dynamic. One expert argues Crawford's superior adaptability, timing, and defensive skills will allow him to outpoint a slowing Álvarez. Another contends that Canelo's experience, strength, and ability to control distance will ultimately prove too much for the smaller man, leading to a victory for the Mexican star.</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly youth-led anti-corruption protests that toppled the government, Nepal has sworn in former Chief Justice Sushila Karki as its first female interim prime minister. The appointment, negotiated between the army and protest representatives, has helped restore calm to the capital, Kathmandu, where curfews have been eased. The "GenZ" protests erupted over economic woes and a social media ban, culminating in the dissolution of parliament. Karki, known for her strong anti-graft stance, will lead the country until new elections are held in March, representing a significant political shift for the Himalayan nation.</p>

          <p>In an effort to address both its declining birth rate and the need to retain scientific talent, Shanghai has introduced a new subsidy program for female researchers returning to work after having a child. The initiative will initially provide 20 new mothers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences with a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010). This program targets a key challenge where women often face career setbacks in demanding scientific fields after childbirth. While the initial scope is limited, it is seen as a positive step toward creating a more supportive environment for women in STEM.</p>

          <p>An American woman who was detained by the Taliban alongside an elderly British couple has issued a dire warning about their deteriorating health, stating they are "literally dying" in prison. Faye Hall was arrested with Peter and Barbie Reynolds in February and released after two months, but the couple remains imprisoned without knowing the charges against them. Hall described how the couple's health has rapidly declined in harsh conditions, with 80-year-old Peter requiring daily medication for a heart condition. She is calling on the US and UK governments to increase efforts to secure the release of the couple, who had lived and run a charity in Afghanistan for years.</p>

          <p>In a commentary, Rebecca Solnit argues that the culture of sexual exploitation of young girls, evidenced by the recently released Jeffrey Epstein birthday book, was disturbingly normalized in the 1970s and 80s. The author recounts how movies, rock music, and mainstream media of that era frequently depicted or excused relationships between adult men and underage girls. Solnit credits the feminist movement with fundamentally shifting public consciousness by establishing principles of consent, exposing widespread abuse, and insisting that women and children have inviolable rights. The article frames the Epstein scandal as a late relic of a permissive patriarchal culture that feminism has worked for decades to dismantle.</p>
