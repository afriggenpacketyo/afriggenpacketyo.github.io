          <p>President Trump is scheduled to speak at West Point's commencement, coinciding with his administration's rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in military academies. Changes include disbanding student clubs like the National Society of Black Engineers and removing books on diversity and race from Naval Academy libraries, though most books have since been returned. Critics, including former West Point teachers, argue these actions stifle education and debate. Protests are planned during the ceremony, reflecting ongoing tensions surrounding the administration's policies and their impact on military education.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, a move that could end 17 years of federal control over the mortgage giants. The idea has drawn support from investors like Bill Ackman, who believe the firms could function better without federal oversight. However, critics like Senator Elizabeth Warren warn that privatization could disrupt the mortgage market and increase housing prices. The decision could have significant implications for homebuyers and investors, depending on how the government decides to end the conservatorship and whether it offers some form of guarantee.

          <p>A new study traces the sensitivity of human teeth back to the exoskeletons of ancient, armored fish. Evolutionary biologist Yara Haridy and her team discovered that the anatomy of these ancient fish scales is similar to that of vertebrate teeth, suggesting a shared evolutionary origin for sensing capabilities. The armor of ancient fish likely allowed them to sense their surroundings, an ability inherited by our teeth, explaining why we experience toothaches and sensitivity to temperature. This research provides insights into skeletal evolution and the reasons behind common dental discomfort.</p>

          <p>Birmingham City Council has secured a court order to prevent waste vehicles from being blocked from leaving depots, as a bin strike continues to disrupt collections. Over 12,000 tonnes of uncollected waste have accumulated due to the strike action by refuse workers. The dispute centers on proposed pay cuts for bin lorry drivers, with the union blaming government-appointed commissioners for the lack of progress. The council insists it has a public health duty to clear waste, while the union maintains its picket lines are lawful and peaceful.</p>

Experts testified that if deported, Khalil could face assassination, kidnapping, or torture by Israeli forces or former operatives of Bashar al-Assad.
