          <p>China is preparing for a major military parade to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, where it is expected to showcase its most advanced weaponry. While the event's official theme is not Taiwan, analysts believe the display of new military hardware, including fifth-generation fighter jets and carrier-based aircraft, is intended as a strong message to the self-ruled island. The parade will feature a speech by President Xi Jinping and demonstrate the People's Liberation Army's combat readiness, with much of the featured equipment having been developed with a potential Taiwan conflict in mind.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article explores the significant gap in French cinema regarding the nation's history with the transatlantic slave trade. The author notes that their own understanding of this history was shaped primarily by American films like "Roots" and "12 Years a Slave." While acknowledging recent efforts by French filmmakers to tackle the subject, such as the films "Fanon" and "Zion," the piece argues these compelling narratives are still marginalized within the mainstream French film industry. It concludes that while French audiences are ready to confront this history, the cinematic establishment has been slow to respond.</p>

          <p>The Chinese yuan has shown significant gains against the US dollar, reaching its strongest level since last November, with analysts forecasting the trend to continue. This appreciation is attributed to a more resilient Chinese economic outlook than previously feared and growing investor concerns about the sustainability of US government debt. Investment bank Goldman Sachs projects the yuan will continue to strengthen, potentially breaking the 7-per-dollar mark within six months and reaching 6.9 in a year, reflecting shifting global economic sentiments.

          <p>Panelists at the East Tech West conference emphasized the need for nations, particularly emerging economies, to develop "sovereign AI" to maintain strategic autonomy and cultural relevance. This involves creating AI systems tailored to local languages and contexts, rather than relying on English-based models from major tech companies. The experts suggested that the use of open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing services are key strategies to democratize AI development. This approach would allow countries to build their own AI ecosystems and ensure the technology's benefits are more inclusively distributed.</p>

          <p>A private survey indicated that China's factory activity unexpectedly grew in June, contrasting with official data that showed a third consecutive month of contraction. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose to 50.4, driven by an expansion in production and new orders, though export orders continued to decline. Economists attribute the divergence between the private and official surveys to differences in sample size and timing, with the Caixin survey focusing more on smaller, export-oriented firms that may be responding to recent tariff reductions.

The bill, which the CBO estimates would increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion, is being advanced through budget reconciliation, requiring only a simple majority and creating a tense race against a self-imposed July 4 deadline.</p>

          <p>A top military commander has proposed reassigning 200 of the roughly 4,000 National Guard members from their controversial deployment in Los Angeles to assist with wildfire preparations in California. President Trump had federalized the troops to deal with immigration-related protests, a move challenged by Governor Gavin Newsom, who warned it could hinder the state's wildfire response. The potential shift highlights the tension between the federal deployment and the state's urgent need for firefighting resources as it enters what is expected to be an active fire season.</p>
