          <p>Armed agents in tactical gear used military-style force, including flash-bang grenades, to disperse a crowd protesting an immigration raid in Los Angeles's Fashion District. The raid and subsequent clash highlight ongoing tensions surrounding immigration enforcement and the tactics employed by federal agents. The incident raises questions about the appropriate use of force during protests and the balance between law enforcement and the right to assembly. The scale of the response and the use of such tactics have drawn criticism from civil rights advocates and community leaders, who argue that they escalate tensions and create an atmosphere of fear. Optimism is low given the high tension and potential for injury.</p>

          <p>Kilmar √Åbrego Garc√≠a, a 29-year-old from El Salvador who was mistakenly deported in March, has been returned to the U.S. to face prosecution on two federal criminal charges. He is accused of participating in a trafficking conspiracy to move people from Texas to other parts of the country, dating back to 2016. El Salvador agreed to release Mr. √Åbrego Garc√≠a after the U.S. presented an arrest warrant, according to Attorney General Pam Bondi. His lawyer has called the charges "preposterous," and the White House had previously resisted a US Supreme Court order to "facilitate" his return. The situation has a low optimism score given that this is a criminal case with the potential for imprisonment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla has been facing massive challenges trying to get back on track after a disastrous first quarter, and these headwinds strengthened considerably this week after CEO Elon Musk officially concluded his term with the Trump administration. Musk expressed sharp criticism of the Trump's signature spending bill, which escalated into an online brawl, with Musk and President Donald Trump hurling insults at one other from their respective social media platforms. The rift sent Tesla shares plummeting 14% on Thursday, wiping out roughly $152 billion in value, the most for any day in the company's 15 year-history on the public market. The company has failed to roll out innovative and affordable new model EVs, while Chinese competitors like BYD have flooded the market, particularly in Europe. The optimism score is low given the stock drop and negative financial outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A former girlfriend of Sean "Diddy" Combs, identified as "Jane," testified about feeling pressured to engage in sexual encounters with male escorts while he watched, alleging that she felt upset by these encounters. She claimed a network of employees helped procure drugs for these encounters, known as "hotel nights" or "freak-offs," which left her in pain and with frequent infections. Prosecutors have charged Mr. Combs with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution, to which he has pleaded not guilty. The trial is in its fifth week, and the prosecution is seeking to provide evidence that the music mogul's activities were criminal, with Jane's testimony serving as a key component of their case.

          <p>Former Steeler Ryan Clark expressed strong disapproval of the Pittsburgh Steelers' decision to sign Aaron Rodgers, calling it the "worst-case scenario" for fans. Clark argues that the move will keep the team mired in mediocrity and prevent them from contending for a championship. He acknowledges that Rodgers will improve the quarterback room but believes the Steelers will only be fighting for a wild-card spot and will still need to find a franchise quarterback. The Steelers had been targeting Rodgers since the start of the offseason and signed him to a one-year deal. The optimism score is low given the negative outlook for the team.</p>

The indictment charges Abrego Garcia with conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens. Attorney General Pam Bondi said the Salvadoran government agreed to return Abrego Garcia to face the criminal charges after being presented with an arrest warrant. The Justice Department said Abrego Garcia should be held in pretrial custody because he poses a danger to the community and a serious risk of flight. The optimism score is low considering the seriousness of the accusations and potential legal ramifications.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security conducted raids on multiple locations across Los Angeles, clashing with crowds of people who gathered to protest. Masked agents were recorded pulling people out of Home Depot stores and Ambient Apparel‚Äôs headquarters. There has not yet been confirmation of how many people were taken into custody, but initial estimates show roughly two dozen people were loaded into white vans and taken away. Armed agents clad in heavy protective and tactical gear, including some who wore gas masks, could also be seen pushing individuals and trying to corral large groups that congregated to challenge the raids. The optimism score is low given the tensions and potential for injury.</p>

          <p>Tesla's vice president of Optimus robotics, Milan Kovac, said on Friday that he's leaving the company, after joining in 2016. In a post on X, Kovac thanked Tesla CEO Elon Musk and reminisced about his tenure. Tesla is developing Optimus with the aim of someday selling it as a bipedal, intelligent robot capable of everything from factory work to babysitting. In a first-quarter shareholder deck, Tesla said it was on target for "builds of Optimus on our Fremont pilot production line in 2025, with wider deployment of bots doing useful work across our factories."

          <p>Elon Musk's recent announcement that he was stepping back from politics led investors to hope he would increase his involvement in his tech firms, but his row with President Donald Trump suggests Musk's changing priorities might not be the salve they had been hoping for. Instead of Musk retreating from the public eye and focusing on boosting the fortunes of Tesla and his other enterprises, he now finds himself being threatened with a boycott from one of his main customers - Trump's federal government. Some argue the problems for Musk's businesses run much deeper than this spat, and the controversial role in the Trump administration it has brought a spectacular end to. The optimism score is mixed given the potential for both positive and negative outcomes.</p>
