          <p>President Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, stating that both nations were complying with the terms. The agreement involved Iran ceasing strikes on Israel within six hours, followed by Israel halting strikes on Iran twelve hours later. However, Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi initially denied any formal agreement, though he indicated Iran would cease strikes if Israel did the same. The conflict, which began on June 13 with Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets, resulted in numerous casualties on both sides and prompted U.S. military action against Iranian nuclear sites. This announcement has an unclear impact on the broader dispute over Iran's nuclear program. The article reports that Qatar played a role in brokering the deal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of students enrolled in Japanese schools in China has decreased by over 10% in the academic year starting April. This decline is attributed to an economic downturn in China and heightened safety concerns among Japanese expatriate communities following knife attacks targeting Japanese nationals. These attacks include a stabbing near Shanghai in June of last year and a fatal stabbing in Shenzhen in September. Security measures have been increased at Japanese schools, but parents remain vigilant, with some considering returning to Japan if safety is further compromised. This year marks the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, raising fears of worsening public sentiment toward Japanese nationals in China.</p>

          <p>Thailand has banned tourists from entering Cambodia due to ongoing border disputes and heightened security concerns. The ban affects crossings at checkpoints across several Thai provinces and flights into Siem Reap, with exceptions for humanitarian cases. This action follows retaliatory measures by both countries, including Cambodia's ban on imports from Thailand and Thai dramas. Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra also vowed to crack down on scam operations in Cambodia, adding another layer to the complex relationship. Tensions between Thailand and Cambodia have historical roots, dating back to border demarcations after the French occupation of Cambodia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is considering requiring Google to make changes to its search services to promote greater competition. The CMA's investigation, initiated under a new law, could lead to requirements for choice screens for users to access different search providers and increased transparency for publishers. Google, which accounts for over 90% of UK searches, expressed concerns that the proposed changes could have significant implications for businesses and consumers. The CMA's investigation aims to ensure fair competition in online search, potentially reducing the average £33,000 spent annually by businesses on Google adverts.</p>

          <p>The Italian media's intense scrutiny of Ferrari's Formula 1 team puts added pressure on the team. Ferrari is regarded as a national team in Italy, leading the population to feel invested in their performance. Team principal Frederic Vasseur expressed his frustration with reports questioning his position, saying it hurts the team. The reports appeared in two respected Italian newspapers on the same day. The facts of Ferrari's current situation are that they entered the year, having come close to winning the constructors' championship last season, believing and saying they could compete for the title, and they have fallen a long way short of that so far, ultimately, that is Vasseur's responsibility.</p>

          <p>NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was established in 1949 to deter Soviet expansion in Europe and promote political integration. The alliance, now comprising 32 members, operates as a collective security organization, providing mutual defense against external threats. Article 5 of the charter, the collective defense clause, states that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all, invoked only once by the U.S. after 9/11. The collapse of the Soviet Union led to former Warsaw Pact countries joining NATO, and amidst the Russia-Ukraine war, Ukraine's NATO aspirations have gained momentum, though Russia views this as a red line.</p>

          <p>Global equities showed muted gains as investors digested President Trump's ceasefire announcement between Iran and Israel. The market appears to be growing desensitized to Trump's policy changes, with less reaction to each successive announcement. The subdued market response also reflects the relatively limited Iranian response to U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities. This trend indicates a potential fatigue among investors regarding the impact of U.S. policymaking on global markets.</p>

          <p>President Trump ordered the bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities, reigniting debates over Tehran's nuclear program. US intelligence agencies have consistently assessed that Iran has an enrichment program but has not built atomic bombs, conflicting with views from Israel and Iran hawks. Trump's skepticism of the CIA and willingness to listen to Israel have led to a situation where he is not interested in expert opinions on Iran. Despite no evidence of Iran weaponizing, disputes continue over the significance of Iran's uranium enrichment program. Trump's actions have raised concerns among Congressional Democrats, who note the absence of new intelligence justifying the strikes.</p>

          <p>Western airlines face greater disruptions than their Chinese counterparts due to the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel. Western firms must avoid Iranian airspace and are barred from Russian airspace, while Chinese airlines continue to use Russian airspace. This gives Chinese airlines a competitive advantage in airfare and flight times for routes between China and Europe. Flight diversions and cancellations increased after Iran's missile assault on a U.S. military base in Qatar, with Western firms diverting flights through Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan or southern routes over Egypt and Saudi Arabia.</p>

          <p>Germany is facing pressure to increase its defense spending to 5% of GDP, a target reportedly agreed upon by NATO members. This increase would require additional tens of billions of euros annually, potentially financed through loans, tax hikes, and budget cuts. Experts are concerned about the impact on Germany's fiscal stability and compliance with EU fiscal rules. While Germany has eased its debt brake to accommodate defense expenditures, long-term financing through loans may not be sustainable, raising questions about the feasibility of the 5% target.

The Florida Supreme Court denied these appeals, stating that the case law protecting intellectually disabled individuals from execution does not apply to those with other mental illnesses. Gudinas's lawyers are also arguing that the governor's discretion in signing death warrants violates inmates' constitutional rights.

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed “Meteor-1,” the first highly parallel optical computing integrated chip. This chip promises hardware acceleration for AI and data centers, achieving a theoretical peak computing power of 2,560 TOPS at 50GHz optical frequency. This performance is comparable to Nvidia's advanced GPUs. The development comes as traditional electronic chips face physical limitations and U.S. export controls restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors, pushing China to innovate in optical computing.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell nearly 3% after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties. This raised hopes of de-escalation in the Middle East conflict. U.S. crude oil prices decreased to $66.57 per barrel, and global benchmark Brent fell to $69.50, below pre-attack levels. Investors believe the conflict will de-escalate following President Trump's actions, with some suggesting a "peace through strength strategy".</p>

          <p>China has become increasingly reliant on rare earth supplies from Myanmar, despite being the world's top producer. Myanmar accounted for about 57% of China's total rare earth imports last year. These imports are particularly high in heavy rare earth elements, which are less abundant and more valuable. Myanmar's production has strengthened China's dominant position, giving Beijing a de facto monopoly over the global heavy rare earths supply chain. The rare earths extracted in Myanmar are shipped to China for further processing and refining, raising concerns about environmental and human rights abuses in Myanmar.</p>
