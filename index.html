          <p>Steel stocks saw a boost after President Trump doubled tariffs on steel imports, increasing them from 25% to 50% to further secure the United States' steel industry. Cleveland-Cliffs shares rose by approximately 25% in premarket trading, while Steel Dynamics and Nucor each experienced increases of over 10%. The VanEck Steel ETF (SLX) also saw a rise of 1.9% following Trump's announcement at a Pennsylvania rally, which has reignited trade tensions and faced criticism from global partners. This tariff increase is aimed at strengthening the domestic steel industry. Optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that Delaware courts, where many major companies are incorporated, have frequently approved substantial payouts to lawyers, which may embolden critics of the state's judicial practices. The study focuses on the fees awarded in corporate litigation within Delaware, a state known for its business-friendly legal environment and specialized Court of Chancery. The findings could prompt further scrutiny of the relationship between lawyers and the Delaware court system. This may lead to calls for greater transparency in the awarding of legal fees in corporate cases. Optimism score is 50.</p>

          <p>Mazyar Azarbonyad, a 20-year-old personal trainer, has been sentenced to 14 months in a young offender institution after causing a pile-up of police cars on the A1 near Newcastle.

Seven officers were injured and five police cars were damaged in the crash, with Azarbonyad pleading guilty to dangerous driving and other motoring offenses; the incident occurred despite his passenger's pleas to stop, as she feared he would kill someone.

          <p>According to a diplomatic source, Iran intends to reject the nuclear agreement proposal from the United States, deeming it "not balanced" following negotiations that began in April. The source claims the proposal is "totally one-sided," favoring the interests of the U.S. and Israel. President Trump, who withdrew the U.S. from the previous agreement in 2018, seeks a new deal to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Despite ongoing indirect talks, differences remain, and Israel is reportedly considering attacking Iranian nuclear facilities. Optimism score is 30.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has unveiled a major defense review, signaling a shift towards "war-fighting readiness" in response to growing Russian aggression. The plans include building 12 new nuclear-powered attack submarines, boosting drone and missile production, and strengthening cyber warfare capabilities. Defense spending is set to rise to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, with an ambition to reach 3% by 2034, contingent on economic conditions.

          <p>In 2013, Stephen Curry made a surprising move by signing with Under Armour, an up-and-coming athletic company, over Nike. The decision was influenced by Kent Bazemore, Curry's teammate, and a botched Nike presentation. Under Armour offered Curry a $4 million per year deal, while Nike declined to match the $2.5 million offer. Today, Curry has a signature line with Under Armour and serves as president of the Curry Brand. Optimism score is 75.</p>

          <p>A lesser-known treatment called Reconsolidation of Traumatic Memories (RTM) claims to treat PTSD painlessly, offering an alternative to prolonged exposure therapy. RTM involves patients reimagining their trauma through mental exercises designed to fade its emotional charge, utilizing a manualized 89-step protocol. Early data from a large-scale clinical trial suggests RTM modestly outperforms prolonged exposure, with a higher completion rate and lower PTSD severity scores. While critics note the need for more research, RTM's potential lies in its gentler approach and quick treatment duration. Optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>Nearly six decades after humans first walked on the moon, space agencies and commercial companies are aiming to return for scientific research and as a stepping stone to Mars. NASA and ESA are collaborating on the Artemis program, while China and Russia are planning the International Lunar Research Station. The moon's abundant resources, such as iron, silicon, and water, make it valuable for establishing self-sufficient lunar bases. The long-term goal is to use these bases as transit points for more distant space travel. Optimism score is 70.</p>
