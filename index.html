        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eli Lilly reported better-than-expected first-quarter revenue and earnings, driven by high demand for its weight loss and diabetes drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound. Mounjaro's revenue soared 113% to $3.84 billion, while Zepbound generated $2.31 billion, quadrupling its sales from the previous year. However, the company lowered its full-year profit guidance due to charges related to acquiring an oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. CEO Dave Ricks noted investments in U.S. manufacturing were increasing due to the threat of tariffs, but maintained the company's fiscal 2025 sales guidance of $58 billion to $61 billion.</p>

          <p>The Football Association has announced that transgender women will not be able to compete in women's football in England starting June 1st. This decision comes after the UK Supreme Court's ruling that defines 'woman' based on biological sex, leading the FA to scrap its previous policy. The new rules permit only those born biologically female to participate in women's football at all levels. The FA stated that this is a complex subject and they had to review and change the rules to align with material changes in law, science, or the operation of the policy in grassroots football.</p>

          <p>General Motors has revised its 2025 earnings guidance to account for a potential $4 billion to $5 billion impact from President Trump's auto tariffs. The updated guidance projects adjusted earnings before interest and taxes between $10 billion and $12.5 billion, down from the previous estimate of $13.7 billion to $15.7 billion. Despite the tariff concerns, GM CEO Mary Barra stated that the company's business remains fundamentally strong as it adapts to the new trade policy environment. The revised guidance factors in the positive impact of recent tariff adjustments, including reimbursements for some U.S. parts and reduced tariff stacking.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration has enacted several policies that directly benefit the U.S. meat industry, often at the expense of the environment, animal welfare, and worker safety. These include speeding up slaughter lines, rolling back food safety measures, and gutting the USDA's animal welfare research department. The administration also allowed JBS, the world's largest meat company, to trade on the New York Stock Exchange despite past scandals and increased poultry industry bailouts for bird flu. Additionally, the USDA restricted the use of certain words and phrases about agricultural pollution in its documents.</p>

Social media users found the digression bizarre and inappropriate for the context of her speech.

          <p>Wang Shouwen, China's former vice-minister of commerce and key trade negotiator during the first Trump administration, has transitioned to a lesser role at the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC). The move comes amid escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China under President Trump's renewed tariff policies. Li Chenggang, China’s envoy to the World Trade Organization, has replaced Wang, raising questions about the reasons behind Wang's reassignment to the less prestigious ACFIC, which operates under the Communist Party’s United Front Work Department.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration is rewriting crypto rules, marking a significant policy shift from the previous administration. The industry is celebrating a “180 pivot” from the Biden years, citing executive actions, appointments, and early wins such as the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the rollback of SEC enforcement tactics. Jonathan Gould at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has signaled support for issuing new bank charters to crypto firms, while the new SEC chair, Paul Atkins, has begun working directly with crypto stakeholders to craft guidance on token issuance.</p>

It explores the potential risks of integrating crypto into the American financial system, including weakened regulation, public corruption, and financial instability.

          <p>This article examines the significance of sport under the Nazi regime, which prioritized physical education to promote health, performance, and military fitness. Individual sports were subordinated to collective activities aimed at strengthening the "national body." The Nazis initially rejected international competitive sport but later recognized the opportunity to present themselves as a peace-loving state by hosting the 1936 Olympic Games. While boxing was promoted for boys, women's sports were limited to their roles as mothers and housewives. Jews were gradually excluded from sports clubs, leading to the creation of purely Jewish sports clubs.</p>

The closure is a blow to the pottery industry in Stoke-on-Trent, following other recent collapses in the sector. The firm had warned of possible redundancies in March due to rising costs.</p>

This agreement involves creating a joint investment fund between the countries and is intended to give President Trump a personal stake in the country’s fate while addressing his concerns that the United States has provided Kyiv with a blank check to try to withstand Russia’s invasion.</p>
