          <p>The University of Massachusetts Amherst reported that five of its international students had their visas revoked by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) without prior notification to the university, a situation mirrored at other institutions like Minnesota State University. These revocations are reportedly targeting students involved in protests or suspected of criminal activity, as stated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The Department of Homeland Security cited national security concerns in at least one case, highlighting the increasing scrutiny faced by international students amid evolving immigration policies. Recent arrests of students, such as Mahmoud Khalil at Columbia and Rumeysa Ozturk at Tufts, underscore the heightened tensions surrounding student activism and visa statuses.</p>

          <p>The central U.S. is facing a series of flash flood emergencies following days of severe storms and deadly tornadoes, impacting states like Missouri, Texas, and Arkansas.

At least 16 people have died due to tornadoes, with additional fatalities from flooding in Kentucky, where a child and an elderly individual were swept away by floodwaters. The extreme weather is also expected to disrupt interstate commerce, causing potential shipping and supply chain delays, particularly in cargo hubs like Louisville and Memphis.</p>

          <p>Experts are calling for increased attention to men's health, noting that men are more likely to die prematurely than women due to factors like lifestyle choices and biological differences. Men often lack the health literacy and access to services that women gain through regular healthcare interactions. Machismo and socioeconomic factors also play a role, with men in deprived areas facing significantly lower life expectancies. Proposals include providing paid time off for health checks and delivering services in workplaces to better reach blue-collar workers.</p>

          <p>The family of Louise Gleadell, who died from cervical cancer at age 38, has been awarded damages after the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust admitted to misreporting her screening results. Two cervical screening tests, conducted in 2008 and 2012, were incorrectly reported as negative, denying her the opportunity for early treatment. An internal review in 2017 revealed the samples were inadequate and should have been repeated. The trust has apologized for the errors, which had devastating consequences, and has since strengthened its processes for sharing audit findings.</p>

          <p>Sarah Boardman, the artist behind the official portrait of Donald Trump that was publicly criticized by the president, says her business is now 'in danger of not recovering.' Trump called the portrait 'truly the worst' and said it had been 'purposefully distorted,' leading to its removal from Colorado's State Capitol. Boardman, who also painted a portrait of Barack Obama, says Trump's comments have negatively impacted her reputation and business after receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback for six years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, has unveiled a novel approach to improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), combining generative reward modelling (GRM) and self-principled critique tuning. The resulting DeepSeek-GRM models outperformed existing methods, achieving competitive performance with strong public reward models. This development comes amid speculation about the release of DeepSeek-R2, the successor to the firm's R1 reasoning model, which garnered global attention for its cost-efficient performance.</p>

          <p>The Israeli army has admitted that its soldiers made mistakes in the killing of 15 emergency workers in southern Gaza on March 23, although it claims that some of the medics were linked to Hamas. Israel initially stated that troops opened fire because the convoy approached suspiciously without headlights, but video footage shows the vehicles were clearly marked and had lights on. The IDF insists that at least six of the medics were linked to Hamas but has not provided evidence, promising a thorough examination of the incident.</p>
