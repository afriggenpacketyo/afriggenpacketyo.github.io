        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) has announced it will lay down its arms after a 40-year insurgency against the Turkish state. The decision follows a message from imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan, who stated that the armed struggle had outlived its purpose. The P.K.K. has evolved from seeking an independent Kurdish state to advocating for greater rights for Kurds within Turkey. The group hopes Ocalan will lead the disarming process and calls on Turkey’s Parliament to participate, potentially ending a conflict that has claimed over 40,000 lives and influencing other Kurdish militias, especially in Syria. This New York Times article underscores the potential political victory for President Erdogan and the shift in regional dynamics.</p>

          <p>Britain's armed forces are facing significant challenges, including dwindling troop numbers, weak morale, and aging equipment, amidst growing geopolitical uncertainty. A British nuclear-armed submarine recently returned after a record-breaking 204 days underwater, highlighting issues with the navy's aging fleet and the strain on submariners. The government's upcoming Strategic Defence Review aims to address these threats, but doubts remain about its ability to achieve realistic goals given budget constraints. The article also raises concerns about Britain's ability to meet its NATO commitments and the impact of potential deployments to Ukraine. The BBC article suggests the need for increased defense spending and a broader security review.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reported substantial progress in trade talks held in Geneva, signaling a potential de-escalation of the ongoing trade war. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the discussions as "productive and constructive," while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng noted the talks were "in-depth" and "candid." The White House has termed it a "trade deal," with a joint statement expected to provide further details. The talks, the first face-to-face meetings since President Trump imposed tariffs, aim to reduce the US's $1.2 trillion trade deficit and establish an economic and trade consultation mechanism.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have unveiled a plan to cut Medicaid by $880 billion to fund $4.5 trillion in tax breaks, sparking a major political battle over healthcare. The legislation introduces new work and eligibility requirements, which Republicans claim will reduce waste and abuse, while Democrats warn that millions will lose coverage. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 8.6 million people could lose healthcare coverage over the decade. The proposed changes include community engagement requirements for Medicaid eligibility and restrictions on federal funding to states for immigrants without proof of citizenship.

          <p>A catastrophic power outage affecting Spain, Portugal, and southern France has ignited a debate over the role of renewable energy in maintaining energy security. The blackout, which lasted several hours, disrupted services and infrastructure across the Iberian Peninsula. While Spanish authorities are investigating the cause, some observers are pointing to the region's high reliance on wind and solar power as a potential factor. However, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and grid operator Red Electrica de Espana (REE) maintain that renewable energy was not responsible for the incident, as described in this CNBC article.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have released a plan to cut Medicaid, potentially causing millions of poor Americans to lose health coverage and face higher fees. The proposal, part of a larger bill to enact President Trump’s domestic agenda, aims to reduce federal spending by $912 billion over a decade. The legislation includes work requirements for Medicaid and increased paperwork requirements, which could lead to 8.6 million people becoming uninsured. This New York Times article highlights the divisive nature of the proposal and its potential impact on vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>Wildlife experts are exploring the possibility of reintroducing elk to the UK for the first time in approximately 3,000 years. The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Wildlife Trusts have secured funding to conduct feasibility studies, as elk are considered a "keystone" species that can enhance habitats for other wildlife. One of the challenges is gaining public acceptance for the return of elk, which were hunted to extinction in the Neolithic era. This BBC article highlights the initial steps and considerations for this ambitious rewilding project.</p>
