          <p>Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested by the FBI for allegedly obstructing an immigration arrest operation. The complaint alleges Dugan intentionally misdirected federal agents away from Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, an undocumented immigrant, allowing him to evade arrest. Dugan is charged with obstructing a proceeding and concealing an individual to prevent arrest, facing up to six years in prison if convicted. The arrest has sparked controversy, with Milwaukee's mayor accusing federal agents of a "show of force."</p>
