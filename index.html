          <p>Rice prices in Japan have surged, more than doubling in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, following similar rises in previous months. This spike has prompted the government to release emergency stockpiles in an attempt to moderate prices. Concurrently, Japan's core inflation rate climbed to 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023, exceeding economists' expectations and remaining above the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) 2% target for the 38th consecutive month. While a portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman anticipates a waning of food price pressures in the coming months, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could impact energy prices.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with federal immigration authorities in order to receive transportation funding. The ruling supports a lawsuit brought by 20 states arguing that the administration lacks the legal authority to tie transportation dollars to immigration enforcement. The judge stated that Congress did not authorize the Secretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on federal dollars appropriated for transportation purposes. This decision prevents the administration from withholding critical funds used for maintaining roads, airports, and other infrastructure.</p>

One lawsuit involves athletes who allege their school compared their "Save Girls Sports" T-shirts to swastikas, while another athlete went viral after recounting having to share a locker room with a trans athlete.

The exact depth and protection of the facility, located deep inside a mountain, are not fully known, and the weapon has never been tested in real-world conditions. The expert suggests that even with damage, Iran's knowledge, experience, enriched uranium, and centrifuges in other locations would allow them to resume their nuclear program relatively easily. The International Atomic Energy Agency recently stated that Iran has breached its non-proliferation agreements and is illegally stockpiling enriched uranium.</p>

          <p>Major tech companies are increasingly using machine learning models to create weather forecasts, challenging traditional physics-based computer forecasts. These new models aim to improve accuracy and provide more detailed predictions. However, the effectiveness of these AI-driven forecasts is still being evaluated, as the weather remains a complex and dynamic system to predict. As machine learning becomes more integrated into weather forecasting, it will be important to assess its reliability and compare it to traditional methods.</p>
