          <p>Flamenco, originating from the Roma people of southern Spain, has found a vibrant home in New Mexico, particularly in Albuquerque, which hosts a world-famous flamenco festival and is home to the only American university offering graduate and undergraduate dance degrees with a flamenco emphasis. New Mexico's flamenco scene is unique because it is homegrown, tracing its Hispanic identity back over 400 years, with local artists incorporating their own history and experiences into the art form. The National Institute of Flamenco plays a crucial role in outreach, teaching flamenco in public schools across the state, fostering a deep connection to the art form among young New Mexicans. Flamenco is not just a dance but a means of expression, allowing individuals to release emotions and connect with their cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>As graduation season approaches, Chinese universities are implementing rules to monitor the proportion of AI-generated content in theses, with some using the "AI rate" as a factor in thesis approval to prevent academic misconduct. However, an official publication from China's Ministry of Science and Technology has criticized the use of AI content detectors, labeling it as a form of "technological superstition" due to the potential for false results. The publication highlighted instances where content written by students was incorrectly flagged as AI-generated, even citing an example of a century-old essay being evaluated as significantly AI-generated. This raises concerns about the reliability and fairness of using such tools in academic evaluations.</p>

Japan has proposed joint efforts to strengthen supply chains, expand U.S. farm product imports, and simplify regulations for foreign-made cars.

          <p>Global spirit makers are facing a mix of challenges, including tariffs and changing consumer preferences, leading to revisions in sales targets and increased uncertainty in the market. Rémy Cointreau, following Diageo and Pernod Ricard, withdrew its sales targets due to macroeconomic uncertainty and ongoing U.S.-China tariff policies, citing a significant drop in cognac sales in the U.S. and complex market conditions in China. The specialty drink has been particularly affected by trade tensions, with LVMH also reporting a decline in Hennessy cognac sales. While some spirit brands face declining demand, others, like Guinness, are experiencing growth, indicating shifts in consumer drinking habits.</p>

Despite the criminal allegations, leaders have called for Abrego Garcia to have access to his lawyers and a fair legal process. The Trump administration has been accused of stonewalling court orders in the case, even invoking the state secrets privilege, while continuing to allege Abrego Garcia's involvement with MS-13.</p>

          <p>Arrests for illegal work in the UK have risen sharply, with over 6,400 people arrested in the past year during raids on businesses, a 51% increase from the previous year, as authorities focus on employers exploiting undocumented migrants. Immigration officers have visited over 9,000 businesses, including restaurants, nail bars, and construction sites, to check paperwork and working conditions, often finding migrants subjected to squalid conditions and illegal working hours. The government has also returned nearly 30,000 people who did not have the right to be in the UK, while tightening work visa regulations to combat illegal migration. Recent data indicates that approximately 44,000 people have entered the UK illegally in the year to March 2025, with most arriving via small boat journeys.</p>

          <p>A federal judge approved a landmark $2.8 billion settlement that will allow US colleges to pay athletes directly, marking a significant shift away from the traditional amateur model of college sports. The settlement, stemming from the House v. NCAA case, allows schools to share up to $20.5 million annually with athletes and compensates former players who were previously barred from earning revenue. The agreement is expected to professionalize college athletics, impacting recruitment, program funding, and the NCAA's oversight role, as power shifts towards the major conferences. While some athletes, particularly football and basketball stars, stand to benefit financially, concerns remain about the future of walk-on athletes, Olympic sports, and the potential for further legal challenges.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has approved the House v. NCAA settlement, ushering in a new era for college sports where athletes can be directly paid by their institutions. Starting this fall, top-division NCAA schools can compensate athletes, capped initially at $20.5 million per school, while $2.75 billion will be paid to former athletes who were previously prohibited from earning money. The settlement arose from lawsuits challenging the NCAA's amateurism tradition, which restricted compensation beyond scholarships despite the massive revenues generated by college athletics. This new framework allows schools to decide which athletes to pay, primarily in revenue-generating sports like football and basketball, but it also introduces roster limits and a third-party clearinghouse to review licensing agreements.</p>

          <p>A phone call between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could provide temporary relief for Asian countries caught between the two powers, although it might also complicate their strategies for balancing trade with China and navigating U.S. policies. The call, described as "very positive" by Trump, is seen as a diplomatic breakthrough after escalating tensions between the world's two largest economies. While the call may ease the immediate pressure on China's neighbors, analysts caution that the relationship between the two nations remains fragile.</p>

          <p>Faced with rising public discontent over escalating rice prices and an upcoming national election, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is targeting Japan's entrenched agricultural policies. With rice prices having doubled, Ishiba aims to overhaul the decades-old production adjustment system to counter opposition parties advocating for a consumption tax cut. Despite officially ending the "acreage reduction policy" in 2018, production adjustments persist with subsidies encouraging farmers to grow feed rice instead of rice for human consumption. Ishiba is pursuing a consumer-focused approach by releasing reserve rice to lower prices, but faces challenges including potential oversupply and opposition from agricultural interests.

The delayed aircraft, which were expected to arrive from Brazil in May and are subject to a 10% tariff since April, are crucial for serving routes in the Pacific Northwest, Alaska, California, and western Canada.
