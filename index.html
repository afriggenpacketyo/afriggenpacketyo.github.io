          <p>Asian-Pacific markets displayed mixed performance following a U.S. government shutdown, with investors largely unfazed. Spot gold prices saw a slight increase, reaching a new record. In Japan, the central bank's third-quarter Tankan survey revealed a marginal rise in business optimism among large manufacturers to +14, though it fell short of economists' expectations. The Nikkei 225 and Topix indices experienced declines, reflecting varied regional responses to global economic shifts.</p>

          <p>An undercover BBC investigation revealed widespread poor care and distress at Castlehill, a luxury care home in Inverness, Scotland. A reporter, posing as a cleaner, witnessed residents being denied basic hygiene and left in soiled conditions due to severe understaffing. The report highlighted systemic issues, including a lack of appropriate staff for residents with dementia, leading to a significant loss of dignity for many. This investigation followed numerous upheld complaints against the facility, underscoring a broader crisis in the care sector.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer, the UK Prime Minister, indicated his government would review international law interpretations to address "mass migration," while affirming the UK would not withdraw from existing treaties. His comments follow the Home Secretary's plans to tighten rules for migrants seeking indefinite leave to remain. Starmer specifically mentioned Articles 3 and 8 of the ECHR, as well as UN conventions, as potential barriers to deportation. The article reflects a broader political effort to confront the Reform UK party and its stance on immigration.</p>

The article highlights a broader trend of high-skilled foreign professionals seeking opportunities elsewhere due to U.S. immigration policies.

          <p>A civilian U.S. Department of Navy employee, Malika Brittingham, was charged with falsely reporting an active shooter at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey. She allegedly fabricated the threat to "trauma bond" with her colleagues, from whom she felt ostracized. The hoax led to a base-wide lockdown and significant panic before authorities determined the reports were unfounded. Interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba condemned the act, vowing strict legal action against such fear-mongering.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has shut down due to a failure by lawmakers to agree on a funding bill. Republicans, despite controlling Congress, lacked the 60 Senate votes needed, requiring Democratic support. Democrats insisted on healthcare provisions, including extending tax credits and reversing Medicaid cuts, which Republicans opposed. This stalemate over key policy differences, particularly healthcare, prevented a resolution, leading to the lapse in federal funding and its widespread implications.</p>

Presidents like Reagan and Clinton oversaw multiple shutdowns, often stemming from budget disputes over spending cuts or policy riders. The most recent, in 2018-2019, lasted 34 days and incurred a permanent economic loss of $3 billion. Each shutdown underscores deep partisan divides over federal spending priorities.</p>

          <p>Senator Marco Rubio, on behalf of the United States, issued a message congratulating the people of China on the 76th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The statement, published on the State Department's website, conveyed wishes for health, happiness, prosperity, and peace. This gesture marks a return to traditional diplomatic timing, as last year, amidst heightened tensions, the U.S. extended its congratulations only after the actual date of China's National Day.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has ruled that Sigal Chattah, the top federal prosecutor in Nevada, is not legally serving in her role, marking the second such disqualification of a Trump administration prosecutor. Chattah's temporary appointment as interim U.S. attorney exceeded the 120-day limit, and her subsequent shift to acting U.S. attorney was deemed an illegal maneuver under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. The ruling bars Chattah from supervising cases for four criminal defendants, challenging the Justice Department's appointment practices.</p>

          <p>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has called on the Global Sumud Flotilla, carrying aid to Gaza, to cease its mission, warning it could jeopardize a fragile U.S. peace plan to end the Israel-Hamas war. Meloni expressed concern that the flotilla's attempt to breach the Israeli naval blockade might serve as a pretext to escalate conflict. Despite an Italian naval escort and calls to divert aid to an Israeli port or Cyprus, the flotilla, including Greta Thunberg, affirmed its commitment to continue sailing towards Gaza.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has sued the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, alleging unconstitutional delays in processing concealed carry weapon (CCW) licenses. The DOJ claims the department's average 281-day wait to begin processing applications violates California law, which mandates initial reviews within 90 days. The Sheriff's Department disputes the claim, citing a significant staffing crisis and a transition from a manual to an online system. The lawsuit seeks a permanent injunction to ensure timely issuance of CCW licenses.</p>

          <p>The global coffee industry faces significant challenges from climate change and a dwindling labor force, threatening higher prices and altered flavors for consumers. Land suitable for coffee farming is projected to shrink by 50% by 2050 due to rising temperatures and erratic rainfall. Farmers, often living below the poverty line, struggle to invest in mitigation strategies and face worker shortages as younger generations leave rural areas. Researchers are exploring climate-resilient varieties like stenophylla and robusta to secure the future of coffee production.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County supervisors expressed strong dissatisfaction with a $1.9 million independent report on government failures during January's Eaton wildfires, calling it inadequate. Residents and supervisors alike criticized the report for failing to explain late evacuation alerts and a lack of clear departmental responsibility. The report found no single department took charge of evacuations and warnings were inconsistent. Supervisors approved implementing some recommendations, but acknowledged the report's limitations due to non-cooperation from several fire agencies and its failure to address racial disparities in outcomes.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump shared photos on Truth Social displaying 'Trump 2028' hats on the Resolute Desk during an Oval Office meeting with Democratic leaders, just hours before a government shutdown.

Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, dismissed the stunt, accusing Trump of erratic behavior and prioritizing politics over national stability.</p>

          <p>The White House has withdrawn E.J. Antoni's nomination to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), a decision confirmed by an official without providing a specific reason.

Antoni had previously criticized the BLS and suggested suspending its monthly jobs report, raising concerns about the politicization of economic data.

          <p>A powerful and shallow 6.9 magnitude earthquake struck the central Philippines, resulting in at least 69 deaths and over 140 injuries.
