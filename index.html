          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking 61% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter profit, significantly exceeding analyst expectations. This surge is primarily fueled by sustained high demand for artificial intelligence chips from clients like Nvidia and Apple, with high-performance computing now accounting for 60% of its revenue. The company provided a strong forecast for the upcoming quarter and expects full-year revenue to grow by approximately 30%. Despite this positive outlook, TSMC acknowledges potential headwinds from U.S. tariff policies and global macroeconomic conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rescue teams in the Italian Alps have discovered a body during the search for Matthew Hall, a 33-year-old British hiker who went missing on July 9th. The body was found in a crevice near the Cross of Daloo, a location from which Mr. Hall had sent a photograph to friends on the day he disappeared. Italian police have informed his family, who had traveled to Italy to assist in the search efforts. The recovery operation required a helicopter due to the dangerous terrain where the discovery was made.</p>

          <p>Andre Correa do Lago, the Brazilian diplomat presiding over the next UN climate talks, has highlighted the difficulty of keeping climate change a top global priority amidst ongoing wars, trade disputes, and political shifts. In an interview, he stressed that while other crises demand immediate attention, the threat of climate change continues to escalate, as evidenced by recent extreme weather events worldwide. He also addressed scrutiny over Brazil's own fossil fuel policies, stating the country aims to use oil wealth to accelerate its green transition. The diplomat remains optimistic but acknowledges the complexity of achieving climate goals, especially with the US government's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement.</p>

          <p>A devastating fire broke out late Wednesday at a recently opened shopping mall in the Iraqi city of Kut, resulting in the deaths of at least 61 people, with most victims succumbing to smoke inhalation. The blaze, which engulfed the five-story building that also housed a restaurant and supermarket, left numerous people injured and missing. Authorities have launched an investigation and filed legal cases against the owners, highlighting ongoing concerns about poor building safety standards in the country, which have contributed to similar tragedies in the past.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's labor market is showing signs of weakening, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.7%, its highest level in four years. Simultaneously, the annual rate of pay growth slowed to 5% in the three months to May, according to the Office for National Statistics. These indicators, coupled with a continuous decline in job vacancies, suggest that businesses are reducing hiring, partly in response to increased national insurance contributions. Economists believe this cooling of the jobs market increases the likelihood of the Bank of England cutting interest rates next month to stimulate the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

For the first time since 1896, no Welsh players were named in the matchday 23 for a Test against a major southern hemisphere opponent. This is a dramatic downturn from just a few years ago when Welsh players formed the backbone of the Lions team. The decision has sparked disappointment and concern within Wales, reflecting a period where the national team just ended an 18-match losing streak.</p>

          <p>China's top anti-corruption body, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), is launching a targeted crackdown on the science and technology sector to combat fraud and mismanagement of research funds. The initiative aims to ensure scientific development proceeds "in the right direction" by focusing on high-risk areas like project evaluation and grant allocation. Li Xi, the agency's chief, stated that authorities will resolutely punish those who abuse their power to accept bribes or embezzle research funds. The CCDI also plans to leverage technology like big data and AI to enhance its supervision and detect complex corruption schemes.</p>

The appeal argues that the local health department improperly issued the permit in violation of the Clean Air Act.

          <p>The UK's new Labour government is facing internal criticism after removing the party whip from four MPs and stripping three others of their trade envoy roles for voting against government policy. The disciplinary action followed a rebellion over the two-child benefit cap, with the government aiming to assert its authority and deter future dissent. However, the move has been described as "petty" and "vindictive" by some Labour MPs, who argue it shows weakness and could lower morale within the party. Downing Street maintains the suspensions were for repeatedly organizing against the government, not for a single act of rebellion.</p>

This has led to lawsuits from major record labels over copyright infringement and calls for better regulation and transparency.
