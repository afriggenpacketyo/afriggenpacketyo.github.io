          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James is appealing a court decision that overturned a nearly $500 million penalty against former President Donald Trump and his company. An appellate court had previously voided the fine, citing the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on "excessive fines," though it upheld the ruling that Trump committed business fraud. James is now asking the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, to reinstate the massive financial penalty. The case centers on findings that Trump and his organization fraudulently inflated asset values to secure better financial terms.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Broadcom reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street estimates, largely due to a significant increase in its artificial intelligence-related business. The company's AI revenue grew by 63% to $5.2 billion, and it provided a strong sales forecast for the upcoming quarter, projecting continued growth. This performance reflects high demand for its custom AI chips and networking components used in data centers. Broadcom's stock has seen substantial gains over the past year as investors view it as a key player in the expanding AI market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The New Orleans Saints' social media team responded to comments made by ESPN analyst Ryan Clark, who stated that legendary quarterbacks like Drew Brees, Tom Brady, and Peyton Manning were not "generational talents." Clark made the distinction while discussing rising star Arch Manning, suggesting that players like John Elway and Patrick Mahomes fit the description better. In response, the Saints posted screenshots of NFL records showing Brees, Brady, and Manning as the top three all-time leaders in both passing yards and touchdowns, implicitly challenging Clark's assessment of their historical significance.</p>

The San Francisco 49ers led the league with $176.5 million in net ticket receipts, significantly higher than the league average. Conversely, the Tennessee Titans ranked last with $81.2 million. The report also details how teams contribute 34% of ticket revenue to a shared pool, which is then redistributed to support league operations and stadium financing, highlighting the financial mechanics that underpin the NFL's business model.

          <p>A federal jury has found Google liable for $425.7 million in damages for violating privacy laws by improperly tracking smartphone users' activity. The class-action lawsuit covered approximately 98 million U.S. smartphones between 2016 and 2024, with the verdict concluding that Google spied on users even when they had activated privacy controls. The plaintiffs argued that Google used this illicitly collected data to sell targeted ads, generating billions in revenue. Google has denied the allegations and stated its intention to appeal the decision, maintaining that its privacy tools honor user choices.</p>

However, his tenure is also defined by a lack of on-field success, with only one major trophy won during his time in charge, leading to frequent fan protests.

          <p>The "$1,000 a month rule" is a financial guideline designed to help individuals calculate how much they need to save to generate a specific monthly income in retirement. Based on the 4% withdrawal rule, it suggests that a person needs between $240,000 and $300,000 in savings for every $1,000 of desired monthly income. This simplifies retirement planning by turning abstract savings goals into concrete targets based on expected lifestyle expenses. The article emphasizes that while not a perfect formula, it serves as a valuable tool for motivating early and consistent saving. (not investment advice)</p>
