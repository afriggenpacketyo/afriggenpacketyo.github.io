          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, is forecast to move up the U.S. East Coast without making direct landfall. As a powerful Category 4 storm with winds of 140 mph, it poses a significant threat of life-threatening surf and dangerous rip currents from Florida to the Northeast. While the storm's center is expected to remain offshore, its large size will generate hazardous coastal conditions, with areas like North Carolina's Outer Banks facing potential flooding and evacuations. Forecasters warn that Erin will likely remain a major hurricane through the middle of the week.</p>

Most major retailers like Target and Walmart will remain open, while Costco, government offices, banks, and the U.S. Postal Service will be closed.

Thousands of users reported service interruptions on the Downdetector website, although SpaceX has not yet commented on the cause. The previous outage was attributed to a failure in key internal software services. This disruption occurred as SpaceX continues to expand its satellite constellation, which currently includes over 7,000 operational units providing internet to more than six million users globally.</p>

The atmosphere was reportedly less tense than their previous encounter, with the discussion focused on finding a path to peace in Ukraine. The article suggests the presence of European leaders from the UK, France, Germany, and others served as an intervention to keep the talks on track and prevent a one-sided deal. Trump boasted of his peacemaking abilities while Zelenskyy navigated the delicate diplomatic situation, emerging without any major diplomatic incidents.</p>

          <p>Iran is on the brink of a severe water crisis, with officials warning that millions of residents could face water shortages within weeks. The situation is attributed to a combination of a prolonged drought, extreme summer heat, and governmental mismanagement of the country's dam systems. This convergence of environmental and administrative failures has left water levels dangerously low. The impending crisis poses a significant threat to the daily lives and stability of the Iranian population.</p>

          <p>Leaked audio recordings have revealed that Aharon Haliva, Israel's former chief of military intelligence, stated that 50,000 deaths in Gaza were "necessary and required for future generations." In the remarks, aired by Israel's Channel 12 TV, Haliva also suggested that for every Israeli killed on October 7, 50 Palestinians should die, regardless of whether they are children. This is the first time a senior Israeli military figure has been recorded endorsing such a high death toll as a strategic message. Haliva resigned in April 2024 over the intelligence failures that led to the Hamas attack.</p>

          <p>California is experiencing a significant surge in Valley fever cases, with health officials warning that 2025 totals are on pace to exceed last year's record high. The infection, caused by breathing in fungal spores from the soil, is most prevalent in Southern California and Arizona. Symptoms can mimic COVID-19 and range from mild fatigue to severe respiratory illness. Health experts attribute the increase partly to environmental conditions like drought followed by rain, which promotes fungal growth. Certain groups, including older adults and the immunocompromised, are at higher risk of severe illness.</p>

          <p>Texas health officials have declared an end to the state's largest measles outbreak in over 30 years, which infected 762 people and led to the deaths of two unvaccinated children. The outbreak was declared over after 42 days passed without a new case being reported. The containment effort involved extensive testing, vaccination drives, and public education campaigns. Despite this success, officials remain vigilant due to ongoing outbreaks elsewhere in the U.S., which have been fueled by declining vaccination rates and a record number of non-medical vaccine exemptions for schoolchildren.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While there are no federal age limits for purchasing annuities, individual insurance companies often set their own caps, typically between 80 and 85 years old for immediate annuities. These limits are based on risk assessment, as the buyer's age and life expectancy are key factors in determining payouts. The article explains that the best age to buy an annuity depends on individual retirement strategy rather than a specific number. Purchasing in one's late 50s or 60s allows for potential growth, while buying later in life can result in higher monthly payments.</p>

          <p>Conservative network Newsmax will pay $67 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems over the airing of false claims about the 2020 presidential election. The settlement avoids a trial where a jury would have determined if Newsmax acted with malice. This follows a similar, larger settlement between Fox News and Dominion in 2023. Despite the payment, Newsmax maintained in a statement that its coverage was "fair, balanced, and conducted within professional standards," and did not issue an apology for broadcasting the conspiracy theories.</p>

          <p>An analysis of international support for Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion shows that while the U.S. is the largest single donor, Europe as a whole has committed more aid. According to the Kiel Institute, European nations and EU institutions have collectively spent $165.7 billion, compared to $130.6 billion from the United States. The article addresses past claims by President Trump about the disparity in spending, concluding the figures he cited were not supported by evidence. It also clarifies that both the U.S. and Europe have provided a mix of grants and loans to Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Bournemouth has completed the signing of 19-year-old winger Ben Doak from Liverpool for an initial fee of £20 million, with an additional £5 million in potential add-ons. Doak, a Scottish international, has signed a five-year contract, seeking more regular first-team football than he was getting at Liverpool. The transfer is part of a busy summer for both clubs, with Liverpool having generated significant revenue from player sales. Doak spent last season on loan at Middlesbrough, where he impressed with three goals and seven assists in the Championship.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has issued an urgent warning about counterfeit Labubu dolls, which pose a serious choking risk to young children. These knockoffs, sometimes called "Lafufus," are often poorly made and can break into small parts or are small enough to be swallowed whole. The popular dolls, created by artist Kasing Lung, are sold officially by Pop Mart. The CPSC advises consumers to avoid deeply discounted dolls and to look for authenticating marks like a holographic sticker and a specific number of teeth to avoid dangerous fakes.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has stated his opinion that the artificial intelligence market is currently in an investment bubble, characterized by investors being "overexcited about a kernel of truth." While he affirmed that AI is a profoundly important technological shift, he compared the current investor enthusiasm to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. His comments align with growing concerns from other experts that investment in AI is outpacing fundamentals. Despite these concerns, OpenAI is reportedly preparing for a secondary stock sale that would value the company at around $500 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

In a briefing with reporters, he cautioned that the U.S.-China AI race is not a simple matter of which country is ahead, as China may have advantages in areas like building inference capacity. Altman also voiced skepticism about the long-term effectiveness of export controls on semiconductors as a sole strategy to curb China's ambitions. He noted that competition from Chinese open-source models was a factor in OpenAI's recent decision to release its own open-weight models.</p>

          <p>Southern California is bracing for what forecasters are calling the most significant and dangerous heat wave of the summer, with triple-digit temperatures expected to last for several days. An extreme heat watch has been issued for much of the region, with inland areas like Woodland Hills potentially reaching 108 degrees. The heat, combined with low humidity, will create critical fire weather conditions, elevating the risk of explosive fire behavior. Officials are urging residents to stay hydrated, seek air conditioning, and avoid outdoor activities during peak heat to prevent heat-related illnesses.</p>
