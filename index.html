          <p>A tragic bus crash in western Afghanistan has resulted in the deaths of over 50 people, primarily Afghan nationals recently deported from Iran. The bus, en route to Kabul, collided first with a motorcycle and then with a fuel truck, causing it to erupt in flames. This incident occurs as a large number of Afghans are returning from Iran and Pakistan, many forcibly, amid ongoing humanitarian crises in their home country. According to the UN, over 1.2 million Afghans have been returned from neighboring countries this year alone.</p>

          <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has released new guidance recommending the Covid-19 vaccine for children as young as six months, a stance that conflicts with the current federal advisory. The Trump administration's health agencies have shifted to a "shared clinical decision-making" model for pediatric vaccination, a move the AAP suggests was influenced by vaccine misinformation. This divergence has sparked a political clash, with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. accusing the AAP of having corporate conflicts of interest, while the AAP maintains its recommendations are based on science to protect children from severe illness.</p>

          <p>As Hurricane Erin moves north in the Atlantic, forecasters are warning of life-threatening rip currents and potential coastal flooding for the U.S. East Coast, from Florida to New England. Although the storm is not expected to make landfall, its large size is generating dangerous sea conditions, leading to mandatory evacuations on North Carolina's Outer Banks. The Category 2 hurricane, which previously caused power outages in Puerto Rico, has prompted states of emergency and swimming bans in several coastal areas to ensure public safety.</p>

His deportation was confirmed by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. Chávez Jr. has a history of legal troubles and substance abuse issues that have long overshadowed his boxing career.</p>

          <p>Texas State Representative Nicole Collier, a Democrat, has filed a court petition alleging she is being illegally confined within the state Capitol. Collier, who is protesting a Republican-led redistricting plan, refused a state police escort intended to ensure her presence for a legislative session and claims she was told she would be arrested if she left the building. Her legal team argues that while lawmakers can be compelled to attend a session if absent, there is no legal basis to detain a legislator who is already present, escalating the political battle over the new congressional maps.</p>

          <p>Rangers FC faced a significant setback in their Champions League aspirations with a 3-1 home defeat to Club Brugge, leaving their qualification hopes in jeopardy. The Belgian side scored three goals within the first 20 minutes, exposing severe defensive vulnerabilities in Russell Martin's team that drew audible frustration from the Ibrox crowd. Despite a second-half goal, the performance highlighted the team's lack of defensive discipline. The result places immense pressure on Martin ahead of the second leg in Belgium and a challenging series of upcoming domestic fixtures.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that an executive order is being drafted to eliminate mail-in voting ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, claiming the method is corrupt. However, legal experts assert that the president lacks the constitutional authority to dictate how states conduct their elections. The U.S. Constitution grants state legislatures the power to determine the "times, places and manner" of holding elections, with a secondary role for Congress, not the executive branch. This move follows Trump's long-standing, unproven claims of fraud associated with mail-in ballots, which were widely used in the 2020 and 2024 elections.</p>

          <p>NASA has announced the discovery of a new, tiny moon orbiting the planet Uranus, identified by the James Webb Space Telescope. Currently designated S/2025 U1, the satellite is approximately six miles in diameter, making it one of the smallest of the planet's 29 known moons. Researchers believe its small size is why it eluded previous detection, even by the Voyager 2 spacecraft during its 1986 flyby. The discovery suggests that more small moons may exist within Uranus's complex system of rings and satellites, offering new insights into the ice giant's chaotic history.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has significantly broadened its 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum to encompass 407 additional product categories, including items like machinery, fire extinguishers, and construction materials. This expansion, which took effect this week, is intended to close loopholes and prevent circumvention of the original levies, supporting domestic industries. The move dramatically increases the scope of the trade policy, with one expert estimating that the tariffs now affect at least $320 billion worth of imports, up from a previous estimate of $190 billion.

          <p>Samuel Kangethe, a Kenyan national who has lived in the U.S. for 16 years, has chosen to return to Kenya rather than risk being detained by ICE.

His case highlights the difficult choices faced by some immigrants, as he leaves behind his family and career to avoid the possibility of being sent to a detention center while his case awaits a hearing scheduled for 2026.</p>

          <p>Shares of Home Depot increased by 3% after the retailer maintained its full-year financial outlook, projecting about 1% growth in comparable sales. This reassurance came even as the company's second-quarter earnings and revenue fell slightly short of Wall Street's expectations for the first time since 2014. The company noted that while many homeowners are still deferring large projects due to economic uncertainty, it saw growing momentum in big-ticket transactions and sales gains across most of its merchandising departments throughout the quarter.

          <p>Following high-profile summits with Vladimir Putin in Alaska and European leaders with Volodymyr Zelensky in Washington, President Trump's push to end the war in Ukraine faces significant hurdles. While the meetings were conducted cooperatively, they yielded few concrete breakthroughs. Trump has expressed openness to U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine and is arranging a potential bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelensky. However, it remains unclear if Putin genuinely seeks a deal, and Trump's own mercurial diplomatic style creates uncertainty about the long-term stability of any American commitments.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has instructed his legal team to challenge what he terms "woke" content in museums across the country, specifically naming the Smithsonian Institution. In a social media post, Trump criticized museums for focusing on negative aspects of American history, such as slavery, rather than celebrating success and brightness. He stated his administration would use the same playbook it has employed against colleges and universities, which has involved threatening to withhold federal funding to force changes, suggesting a new front in the culture war over institutional narratives.</p>
