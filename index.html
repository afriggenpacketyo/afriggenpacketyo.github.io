          <p>The New York Times reviewed a guest list and social media posts to identify attendees at President Trump's private dinner for cryptocurrency business customers and a subsequent White House tour. Invitees included Justin Sun, a Chinese crypto billionaire sued by the SEC, and Elliot Berke, a lawyer for Justice Clarence Thomas, among others. The dinner, held at Trump's Virginia golf club, allowed the president to leverage his position for financial gain, raising ethical questions. Some attendees were later given a tour of the White House, further blurring the lines between official duties and private business ventures.</p>

          <p>A misplaced antenna caused military air traffic controllers to lose contact with a Black Hawk helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, leading to two commercial planes performing go-arounds. Brig. Gen. Matthew Braman stated that the FAA received 'inconclusive' data due to the antenna's incorrect placement, causing confusion. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy expressed frustration, emphasizing the importance of safety after a recent fatal midair collision. The FAA is working to modernize air traffic systems to prevent future incidents, and the NTSB is investigating the May 1 event.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered significant reductions to the White House National Security Council, resulting in numerous policy experts being dismissed abruptly. The goal is to streamline operations and eliminate redundancy, shifting responsibilities back to departments and agencies. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been effectively running the NSC, and Vice President JD Vance's national security advisor Andy Baker is taking a top role in the restructured NSC. This move aims to align the NSC more closely with Trump's policy preferences, reducing the influence of dissenting voices.</p>

          <p>The use of facial recognition technology by a private organization, Project N.O.L.A., in the search for escaped inmates in New Orleans has ignited controversy. While authorities credit the technology with aiding in the recapture of one fugitive, civil rights groups and politicians raise concerns about privacy and constitutional issues. The ACLU argues that live facial recognition poses a threat to fundamental rights, while some Republicans and Democrats in Congress seek to curtail its use. The New Orleans Police Department has paused automated alerts from Project N.O.L.A. until its use meets legal requirements.</p>
