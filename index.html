          <p>Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. stated he is perplexed by Beijing's warning that his country is "playing with fire" regarding its stance on Taiwan. Marcos Jr. reiterated his position that a conflict over Taiwan would inevitably involve the Philippines due to its geographic proximity to the island. He emphasized that his statements were based on practical, geographical facts and that the Philippines does not seek confrontation. The president's remarks highlight the escalating tensions and delicate diplomatic situation in the region.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has demanded the immediate removal of homeless people from Washington D.C., vowing to make the capital safer and more beautiful. He announced a plan to provide alternative places for them to stay far from the city center, while also promising to jail criminals. This move follows an order to deploy federal law enforcement to the city to address what he terms an out-of-control crime situation. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has pushed back, stating that violent crime has actually been driven down significantly.</p>

          <p>Motorists in England and Wales over the age of 70 could face driving bans if they fail compulsory eye tests under proposed new driving laws. The plan is part of a broader road safety strategy that also includes lowering the drink-driving limit and adding penalty points for unbelted passengers. The initiative follows a coroner's report that criticized the UK's current self-reporting system for vision problems as the "laxest in Europe." The government aims to reduce the 1,600 annual road deaths and thousands of serious injuries.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike near Gaza City's Shifa Hospital resulted in the deaths of several individuals, including Al Jazeera correspondents Anas al-Sharif and Mohamed Qureiqa. The Israeli military later claimed al-Sharif was a Hamas operative, an allegation the network and the journalist had previously denied. This incident adds to what press freedom advocates describe as the deadliest conflict for journalists in modern times, with Al Jazeera calling the strike a "targeted assassination." The deaths have been condemned by international media organizations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the key factors to consider when choosing sunscreen, such as the Sun Protection Factor (SPF) and star ratings. SPF indicates the level of protection against UVB rays, which cause sunburn, with an SPF of 30 being recommended by dermatologists. The star rating system measures protection against UVA rays, which are associated with skin aging and cancer. For optimal protection, consumers should look for a product with both a high SPF and a high star rating, and reapply it every two hours.</p>

          <p>London police arrested 532 people during a protest where demonstrators intentionally showed support for Palestine Action, a group recently outlawed as a terrorist organization. The protest was a deliberate test of the government's ability to enforce the ban, with many arrested for displaying placards supporting the group. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defended the ban, stating the organization was proscribed for committing serious violent attacks and extensive criminal damage. The arrests highlight the ongoing tensions surrounding freedom of expression and anti-terror legislation in the UK.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the last two seasons, all three clubs promoted from the Championship to the Premier League have been immediately relegated, a pattern not seen since 1997-98. This article analyzes the statistical challenges facing newly promoted teams like Burnley, Leeds, and Sunderland. Financial disparities are a key factor, as Profit and Sustainability Rules allow established Premier League clubs to incur significantly larger losses than newcomers. A strong start is crucial, as historical data shows that promoted teams with 11 or more points after 10 games almost always survive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Scottish government has announced special legal protection for the remains of German High Seas Fleet warships in Scapa Bay, Orkney, by designating them as a historic Marine Protected Area (MPA). The fleet was deliberately scuttled by its own crews in 1919 at the end of World War One. This new status makes it a criminal offense to remove any items from the popular dive sites, which were previously vulnerable to looting. The move aims to preserve this significant underwater heritage for future generations.</p>

          <p>The annual Perseids meteor shower, one of the year's best celestial shows, is set to peak this week, but viewing conditions will be challenging. A bright, 84% full waning gibbous moon will coincide with the peak on August 12-13, expected to reduce visibility by at least 75%. Instead of the usual 50 or more meteors per hour seen under dark skies, viewers can expect to see only 10-20. Experts suggest that the best viewing might be a week after the peak when the sky is darker.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A deep dive into the Lucy Letby case reveals significant debate and potential flaws in the medical evidence presented by both the prosecution and the defense. For instance, in the case of Baby O, alternative theories for the infant's death, such as accidental needle injury during resuscitation or birth trauma, have been proposed by defense experts but are contested by others. Similarly, the evidence for insulin poisoning in other babies is challenged. This complexity underscores the difficulty in reaching a definitive conclusion and fuels the ongoing debate over Letby's conviction.</p>

          <p>A Chinese state media outlet has labeled Nvidia's H20 AI chip as unsafe, urging a boycott by Chinese consumers due to alleged security vulnerabilities. The commentary claims the chip, designed specifically for the Chinese market, could contain "back doors" allowing for remote control, despite Nvidia's strong denials. This growing distrust follows reports of a deal where Nvidia would pay the U.S. government a percentage of its China sales revenue. The outlet cited past U.S. government efforts to implement surveillance through hardware as a reason for concern.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's company, Tesla, has formally applied for a license to supply electricity directly to households and businesses in the United Kingdom. If approved by the energy regulator Ofgem, this would position Tesla to compete with established UK energy firms. The company, known for its electric vehicles, also develops solar energy and battery storage solutions and already operates a similar electricity supply service in Texas. This move comes as Tesla faces a significant sales slump for its electric cars across Europe.</p>
