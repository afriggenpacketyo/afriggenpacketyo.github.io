        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has detailed proposed changes to the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and Universal Credit (UC) systems, which it estimates will save Â£5 billion annually by 2030. The reforms would tighten eligibility for PIP's daily living component, affecting an estimated 800,000 people by requiring a higher score in a single activity area. For Universal Credit, the incapacity top-up will be frozen for existing claimants and reduced for new ones, with eligibility starting at age 22. These changes have sparked a significant backlash from over 120 Labour MPs who are calling for the bill to be scrapped due to its potential financial impact on millions of disabled individuals and their families.</p>

          <p>The recent murder of a teenage TikTok star in Pakistan has intensified concerns over the safety of women who are public figures on social media. Many female content creators in the country report that online stalking and harassment frequently escalate into real-world threats and violence, including threats of sexual assault and death. Activists argue that these dangers are rooted in patriarchal norms that view women's public self-expression as a threat to cultural and religious values, often leading to a lack of effective support from social media platforms. Despite the risks, many women continue to use these platforms to advocate for issues like mental health and domestic violence awareness.</p>

          <p>Health alerts, including an amber warning for London and southern England, have been issued as the country anticipates a second heatwave. Temperatures are expected to reach the low 30s Celsius over the weekend, potentially hitting a new high for the year of 35-36Â°C on Monday, coinciding with the start of Wimbledon. The heatwave, defined as three consecutive days above a certain temperature threshold, is expected to last four to six days. Health officials warn that the heat could affect the entire population, with the elderly and vulnerable being at particular risk, and may strain health services.</p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL), the world's largest electric vehicle battery manufacturer and a key Tesla supplier, is aggressively expanding its international operations. Following a major IPO in Hong Kong, the company is investing heavily in new factories in Europe, including a significant plant in Hungary, to complement its existing German facility. Driven by intense price wars and market saturation in China, CATL also plans to introduce its battery-swapping technology to the European market. This move could address key EV adoption barriers like charging speed and battery longevity, though it faces challenges related to infrastructure costs and lack of standardization among automakers.</p>

          <p>A coalition of sports stars and entertainers, including Mike Tyson and Kevin Durant, has sent a letter to the White House urging President Trump to implement significant cannabis reform. The group's requests focus on three main areas: granting clemency for individuals with nonviolent federal marijuana offenses, reclassifying cannabis from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance, and ending discriminatory banking practices against legal cannabis businesses. The letter argues that current policies are outdated, economically harmful, and create unfair barriers for an industry that employs hundreds of thousands of Americans. It highlights the need for federal law to align with the growing number of states where cannabis is legal.</p>

          <p>German federal prosecutors have charged a Syrian national for allegedly supporting a foiled terrorist plot to attack Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna, Austria, last year. The plot's discovery led to the cancellation of three concerts and the arrest of three other individuals in Austria. The suspect, identified as Mohammad A., is accused of supporting the Islamic State group by helping the primary plotter in Austria. His alleged assistance included translating bomb-making instructions from Arabic and facilitating contact with an IS member. The Berlin court will now decide whether to proceed with a trial against the suspect, who is not currently in custody.</p>

          <p>An Idaho judge has ruled that the trial for Bryan Kohberger, accused of the 2022 stabbing deaths of four university students, will proceed this summer with jury selection beginning in August. The judge rejected the defense's request to delay the trial and also denied their motion to introduce theories about four potential "alternate perpetrators." The court found the evidence for these alternate suspects to be irrelevant and based on "rank speculation," noting that none of them had DNA matching samples from the crime scene. Kohberger faces four counts of murder, and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty in the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>A jury has found Habibur Masum guilty of murdering his wife, Kulsuma Akter, in a brutal knife attack in Bradford, UK. Masum stabbed Ms. Akter over 25 times as she was pushing their seven-month-old son in a pram in a public street. The court heard that Ms. Akter had been living in a women's refuge after Masum had previously threatened her with a knife, and he had tracked her location to carry out the attack. After the murder, Masum fled nearly 200 miles before being arrested days later following a nationwide manhunt. He was also convicted of stalking and making a threat to kill.</p>

The fierce price competition in the auto industry is eroding profit margins, signaling a potential market consolidation. Experts at the forum noted that China's era of export-led growth is ending, emphasizing the urgent need to stimulate internal consumption to sustain the economy amidst ongoing over-investment and excess production challenges.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has made significant concessions on its controversial welfare reform bill to avoid a parliamentary defeat. Facing a rebellion from over 100 of its own MPs, the government announced that planned cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and the health element of Universal Credit will now only apply to future claimants, not existing ones. While the move has satisfied the lead rebels, ensuring the bill will likely pass, some Labour MPs have vowed to vote against it anyway, citing concerns about creating a two-tier system for disabled people. The U-turn complicates the government's financial plans, which had factored in savings from the original proposals.</p>

Shiraishi, dubbed the "Twitter killer," was found guilty of murdering, dismembering, and storing the bodies of his victims in his apartment near Tokyo. The victims were young people, mostly women, who had expressed suicidal thoughts on social media, whom Shiraishi lured with promises of helping them die. His death sentence was finalized in 2021 after he withdrew an appeal, concluding a case that shocked the nation and sparked debate about online safety and mental health support.</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan offered a stark critique of her party, describing it as a "solar system with no sun" due to its internal divisions and lack of teamwork. In a speech, she argued the party is split between those who see a second Trump administration as an existential threat and those who view it as survivable, which prevents a unified strategy. Slotkin urged Democrats to refocus on fundamental "pocketbook" issues affecting the shrinking middle class, such as creating better jobs, affordable housing, and accessible education. She asserted that addressing economic insecurity is the key to preventing the social and political polarization that threatens American democracy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is implementing a new rule that removes the 30-day warning period before levying fines on individuals in the U.S. illegally. According to the rule from the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, the government can now immediately begin fining people for offenses such as illegal entry or ignoring a removal order. The fines can be as high as $1,000 per day for failing to comply with a deportation order. This policy revives and streamlines a practice from Trump's first term that had been halted by the Biden administration, aiming to create stronger consequences for violating immigration laws.</p>

          <p>A new report from Coldwell Banker reveals a split in the luxury real estate market, driven by economic uncertainty and high interest rates. The ultra-wealthy, those worth over $30 million, are increasingly making all-cash purchases and are less deterred by market volatility. In contrast, the merely affluent are more sensitive to borrowing costs and are proceeding with more caution. The report, based on a survey of luxury property agents, notes that while over half of agents have seen a rise in cash deals, overall luxury home sales dipped in May. Buyers at all luxury price points have also become more discerning, demanding high-end amenities and move-in ready conditions.</p>

This resonates with a fed-up electorate that feels both major parties have failed to address their financial struggles. The win suggests that authenticity and a willingness to challenge the status quo are becoming more valuable to voters than traditional party loyalty.</p>

          <p>Following significant pressure from health experts, advocacy organizations, and Democratic lawmakers, the Trump administration has reversed its decision to freeze federal funding for HIV prevention and surveillance programs. The CDC notified the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health that its nearly $20 million in funding has been restored for the current year. Critics had warned that the proposed cuts were reckless and would lead to a dangerous spike in new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths. While the immediate funding is secure, advocates remain concerned as the President's budget for the next fiscal year proposes to eliminate this funding entirely.</p>
