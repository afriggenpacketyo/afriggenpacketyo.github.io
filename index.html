          <p>A 39-year-old man undergoing cancer treatment shared on Reddit that he declined to travel with his brother's family, including his two picky-eating children, on a celebratory post-treatment trip to Asia. The man, wanting to experience the local food culture, felt that the children's limited diet of "beige foods" would hinder his ability to fully enjoy the trip. While he loves his niece and nephew, he expressed his desire for a unique and affordable experience focused on culinary exploration. The brother was reportedly frustrated, but the majority of Reddit users supported the man's decision, emphasizing the importance of his personal fulfillment after battling cancer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. crude oil futures experienced a significant drop of over 4% after OPEC+ members agreed to increase oil production for the month of June, marking the second consecutive month of production surges. The decision, led by Saudi Arabia, involves an additional 411,000 barrels per day in June, nearly tripling earlier forecasts by Goldman Sachs. This increase, totaling over 800,000 bpd over two months, comes amid concerns about a potential oversupply in the oil market and fears of a recession due to rising tariffs. Oilfield service firms anticipate reduced investment in exploration and production, as major oil companies reported lower first-quarter earnings due to weaker oil prices. </p>

The suspects were allegedly part of a group spreading hate speech against the LGBTQ community and seeking to recruit teenagers for attacks using Molotov cocktails and improvised explosives. The police worked with the Justice Ministry to disrupt the plan, which they described as a "collective challenge" to gain notoriety on social media. Lady Gaga's team stated they were unaware of any safety concerns prior to or during the concert, which was funded by the city to revitalize the economy.</p>

          <p>Rory Truex, a China expert at Princeton University, discusses the evolution of Donald Trump's China policy, noting a shift from a potentially amicable relationship to a trade war involving aggressive rhetoric and tariffs. Truex initially suggested Trump's administration was "relatively easy" on China, but now acknowledges the escalation. He views Trump as a "proto autocrat" who initially might have sought closer ties with authoritarian leaders like Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. However, the current aggressive stance suggests Trump is using tariffs as a bargaining tactic rather than seeking a broader reset of the relationship.</p>

          <p>The bodies of 13 security guards kidnapped from La Poderosa, a major Peruvian gold mine, were discovered after an ambush allegedly by informal miners linked to criminal gangs. La Poderosa reports that 39 of its workers have been killed since 1980 due to ongoing conflicts over control of the mine in Pataz. The company criticized the ineffectiveness of the state of emergency declaration and police presence in halting the violence. Relatives of the victims are demanding justice, while mining remains a crucial economic sector in Peru, complicated by the presence of both legal and illegal mining operations.</p>

          <p>Marvel Studios' Thunderbolts* debuted at the top of the US box office with $76 million in domestic ticket sales, marking a respectable start to the summer movie season. While falling short of Marvel's typically massive launches, the film's positive reviews and audience reception suggest strong potential for continued success. The movie, featuring a team of antihero rejects, is seen as a possible "reset" for Marvel, which has struggled to consistently recapture its previous box office dominance. The film added $86.1 million in overseas sales and teases the next MCU chapter, The Fantastic Four: First Steps.</p>

Home-schooled students will receive $2,000 annually. Democrats argue the legislation will harm public schools by diverting funds to wealthier students already in private education.

          <p>The 80th anniversary of the liberation of Dachau concentration camp was commemorated, underscoring the urgency of remembrance as survivors and liberators pass away and the far-right gains prominence in Germany. At the memorial ceremony, Lockered Gahs, a 100-year-old U.S. Army veteran, shared his experience of liberating the camp, while other survivors expressed concerns about rising nationalism and antisemitism. The anniversary occurs amid a shift in the U.S.-German relationship, with some American leaders expressing support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The article highlights the increasing threats to liberal democracy and the importance of preserving the memory of the Holocaust.</p>

          <h2>Expiration of Trade Loophole Set to Increase Prices for Consumers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The expiration of a de minimis tariff exemption is expected to significantly impact consumers, as cheaper goods from China become more expensive. The loophole, which allowed packages worth up to $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, has been a key factor for ultra-low-cost retailers like Shein and Temu. With the end of the exemption, many goods will be subject to new tariffs, potentially leading to higher prices and reduced variety for consumers. Additionally, the increased volume of packages requiring inspection could cause substantial delays in shipments, posing administrative challenges for U.S. Customs and Border Protection.</p>

          <p>California's high-speed rail project, initially approved in 2008, faces significant delays and tripled costs, raising questions about the state's ability to undertake large-scale infrastructure projects. The project, intended to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco, is now focused on a 171-mile stretch between Bakersfield and Merced. An eminent-domain lawyer disputes claims that acquiring private property is the main cause of delays, citing various challenges including third-party agreements, permitting requirements, and lack of full funding. The project has significantly impacted farmers in the Central Valley, disrupting agricultural operations and dividing farmland.</p>

She emphasized that while PBS receives 15% of its funding from the federal government, some stations in smaller communities rely on it for up to 50% of their funding, making the cuts existential.</p>
