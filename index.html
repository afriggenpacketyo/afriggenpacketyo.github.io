          <h2>Infected Blood Scandal Victims Face Further Harm Due to Compensation Delays</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 08:39:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thousands of victims of the UK's infected blood scandal are experiencing continued suffering due to prolonged waits for compensation, according to a new report by public inquiry chair Sir Brian Langstaff. The report criticizes the compensation scheme's design, highlighting "obvious injustices" and the slow pace of payments, with only 460 of an estimated 30,000 infected individuals and their families having received full compensation. Sir Brian emphasized that authorities knew compensation was inevitable for years but failed to act swiftly, urging urgent reforms to allow direct applications and prioritize the seriously ill. This article underscores the ongoing systemic failures compounding the trauma for those affected by contaminated blood products in the 1970s and 80s.</p>

          <p>The European Union remains in a state of uncertainty regarding a potential trade agreement with the United States, as a self-imposed July 9 deadline for a framework deal has passed. Despite the missed deadline, President Trump suggested an agreement or tariff decision could still be reached this week, indicating an improved tone in communications between Washington and Brussels. The EU broadly anticipates a 10% baseline tariff, hoping to negotiate specific sector exemptions, while the US Commerce Secretary hinted at significant offers from the EU to open markets.

          <p>A public inquiry into the July 2024 Southport attack heard harrowing testimony from the mother of a seven-year-old survivor, referred to as C1, who "fought like hell" to protect herself and other children. C1, who sustained 33 stab wounds, shielded peers and urged them to flee, actions her mother believes saved lives, despite the absence of adults in the initial moments. The inquiry, which has adjourned until September, continues to investigate the circumstances of the attack by 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana and wider issues surrounding extreme violence. This article highlights the remarkable courage of young victims in the face of extreme danger.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration secured a legal victory as a federal judge denied a preliminary injunction against the Department of Justice's decision to rescind nearly $800 million in grants for violence reduction and crime victim programs. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, while calling the DOJ's actions "shameful" and likely harmful to vulnerable communities, ultimately ruled that the court lacked jurisdiction. The DOJ stated the cancellations were part of a priority shift towards direct law enforcement support and combating violent crime. This article details the legal outcome and its significant impact on numerous community programs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Middle East is undergoing a "quiet revolution" as fertility rates have dramatically fallen over the past two to three decades, with some countries now below population replacement levels. Experts attribute this decline to a combination of economic factors, such as war, political uncertainty, inflation, and the rising cost of marriage and children, alongside social and cultural shifts. Increased access to contraception, higher female education and labor force participation, and urbanization are also contributing factors. This article explores the complex reasons behind this demographic shift and its potential long-term implications for the region's social safety nets and economic future.</p>

          <p>Flash flooding from torrential rain in Ruidoso, New Mexico, has tragically killed at least three people, including a four-year-old girl, a seven-year-old boy, and a man in his 40s or 50s. The Rio Ruidoso swelled to a record 20 feet, and a video captured a house being carried downstream by the fast-moving water. The area, previously devastated by wildfires, is highly susceptible to flooding due to unstable, burned soil.

          <p>A recent drop in mortgage interest rates has spurred a significant 9.4% increase in total mortgage application volume last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The average contract interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.77%, its lowest level in three months, leading to a 9% rise in both refinance and purchase applications. This surge in demand is attributed to increasing housing inventory and moderating home-price growth.

          <p>Latin America is experiencing a significant shift towards the political right, driven by a confluence of factors including the crisis of traditional political parties, persistent inequality, and the rise of "anti-politicians." This article argues that the market-centered model imposed after the 20th century, coupled with exacerbated inequality post-2016 and during the pandemic, has delegitimized democracy. The radicalization of political projects, social media polarization, and "lawfare" further contribute to this trend, with the re-election of Donald Trump amplifying the global far-right influence in the region. This article calls for a new solidarity-based development model to counter the threat of a "fascist abyss."</p>
