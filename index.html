          <p>President Trump has threatened the European Union with a 50% tariff on goods starting June 1, citing a lack of progress in trade negotiations. The EU is weighing its options, with some members pushing for bilateral deals while others advocate for a unified front against Trump's demands. Despite the tension, some analysts believe economic pressures will prevent Trump from pushing Brussels too far, while others think that the EU offer is not enough to satisfy Trump's demands. The EU has threatened new tariffs on $107 billion of US goods in response to Trump's earlier tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that affordable credit card interest rates are unlikely to return soon, potentially remaining elevated into 2026. The Federal Reserve's cautious stance on interest rate cuts, coupled with rising consumer debt and delinquency rates, contribute to this forecast. While a Fed rate cut could help, lenders are also weighing default risks and operating margins before lowering APRs. Consumers are advised to explore debt repayment strategies and hardship programs to manage their balances amid the high-rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A tax and policy bill passed by House Republicans would significantly hinder the electric vehicle (EV) industry by repealing critical subsidies. The measure targets subsidies for battery manufacturing, individual and business EV purchases, and charging stations, while also imposing a new annual fee on EV owners. Analysts predict this could slow EV sales and production in the United States, widening the gap with China and Europe.

However, using HELOCs for non-essential items like vacations or pools is discouraged due to the risk of long-term debt and the potential for foreclosure.
