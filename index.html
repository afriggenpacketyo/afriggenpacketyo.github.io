          <p>A Maltese court found Robert Agius and Jamie Vella guilty of supplying the explosives used in the 2017 assassination of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was known for reporting on government corruption. The journalist's family expressed that the verdict brought them closer to justice, but noted that institutional failures enabling her murder remain unaddressed. Agius and Vella are expected to be sentenced next week, and are the fifth and sixth individuals to be convicted in connection with the assassination.

          <p>The Trump administration mandated that coal and gas plants continue operating, even though grid operators stated they had not requested such measures.

The New York Times article highlights the potential economic impact of this intervention, suggesting that consumers might bear the financial burden of keeping these plants running. The article raises questions about the administration's motives and the long-term consequences for the energy sector and consumer finances.

A CBS News California review found that the FAIR Plan is far more secretive than similar plans in other states, leading to calls for increased accountability. The article highlights the growing pains of the FAIR Plan as it transforms into a major player in fire insurance, and the article adds that State Farm and Farmers non-renewals have fueled the FAIR Plan's rapid growth.</p>
