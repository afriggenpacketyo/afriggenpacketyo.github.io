          <p>A 42-year-old man was taken into custody after allegedly stabbing eleven people in a Traverse City, Michigan, Walmart in what authorities described as a random act. The attack occurred near the checkout area using a folding knife, leaving six of the victims in critical condition and five others seriously injured. All are receiving treatment at a local hospital. Officials and Walmart have condemned the violence, with the FBI assisting the local sheriff's office in the ongoing investigation into the brutal incident.</p>

          <p>Four individuals, including a married couple, have been charged with aggravated child abuse in Fort White, Florida, for allegedly keeping nine children in plywood cages. The children, aged 7 to 16, were also subjected to punishments like being sprayed with vinegar. Prosecutors claim the adopted children were beaten, given unprescribed medication, and treated unfairly compared to the biological children. The investigation began after a church member, who is a mandatory reporter, raised concerns, leading to the removal of all children from the home.</p>

          <p>While visiting Scotland, Donald Trump issued a series of late-night social media posts threatening legal action against political opponents and news networks. He accused the Democratic campaign of illegally paying celebrities like Beyonce and Oprah Winfrey for endorsements, vowing to prosecute them and Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump also suggested that the broadcast licenses for networks like NBC and ABC "could, and should, be revoked" for what he perceives as biased coverage. The article notes there is no evidence of illegal payments for the endorsements mentioned.</p>

          <p>A senior Chinese official's call to emphasize the Chinese history of ancient kingdoms has raised concerns about diplomatic tensions with South Korea. The party chief of Jilin province urged a clear presentation of the Fuyu, Gaogouli, and Bohai kingdoms as part of China's history. These kingdoms, known in Korea as Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Balhae, are a contested part of the shared historical narrative between the two nations. The remarks touch on sensitive nationalist sentiments and could potentially strain diplomatic relations in the region.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government is increasingly suppressing information about mass casualty events, such as vehicle attacks, to prevent potential copycat crimes and control public narratives. This policy shift became more apparent after a deadly attack in November, leading to minimal or delayed official statements on subsequent incidents. Despite the censorship, some Chinese citizens are using social media to demand transparency and criticize the information blackouts. Experts suggest this reflects a broader trend of tightening information control under Xi Jinping's leadership to prevent unrest.</p>

          <p>Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced the formation of a civilian-led rival government, escalating the country's 27-month civil war. The move directly challenges the authority of the internationally recognized army-led government and raises fears of a permanent partition of the nation. RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo will serve as president of the new administration, which aims to establish a secular "New Sudan." The UN has warned this development could further fragment the country, where the conflict has already displaced millions and caused widespread famine.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury found former ballerina Ashley Benefield guilty of manslaughter for the 2020 shooting death of her estranged husband, Doug Benefield. The prosecution argued she killed him to win a contentious custody battle over their daughter, while the defense claimed it was self-defense after years of alleged abuse. The trial featured testimony about their turbulent relationship, a failed ballet company, and competing narratives of violence and manipulation. Benefield was ultimately sentenced to 20 years in prison, bringing a complex and tragic legal battle to a close.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been diagnosed with a flexor strain in his right elbow but has avoided a more serious ligament injury that could have ended his season. An MRI confirmed the strain, and Judge received a platelet-rich plasma injection before being placed on the injured list. The two-time MVP, who leads the major leagues in batting average, hopes to return in 10 to 14 days, initially as a designated hitter. The news comes as a relief to the team, which had feared a long-term absence for its star player.</p>

          <p>Following the death of Ozzy Osbourne, many are remembering not only his music career but also his role as a pioneering reality television star. The MTV show "The Osbournes," which ran from 2002 to 2005, offered an unfiltered look into the daily life of the heavy metal legend and his family. The series blended mundane family situations with rock-star fame, creating a "reality sitcom" format that predated shows like "Keeping Up With the Kardashians." It humanized the "Prince of Darkness," recasting him as a lovable, albeit eccentric, family man for a new generation.</p>

          <p>Floribert Bwana Chui Bin Kositi, a 26-year-old customs official in the Democratic Republic of Congo, is on the path to becoming a Catholic saint after being murdered in 2007. A devout Catholic, he was killed "mafia-style" after refusing to accept bribes to allow a shipment of spoiled, potentially poisonous rice to enter the country. The Catholic Church has declared him a martyr for dying for his Christian values of honesty and justice. His story, highlighted by Pope Francis, serves as an inspiration against corruption in a region plagued by conflict and lawlessness.</p>

          <p>As fans brace for the England vs. Spain Euro 2025 final, psychologists explain the intense physical and emotional reactions that accompany watching a high-stakes match. The body's stress response, driven by hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, can cause an increased heart rate and anxiety. Experts advise fans to manage these effects by getting enough rest, having a clear plan for the day, and engaging in movement to release nervous energy. They also emphasize reframing the experience as a positive opportunity for emotional expression and community bonding, regardless of the final score.</p>

          <h2>San Francisco Experiences Unusually Cold and Foggy Summer</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in several decades, with July's average temperature running below normal and daytime highs struggling to leave the 60s. Meteorologists attribute the chill to a misplaced seasonal high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface. This has resulted in persistent cloud cover and drizzle, a stark contrast to the extreme heat seen in other parts of California. While some residents enjoy the temperate weather, the pattern is a notable deviation from typical summer conditions.</p>
