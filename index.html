          <p>Iconic actress Diane Keaton, celebrated for her distinctive roles in films like "Annie Hall," "The Godfather" saga, and "Father of the Bride," has passed away at the age of 79. Her death was confirmed by a producer and friend, though her family has requested privacy. Keaton, an Academy Award winner, was widely recognized for her unique fashion sense, often featuring menswear and wide-brimmed hats, and her enduring collaborations with director Woody Allen. Tributes from fellow Hollywood stars, including Bette Midler, Kimberly Williams-Paisley, and Ben Stiller, lauded her as a brilliant, original, and influential figure in cinema, highlighting her kindness, talent, and humor.</p>

          <p>During the ongoing government shutdown, the Trump administration erroneously issued layoff notices to hundreds of crucial Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) employees, attributing the mistake to "coding errors." These affected staff include individuals vital for responding to infectious disease outbreaks like Ebola and measles, as well as those responsible for the highly respected Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. While these particular employees are expected to have their layoff notices rescinded, the incident underscores the significant disruption and broader workforce reductions impacting various federal agencies due to the unresolved funding impasse.</p>

Makhmudov, known for his impressive knockout record, presented Allen with his toughest challenge yet.

          <p>Austin Beutner, a former investment banker and Los Angeles Unified School District superintendent, appears to be laying the groundwork for a mayoral run against incumbent Karen Bass in the 2026 election. Beutner's social media accounts briefly featured campaign-style banners and text, which were subsequently removed. At 65, he would emerge as the most formidable challenger to Mayor Bass, who is seeking a second term and has recently navigated crises such as the Palisades fire, a significant city budget deficit, and federal immigration enforcement actions. Beutner's diverse background in finance, journalism, and local government positions him as a strong contender in the anticipated race.</p>

          <p>William Bordsen, the individual accused of murdering 65-year-old Robert Murphy, has been returned to jail after a judge revoked his bond. Bordsen had been released just three days following his July arrest on first-degree murder charges, a decision that caused significant distress to the victim's family. Prosecutors successfully argued for the bond revocation, presenting new evidence including toxicology results that contradicted Bordsen's claim of Murphy's intoxication, and cellphone video allegedly showing Bordsen taunting Murphy as he lay dying. Robert Murphy's son, Ryan, expressed profound relief that Bordsen is back in custody, calling the video evidence "the sickest thing."</p>

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul hailed the decision as a victory for the state, asserting that it protects local law enforcement's role and community rights.

While earlier initiatives were successful in driving growth, some contributed to local government debt. The new strategy is expected to prioritize more tech-driven and people-focused infrastructure, aiming for sustainable development while addressing financial pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An early season storm is projected to deliver widespread and beneficial rainfall across the Southern California region next week, with its most intense period anticipated on Tuesday. The National Weather Service forecasts accumulations of 0.5 to 1.5 inches for Los Angeles and Ventura counties, with higher totals of up to 3 inches in mountainous and hilly areas. Although significant flooding is not expected, this unusually deep low-pressure system will bring a notable drop in temperatures. Residents are advised to monitor forecasts for potential minor road flooding and a remote risk of flash flooding or debris flows in areas affected by recent wildfires.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has publicly urged President Trump to broker a peace agreement in Ukraine, following a phone call he characterized as "very productive." Zelenskyy conveyed his belief that if a war can be successfully halted in one region, then other conflicts, including Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, can also be resolved. During their discussion, he informed Trump about Russia's recent devastating airstrikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure and expressed gratitude for Trump's readiness to support Ukrainian air defense and pursue concrete agreements. This interaction marks a notable improvement in relations between the two leaders, who previously had a more contentious dynamic.</p>

          <p>The Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva, Israel, is meticulously preparing to receive Israeli hostages released from Gaza, actively pioneering a unique medical approach termed "captivity medicine." Dr. Michal Steinman, the head of nursing, highlighted the profound privilege and inherent challenges in treating individuals who have endured over 700 days in confinement. The medical team has gleaned vital lessons from previous hostage releases, stressing the necessity of a "medical detective" methodology to uncover delayed symptoms and the critical importance of providing patients ample time and quiet for both physical and psychological recuperation. Specialized care includes private rooms designed with comfort in mind, along with immediate family support.</p>

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old British army horse, has been granted a well-deserved retirement at The Horse Trust sanctuary in rural Buckinghamshire, following serious injuries sustained during a dramatic runaway incident in London last year. The horse was one of five from the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment that were spooked by construction noise, causing them to gallop through city streets, where they collided with taxis and a tour bus, resulting in injuries to several people and soldiers. Major Thomas Stewart confirmed that Quaker's injuries, including a broken bone and severe bleeding, rendered him unable to return to active duties, making retirement the optimal choice for his long-term welfare.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian museums, its associated research centers, and the National Zoo are slated to close their doors beginning Sunday, as the ongoing federal government shutdown exhausts their previously available funds. The Smithsonian, which relies on federal funding for approximately 62% of its operations, reassured the public that all animals housed at the zoo and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute will continue to receive full care and sustenance. Nevertheless, popular animal cams, categorized as nonessential services, will be deactivated for the duration of the shutdown. This closure represents the latest tangible consequence of the unresolved federal funding dispute, mirroring similar shutdowns experienced by some national parks.</p>

While speakers acknowledged the ceasefire as a positive, they underscored its "precarious" nature and stressed the ongoing necessity to address the fundamental causes of the conflict.

          <p>President Trump's declaration of new 100% tariffs on imports from China, alongside fresh export controls on "critical software," triggered a substantial stock market decline, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq experiencing their steepest single-session drops since April. This tariff announcement overshadowed an already volatile week for Nvidia, whose stock saw fluctuations following a major chip-buying agreement between AMD and OpenAI, and reports of thin margins for Oracle's Nvidia chip rental business. Amidst this market turbulence, an investment club made strategic portfolio adjustments, including increasing holdings in GE Vernova and Corning, while reducing positions in Salesforce and BlackRock, with Nike's ongoing turnaround plan also under investor scrutiny.
