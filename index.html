          <p>Nvidia has completed a deal valued at over $900 million to hire key employees from the AI hardware startup Enfabrica, including its CEO, and to license the company's technology. This transaction, structured as an acqui-hire, allows Nvidia to integrate Enfabrica's advanced networking solutions, which are designed to connect tens of thousands of GPUs to function as a single powerful computer. The move reflects a broader trend among tech giants to secure top AI talent and proprietary technology through strategic acquisitions rather than traditional corporate takeovers.</p>

          <p>WNBA star Napheesa Collier and former President Barack Obama have commented on the controversy surrounding the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show. Obama accused the Trump administration of escalating "cancel culture" to a dangerous level by threatening regulatory action against media companies, a sentiment echoed by Collier. The situation arose after Kimmel's monologue about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk prompted backlash and led ABC's parent company, Disney, to pull the program from the air following pressure from the FCC.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United was defeated 2-1 by Barcelona in their opening Champions League match, despite a spirited performance that earned applause from their home supporters. Although a late goal from Anthony Gordon provided a glimmer of hope, the team was ultimately let down by several missed scoring opportunities earlier in the game. Head coach Eddie Howe praised the players' commitment and heart but acknowledged that a great performance, not just a good one, is needed to overcome Europe's elite clubs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing intense criticism for its role in pressuring ABC to suspend late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, a move described as a brazen attack on free speech. The suspension followed threats from FCC Chair Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, who suggested regulatory action if the network did not address Kimmel's comments about the Charlie Kirk assassination. This incident is being viewed as part of a concerning autocratic pattern of using government power to suppress critical media voices, raising alarms about the erosion of First Amendment protections.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. Current forecasts from the National Hurricane Center indicate that the storm is expected to remain over open waters and does not pose an immediate threat to any land areas. While it is projected to track north of the Caribbean, the system could intensify into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend and potentially bring some impacts to Bermuda by early next week.</p>

The controversy stems from Kimmel's monologue about the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which led to threats of regulatory action by the Federal Communications Commission.

          <h2>Calls for Boycott of Disney Emerge After Suspension of 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!'</h2>

          <p>Following the indefinite suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" by ABC, activist groups are calling for a widespread boycott of its parent company, Disney, as well as major broadcast groups Sinclair and Nexstar. The suspension came after FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, complained about Kimmel's monologue regarding the Charlie Kirk assassination. Organizers of the boycott are framing the network's action as "state-sanctioned censorship" and an unacceptable capitulation to authoritarian pressure, urging the public to respond by targeting the companies' revenue.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has claimed that he personally intervened to prevent London Mayor Sadiq Khan from attending any events during his second state visit to the United Kingdom. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump called Khan "among the worst mayors in the world" and said he "didn't want him there." This statement is the latest development in a long-running and public feud between the two politicians, adding a contentious note to a visit otherwise focused on diplomacy and economic partnership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During an appearance at The Atlantic Festival, former Vice President Mike Pence addressed the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel, drawing a distinction between government censorship and the rights of private employers. While stating he "would have preferred that the chairman of the FCC had not weighed in," Pence defended the network's right to dismiss an employee for making "crass or thoughtless" remarks. He also maintained his belief that President Trump has not fundamentally changed the Republican Party, which he expects will return to its traditional conservative principles.</p>

          <p>The British foreign intelligence service, MI6, has launched a dedicated portal on the dark web named Silent Courier to recruit new spies, with a particular focus on individuals inside Russia. This initiative aims to bolster national security by providing a secure and anonymous channel for potential agents to establish contact and share sensitive information. The move mirrors a similar strategy recently employed by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, utilizing modern, encrypted technology to gain an edge in the intelligence gathering.</p>

          <p>ABC has indefinitely suspended its long-running late-night show, "Jimmy Kimmel Live!," following controversial remarks the host made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The decision came after major broadcast station owners, including Nexstar and Sinclair, announced they would stop airing the program. The move was applauded by President Trump and FCC Chairman Brendan Carr but was strongly condemned by the Writers Guild of America and other free speech advocates as a dangerous act of censorship.</p>

          <p>A major earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 struck off the coast of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The powerful seismic event triggered initial tsunami advisories for some of Alaska's Aleutian Islands, which were subsequently canceled. Russian authorities in the Kamchatka region issued a local tsunami warning for the sparsely populated coastal area, though there were no immediate reports of significant damage or casualties from the quake itself.</p>
