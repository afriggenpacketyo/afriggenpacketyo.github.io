          <p>American social media influencer Ethan Guo has been released after being detained for two months at a Chilean airbase in Antarctica. Guo, who was attempting to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents for a cancer research fundraiser, landed his single-engine plane without proper authorization. Following legal negotiations, a Chilean judge ordered his release on the condition that he pay a $30,000 penalty, donate raised funds to a children's cancer foundation, and not enter Chile for three years. Guo described his detention as a "mundane" experience and noted that the Chilean people had treated him well.</p>

          <p>England defeated Andorra 2-0 in a World Cup qualifier at Villa Park, but the performance under manager Thomas Tuchel was widely criticized as uninspired. The victory, secured by an own goal and a header from Declan Rice, maintains England's strong position in their qualifying group. However, the article suggests the team has shown a lack of identity and has arguably regressed since Tuchel took over from Gareth Southgate. Despite the win, the lackluster play and empty seats before the final whistle have raised concerns about the team's direction ahead of a more challenging match against Serbia.</p>

          <p>South Sudan's government has repatriated a Mexican citizen, Jesus Munoz-Gutierrez, who was deported from the United States to the East African nation in July. Munoz-Gutierrez, who had a second-degree murder conviction in the U.S., was part of a group of eight men with serious criminal records sent to third countries. This practice, part of the Trump administration's immigration policy, has drawn criticism from rights groups for violating international law. The repatriation was coordinated between South Sudan's foreign ministry and the Mexican Embassy in Ethiopia, highlighting a controversial U.S. policy of deporting migrants to nations other than their own.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A preliminary investigation into the deadly funicular crash in Lisbon has determined that a snapped cable was the primary cause of the incident, which killed 16 people. According to the national transport safety office, the cable connecting the two carriages gave way, causing the upper carriage to derail and crash into a building at approximately 60 km/h (37 mph). The report notes that while the brakeman attempted to apply emergency brakes, it is unclear if an automatic brake system engaged as intended. The crash, involving a popular 140-year-old tourist attraction, is being called one of Portugal's worst recent tragedies.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury in Minnesota has indicted two naturalized U.S. citizens, Benedict Nwana Kuah and Pascal Kikishy Wongbi, for allegedly directing a campaign of violence in their native Cameroon. The two men are accused of holding leadership roles in the Ambazonia Defense Forces, a separatist militia, and using their base in the U.S. to finance and order kidnappings, bombings, and killings. The indictment details their alleged involvement in funding attacks that targeted civilians and government officials, including a 2024 bombing that killed a 15-year-old girl. If convicted, they face a maximum penalty of life in prison for their actions.</p>

          <p>An immigration raid at a Hyundai and LG electric vehicle battery plant under construction in Georgia has led to the arrest of 475 people, most of whom are South Korean nationals, creating diplomatic tension.

The South Korean government has expressed deep concern, with its foreign minister considering a trip to the U.S. to address the issue and protect the interests of its citizens and companies.

Despite the record, Verstappen expressed cautious optimism about the race, acknowledging the strong race pace of rival McLaren. The new record is expected to stand for some time, as upcoming rule changes in 2026 are anticipated to slow the cars down.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he knew "nothing about" a New York Times report detailing a covert 2019 SEAL Team 6 mission in North Korea that allegedly resulted in the deaths of unarmed civilians. According to the report, which cited numerous anonymous sources, the mission was intended to plant a surveillance device to intercept communications from Kim Jong-un but was aborted after the SEALs feared detection. The commandos reportedly opened fire on an approaching boat, killing its crew, who were later found to be unarmed civilians. Trump claimed he was hearing about the incident for the first time when questioned by reporters.</p>

          <p>Approximately 300 people were arrested at a demonstration in London's Parliament Square protesting the UK government's decision to proscribe the campaign group Palestine Action under the Terrorism Act. Protesters gathered with signs and flags expressing support for the group, defying warnings from the Metropolitan Police that such actions would lead to arrest. The police reported that officers faced significant abuse, including physical assaults, while carrying out their duties. The event follows a similar protest last month where over 500 were arrested, highlighting the growing civil disobedience against the ban, which makes supporting the group a criminal offense.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department has ended its protective detail for former Vice President Kamala Harris following internal criticism that the assignment diverted officers from crime suppression duties. The LAPD had been assisting the California Highway Patrol after President Trump revoked Harris's Secret Service protection. Mayor Karen Bass's office stated the support was always intended to be temporary. The police union had strongly criticized the move, arguing that a multi-millionaire who can afford private security should not be protected at the expense of Los Angeles taxpayers, especially when officers are being pulled from other essential roles.</p>

          <p>Tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela are escalating after a U.S. strike on a boat that had departed from Venezuela, killing those aboard. The White House claimed, without providing evidence, that the individuals were "narco-terrorists" from the Tren de Aragua gang, a group the Trump administration designated a foreign terrorist organization. In response, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro condemned the strike as "imperialist policy" and announced plans to activate millions of armed militia members. The incident occurs as the U.S. has deployed at least eight warships to the Caribbean, increasing military pressure in the region under its "war on drugs" initiative.</p>

          <p>A new chapter is beginning for California's Point Reyes National Seashore as 12 organic dairy and cattle operations have agreed to a multi-million dollar buyout to cease operations on the land. This deal opens over 16,000 acres for a large-scale, five-year restoration effort led by The Nature Conservancy. The plan aims to restore native grasslands and improve biodiversity, in part by using targeted cattle grazing to manage invasive plant species. While the transition is painful for the multi-generational ranching community, conservationists are hopeful the project will create a more resilient ecosystem and serve as a model for land management.</p>

          <p>The Trump family's involvement in cryptocurrency is evolving from promotional NFTs to more structured business ventures, lending them a new veneer of legitimacy. American Bitcoin, a crypto-mining company co-founded by Eric Trump, recently went public on the Nasdaq, and another firm, World Liberty Financial, has unlocked governance tokens potentially worth billions in paper wealth for the family. These moves, which include plans to list another crypto-related company, are seen as an effort to position these ventures as legitimate assets rather than speculative cash grabs. This strategy allows the family to capitalize on the Trump brand within the crypto industry. (not investment advice)</p>

Authorities reported that the man, an experienced surfer, was mauled by a suspected large shark and lost multiple limbs.

In response, nearby beaches have been closed for at least 24 hours while patrols search for shark activity.
