          <p>Honda Motor announced its first-quarter operating profit was cut in half compared to the previous year, falling short of analyst expectations. The Japanese automaker attributed the significant decline to the impact of U.S. auto tariffs and a strengthening yen, which affected its exports. Despite the downturn, Honda raised its full-year profit forecast, citing optimism for the coming months. The company's global sales decreased by 5%, with notable declines in China, Asia, and Europe, highlighting the widespread challenges in the automotive market.</p>

          <p>The BBC has begun airing a new season of MasterChef that was filmed before its hosts, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were dismissed following an investigation into misconduct allegations. The broadcaster defended the decision, stating it was important for the contestants who participated, though it has faced criticism from unions and women's rights groups. The new episodes have reportedly been edited to reduce the hosts' on-screen presence and banter. One contestant was also edited out at her request following the controversy surrounding the presenters.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has launched two new open-source artificial intelligence models, a strategic move seen as an effort to compete with the growing number of popular open-source models from China. CEO Sam Altman described the new models, GPT-OSS-120b and GPT-OSS-20b, as the "best and most usable" in the world, marking a return to the company's open-source origins. This development intensifies the competition in the AI landscape, where Chinese firms like Alibaba have been gaining significant traction. Analysts note that while this is a major step for OpenAI, China still leads in the sheer quantity of available open-source models.</p>

          <p>Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk reported a massive 67% increase in second-quarter sales for its popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy. Despite this surge, the sales figure of 19.53 billion Danish kroner slightly missed analyst forecasts. The company recently lowered its full-year guidance due to anticipated weaker U.S. sales growth for both Wegovy and its diabetes drug Ozempic. In response to a subsequent drop in its share price, Novo Nordisk has pledged to implement cost-cutting measures and sharpen its commercial focus to ensure future growth.</p>

A former communist functionary, Iliescu seized power during the bloody revolution and led the country for seven years, shaping its transition with what he called an "original democracy." His legacy is complex and divisive; he is credited by some with saving Romania from chaos but criticized by others for his role in the violent suppression of opposition protests, known as the "mineriads." Despite decades of investigations into his actions, Iliescu was never compelled to appear in court.</p>

          <p>Seattle's upcoming mayoral election in November will feature a contest between progressive activist Katie Wilson and incumbent Mayor Bruce Harrell. The two candidates secured the top spots in Tuesday's nonpartisan primary, with Wilson receiving approximately 46% of the vote to Harrell's 45%. Wilson, known for co-founding the Transit Riders Union, is running on a platform of progressive policies, while Harrell is viewed as the more established, moderate candidate. The race is expected to be a tight contest, highlighting the city's political divisions as Wilson aims to become the first challenger to unseat an incumbent Seattle mayor in two decades.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a new report from the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the Great Barrier Reef has suffered its most significant annual loss of live coral on record. The decline is a direct result of a severe mass coral bleaching event in early 2024, which was caused by unprecedented levels of ocean heat stress. Scientists found that the northern and southern regions of the reef were hit the hardest, with coral cover dropping by as much as one-third. Experts warn that this increased volatility indicates the ecosystem is under severe stress due to climate change, though they emphasize it is still worth fighting to protect.</p>

          <p>A leading economic think tank, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr), has warned that UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves must implement tax increases to meet her own fiscal rules. The report states the government is on track to miss its borrowing target by over £41 billion, necessitating a "moderate but sustained increase in taxes." This shortfall is attributed to weaker economic growth and the watering down of planned welfare cuts. The analysis presents a "trilemma" for the chancellor, forcing a choice between her spending commitments, her pledge to avoid tax hikes on workers, and her borrowing limits.

          <p>The recent decision by Welsh star Louis Rees-Zammit to end his pursuit of an NFL career highlights the immense difficulty athletes face when transitioning from other sports, particularly rugby. This article explores the key obstacles, such as the complexity of learning an NFL playbook, which one former player described as more difficult than studying for the bar exam. Another major challenge is the "planet theory," which posits that only a rare few possess the ideal size and athleticism for certain positions, making competition fierce for skill positions like running back. While some, like Jordan Mailata, have succeeded, the transition requires a unique combination of physical talent, rapid learning ability, and resilience.</p>

          <p>A devastating flash flood in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand has left more than 100 people missing and at least one person dead. The disaster occurred in Dharali village after a cloudburst—an extreme, sudden downpour—caused the Kheerganga river to surge, submerging buildings and roads. Rescue operations are being severely hampered by continued heavy rainfall and extensive damage to infrastructure, which has cut off access to the affected area for many disaster response teams. Officials are also concerned about a temporary lake formed by a blockage in the Bhagirathi river, which poses a threat to downstream communities.</p>

          <p>China is strategically increasing its coffee imports from major African producers like Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Uganda to meet soaring domestic demand and secure new supply chains. This push is supported by a zero-tariff policy for many African nations and is being spearheaded by rapidly expanding Chinese coffee chains such as Cotti Coffee. The move is seen by analysts as an effort to "lock in supply" by leveraging global trade uncertainties. Chinese companies are not only procuring large quantities of beans but are also investing in local infrastructure, including coffee industry development parks and processing factories in Africa.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is reportedly in early discussions with investors for a secondary stock sale that would value the artificial intelligence leader at approximately $500 billion. The potential deal would allow current and former employees to sell their shares and reflects the company's soaring valuation since the launch of ChatGPT. This follows a funding round in March that valued OpenAI at $300 billion, and comes as the company's annual recurring revenue is projected to exceed $20 billion by the end of the year. The talks highlight investors' immense confidence in the generative AI market and OpenAI's dominant position within it. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is facing a shortage of available rockets, which is creating a bottleneck for its ambitious plans to build massive satellite internet constellations to compete with services like SpaceX's Starlink. The state-backed Guo Wang project appears to be receiving priority, having launched three batches of satellites in the past week using different Long March rockets. This has left other major projects, like the Shanghai-based Qianfan constellation, turning to private rocket companies to meet their deployment schedules. The competition for limited launch capacity highlights a growing tension between national strategic priorities and the goals of various commercial and local space initiatives within the country.</p>

          <p>Japan marked the 80th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima with a solemn ceremony attended by officials, students, and survivors. A silent prayer was held at 8:15 a.m., the exact moment the bomb was dropped in 1945, which ultimately killed an estimated 140,000 people. In his speech, Hiroshima's mayor warned against the growing global trend of military buildup and the normalization of nuclear weapons as a means of defense. The event served as a powerful reminder of the horrors of nuclear warfare, with world leaders like Pope Leo XIV and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issuing statements on the need to avoid repeating such a tragedy.</p>

          <p>An alleged assault and attempted carjacking of a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer in Washington, D.C., has led President Trump to threaten a federal takeover of the city. The victim, 19-year-old Edward Coristine, was reportedly surrounded and assaulted by a group of teenagers, two of whom were arrested. In response to the incident, President Trump posted on social media that crime in the capital is "totally out of control" and stated he would "FEDERALIZE this City" if the situation does not improve. The incident has intensified the debate over crime in D.C. and the constitutional power of the federal government to govern the district.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under Secretary Robert F.

The decision affects contracts with major pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Moderna for vaccines targeting respiratory viruses such as COVID-19, the flu, and H5N1. Kennedy criticized the technology and stated the department would prioritize what he called "safer, broader vaccine strategies." The move has been condemned by numerous infectious disease experts, who called it a "dangerous decision" that undermines future pandemic preparedness and ignores the life-saving success of mRNA technology.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has filed a lawsuit with the state's Supreme Court seeking the removal of Democratic State Representative Gene Wu from office. Abbott accuses Wu of being the "ringleader" of the Democratic caucus members who fled the state to prevent a vote on a contentious Republican-led redistricting plan. The governor's petition argues that the lawmakers' prolonged absence constitutes an abandonment of their duties and deprives the House of the quorum needed to conduct business. Rep. Wu responded that denying a quorum was a fulfillment of his constitutional oath, not an abandonment of his office, in order to block what he called a "racist gerrymandered map."</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has arrested and charged two Chinese nationals in California for allegedly smuggling tens of millions of dollars' worth of sensitive technology, including advanced Nvidia AI chips, to China. The defendants are accused of violating U.S. export controls by shipping items like Nvidia's H100 GPUs without the required licenses. According to the criminal complaint, the individuals used their California-based company to ship the controlled technology through intermediary countries like Malaysia and Singapore to conceal the final destination. If convicted, the defendants face a maximum penalty of 20 years in federal prison for violating the Export Control Reform Act.</p>

          <p>With the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, there is a growing urgency to preserve the first-person accounts of the aging survivors, known as "hibakusha." The average age of the just over 99,000 remaining survivors is now 86. This article highlights the efforts of individuals and organizations to ensure these stories are not lost, such as a 12-year-old boy in Hiroshima who guides foreign tourists and shares his great-grandmother's story of survival and subsequent death from cancer. These "successors" aim to convey the true horror of the attacks to new generations, hoping the lessons of the past can prevent future use of nuclear weapons.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new national poll from the research group Equis suggests that Republican support among Latino voters may not be solid heading into the 2026 midterm elections. The survey found that a quarter of Latinos who voted for President Donald Trump in 2024 are not committed to voting for Republican congressional candidates. Only 27% of respondents said they would vote for a GOP candidate, a significant drop from the 45% who reported voting for Trump. The poll also indicated growing disapproval of Trump's job performance and a belief among many that neither political party truly cares about people like them, presenting an opportunity for Democrats to win back these voters.</p>

In response, the Republican House Speaker authorized warrants to compel the members' return, and Governor Abbott directed state law enforcement to locate and arrest them. The Democrats maintain their actions are a constitutionally protected tool to prevent the passage of a map they argue is unfair, while Republicans accuse them of abandoning their duties.</p>
