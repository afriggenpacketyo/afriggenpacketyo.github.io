        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The agency managing courts in England and Wales, HM Courts & Tribunals Service (HMCTS), has been accused of a cover-up regarding a significant IT bug that caused evidence to be lost or overwritten for years. A leaked internal report revealed that management knew about the flaw but chose not to inform judges or lawyers, fearing it would cause more harm. As a result, sources claim that rulings in civil, family, and tribunal cases may have been made with incomplete evidence. HMCTS maintains that its own investigation found no proof that case outcomes were affected, a conclusion some insiders and experts deem insufficient.</p>

          <p>Israel's security cabinet has approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal for the military to take over Gaza City, signaling a major expansion of its military operations. The plan also outlines five principles for ending the war, including disarming Hamas, returning all hostages, and establishing Israeli security control over the Gaza Strip. The decision has drawn condemnation from Hamas and concern from hostage families, who fear the escalation will endanger their loved ones. This move comes amid growing international pressure for a ceasefire due to the severe humanitarian crisis in the region.</p>

          <p>China's foreign ministry has warned the Philippines to stop "playing with fire" following comments from President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. about the island of Taiwan. Marcos stated that the Philippines could not avoid being involved in a potential conflict over Taiwan due to its geographic proximity to the self-governing island. Beijing, which considers Taiwan a breakaway province, responded by accusing the Philippines of making provocative statements that undermine regional stability and violate the one-China principle. The exchange highlights the escalating tensions in the region and Manila's delicate position between its powerful neighbors.</p>

          <p>An article in the People's Daily, the Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper, has detailed China's ambition to build a "world-class" military by the middle of the 21st century, explicitly using the United States as its benchmark. The goal is to achieve dominance in military competition by reaching top-tier global standards in weaponry, combat systems, and military theory. This strategy aims to ensure China can protect its national security interests and stand on equal footing with other global powers. The article emphasizes the need to match the "most powerful military" to effectively prevail in international competition.</p>

          <p>Shares for Japan's SoftBank Group surged by 13% to a record high following a fiscal first-quarter profit report that significantly surpassed expectations. The company announced a profit of 421.8 billion yen, a stark turnaround from the loss reported in the same period last year, marking its second consecutive profitable quarter. The gains were largely driven by the performance of its Vision Funds, which saw a $4.8 billion increase in value from investments in companies like Grab Holdings and Swiggy. Several of its portfolio companies, including Lenskart and PayPay, are also expected to pursue initial public offerings soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel's announced plan to take over Gaza City, the territory's largest urban area, is expected to cause further mass displacement and intensify the ongoing humanitarian crisis. Despite extensive prior bombardment, the city still shelters hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and a new ground operation faces opposition both internationally and within Israel. Critics, including hostage families and some former security officials, argue that further military action endangers the remaining hostages and offers little strategic gain while risking more Israeli casualties. Prime Minister Netanyahu maintains that increased military pressure is necessary to defeat Hamas and secure the hostages' release.</p>

          <p>For the first time on record, the Southern Small White butterfly, a species typically found in Southern Europe, has been sighted in the United Kingdom. A volunteer at the Landguard Bird Observatory in Suffolk photographed the female butterfly, confirming its presence. Experts have been tracking the species' rapid northward expansion across Europe over the past two decades, a movement believed to be partly driven by a warming climate. While its arrival is a significant ecological event, it is uncertain if the species will establish a permanent breeding population in the UK.</p>

          <p>In Ukraine, a volunteer defense group composed almost entirely of women, known as the "Witches of Bucha," has taken on the mission of shooting down Russian drones. These women, who work regular jobs by day, spend their nights watching the skies on the outskirts of Kyiv to protect their communities from nightly attacks. The group formed in response to the atrocities committed in Bucha at the beginning of the war, driven by a desire to actively contribute to the defense of their country. Their efforts are credited with saving homes and critical infrastructure from Russia's relentless drone assaults.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has instructed the Department of Commerce to develop a new census methodology that would exclude undocumented immigrants from the official population count. This move would have massive repercussions on the apportionment of congressional seats and the distribution of federal funding. The U.S. Constitution mandates an "actual enumeration" of all persons every ten years, and legal experts widely believe excluding a group based on immigration status would face significant legal challenges. The Trump administration previously failed in an attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census but appears poised for a new legal battle.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly called for the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, describing him as "highly conflicted" in a post on social media, which caused the company's stock to dip. The demand followed a letter from Senator Tom Cotton that raised concerns about Tan's reported investments in and ties to numerous Chinese technology firms, including some with alleged links to the Chinese military. The letter also highlighted that Tan was CEO of Cadence Design Systems when it illegally exported products to a Chinese military university. Intel has not yet responded to the president's statement.

          <p>Records show that Shane Tamura, the man who killed four people in a New York shooting, had been placed on two emergency psychiatric holds in Las Vegas in recent years. However, these incidents did not prevent him from legally purchasing firearms, including the AR-15-style rifle used in the attack. Under Nevada law, short-term mental health holds are not automatically reported to the national background check system unless they lead to a court-ordered involuntary commitment. Experts note that while Nevada has a "red flag" law that could have been used to temporarily remove his guns, it was not invoked in his case.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Marshals Service is auctioning the Amadea, a 348-foot superyacht valued at over $300 million, which was seized as part of sanctions against Russia. The vessel, which features a helideck, mosaic pool, and marble fireplace, is linked to sanctioned Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov. The U.S. seized the yacht in Fiji in 2022 to put pressure on allies of Vladimir Putin following the invasion of Ukraine. With a required bid deposit of $10 million, the sealed-bid auction offers a rare opportunity to purchase a vessel of extreme luxury.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly millennials and Gen Z, are moving away from dating apps and embracing old-fashioned, in-person singles events to find partners. Companies like Date Cincy are hosting events that attract hundreds of participants seeking genuine, face-to-face connections, free from the curated and sometimes misleading nature of online profiles. This trend is reflected in market data, with dating app Bumble's value plummeting and attendance at singles events rising significantly. Couples who have met at these events credit the in-person chemistry as something that cannot be replicated through a screen.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveals that Americans get an average of 55% of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods. These foods, which include items like sweetened beverages, savory snacks, and burgers, are typically high in salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats while being low in fiber. The consumption is even higher among young people aged 1 to 18, who derive nearly 62% of their calories from these sources. This data comes as previous research has linked high consumption of ultra-processed foods to numerous negative health outcomes, including cancer and heart disease.</p>

Haddix pleaded guilty to perjury and obstruction of justice after lying to a federal judge about the death of a chimpanzee named Tonka, whom she was hiding in her basement. PETA had sued for custody of Tonka, a former celebrity animal actor, and other chimps. After Haddix tearfully claimed the chimp had died, he was discovered alive in a small cage in her home, leading to her arrest and conviction.</p>
