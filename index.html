        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde voiced her hope that President Trump would not fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, dismissing concerns about the potential market implications of such an action. Lagarde's comments came amidst Trump's increasing pressure on Powell to lower interest rates, a move the ECB has been consistently undertaking due to lackluster economic growth in the Eurozone. The ECB has cut interest rates seven times since last summer, diverging from the Fed's steady rate policy. This divergence and Trump's pressure on Powell create uncertainty in the global financial landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Qatari and Egyptian mediators have proposed a new ceasefire plan between Israel and Hamas, envisioning a five-to-seven-year truce, the release of all Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The proposal comes after the last ceasefire collapsed a month ago, with both sides blaming each other. Hamas has signaled readiness to hand over governance of Gaza to a mutually agreed Palestinian entity, potentially the PA or a newly formed administrative body, showing "unprecedented flexibility" according to a Palestinian official. Despite these developments, Israeli air strikes continue across Gaza, and Prime Minister Netanyahu insists on destroying Hamas before ending the war.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts slower U.S. economic growth in 2025, projecting a 1.8% growth rate, a 0.9% decrease from January's forecast, citing the escalating trade war as a major factor. The IMF also reduced its global economic growth forecast to 2.8%. Uncertainty surrounding President Trump's trade policies is driving the projected slowdown, with the IMF warning that further escalation could hinder both near- and long-term growth. The agency raised the probability of a U.S. recession to 37% and a global recession to 30%.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer does not believe transgender women are women, according to his official spokesman, following a UK Supreme Court ruling defining 'woman' under the Equality Act as a biological woman. This marks a shift from Starmer's previous stance in 2022, where he stated that transgender women are women. The ruling clarifies that individuals born male but identifying as women do not have the right to use women-only spaces, though exceptions can be made if "proportionate". The Labour government insists it remains committed to treating transgender women with dignity and respect.</p>

          <p>Chevron CEO Mike Wirth stated that the company sees no signs of an imminent U.S. recession, despite acknowledging that President Trump's tariffs are weighing on oil demand expectations. Wirth noted that growth may be slowing, and the oil market anticipates reduced demand due to the tariffs and OPEC+'s increased production. While Chevron is not altering its capital spending plans, Wirth suggested that U.S. onshore oil production could decrease if prices fall to $60 per barrel. He added that Chevron's direct business impact from the tariffs is expected to be minimal due to energy exemptions.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has retaken the $90,000 level as investors seek refuge in the cryptocurrency amidst stock market volatility and concerns over the diving dollar. The surge coincided with a sell-off in U.S. equities following President Trump's renewed pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. U.S. ETFs tracking spot bitcoin experienced significant inflows, indicating renewed investor interest. While bitcoin was previously vulnerable to stock market volatility, it has recently shown signs of decoupling from risk assets, rising more than 9% in April. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Margaret Sullivan argues that Donald Trump's attacks on public media, such as NPR and PBS, are predictable and part of an authoritarian strategy to control the political narrative. Trump's actions, including disparaging journalists and attempting to dismantle the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, aim to harm the reality-based press. While federal funding constitutes a small portion of NPR's budget, it is critical for smaller member stations in news deserts. Sullivan asserts that Congress should continue funding public media as a vital component of a fact-based news ecosystem.</p>

Burnley's chief finance officer highlights the disparity in wages, making it increasingly difficult for newly promoted sides to compete.
