          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that "precise plans" are being drafted for international military deployments in Ukraine to guarantee security after a potential peace agreement. These plans allegedly include an American "presence" as a backstop, an assurance she claims to have received from President Trump, though the White House has previously emphasized coordination over ground troops. This development comes as diplomatic efforts to end the war continue, with Ukraine insisting on robust security guarantees to prevent future Russian aggression. The Kremlin has consistently rejected the idea of any Western military presence in the country.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has retracted its subpoena compelling former special counsel Robert Mueller to testify regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. A committee aide confirmed the withdrawal was due to new information about Mueller's health, which precludes him from testifying. The New York Times recently reported that the 81-year-old former FBI director was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2021. The subpoena was part of a broader investigation into the handling of the Epstein case, for which the committee sought Mueller's knowledge from his time as FBI director between 2001 and 2013.</p>

          <p>A recent coronal mass ejection from the sun is expected to create a geomagnetic storm, potentially making the northern lights visible across 18 U.S. states. According to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center, the celestial display is anticipated to peak late Monday into early Tuesday morning. While not expected to be as intense as the major storms of 2024, it presents a significant viewing opportunity for skygazers in states as far south as Illinois and Oregon. Forecasters recommend finding a dark location away from city lights for the best chance to witness the aurora.</p>

Szczerek claimed he made a "huge mistake," believing tennis player Kamil Majchrzak was tossing the hat in his direction. Following widespread criticism, he stated his actions were unintentional and that he returned the hat to the boy to repair the damage done. Majchrzak, who was unaware of the incident at the time, later met with the young fan and gave him a new cap and other merchandise.</p>

          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake has struck the mountainous eastern region of Afghanistan, with the Taliban government reporting that over 800 people are feared dead and many more injured. The shallow quake's epicenter was near Jalalabad, causing widespread destruction of homes, particularly those made of mud and timber. Rescue operations are severely hampered by the remote, difficult terrain and landslides blocking access roads, with authorities using helicopters for evacuations. The disaster compounds an existing humanitarian crisis in the country, which is already struggling with economic collapse and the withdrawal of foreign aid.</p>

          <p>ScotRail, Scotland's national train operator, has permanently abolished peak-time fares, meaning passengers will pay the same price regardless of when they travel on weekdays. The move, which follows a government-funded pilot program, is aimed at encouraging more commuters to switch from cars to trains, thereby reducing traffic and benefiting the environment. A journey from Edinburgh to Glasgow during peak hours will now be nearly 50% cheaper. The Scottish government expects the policy to cost between £40m to £45m annually, an investment they believe is sustainable and will provide significant savings for the public.</p>

While longer-term CDs historically offered higher rates, the current inverted yield curve makes shorter terms more lucrative for maximizing returns.

          <p>The Duane Arnold nuclear plant in Iowa, which shut down in 2020, is moving forward with plans to restart operations by the end of the decade. The revival is driven by soaring electricity demand from new data centers being built to power artificial intelligence technologies. Owner NextEra Energy received federal approval to reconnect the plant to the grid and is seeking a power purchase agreement with a major tech company to finance the project. This makes Duane Arnold the third mothballed U.S. nuclear reactor slated for a comeback, reflecting a renewed interest in nuclear power's ability to provide reliable, carbon-free energy.</p>

          <p>This opinion column offers a satirical take on the deployment of National Guard troops to perform groundskeeping duties in Washington D.C. parks as part of a response to a declared "crime emergency." The author ironically praises the move as a better use of soldiers than armed patrols, especially since the National Parks Service staff was recently cut. The piece humorously extends the logic, suggesting that if taxpayers are funding the deployment, the troops should also be available for personal chores like organizing refrigerators and calling the author's mother. The commentary critiques the policy's priorities and cost.</p>

          <p>This personal essay delves into the anxiety and vulnerability associated with sharing a favorite movie, in this case "The Big Lebowski," with a new friend. The author explores the psychology behind this common experience, noting that sharing cultural tastes is a way of revealing one's identity, and a negative reaction can feel like a personal rejection. Psychologists explain that friendships are often built on similarities, and discovering a difference in taste can challenge our perception of that bond. The essay concludes that while the risk is real, a shared appreciation can ultimately affirm and strengthen a friendship.</p>

This includes fostering genuine free speech and intellectual diversity to combat polarization, and adapting teaching methods to counter the cognitive shortcuts offered by AI. By recommitting to their civic mission of open inquiry and broad learning, universities can begin to rebuild the consensus that they serve the common good.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that to maximize the environmental benefits of electric vehicles, California should prioritize expanding workplace charging infrastructure. The author, part of a UC San Diego research team, explains that the cleanest and cheapest time to charge an EV is midday, when the grid is rich with solar power. However, most EV owners currently charge overnight at home, using electricity primarily generated from natural gas. Encouraging daytime charging at offices would better utilize renewable energy, further slash emissions, and help stabilize the power grid, but requires stronger incentives and policy support.</p>

The forecast for the week ahead shows continued rain and wind, with a low-pressure system likely to bring gales mid-week. Despite some media speculation about an "Indian summer," meteorologists note that this term typically refers to warm weather occurring later in the autumn, not in early September.</p>

          <p>A new study from the University of Southampton warns that "sharenting," the common practice of parents posting photos and videos of their children on social media, increases the risk of future harm. Researchers found that this behavior can expose children to cyberbullying, harassment, and identity theft later in life, as personal details can be gleaned from the shared content. The study indicated that many parents are unaware of how privacy settings can be bypassed through features like tagging and resharing. Child safety organizations urge parents to be more cautious, as the widespread sharing of a child's life can compromise their safety and privacy.</p>

          <p>Actress Alicia Silverstone attributes her graceful aging to the plant-based diet she adopted in the 1990s. She reports that after giving up meat, she experienced clearer thinking and noticed her hair and nails becoming thicker and stronger. Health experts support the benefits of such diets, which are linked to a lower risk of stroke, heart disease, and certain cancers. In addition to personal health advantages, plant-based eating is also more environmentally sustainable and cost-effective than meat-heavy diets. For those looking to make a change, experts suggest a gradual transition by slowly replacing meat with plant-based proteins like lentils and beans.</p>
