The officer, though seriously injured, survived and returned fire. Authorities confirmed both suspects are in the country illegally and have prior criminal records, linking them to a broader pattern of violent crime.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services, led by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has terminated approximately $500 million in federal funding for 22 mRNA vaccine development projects. The administration stated that it has determined the technology poses more risks than benefits for respiratory viruses and will shift funds to what it calls safer, broader vaccine platforms. This decision has drawn sharp criticism from leading infectious disease experts and a former Trump administration surgeon general, who warn it will leave the U.S. vulnerable to future pandemics and stifle critical medical innovation.</p>

          <h2>Shopify Stock Soars as Strong Guidance Suggests Resilience to Tariff Impacts</h2>

          <p>Shopify's stock price surged after the e-commerce platform reported second-quarter results that beat expectations and offered an optimistic forecast for the third quarter. The company's revenue grew 31% year-over-year, and its CFO stated that the anticipated negative impact from U.S. tariffs "did not materialize." The strong performance suggests that consumer spending on its platform remains robust despite broader economic concerns. Shopify's investments in AI tools for merchants also appear to be contributing to its compelling market position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of server maker Super Micro Computer fell sharply after the company released weaker-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results and a disappointing outlook. The company's revenue and earnings per share both fell short of analyst forecasts, with executives citing the impact of U.S. tariffs and a revenue shortfall due to working capital issues. After a period of rapid growth fueled by demand for AI servers, the company's forecast for the upcoming year was a step down from previous projections, signaling a slowdown.

          <p>Amazon's self-driving vehicle unit, Zoox, has cleared a significant regulatory hurdle, paving the way for public demonstrations of its robotaxis. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) granted Zoox an exemption from certain federal motor vehicle safety standards, a first for a U.S.-built vehicle of its kind. The decision also closes a safety probe into the company's self-certification process.

          <p>President Trump has sought to justify firing the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner by claiming the agency "rigged" jobs data, releasing strong numbers before the 2024 election and revising them down afterward. However, a fact-check of the timeline reveals his account is incorrect. A major downward revision of 818,000 jobs was actually announced in August 2024, months before the election. Furthermore, the final jobs report before the election showed a sharp slowdown in hiring, which Trump himself used at the time to attack his opponent.</p>

          <p>A nine-year-old girl was bitten by a sea lion while attending a surf camp at Asilomar State Beach, leaving her with puncture wounds and bruising. The incident is the latest in a series of aggressive sea lion encounters along the California coast. Experts have linked this unusual behavior to a toxic algae bloom causing domoic acid poisoning in marine mammals, which can lead to sickness and aggression. The surf instructor acted quickly to get the children out of the water, and the young girl plans to return to surfing.</p>

This action is part of a broader U.S. strategy targeting the financial activities of Mexican artists whose music often explores themes related to cartel life.</p>

The decision to air the show has faced backlash from some of the women who made complaints and others who felt it was inappropriate.

          <p>The recent resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler presents President Trump with several strategic choices for filling the influential board seat. One possibility discussed is the appointment of a "shadow chair," a nominee who would serve for the short remainder of the term and act as an agitator against current Chair Jerome Powell. Alternatively, Trump could nominate his long-term choice for Fed chair to the seat now. This analysis explores the potential ramifications for the central bank's independence as Trump considers candidates. (not investment advice)</p>
