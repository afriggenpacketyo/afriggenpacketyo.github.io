          <h2>Barry Diller's Memoir Explores Instinct Over Data in Media Success</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-10 12:41:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an excerpt from his memoir, "Who Knew," media executive Barry Diller reflects on his career, emphasizing the importance of instinct over relying solely on data, particularly in creative decision-making. Diller recounts his time at ABC, where he championed the "Movie of the Week," and shares anecdotes about trusting his gut to identify successful projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker." He argues that over-reliance on data can stifle creativity and obscure the essence of a good idea. Diller believes that understanding human instinct is better than MBA case studies. Relevant context is Diller's long and successful career in the entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>At least seven people have died in Mogadishu, Somalia, after heavy rains overwhelmed the city's drainage system, causing widespread flooding. The rains, which lasted for approximately eight hours, resulted in waist-high waters, collapsed houses, and damaged roads, trapping residents and disrupting transport. Rescue efforts are ongoing, with concerns that the death toll may rise as some people remain trapped. The flooding also temporarily halted operations at Aden Abdulle International Airport. Somalia has historically faced extreme climate shocks, including droughts and floods, exacerbating the challenges faced by its growing urban population.</p>

          <p>Google has agreed to pay Texas nearly $1.4 billion to settle allegations that the company violated the data privacy rights of state residents. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Google in 2022, claiming the company unlawfully tracked and collected users' private data. The settlement covers allegations related to Chrome's incognito mode, location history on Google Maps, and biometric claims related to Google Photos. While Google does not admit wrongdoing, the company stated that the settlement resolves old claims related to product policies that have already been changed. The settlement is a major win for Texans' privacy, sending a message to Big Tech that they will be held accountable for abusing trust.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a ceasefire following escalating military operations, though reports of explosions in Kashmir emerged shortly after the announcement. President Trump announced the ceasefire on Truth Social, claiming U.S.-brokered talks, though Indian officials suggest the deal was worked out directly between the two countries. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked Trump for his role in facilitating the agreement. The ceasefire aims to de-escalate tensions that have been rising since an attack on Hindu tourists in Kashmir, which India blamed on Pakistani-backed militants. The situation remains tense, but the agreement represents a step toward regional peace and stability.</p>

          <p>Elana Cohen-Roth, a retired IRS agent from Southern California, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for defrauding an elderly Sonoma County woman out of $1 million. Cohen-Roth gained the victim's trust while preparing her taxes and offered bogus "investment opportunities" promising high returns. She ran a Ponzi scheme, using funds from new investors to pay off earlier ones and support a lavish lifestyle. The scheme collapsed when the victim requested her money back, leaving her financially destitute. The judge gave Cohen-Roth a lighter sentence due to her age, but the sentencing hopefully provides some measure of justice for the victim.</p>

          <p>A DW article discusses how climate change is altering bird migration patterns, affecting their ability to feed, breed, and maintain ecosystem balance. Rising sea levels are impacting coastal stopover points, while ocean acidification reduces the availability of crustaceans, a vital food source. Extreme weather events also pose a threat to migratory birds. Warmer temperatures can disrupt migration routes, leading to conflicts with resident animals. The article emphasizes the importance of protecting habitats and reducing pollution to support migratory birds, which serve as bioindicators of environmental health and play a crucial role in agriculture and the food chain.</p>

          <p>Billy Evans, the partner of convicted Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, is seeking funding for a new blood-testing company called Haemanthus, aiming to revolutionize diagnostics, similar to Theranos' initial claims. The company plans to start by testing pets before moving to human diagnostics, with the ultimate goal of “human health optimization.” A prototype device resembles Theranos' infamous blood-testing machine. Despite the connection to the Theranos scandal, Evans is moving forward with the venture, though some investors have passed on the opportunity due to concerns about scientific defensibility.</p>

          <p>The Channel Islands off the coast of Southern California, often called “California’s Galapagos,” boast a diverse underwater ecosystem. Marine protected areas (MPAs) safeguard roughly 21% of the islands' waters, fostering thriving populations of sea life.

Scientists and conservationists advocate for preserving the area's abundance, highlighting its economic benefits through ecotourism and its role in supporting nearby fisheries. The article emphasizes the importance of balancing conservation efforts with the needs of commercial fishers and addressing the challenges posed by climate change.</p>

          <p>This CNBC article explores the case for owning stocks at every age, even in retirement, emphasizing the importance of staying the course despite market volatility. It also explains the concept of "risk on" and "risk off" environments, describing how investor sentiment shifts between optimism and fear based on economic conditions. In a risk-off environment, investors tend to move away from riskier assets like tech stocks and into safer havens like bonds and gold. The article cautions against trying to time the market based solely on risk-on or risk-off sentiment, recommending instead a focus on investing in best-of-breed companies with solid long-term growth.</p>
