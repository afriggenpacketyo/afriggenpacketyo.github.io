          <p>A Ukrainian F-16 pilot, identified as Lt. Col. Maksym Ustimenko, was killed after his jet was damaged during a massive overnight Russian air assault. The pilot successfully shot down seven Russian aerial targets before his aircraft began losing altitude. According to Ukraine's air force, he steered the damaged plane away from populated areas and did not have time to eject. The large-scale attack involved nearly 500 drones and missiles targeting central, southern, and western Ukraine, prompting Poland to scramble its own jets in response.</p>

          <p>The Northern Irish rap group Kneecap delivered a politically charged performance at the Glastonbury Festival despite recent controversy and a terrorism charge against one of its members. The trio, known for its pro-Palestinian stance and use of Irish republican symbolism, led the crowd in chants of "Free Palestine." The performance drew criticism from some UK politicians, and police are reviewing footage from their set and that of rap-punk duo Bob Vylan for potential criminal offenses. The band's supporters argue that preventing their performance would contradict the festival's spirit of free speech.</p>

          <p>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, stated that Iran retains the capacity to restart uranium enrichment for a potential nuclear bomb in "a matter of months." This assessment follows recent US and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, which Grossi said caused severe but not total damage. His comments contradict claims by President Trump that the sites were "totally obliterated." The situation remains tense, with Iran's parliament voting to suspend cooperation with the IAEA, though Grossi still hopes for a diplomatic solution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent killing of 17-year-old TikTok star Sana Yousaf has intensified concerns over the digital safety of women in Pakistan. Many female social media users report experiencing online stalking that escalates into real-world threats and harassment. A 2023 study found that women file nearly 60% of online harassment complaints in the country. Activists and users point to deep-seated patriarchal norms that view women's public visibility as a threat to cultural values, often leading to victim-blaming and a lack of effective recourse from both social media platforms and authorities.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has urged senior members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to unite in order to maintain the coalition government. The call for unity comes just weeks before a crucial House of Councillors election. This follows the LDP's worst-ever result in a recent Tokyo assembly election, which was attributed to ongoing money scandals and a shift in voter support to smaller parties. A loss in the upper house could threaten Ishiba's position and alter the political landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Five NATO countries bordering Russia or Belarusâ€”Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Polandâ€”have announced their withdrawal from the 1997 Ottawa Convention, which bans anti-personnel mines.

This strategy is highly controversial due to the indiscriminate danger mines pose to civilians long after conflicts end. Proponents argue it is a necessary deterrent, creating an explosive new "Iron Curtain" to inflict heavy losses on any potential aggressor.</p>
