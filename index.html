        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's economy demonstrated resilience by growing at an annual rate of 7.4% in the March quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts, despite global economic uncertainties. This robust growth is attributed to strong domestic consumption and relatively low dependence on exports, which has helped cushion the impact of U.S. trade policies. The Reserve Bank of India has been cutting interest rates to bolster growth, and rural consumer demand is improving, further contributing to the positive outlook. The International Monetary Fund projects India's economy to modestly overtake Japan's, making it the world's fourth-largest economy by 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

Doyle, 53, did not enter a plea and was remanded in custody, with reporting restrictions in place.

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit Pittsburgh to celebrate a partnership between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, a deal that was initially blocked by former President Biden on national security grounds. Details of the agreement remain unclear, with analysts suggesting Trump is framing it as a partnership to avoid appearing to reverse his stance on U.S. Steel remaining American. Separately, Elon Musk is leaving his position as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) after facing legal challenges and clashes with Cabinet members. Musk's departure from DOGE may not halt the restructuring of government through data collection and workforce downsizing.</p>

          <p>Gerry Adams, the former Sinn FÃ©in leader, has been awarded â‚¬100,000 in damages after winning a libel case against the BBC over a story alleging his involvement in the 2006 murder of Denis Donaldson.

The 11-person jury in Dublin's High Court reached its verdict after nearly seven hours of deliberation. The legal victory marks a significant moment for Adams, who has long maintained his innocence.</p>

Factors include financial constraints, career priorities, climate change concerns, and the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Additionally, there's a cultural shift redefining "harm," leading to higher parenting standards where adult children expect parents to be responsible for their mental health and career success well into adulthood. This has made parenthood seem daunting and contributed to the decision to remain childless.</p>

          <p>Trade talks between the U.S. and China have stalled, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, despite a temporary trade truce reached earlier this month. Both countries agreed to reduce tit-for-tat tariffs, but further negotiations have lost momentum. Bessent remains optimistic, suggesting that additional talks and a potential call between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could revive the process. The delay comes as Trump's global tariff regime faces legal challenges, with a recent ruling temporarily reinstating his plans after an appeal.</p>

          <p>A culture writer reflects on the emotional challenges of hair loss and regrowth after cancer treatment, noting that the process can be slow, uneven, and isolating. While losing hair during treatment was upsetting, the post-chemo regrowth process has been more difficult, especially when trying to return to normalcy. There are various treatments available, including minoxidil and supplements, but their effectiveness can vary. The author also highlights the societal pressure and dismissive attitudes surrounding hair loss, emphasizing the importance of addressing the emotional impact of hair loss alongside the physical.</p>

          <p>A neuroscientist dispels the notion of simple animal instincts, arguing that behaviors are shaped by a complex interplay of genetics, environment, and learning. The question of how a tailorbird knows to sew its nest, or how a dog knows to herd, is not easily answered by attributing it to instinct. Instead, these species-typical behaviors arise from a combination of predispositions, physical capabilities, and environmental interactions. Understanding the origins of these behaviors is crucial for both curiosity and conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Hawaii has filed a lawsuit alleging that the Honolulu Police Department is arresting sober drivers in an effort to increase DUI arrest statistics.

The ACLU says the department is attempting to show that officers are protecting the public, using arrest numbers to secure federal funding and to meet quotas. The Honolulu Police Department has stated that it will review all impaired driving arrests dating back to 2021 in response to the allegations.</p>
