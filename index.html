          <p>A Mexican navy training ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City, resulting in injuries to nineteen people. The ship, carrying 277 individuals, struck the bridge around 8:30 p.m. on Saturday, causing damage to the vessel's mast. Initial reports suggested possible mechanical issues with the pilot assigned to navigate the ship out of the water.

          <p>In 1993, the murder of Jeanie Childs in Minneapolis left investigators with a crucial clue: bloody, bare footprints at the crime scene. Decades later, forensic scientist Andrea Feia discovered an unknown DNA profile that kept repeating itself throughout the apartment. The DNA was submitted to genealogy websites, ultimately leading them to two brothers in Minnesota, one of whom was Jerry Westrom. Westrom was eventually convicted based on this DNA evidence and footprint analysis, though he maintained his innocence. The article details the extensive investigation and the scientific breakthroughs that led to solving the cold case.</p>

Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood aims to expand unpaid work programs, collaborating with local councils and private companies to provide job assignments.

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Walmart for blaming tariffs for its increased prices, urging the company to "eat the tariffs" instead of passing the costs onto consumers. Walmart had warned that prices on various goods could increase despite reduced tariffs on China. A Walmart spokesperson stated that the company is committed to keeping prices as low as possible, but acknowledged the constraints of small retail margins. The article examines the tension between Trump's trade policies and their impact on American businesses.</p>

          <p>Former Conservative minister Michael Gove indicated that a second Scottish independence referendum could be considered if there is "overwhelming support" for it. While Gove doesn't believe another referendum is currently necessary, he acknowledged that the UK government may need to reconsider its position if support for independence significantly increases. Gove's comments align with SNP leader John Swinney's emphasis on achieving "demonstrable support" for independence. The article examines the political dynamics and potential triggers for a future referendum.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved the Novavax Covid-19 vaccine, but only for older adults and for others over age 12 who have at least one medical condition that puts them at high risk from Covid.The agency narrowed who can get the shot and added new study requirements that could cost the company tens of millions. The new restriction will sharply limit access to the Novavax vaccine for people under 65 who are in good health. It may leave Americans who do not have underlying conditions at risk if a more virulent version of the coronavirus were to emerge.</p>
