          <p>The U.S. Department of the Interior has drafted a proposal to expand its critical minerals list, adding 51 commodities including copper, silver, and silicon. This updated list guides government strategy on securing resources essential for the economy and national security, influencing decisions on tax breaks and mining permits. The expansion aims to mitigate potential supply chain disruptions and reduce reliance on foreign sources like China for materials crucial to the semiconductor, automotive, and solar industries. The selection process identified minerals where domestic investment or trade relations could minimize risks.</p>

          <p>The Dallas Cowboys have traded star linebacker Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers in a stunning move that has surprised players and fans. The deal, which followed a tense contract situation, sends Parsons to Green Bay in exchange for two first-round draft picks and All-Pro defensive tackle Kenny Clark. Parsons reportedly received a four-year, $188 million extension, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL. Cowboys teammates, including CeeDee Lamb and Trevon Diggs, reacted with shock and disappointment on social media.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's legal team has asked a federal judge to deny Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's request for a temporary restraining order to block her termination. The administration's court filing argues that the president has sufficient "cause" to remove her based on allegations of mortgage fraud and that this judgment is not subject to judicial review. In a separate filing, the Federal Reserve Board took no position on the matter but requested a prompt ruling to resolve the dispute. The case represents a significant legal test of presidential authority over the independent central bank.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new regulation proposed by the Trump administration aims to tighten visa rules for international students, cultural exchange visitors, and foreign journalists. The proposal would create fixed time periods for F, J, and I-visas, replacing the current system that allows holders to remain for the duration of their program or employment. Under the new rule, student and exchange visas would be limited to four years, while journalist visas could be restricted to as little as 90 days for Chinese nationals, requiring holders to apply for extensions to prolong their stay.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing widespread and rare bipartisan criticism following the firing of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Susan Monarez just one month into her tenure. Monarez was reportedly dismissed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for refusing to remove agency officials and for her commitment to established vaccine policies. The move prompted four other top CDC leaders to resign and dozens of staff members to walk out in protest, sparking alarm in Congress over political interference at the nation's leading public health agency.</p>

          <p>The article argues that the White House's AI Action Plan, which discourages "ideological dogmas," may lead to the development of biased medical AI tools. It warns that purging certain data sets and pressuring researchers could encode current health disparities into future standards of care. This approach risks echoing historical instances where flawed, race-based assumptions were built into clinical tools, ultimately harming marginalized communities. The piece suggests that without careful oversight, the administration's policies could cement systemic biases into the future of medicine.</p>

          <p>The UK government proceeded with a major reorganization of local councils in England without conducting its own independent cost-benefit analysis, a BBC investigation has learned. The government based its projected savings on a 2020 report from the County Council Network (CCN). However, the CCN has since revised its analysis, now suggesting the reforms could potentially cost money rather than save the £2.9 billion previously estimated, raising significant concerns about the financial justification and viability of the plan.</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed that no official Israeli government delegation will be invited to attend the DSEI UK 2025 defense trade show in London. A government spokesperson stated the decision was a direct result of Israel's "wrong" choice to escalate its military operations in Gaza. While private Israeli defense firms will still be permitted to exhibit, Israel's defense ministry condemned the move as a "deliberate and regrettable act of discrimination," highlighting a growing diplomatic rift over the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>In a new court filing, federal prosecutors have suggested that Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing the UnitedHealthcare CEO, may have influenced the recent deadly shooting at the NFL's headquarters in Manhattan. They argue that Mangione's actions were calculated to "normalize the use of violence" to achieve ideological goals, a pattern they believe was mirrored in the subsequent attack. This argument is a key part of the prosecution's case for seeking the death penalty, positing that Mangione represents a continuing danger to the public by inspiring others to violence.</p>

          <p>Relations between Kyiv and Budapest have deteriorated sharply after Ukrainian drone and rocket strikes on the Druzhba oil pipeline inside Russia disrupted Hungary's crucial oil supply. Hungarian officials condemned the attack as a threat to European energy security, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hinted the action was linked to Hungary's continued obstruction of Ukraine's EU accession talks. The incident exposes Hungary's deep dependence on Russian energy and adds another layer of complexity to the region's geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>An Italian website named Phica, notorious for posting digitally altered, explicit images of prominent women including Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, has been shut down following a significant political backlash. The site, which had operated for two decades, faced renewed public anger after female politicians and celebrities condemned its content, which often included vulgar commentary and incitement to sexual assault. Its closure comes amid a broader outcry in Italy against the non-consensual sharing of intimate images online, prompting a police investigation.</p>

          <p>A boat carrying approximately 160 migrants, mostly from The Gambia and Senegal, has capsized off the coast of Mauritania, resulting in at least 49 confirmed deaths. Coastguards have managed to rescue 17 survivors, but around 100 other passengers remain missing as search and rescue operations continue. According to survivors, the vessel was heading toward Spain's Canary Islands when the passengers moved to one side of the canoe, causing it to overturn in a tragic accident on the increasingly perilous Atlantic migration route.</p>

          <p>India's economy expanded at an annual rate of 7.8% for the quarter ending in June, a figure that surpassed economists' forecasts. This robust growth was primarily driven by strong performance in the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors. Despite the positive headline number, some analysts expressed caution, pointing to a slowdown in nominal GDP growth, which does not account for inflation. Concerns also persist regarding the potential future impact of recently imposed U.S. tariffs on the country's economic trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the U.S. Gulf Coast, this article revisits the storm's catastrophic impact and its lasting legacy. The storm, which became the costliest in U.S. history, was responsible for nearly 1,400 deaths, with the majority occurring in New Orleans after the city's levee system failed. The resulting floods inundated 80% of the city, creating a massive humanitarian crisis that was exacerbated by a widely criticized, delayed federal response, leaving deep scars on communities like the Lower Ninth Ward.</p>

          <p>The share prices of major UK banks, including NatWest, Lloyds, and Barclays, experienced a significant drop following a proposal for a new windfall tax on their profits. The call for the levy came from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), which argued that such a tax could raise up to £8 billion annually to compensate taxpayers for losses incurred by the Bank of England's quantitative easing program. While the government has not commented on the proposal, the mere suggestion has created market uncertainty and concern among investors. (not investment advice)</p>
