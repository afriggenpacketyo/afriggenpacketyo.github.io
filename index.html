          <h2>Tariff Exemption's End Impacts Advertising Revenue for Tech Giants Like Meta and Alphabet</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 00:01:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The elimination of the tariff exemption for inexpensive goods has begun to affect advertising revenue for Meta, Alphabet, and other large platforms. The tariff exemption had previously enabled low-cost online retailers such as Temu and Shein to offer heavily discounted goods directly from Chinese factories, leading to substantial digital advertising spending. President Trump eliminated the exemption, subjecting goods from China and Hong Kong to tariffs as high as 145 percent. This has caused Temu and Shein to reduce their advertising spending on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Google, which is expected to create a headwind for these tech companies' ad businesses in 2025. The article suggests that Meta, Snap, and Google are already seeing the impact of this shift as Asian retailers redirect spending to other markets.</p>

          <p>Ghana's ambitious national cathedral project, envisioned by former President Nana Akufo-Addo and designed by architect David Adjaye, has become a symbol of economic mismanagement and a political battleground. Intended as a national monument and a unifying force for Ghanaian Christians, the $400 million project has only resulted in a large hole in Accra, with approximately $58 million of public funds already spent. The new government has ceased funding, dissolved the managing agency, and initiated an anticorruption investigation, named Operation Recover All Loot. The article details how the cathedral project became a target of political opposition and public criticism due to Ghana's economic crisis, leading to accusations of corruption and a loss of public support, and is now likely permanently doomed.</p>

The company aims to differentiate humans from AI bots online, potentially distributing proceeds from AI systems via a universal basic income. While the project has faced privacy concerns and regulatory scrutiny in other countries, it has found a foothold in the US due to crypto-friendly policies; however, the article questions whether Americans will embrace the technology due to privacy concerns.</p>

          <p>China's military mouthpiece, the PLA Daily, has likened the ongoing anti-corruption drive within the People's Liberation Army to preparations for war. The commentary emphasizes the need for political rectification to ensure combat readiness, drawing historical parallels to campaigns conducted before key wars, including the second Sino-Japanese War and the Korean War. The article suggests that eliminating corrupt practices and unifying political loyalty are essential for the military to fulfill its missions, particularly amid growing national security uncertainty. It also indicates that the forces should be prepared to be soldiers and officers in a time of potential conflict rather than peacetime.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 00:00:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, a move expected to significantly increase the prices of new and used vehicles, as well as repair costs and insurance premiums. These tariffs, ordered by President Trump to promote domestic manufacturing, follow earlier tariffs on imported cars. The new levies will affect even vehicles made in the U.S., as they often include foreign-made components. While parts from Canada and Mexico are exempt under certain conditions, the tariffs are expected to shrink the supply of less expensive vehicles and could drive some suppliers out of business, leading to parts shortages. The article notes that while some automakers will delay price increases, the long-term impact is likely to include rising car prices and overall inflation.</p>
