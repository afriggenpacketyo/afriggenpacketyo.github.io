Consumers should also check labels for the rice's growing region, as rice grown in California has lower arsenic levels than rice grown in the Southeast U.S. Cooking rice like pasta, using more water and draining the excess, can also reduce arsenic content by 40% to 60%.</p>

          <p>An analysis by the Penn Wharton Budget Model suggests that a Republican tax package may offer only modest gains to everyday workers, with some taxpayers potentially worse off due to federal spending cuts. The analysis found that lower-income Americans could see their after-tax income fall, while the top 0.1 percent could gain significantly. Republicans argue that the plan would generate economic growth and deliver new jobs, but the discrepancy highlights the complexity of the U.S. tax code and the potential for unequal distribution of benefits.

NJ Transit has suggested commuters work from home and is implementing a contingency plan with additional bus service, but warns that it can only handle about 20% of daily train riders.
