          <p>An Iranian missile struck a hospital in southern Israel, causing injuries and significant damage, while another missile hit a high-rise building near Tel Aviv, prompting emergency responses and evacuations. Israeli officials condemned the attack as a war crime and vowed retaliation, while Israeli military forces conducted strikes on Iran's Arak heavy water reactor as part of ongoing conflict. The escalating conflict has raised concerns about potential U.S. involvement and has led to heightened security measures in Israeli hospitals, including the activation of emergency plans and underground patient transfers. Despite the ongoing conflict, Israel has lifted some restrictions on daily life, indicating a possible easing of the missile threat from Iran. Optimism hinges on de-escalation efforts and the protection of civilian lives.</p>

          <p>Political analysts are expressing alarm at the speed with which Donald Trump's administration is allegedly exhibiting authoritarian tendencies, including the arrest of opposition politicians, deployment of masked ICE agents, and potential politicization of the military. Experts are concerned about the judiciary's ability to act as a safeguard, citing the conservative majority in the Supreme Court. Some analysts argue that Trump is outpacing historical autocrats in his efforts to undermine democratic institutions, creating a climate of fear. The article references a survey that gave the U.S. a score of 53 out of 100 on a democracy spectrum, indicating a decline in democratic norms.</p>

          <p>The escalating conflict between Israel and Iran has led to a significant increase in insurance costs for ships traveling through the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. Marine insurers are charging higher rates due to the deteriorating security environment, with war risk insurance also seeing an uptick. The reduced validity period for insurance quotes reflects the heightened uncertainty in the region.

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering multiple strikes on Iran's Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant, according to a source familiar with the intelligence. The President is gauging the reaction of his base and Vice President JD Vance to potential American strikes against Iran, while also being briefed on security at U.S. Army bases, which could be vulnerable to retaliation. This consideration comes as Israelis discovered they did not eliminate all Iranian air defenses as previously believed, adding to the concerns and tensions in the region. The article reports that there has been no response from the Iranians regarding ongoing nuclear talks, likely because of the way Trump demanded an unconditional surrender.</p>

          <p>Japan's new policy of making high school tuition virtually free, even at private institutions, is causing concern among educators who fear it could lead to a decline in public school enrollment and exacerbate inequalities. Critics argue that the policy lacks sufficient support for struggling public schools, which are already facing enrollment and budget challenges. Public schools serve as safety nets for students with diverse needs, but they are grappling with issues like teacher workload and individualized responses to bullying. The policy aims to ease household financial burdens but may have unintended consequences for the overall education system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Passing Star Could Disrupt Solar System, Study Suggests</h2>

          <p>A recent study published in Icarus suggests that a passing star could cause more havoc in our solar system than previously believed. Researchers used computer simulations to indicate that the planets and Pluto are less stable than thought, with a small chance of Earth being involved in a planetary collision or ejection. While the odds are low, the gravitational tug of a passing star could destabilize objects in the solar system. The study suggests a 0.2 percent chance of collision with Earth, which is higher than previous research indicated.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have reconstructed remarkable frescoes from 2,000-year-old wall plaster discovered in central London, revealing details of a luxurious Roman villa. The fragments depict musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit, offering insights into the affluence of the area, described as the "Beverly Hills of Roman London." The art suggests that Roman painters incorporated local elements into classical designs. The villa, dating to the first or second century AD, may have been home to a wealthy family or a hotel for rich travelers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is resuming the processing of student visas for foreign applicants but will now require access to their social media accounts for review. Consular officers will look for posts and messages deemed hostile to the United States. Refusal to set social media accounts to "public" may result in visa rejection. The State Department will prioritize students enrolling at colleges with fewer foreign students, and internal guidance directs officers to look for signs of hostility toward U.S. values.

The Cook Islands responded by stating their commitment to addressing New Zealand's concerns.
