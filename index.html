            <p>A hospital in Gaza City, Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital, has reportedly been struck by an Israeli air strike, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Initial reports and videos depict significant damage and casualties, leading to the displacement of patients and staff. Hamas has condemned the incident as a "horrific crime" by Israel, while Israel has stated they are investigating the claims.

            <p>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Taiwan is actively supporting a recall campaign aimed at unseating opposition lawmakers, seeking to regain control of the legislature. This move is driven by the DPP's frustration with the current opposition-dominated legislature, led by the Kuomintang (KMT), which has warmer ties with Beijing. The campaign has energized pro-DPP groups but also risks deepening political divisions and instability amid increasing pressure from Beijing. The DPP needs to unseat at least six district-based KMT legislators to reclaim a working majority. Optimism score: 40</p>

            <p>Luxury malls in Beijing and Shanghai are experiencing a decline in consumer spending, leading to rent reductions and changes in tenant mix. Malls like Parkview Green and K11 are seeking to attract middle-class shoppers by courting mid-market retailers and adjusting their brand structure. This shift reflects the challenges facing high-end consumption in China and the need for malls to adapt to changing market conditions. The trend is indicative of a broader economic shift in China.

            <p>Big tech companies have gained a significant exemption from President Trump's trade war, as smartphones, computers, and other electronics have been excluded from tariffs. This move follows warnings that tariffs would cause electronic consumer prices to spike in the US. The decision will benefit many countries in South-east Asia, for whom tech exports are a key part of their US trade. The move coincides with a visit to the region this week by Chinese president Xi Jinping on his first official foreign trip this year. Optimism score: 75</p>
