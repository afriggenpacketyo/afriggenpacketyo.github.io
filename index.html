          <p>A SkyWest pilot executed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a potential collision with a B-52 military bomber during landing approach in Minot, North Dakota. The pilot informed passengers that the bomber was not announced by the control tower, which lacks radar, catching him completely by surprise. The Air Force confirmed the B-52 was conducting a pre-approved flyover for a local event and stated the tower did not advise its crew of the inbound commercial flight. The FAA is now investigating the incident, which involved a privately run air traffic control tower.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Tariffs May Inadvertently Encourage Economic Liberalization Abroad</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that former President Trump's widespread tariffs, while widely criticized, have an unintended positive effect by exposing and prompting other nations to address their own self-defeating internal trade barriers. Countries like Canada and China have reportedly made significant moves to remove domestic commerce restrictions in response to the tariff pressure. The piece suggests that the European Union could also benefit by breaking down internal barriers, though its focus may be shifting toward a war economy instead of trade liberalization.

          <p>Thomas Fugate, a 22-year-old special assistant at the Department of Homeland Security, has addressed criticism regarding his age and alleged inexperience. Contrary to some reports, both Fugate and the DHS clarified that he was not the head of the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships (CP3), but rather a "low-level" staffer in a downsized office focused on grant administration. DHS leadership defended Fugate, suggesting the controversy is a smokescreen to distract from waste within the CP3 program under the previous administration. Fugate stated all major decisions were made by senior policy leadership.</p>

          <p>Annie Farmer, one of Jeffrey Epstein's earliest accusers, is urging the government to release all related case files, stating that if there is "nothing to hide," the information should be made public. She expressed exhaustion and a feeling of being "used" as the case becomes increasingly politicized, particularly by the Trump administration. Farmer remains skeptical of the administration's handling of the files and stated that the recent firing of prosecutor Maureen Comey was concerning to her and other victims. She also voiced strong opposition to any potential pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has removed a Wall Street Journal reporter from the press pool for an upcoming presidential trip to Scotland, explicitly citing the newspaper's recent reporting. The move is seen as retaliation for an article detailing a letter and drawing Trump allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday, which prompted Trump to sue the paper for $10 billion. The White House Correspondents’ Association condemned the decision as an attack on the First Amendment and an attempt to punish a media outlet for unfavorable coverage. The reporter who was barred did not write the story in question.</p>

          <p>Lynsi Snyder, the billionaire CEO and heiress of the In-N-Out Burger chain, has announced she is relocating her family from California to Tennessee. Citing difficulties in raising a family and conducting business in California, Snyder plans to expand the company's office in Franklin, Tennessee, where 35 new restaurant locations are planned. Despite the move and requests from other states, she stated that the company has no current plans for a major expansion to the East Coast. The announcement was made on a podcast where Snyder also discussed her Christian faith, which is reflected in the Bible verses printed on the company's packaging.</p>

          <p>A 2006 interview from "The Howard Stern Show" has resurfaced amid heightened scrutiny of Donald Trump's past, particularly his association with Jeffrey Epstein. In the clip, when asked about a minimum age limit for sexual partners, Trump responded that he didn't want to be like a congressman involved with "12-year-olds," but did not state a clear limit. The renewed interest in the interview follows a Wall Street Journal report on a "bawdy" birthday letter Trump allegedly sent to Epstein, which prompted Trump to file a $10 billion libel lawsuit against the newspaper's parent company.</p>

          <p>Following the shooting of an off-duty federal officer in New York City, allegedly by an undocumented individual, the Trump administration has declared sanctuary cities a priority for its deportation drive. Border czar Tom Homan announced plans to "flood the zone" with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in cities that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blamed the shooting directly on New York's sanctuary policies. Homan warned that if ICE cannot arrest individuals in jails, they will conduct arrests in the community, detaining anyone present who is in the country illegally.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump's presidency is animated not by a coherent policy ideology but by personal grievances, anger, and small-minded vengeance. The author cites several examples, including renaming military bases, barring a former intelligence director from a CIA event for a dog named after his late wife, and pursuing loyalty purges within the FBI. The piece contends that even major foreign policy decisions, such as recent shifts on aid to Ukraine, appear driven by emotional reactions to being slighted by leaders like Vladimir Putin. This governing style is described as a series of capricious roller-coaster rides without a real destination.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security will begin using military bases in New Jersey and Indiana, as well as expand capacity at Guantanamo Bay, to detain immigrants who entered the country illegally. Correspondence obtained by NPR shows the Defense Department approved a DHS request for immediate access to Camp Atterbury in Indiana and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey through September 2025. This move is part of the Trump administration's effort to increase detention capacity as it holds nearly 57,000 people, far exceeding its official bed space.

          <p>The article discusses Emil Bove, one of President Trump's most controversial judicial nominees, as emblematic of a potential new direction for the administration's court appointments. During his first term, Trump relied heavily on the Federalist Society to select judges with a conservative, originalist philosophy. Now, as the judicial nomination process restarts, Bove's nomination is seen as a key indicator of the type of candidates the administration may prioritize. The piece frames his potential confirmation to the federal bench as a significant moment in the ongoing effort to reshape the federal courts, moving beyond the traditional conservative legal movement's mold.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the latest tax bill signed by President Trump will add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The bill makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent and introduces new deductions, resulting in an estimated $4.5 trillion in lost revenue. This loss is only partially offset by $1.1 trillion in savings from cuts to Medicaid and food stamp programs, which are projected to leave 10 million more Americans without health insurance. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget projects the actual debt increase will be closer to $4.1 trillion when including interest. (not investment advice)</p>

Harvard's lawyers argued there is no evidence the funding cuts, which affect critical medical and scientific research, would have any impact on antisemitism. The administration countered that Harvard had violated an executive order and prioritized campus protesters over its research obligations, making the cuts justified.</p>
