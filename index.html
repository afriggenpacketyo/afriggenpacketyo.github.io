          <p>Judge William Orrick, an Obama appointee, faced scrutiny after blocking the Trump administration's efforts to cut funding to sanctuary cities, citing constitutional concerns regarding separation of powers and due process. Records revealed Orrick's significant financial contributions to Democratic candidates and committees, including Obama, Kerry, and Hillary Clinton. Additionally, Orrick held leadership roles in committees supporting Obama and Kerry's elections and introduced Kamala Harris at a fundraiser. The judge's ruling stated that Trump's orders would cause irreparable injury to cities and counties in the form of budgetary uncertainty and deprivation of constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>President Trump directed the U.S. government to take steps toward mining the ocean floor, disregarding an international treaty ratified by most major coastal nations.

This move is expected to face criticism from allies and rivals, and instructs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to expedite permits for mining companies in both U.S. and international waters.

          <p>Intel reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed expectations but issued disappointing guidance for the upcoming quarter, leading to a stock drop in extended trading. The company plans to slash expenses, including job cuts, to improve efficiency under new CEO Lip-Bu Tan, aiming for $17 billion in operational expenses and $18 billion in capital expenses in 2025. Intel cited elevated uncertainty due to the macro environment and fluid trade policies as factors influencing its guidance. Tan emphasized the need for critical changes to regain market share and drive sustainable growth, particularly in the competitive AI chip sector.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed that the seemingly simple act of adding politeness, such as "Please!" or "Thank you!", to chatbot prompts incurs significant electricity costs, potentially reaching tens of millions of dollars. While it may seem trivial, every word in a chatbot request increases the cost for the server processing it. Altman suggests this expense is worthwhile, implying a potential positive impact on user experience or AI behavior, despite the financial implications. This highlights the underlying costs associated with interacting with AI and the trade-offs between efficiency and user-friendliness.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The sequel to "The Accountant," starring Ben Affleck, subtracts much of the charm and wit that made the original film enjoyable, resulting in a louder and more banal action-thriller. While Affleck returns as Christian Wolff, a neurodivergent assassin, the plot involving a human trafficking ring lacks the subtle humor and romance of the first movie. Jon Bernthal's character, Braxton, is reworked into a comedic sidekick, but the gags often fall flat, and the film's attempts at dramatic subplots, particularly involving vulnerable immigrants, feel tonally inconsistent. Despite some entertaining moments, the sequel fails to capture the distinctive appeal of its predecessor.</p>

          <p>Robert Crimo III, the gunman responsible for the deaths of seven people at a 2022 Independence Day parade in Highland Park, Illinois, was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Judge Victoria Rossetti delivered seven consecutive life sentences for each murder victim, along with an additional 50 years for attempted murder. The judge described Crimo as having a "complete disregard for human life" and being "irretrievably depraved." The emotional sentencing followed witness testimonies from survivors, with Crimo choosing not to appear in court. The shooting resulted in over 40 injuries, highlighting the devastating impact on the community.</p>

          <p>The National Security Council (NSC) under President Trump is described as being in a state of chaos and instability, marked by firings, disregard for protocol, and the influence of right-wing figures like Laura Loomer. Career officials have been purged, security briefings were skipped, and decisions are being made without the traditional NSC process. The article suggests that Trump's impatience with process, disregard for the law, and insistence on loyalty over expertise are contributing factors. The situation has marginalized the NSC in foreign policy decision-making, with major decisions reached without proper evaluation.</p>

          <p>The California Supreme Court has demanded that the State Bar of California explain its use of artificial intelligence in developing multiple-choice questions for the February bar exams. The court expressed concern that it was not informed beforehand about the State Bar's decision to use AI to develop a portion of the exam questions. The court is seeking answers regarding the reliability of the AI-assisted questions, the vetting process, and the reasons for deviating from the original plan to use Kaplan Exam Services exclusively.

The Partnership for Public Service estimates these costs to exceed $135 billion this fiscal year, while the IRS could lose $8.5 billion in revenue in 2026 due to DOGE-driven employee departures.

However, this strength is also a weakness, as the administration's impulsiveness and disregard for established norms can lead to instability and unintended consequences.

          <p>The health of Brazil's former president, Jair Bolsonaro, has deteriorated following intestinal surgery, according to his medical team. Bolsonaro, who is facing trial for allegedly directing a right-wing coup attempt after losing the 2022 election, was served a summons in the hospital, giving him five days to present his defense. Despite his health concerns, Bolsonaro recorded a live YouTube broadcast from his hospital bed, which the Brazilian Supreme Court cited as evidence of his ability to be notified. He faces a potential 40-year prison sentence if found guilty.</p>
