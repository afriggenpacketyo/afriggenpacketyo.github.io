          <p>Columbia University requested the New York Police Department's assistance to clear pro-Palestinian activists from the campus's main library after clashes with public safety officers. Acting President Claire Shipman stated that protesters refused to leave the building, leading to the decision to involve the NYPD to secure the building and ensure community safety. Two public safety officers sustained injuries during a crowd surge, prompting New York's mayor Eric Adams to call the protest "unacceptable" and deploy the police. The library was closed, and the area was ordered to be cleared.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this New York Times article, the author argues that the charitable tax deduction in the U.S. disproportionately benefits wealthy donors and the institutions they support, such as museums and universities. The current system allows higher-income individuals to receive larger income tax deductions for their charitable donations, effectively subsidizing their philanthropy more than that of lower-income individuals. The author suggests replacing the current system with a tax incentive that is determined by the amount of the donation, not the income of the donor, such as matching private donations or tax credits.</p>

Sovereign wealth funds typically invest assets from a country's natural resources to generate returns for public benefit, and Trump has suggested that the fund could own a stake in TikTok.</p>

DNA analysis, the gold standard, is hindered by limited resources, sanctions, and high costs. The lab relies on funding from the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the new government says "transitional justice" is one of their priorities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering cutting $26 million in funding for US national parks, targeting grants related to climate change, DEI, and LGBTQ issues. The proposed cuts follow previous reductions at the Department of the Interior and US Forestry Service. Critics argue that these cuts risk the preservation of national parks and could jeopardize land management and fire reduction efforts. The National Parks Conservation Association estimates that the full cost of proposed cuts could reduce NPS services by 75%.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has outlined steps the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) needs to take to address ongoing delays at Newark Liberty International Airport, including limiting flights during construction, returning the airport to a slot-controlled system, modernizing air traffic control, and fully staffing air traffic control. The delays began after a technology outage at the Philadelphia air traffic control facility. The FAA is taking steps to improve speed, reliability, and redundancy, including installing new communications lines, replacing copper wires with fiber optics, and adding a radar data center.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to deport immigrants to Libya is likely illegal due to the country's human rights abuses and instability, potentially violating U.S. and international law. The principle of "non-refoulement" prohibits sending immigrants to places where they will face persecution and danger. Libya, with its history of human trafficking and conflict, is considered unsafe for migrants. This plan follows other controversial deportation schemes, such as sending immigrants to a megaprison in El Salvador and pressuring Ukraine to accept deportees.</p>

Kennedy's focus on autism stems from his views on vaccines, despite evidence to the contrary. Some experts remain skeptical, fearing misuse of the data and a focus on vaccine studies.</p>
