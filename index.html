          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student from Turkey, returned to Massachusetts after spending six weeks in ICE detention in Louisiana. Ozturk was arrested in Somerville, Massachusetts, and her visa was revoked allegedly due to an op-ed she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. During a press conference, Ozturk expressed her faith in the American justice system and gratitude for the support she received. She also highlighted the plight of other women in immigration detention, urging people not to forget them, and plans to continue her legal fight to restore her visa and exonerate herself.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced that the UK will end the recruitment of care workers from abroad as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration. The government plans to change visa rules, requiring firms to hire British nationals or extend visas of overseas workers already in the country. These measures aim to cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled and care workers coming to the UK over the next year, while also introducing new training commitments for UK residents to re-enter the labor market. Critics argue the changes don't address the underlying issues in the social care sector, such as low pay and lack of career progression, and will exacerbate existing shortages.</p>

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described the talks as "more serious and explicit" than previous sessions, noting that the two sides' positions had moved closer. However, significant disagreements remain, particularly regarding Iran's uranium enrichment activities, with the US seeking complete dismantlement of Iran's nuclear facilities, a condition Iran rejects.

          <p>Colorado Rockies fans expressed their frustration and called for the team's owner, Dick Monfort, to sell the team after a 21-0 loss to the San Diego Padres. The Rockies' poor performance and 6-33 record have led to chants of "Sell the Team" during games. Fans are critical of Monfort's leadership and the team's lack of success, with some suggesting the team should be demoted to Triple-A. Despite the team's struggles, some fans continue to attend games, which some argue enables the current ownership to remain in place.</p>

While some investors have passed on the opportunity, Evans, allegedly advised by Holmes, aims to use a laser to scan samples and detect illnesses quickly, with long-term goals of developing a wearable device for humans.

          <p>India and Pakistan have seemingly de-escalated after a chaotic four-day clash involving new military technology, including weaponized drones and missiles. The conflict, triggered by a terror attack in Kashmir, saw airstrikes and antiaircraft volleys reaching deep into both countries' territories. Despite international diplomacy efforts, the underlying religious nationalism and political realities in both countries persist, creating a risk of future confrontations. The limited military industrial base in both countries means that weapons sales from abroad could be used to influence both countries.</p>

Beth Benike, owner of Busy Baby, is struggling to afford the 145% tax on her products made in China, risking her business and home. Marissa Held-Nordling, owner of Little Roo's, has seen changes in shopper behavior as customers stockpile baby registry gifts due to uncertainty about product availability. Economic analyst Kyla Scanlon suggests that broad tariffs are unnecessary and create economic uncertainty, while President Trump claims that businesses will thrive by manufacturing in the U.S., but Benike argues that domestic manufacturing is too expensive.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the Trump administration's selective use of "freedom of choice," promoting it in economic life while restricting it in political and social spheres. The administration emphasizes consumer choice through deregulation but limits options related to political expression, intellectual freedom, and personal identity. This creates a disjunction between economic and political freedom, reflecting a new form of authoritarianism that prioritizes consumer choice over broader civil and political rights. The author argues that Trump is becoming the nation's premier "choice architect," controlling the range of options available to citizens.</p>
