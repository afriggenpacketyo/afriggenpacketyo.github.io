          <p>Dr. Kevin O’Connor, who served as President Biden's physician, invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during a deposition with the House Oversight Committee. Committee Chairman James Comer suggested the silence implies a cover-up regarding the president's health, while Democrats argued it was a necessary step to protect patient confidentiality amid a separate Justice Department investigation. The brief 20-minute session ended with Dr. O'Connor refusing to answer any questions, fueling further political debate over the president's fitness for office and the doctor's motivations.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered his best pitching performance of the season, throwing three scoreless innings to help the Los Angeles Dodgers defeat the San Francisco Giants 2-1. His dominant start, which included striking out the side in the first inning, set a positive tone that snapped the team's seven-game losing streak. While still on a limited pitch count following surgery, Ohtani's effective outing provided a much-needed boost and demonstrated his continuing value as an elite two-way player for the team.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is subtly pushing back against escalating criticism from the Trump administration concerning its $2.5 billion headquarters renovation project. After the Office of Management and Budget director attacked the project's costs and features, the Fed updated its website to clarify details, stating no "VIP dining rooms" are being built and attributing cost increases to unforeseen issues like asbestos. This dispute is part of a broader, politically charged campaign by the administration against Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Police in the UK have arrested 71 people across London, Cardiff, and Manchester during demonstrations protesting the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist group. The ban makes supporting the organization a criminal offense, and most arrests were for suspicion of this crime. Palestine Action has been known for direct-action tactics targeting arms companies involved with Israel, and the government's move has been criticized by some as an overreach of anti-terror legislation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iga Swiatek's dominant 6-0, 6-0 victory in the Wimbledon final was a stunning achievement on what was considered her weakest surface. The win for her first Grand Slam title on grass demonstrates a significant evolution in her game, which analysts attribute to improved movement and a more powerful serve developed under her new coach. Having more time to train on grass after an earlier-than-usual French Open exit also appeared to boost her confidence and performance throughout the tournament.</p>

          <p>A fast-growing wildfire, named the White Sage Fire, has burned over 19,000 acres near Arizona's Grand Canyon National Park, forcing the complete evacuation of the park's North Rim. The blaze, sparked by lightning, remains 0% contained and is being fueled by high temperatures, gusty winds, and dry conditions. A second nearby fire, the Dragon Bravo Fire, has also contributed to the evacuation orders as officials battle the flames amid an extreme heat warning for the region.</p>

          <p>An aviation analyst has proposed that a chip malfunction, rather than pilot error, could be the cause of last month's fatal Air India crash in Ahmedabad. The theory is based on the preliminary investigation report, which showed the plane's engine fuel cutoff switches flipped almost simultaneously. The expert pointed to a pre-existing service bulletin from the engine manufacturer about a flawed chip that could lead to signal loss, providing a potential technical explanation for the tragedy that killed 260 people.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has announced the dismissal of all criminal charges against Dr. Michael Kirk Moore, a Utah plastic surgeon who was on trial for allegedly faking COVID-19 vaccine cards.

          <p>A UK government-backed report has concluded that anti-Semitism has become increasingly "normalised" within middle-class British society. The commission, co-authored by Lord Mann and Dame Penny Mordaunt, found pervasive prejudice in sectors such as the NHS, universities, and the arts, leaving many British Jews feeling merely tolerated rather than respected. The report makes several recommendations, including officially recognizing Judaism as an ethnicity to better combat it as a form of racism.</p>
