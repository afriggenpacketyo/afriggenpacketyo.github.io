          <p>President Trump acknowledged reports of a significant Russian cyberattack on the U.S. federal courts' electronic filing system, which may have compromised sealed records. He downplayed the event, stating that hacking is something Russia is known for and that the U.S. is "actually better at it." The breach, believed to be part of a long-term effort, was revealed just days before Trump's scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, where he indicated he might raise the issue. The hack reportedly involved searches of cases with individuals having Russian and Eastern European surnames.</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) remain an attractive savings option, with current interest rates generally between 4% and 5%. This article outlines the potential interest earnings on a $75,000 deposit across various CD terms, from three months to five years. Due to their fixed rates, CDs offer predictable returns and are FDIC-insured, providing security against market fluctuations and potential future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The calculations show earnings ranging from nearly $800 for a 3-month term to over $16,900 for a 5-year term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Walmart has broadened its employee discount program to include nearly all grocery items, offering its 1.6 million U.S. workers a 10% reduction on food staples like milk and meat. This expansion comes as rising tariffs fuel concerns about higher consumer prices, a possibility Walmart's own CFO has acknowledged. The move is seen as a way to support its workforce financially while also encouraging them to shop in-store, thereby boosting Walmart's own sales. The enhanced benefit, one of the most requested by employees, is effective immediately for staff who have passed their 90-day probationary period.</p>

Zelenskyy urged continued pressure on Russia, stating that Putin is "bluffing" about wanting peace and is aiming to occupy the entire country. Trump assured the leaders he would push for a ceasefire and threatened "severe consequences" if Russia does not comply.</p>

          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining over 1% while major tech stocks saw a slight decline. This market rotation is driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. Lower rates are particularly beneficial for smaller companies, which often rely on borrowing for operations and expansion, and could also stimulate consumer spending. The shift reflects a broader economic sentiment, with many voices, including the Treasury Secretary, advocating for monetary easing to support the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

However, analysts from firms like Deutsche Bank and Piper Sandler are now upgrading the stock, citing the strategic value of adding CyberArk's identity security capabilities to Palo Alto's platform. This move is seen as filling a critical gap and enhancing the company's "platformization" strategy to consolidate cybersecurity services for enterprise clients. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study predicts that global reindeer populations could face a substantial decline by the end of the century due to climate change, with North American caribou being the most vulnerable. Researchers project a potential population loss of up to 80% by 2100 unless significant cuts are made to greenhouse gas emissions. The study, which analyzed 21,000 years of data, found that while reindeer have survived past warming periods, the current rate of climate change poses an unprecedented threat. The decline could have cascading ecological effects, including reduced plant diversity and increased carbon release from Arctic soils.</p>

          <p>Four years after its takeover, the Taliban is promoting Afghanistan as a tourist destination, partly by welcoming young, female travel influencers whose social media posts often portray the country positively. Despite a U.S. State Department "Do Not Travel" advisory warning of wrongful detention and other dangers, tourism numbers are reportedly increasing. Critics, including Afghanistan's ambassador to Austria, argue this is a calculated "image management" strategy to create a false narrative of stability and openness. This PR campaign starkly contrasts with UN reports on the severe restrictions and human rights violations faced by Afghan women and girls under the regime.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt at a record high, many consumers are exploring debt relief options. This article examines the pros and cons of negotiating directly with creditors versus hiring a professional debt relief company. While a DIY approach avoids fees and keeps the borrower in control, it requires significant preparation, persistence, and knowledge of debt collection laws. Individuals must be ready for stressful conversations and understand the potential negative impacts on their credit score and tax situation, as forgiven debt can be considered taxable income.

          <p>A growing number of older Americans are struggling with student loan payments, with nearly 18% of borrowers aged 50 and over now seriously delinquent, a significant increase from pre-2020 levels. This trend, highlighted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is particularly concerning as the Trump administration resumes collection activities that were paused during the pandemic. Experts suggest the debt often comes from borrowing for children's education or returning to school later in life. While the administration has temporarily paused garnishing Social Security benefits for defaulted loans, other collection methods like wage garnishment are expected to resume soon.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is standing by its economic analysis which concluded that U.S. consumers will ultimately bear about two-thirds of the cost of recent tariffs, despite public criticism from President Trump. An economist from the firm reiterated that their research consistently shows that while exporters and businesses absorb initial costs, the burden eventually shifts to consumers through higher prices. The forecast predicts this could push a key inflation metric well above the Federal Reserve's target. The firm's confidence in its data highlights the ongoing tension between the administration's trade policy narrative and independent economic assessments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At 45 years old, tennis legend Venus Williams has been awarded a wildcard to compete in the US Open, making her the oldest singles player in the tournament in 44 years. This marks her record-extending 25th appearance at her home Grand Slam, where she is a two-time champion. Williams returned to the sport in July after a 16-month hiatus, winning a match at the Washington Open and proving she can still compete at a high level. While some may argue the wildcard spot could have gone to a younger player, it offers the seven-time major champion a chance to compete on one of tennis's biggest stages once again.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is facing a critical shortage of about 3,000 air traffic controllers, a key factor in recent travel delays, as a high number of trainees fail to complete the rigorous certification process. The Federal Aviation Administration's sole training academy in Oklahoma City has a washout rate of around 35%, and those who fail are not permitted to re-enroll. To combat the shortage, the FAA is implementing mentoring programs, streamlining its application process, and using modern tower simulators to accelerate training. However, with over 90% of U.S. control towers reportedly understaffed, it remains a significant challenge for the national aviation system.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has overturned a lower court's decision, giving the Trump administration the authority to proceed with billions of dollars in cuts to foreign aid funding previously approved by Congress. In a 2-1 decision, the court ruled that the nonprofit groups who sued the administration lacked the legal standing to bring the case, sidestepping the constitutional question of the executive branch's power over congressionally appropriated funds. The dissenting judge criticized the majority for facilitating what she described as the executive branch's unlawful behavior and disregard for the balance of powers.</p>

          <p>A popular YouTube weather forecaster, Direct Weather, has released a long-range winter forecast predicting a drier and warmer season for California and the Southwest. This outlook, which aligns with some NOAA projections, suggests a reduced storm track for the region, potentially leading to fewer powder days for ski resorts like Mammoth Mountain and Palisades Tahoe. The forecast attributes the expected warm temperatures to unusually warm waters in the Northern Pacific. Conversely, the forecast calls for a colder, snowier winter in the Northeast and Midwest, indicating a significant regional divergence in weather patterns for the upcoming season.</p>

In a related move, the National Academies of Sciences is self-funding a "fast-track" review of climate change's threats to human health to inform policy.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration's federal takeover of the Washington D.C. police force is an authoritarian move based on a false premise. The author contends that President Trump is manufacturing a crisis by describing the city as crime-ridden, when in fact, official statistics show violent crime is at a 30-year low. The piece suggests this action is a "fascist playbook" tactic to expand executive power by creating fear and disregarding facts. It warns that this move on D.C. is a prelude to similar interventions in other major U.S. cities, despite data showing crime is also falling in those locations.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI data center provider CoreWeave fell by 18% after the company reported a wider-than-expected adjusted loss of 27 cents per share for the quarter. The disappointing earnings report comes just before the expiration of the post-IPO lock-up period, which could introduce more selling pressure from insiders. Despite the loss, the company's revenue more than tripled year-over-year to $1.21 billion, beating forecasts, and it raised its full-year revenue guidance. However, some analysts noted that guidance for capital expenditures was light, suggesting potential delays in deployment and future revenue recognition. (not investment advice)</p>
