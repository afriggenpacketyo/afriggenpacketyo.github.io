        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Criminal organizations are exploiting legal loopholes to smuggle ketamine across Europe, where it is sometimes classified as a legal medicine. Smugglers are swapping ketamine for substances like salt or sugar during transit, often along routes from India through Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium, before reaching the UK. The rise in ketamine consumption in the UK has led to increased deaths and health issues, prompting concerns from law enforcement agencies. European police forces are planning to liaise with Indian authorities to address the problem at its source, as Germany imports far more ketamine than would be expected for legitimate medical and veterinary use.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles to combat elevated prices of the staple food. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced the release, which includes 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, and expects the 2020 rice to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, and the released rice will be directed to smaller supermarket operators and specialty shops as well as major retailers. The government hopes this measure will alleviate distribution shortages and lower overall prices for consumers.</p>

Both teams scored twice in the first inning, and the lead changed hands multiple times throughout the game, with the Dodgers ultimately surging ahead in the 10th with RBIs from Andy Pages and Tommy Edman. The game was intense, reflecting the high stakes as the Dodgers lead the Padres by just one game in the National League West standings.

The simulation aims to discuss the feasibility of Taiwan’s military strategy and operational concepts in response to a hypothetical Chinese use of force by 2030.

          <p>Israeli authorities are preparing to deport a group of activists, including Greta Thunberg, who were detained on a Gaza-bound aid boat. The yacht, carrying 12 people attempting to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, was intercepted by Israeli forces and towed to Ashdod. Israel has dismissed the effort as a "selfie yacht" and stated the activists are being processed for deportation to their home countries.

The lawsuit arises as a biotechnology company seeks court approval to acquire the financially struggling 23andMe. The states argue that biological samples, DNA data, health-related traits, and medical records are too sensitive to be sold without explicit, informed consent from each individual. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has expressed interest in buying the company for $256 million and has stated that it would comply with 23andMe's privacy policies and applicable law.</p>

Newsom has accused Trump of inflaming the situation and acting illegally by mobilizing the National Guard without state consent, leading to a lawsuit against the administration.

A letter sent to Foreign Secretary David Lammy last month questioned the UK's continued arms sales and what they termed a "stark disregard for international law" by Israel. The response from senior civil servants stated that while staff are entitled to personal views, resignation is an "honourable course" for those with deep disagreements over government policy.

          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns of an "unprecedented decline" in world fertility rates, with many people unable to have their desired number of children due to financial limitations and lack of suitable partners. The UNFPA surveyed 14,000 people across 14 countries, finding that one in five respondents have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children. Financial limitations were cited by 39% of respondents as a barrier to parenthood, with the highest response in Korea (58%) and the lowest in Sweden (19%). The agency's head, Dr. Natalia Kanem, emphasizes that falling fertility rates are due to many feeling unable to create the families they want.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed £14.2 billion of investment to build the new Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, ahead of the Spending Review. Sizewell C is expected to create 10,000 direct jobs and generate enough energy to power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves described the decision as a "landmark" that would "kickstart" economic growth. The government insists that nuclear power is a crucial part of its plans to eliminate fossil fuels from the UK's energy grid by 2030, though the project will take at least a decade to complete.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have plummeted, with a significant reduction in fatal overdoses among Gen Z, according to data from the CDC and other federal agencies. The number of drug-related deaths for those under 35 decreased from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 in 2024. Researchers attribute this decline to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less deadly fentanyl being sold, more available addiction healthcare, and behavioral shifts among teens and young adults. Despite this progress, experts caution that sustaining this recovery may be difficult, particularly for those struggling with severe addiction.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles has experienced days of violent protests following immigration raids, leading to dozens of arrests and the deployment of National Guard troops by President Donald Trump. The protests began after ICE officers conducted raids in areas with large Latino populations, sparking demonstrations that turned violent, including vehicles being set on fire and looting. Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard has been met with outrage from state politicians, who argue local police could handle the situation. California Governor Gavin Newsom has sued the Trump administration, challenging the legality of the deployment.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has criticized President Donald Trump's deployment of thousands more troops to Los Angeles amid protests against immigration raids, calling the move "deranged." The Trump administration has sent 700 US Marines and doubled the National Guard contingent to 4,000, prompting Newsom to accuse the president of fulfilling "the deranged fantasy of a dictatorial president." The state is suing the president for deploying troops without the governor's permission, arguing it is an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism.
