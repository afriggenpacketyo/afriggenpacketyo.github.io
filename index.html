          <p>Republican candidate Vivek Ramaswamy's campaign for Ohio governor has secured nearly $220,000 from prominent business leaders who previously donated to Democrat Tim Ryan. Ramaswamy's team is portraying this financial shift as evidence of a broader political realignment in the state, suggesting voters are seeking new economic ideas over established political figures. The campaign further points to its record fundraising and the state Republican Party's early endorsement as clear indicators of strong momentum heading into the 2026 election cycle.</p>

The policy discussion comes as the new Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, confronts the challenge of increasing English Channel crossings, with the total for the year now surpassing 30,000 people.</p>

          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett addressed concerns about the U.S. economy, questioning the reliability of recent low job creation figures due to what he described as outdated data collection methods. He argued that stronger indicators like GDP growth and high industrial production suggest a healthier economy and that the Federal Reserve will likely cut interest rates. Hassett also confirmed that the administration is actively considering additional economic sanctions on Russia following its recent significant military assault on Ukraine.

          <p>Investors are closely monitoring the upcoming week for two critical inflation reports, the Producer Price Index (PPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI), which are expected to heavily influence the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates.

In the tech sector, Apple is scheduled to unveil its new iPhone 17 lineup, an event that could significantly impact market dynamics and potentially boost the company's recent sluggish growth.

          <p>Republican Senator Rand Paul has strongly condemned Vice President JD Vance for his remarks supporting a recent U.S. military strike that killed 11 alleged drug traffickers aboard a Venezuelan boat. Vance characterized the action as the "highest and best use of our military," a statement Paul labeled as "despicable and thoughtless" for glorifying extrajudicial killings without due process. This public disagreement highlights internal GOP tensions and comes amid escalating military posturing by the U.S. in the Caribbean, which has increased friction with Venezuela.</p>

          <p>The estimated $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot, the second-largest in the game's history, was won by two tickets sold in Missouri and Texas. The winning numbers drawn on Saturday ended a three-month period without a jackpot winner. The Texas ticket was purchased at a convenience store in Fredericksburg. The winners will have the option to split the prize through an annuity paid over 30 years or a lump sum cash payment, which was estimated at $826.4 million before taxes.</p>

          <p>A border dispute between Colombia and Peru is intensifying as the Amazon River, which forms the frontier, changes its course. The river is gradually shifting south, threatening to leave Colombia's only Amazon port city, Leticia, landlocked within five years. Tensions recently flared over Santa Rosa, a river island inhabited by Peruvians but claimed by both nations, prompting high-level protests from Colombia. The changing river geography challenges the 1922 treaty defining the border, creating diplomatic friction over sovereignty and resource access.</p>

          <p>Five Polish refugee aid workers, known as the "Hajnowka Five," are on trial for human trafficking after they provided emergency assistance to an Iraqi-Kurdish family in a forest near the Belarus border. The activists were arrested while attempting to drive the family, which included seven children, to a nearby town. The case has drawn significant media attention, highlighting the conflict between Poland's hardline migration policies, which include illegal "pushbacks," and the humanitarian impulse to help people in distress at the EU's eastern frontier.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Eagles were eliminated from the Women's Rugby World Cup despite a commanding 60-0 victory over Samoa in their final pool stage match. Their fate was sealed when Australia secured enough points in their loss to England to advance to the quarter-finals on points differential. While disappointed, the U.S. team showed significant promise for the future, with standout performances from young players like 22-year-old flanker Freda Tafuna, who scored four tries in the final game and emerged as a tournament star.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article makes the case that solar energy should be the preferred power source for right-leaning preppers and individualists concerned with self-sufficiency during societal disruptions. Unlike fossil fuels, which rely on a complex and vulnerable supply chain, solar panels offer a decentralized and long-lasting energy source dependent only on the sun. Paired with battery storage and electric vehicles, a solar setup provides true energy independence, aligning with conservative values of self-reliance and resilience, regardless of one's views on climate change.</p>

          <p>Democratic State Senator Analise Ortiz of Arizona is facing an ethics complaint and calls for her expulsion after she reshared an Instagram post warning of immigration enforcement activity near an elementary school. Republican colleagues filed the complaint, accusing her of impeding federal law enforcement and endangering agents, a claim Ortiz calls an intimidation tactic to suppress First Amendment rights. The controversy has escalated a debate over the role of community alerts regarding ICE presence in a border state under the second Trump administration.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's frequent use of phrases like "never seen anything like it" is more than a rhetorical tic; it reflects his governing style and worldview. This form of hyperbole, which he is using with increasing frequency, frames every issue in extreme terms, casting himself as a heroic figure achieving unprecedented successes or facing historic crises. This black-and-white framing serves to justify drastic actions and consolidate power, as both his achievements and the nation's problems are presented as legendary and unparalleled in history.</p>

          <p>More than 15,000 protesters gathered in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, demanding that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government secure a deal to release the remaining hostages held by Hamas. These demonstrations, among the largest in recent months, reflect growing public pressure to end the war in Gaza, as many fear an expanded military offensive will further endanger the captives. Despite these appeals and international concern over the humanitarian crisis, the Israeli government has signaled its intent to intensify military operations.</p>
