          <p>Wang Leyao, a human microbiome scientist and former member of the NIH climate and health scholars cohort, has left the University of Massachusetts to join a research academy in Shenzhen, China. Her departure comes as U.S. medical research agencies face significant challenges, including funding cuts and policy changes under the second Trump administration. This move highlights a trend of scientific talent shifting amid instability within American government research institutions. The article notes that thousands of researchers have been affected by the recent turmoil.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a nationwide injunction, blocking the Trump administration's policy to expand fast-track deportations. The ruling cites concerns that the expansion, which applies to migrants anywhere in the U.S. for up to two years, likely violates constitutional due process rights. While the long-standing use of expedited removal near the border remains unaffected, this decision significantly curtails the administration's interior enforcement strategy. The Department of Homeland Security has stated it will appeal the decision, asserting the president has clear legal authority for the policy.</p>

Norrie acknowledged he may have been overconfident after an early break in the third set, but expressed satisfaction with his recent return to form.</p>

          <p>South Korean prosecutors have indicted former first lady Kim Keon Hee on charges of bribery and stock market manipulation, alleging she amassed over $720,000 in criminal proceeds. The charges are linked to a stock scheme from 2010-2012 and accepting bribes in exchange for political support. Her husband, former President Yoon Suk Yeol, was recently impeached and arrested over a short-lived martial law declaration. The indictments are part of a broader investigation into Yoon's administration, which he had previously vetoed while in office.</p>

          <p>Russian forces launched a large-scale missile attack on the central Dnipropetrovsk region of Ukraine, with explosions reported in the cities of Dnipro and Pavlograd. The regional governor urged residents to take shelter amid the assault. This attack marks an escalation in a region that has largely been spared from heavy fighting until recently, when Kyiv confirmed Russian troops had entered the area.

          <p>China's foreign ministry has strongly opposed Japan's plan to deploy the U.S.-made Typhon missile system during joint military exercises next month. Beijing stated the deployment undermines the security interests of other countries in the region. The Typhon system is scheduled to be used at the U.S. Iwakuni base in Yamaguchi prefecture as part of a large-scale drill with a notional enemy of China. Analysts interpret the move as a strategic signal from the U.S. and Japan, particularly concerning potential conflicts over Taiwan.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has terminated a Justice Department paralegal, Elizabeth Baxter, for making an obscene gesture and uttering vulgarities at National Guard members in Washington D.C. The action was taken in response to what was deemed inappropriate conduct toward the service members. The National Guard was deployed to the city earlier in the month by President Trump, who declared a crime emergency and a temporary federal takeover of the local police. A department spokesperson emphasized that those who do not support law enforcement may not be a good fit for the DOJ.</p>

          <p>A political battle over congressional redistricting is intensifying across the United States, with California and Texas at the forefront. After Texas Republicans passed a map to create five new GOP-favored seats, California Democrats countered with a plan to add five Democratic seats. Now, Missouri is joining the fray, aiming to add another Republican seat, following calls from President Trump for loyal statehouses to redraw maps to maintain GOP control of Congress. This mid-decade gerrymandering arms race highlights the high stakes of controlling the House of Representatives ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

El-Fasher is the last army stronghold in Darfur, and the RSF has been accused of intensifying its offensive and deliberately targeting civilians and hospitals.

The move has drawn criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans, who argue it illegally bypasses Congress's constitutional power to allocate spending.

The program, run by the charity Power2, has shown significant success, with 78% of participants improving their attitude toward learning and 83% showing improved self-esteem. The initiative aims to address the rising issue of school avoidance since the pandemic.</p>

          <p>A new investigation has concluded that Buford Pusser, the legendary Tennessee sheriff who inspired the movie "Walking Tall," murdered his wife, Pauline, in 1967 and staged it to look like an ambush by his enemies. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation reexamined the cold case and found that physical evidence, including blood spatter and gunshot wound analysis, contradicted Pusser's account. An autopsy of Pauline's exhumed body also revealed a previously healed broken nose, suggesting a history of domestic violence. Prosecutors stated that if Pusser were alive today, he would be indicted for the murder.</p>

          <p>Pharmacy chains CVS and Walgreens are now requiring prescriptions or limiting access to the latest COVID-19 vaccines in certain states to comply with local regulations. While the FDA has approved the new vaccines for all seniors, they are only approved for younger individuals with specific health conditions. This has led to varied availability, with CVS stating it cannot administer the vaccine without a prescription in states like Massachusetts and Nevada. The situation is further complicated by the FDA's decision to end emergency authorization for the Pfizer vaccine for children under 5, limiting their options.</p>

          <p>A new film starring Julia Roberts, "After The Hunt," has premiered at the Venice Film Festival to a divided reception. The movie follows a college professor, played by Roberts, caught between a student who alleges sexual assault and a colleague who denies the accusation. The film deliberately avoids presenting a clear version of events, casting ambiguity on both accounts to provoke debate. Roberts defended the approach, stating the goal is to challenge audiences and encourage conversation about complex issues, acknowledging that the film's moral ambiguity is intended to be unsettling for viewers.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Network Open suggests that preschool-aged children diagnosed with ADHD are frequently prescribed medication without first trying behavioral interventions. Researchers from Stanford Medicine examined the health records of nearly 10,000 children and found that 42% were prescribed drugs within 30 days of diagnosis. Clinical guidelines recommend behavioral therapy as the first line of treatment for this age group due to the potential side effects of stimulant medications, such as irritability and emotional problems. The study calls for further investigation into the appropriateness of early medication for young children with ADHD.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals ruling has found that President Trump exceeded his authority under emergency powers laws when imposing sweeping tariffs on numerous countries. The court determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 does not grant the president unlimited authority to levy tariffs, calling it a core congressional power. While the decision is a setback for the administration's trade strategy, the court did not immediately block the tariffs, allowing time for a Supreme Court appeal. The ruling applies to broad tariffs imposed in April as well as specific levies against China, Mexico, and Canada.</p>

Officials are also weighing whether to grant honorable discharges to those whose separation was solely due to vaccine refusal. Since the Biden-era mandate was rescinded, only a small fraction of the hundreds who applied have been reinstated, a process veterans have described as slow and difficult.

Appearing on Fox News, Johnson deflected by calling Newsom an attention-seeker and stated that his hometown of Shreveport has done a "great job of reducing crime – gradually."

          <p>Missouri's Republican Governor, Mike Kehoe, has called a special legislative session to redraw the state's congressional districts in a bid to gain another Republican seat in the U.S. House. The proposed map targets the Kansas City-area district currently held by Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. This move makes Missouri the third state, after Texas and California, to pursue a partisan mid-decade redistricting effort. The action aligns with President Trump's call for Republican-led states to reshape districts to help the party maintain control of Congress in the 2026 midterm elections.</p>
