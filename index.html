          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a series sweep against the Milwaukee Brewers, losing 6-5 in a game that also saw star first baseman Freddie Freeman exit with a left wrist contusion. The injury adds to the team's woes, as they are already missing key players and have lost 10 of their last 12 games. Despite an early lead from a Shohei Ohtani home run, defensive errors allowed the Brewers to rally. The loss marks a significant slump for the Dodgers, compounding concerns over their pitching bullpen and offensive consistency.</p>

          <p>Officials in Texas Hill Country announced that the number of people unaccounted for following devastating holiday weekend floods has dropped from over 100 to just three. The significant reduction comes after extensive verification efforts by local, state, and federal agencies identified many initially reported missing as safe. The historic flash floods claimed at least 135 lives, primarily along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County. Recovery efforts for the remaining missing persons are ongoing as state lawmakers prepare to address flood-related issues and warning systems.</p>

          <p>Insiders involved with the UK's High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project suggest it was destined for problems due to fundamental challenges inherent in building large-scale infrastructure in the country.

Additionally, the article points to the UK's complex planning system and the political necessity of making costly compromises to appease local opposition on a densely populated island.

          <p>A new book and investigation have uncovered a Vatican-run program from 1950 to 1970 that sent thousands of Italian children, born to unwed mothers, to the United States for adoption by labeling them as orphans. Many mothers placed their children in Catholic-run institutions temporarily, believing they could retrieve them later, but were unaware of the adoptions. The program allegedly involved misleading or tricking mothers into relinquishing their rights, with some even being told their child had died. The revelations have shed light on the lifelong struggles of American adoptees searching for their origins.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition failed to secure a majority in the upper house of parliament, a significant political blow. Despite the defeat, which was driven by public discontent over inflation and scandals, Ishiba has vowed to remain in his post. He cited the need to lead critical trade negotiations with the United States as his reason for not resigning, a departure from the typical response to such an election loss. The result leaves his Liberal Democratic Party in the minority in both houses of parliament for the first time since 1955, further complicated by the rise of a populist party.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to establish a new water ombudsman to handle consumer complaints about issues like leaks, incorrect billing, and sewage discharges. This new consumer champion will have legal powers to protect customers in disputes with water companies, bringing the water industry in line with other utilities. The move is part of a broader overhaul of the sector, which has faced intense public criticism for rising bills and record levels of sewage pollution. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the industry as "broken" and its regulator as "failing," signaling that significant reforms are forthcoming.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that despite a recent positive visit to China by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Australia is sending mixed signals that could sabotage its own diplomatic efforts. While Chinese media focused on the positive aspects of the visit, some Australian media and opposition figures framed it as a capitulation or criticized its substance. The author contends that actions and rhetoric, such as those surrounding the potential sale of the Port of Darwin, undermine attempts to present Australia as a reliable partner for Chinese investment. This creates a contradictory stance that could hinder the stabilization of the crucial bilateral relationship.</p>

          <p>Emergency room physicians and pediatricians are warning parents about the dangers of trampolines, which are associated with over 100,000 injuries in the U.S. each year. According to medical experts, the combination of height, velocity, and unpredictable landings makes trampolines a leading cause of home-related injuries, including fractures, concussions, and serious neck trauma. The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly advises against recreational trampoline use for children of all ages, even with safety features like nets. If use is permitted, doctors stress the importance of strict adult supervision and allowing only one child to jump at a time.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass criticized the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, stating the recent ICE raids have spread fear throughout the city's large immigrant communities. In an interview, Bass described how residents, including legal citizens, are afraid to leave their homes, impacting local businesses and daily life. She condemned the tactics used by federal agents, such as wearing masks and using unmarked cars, which she said resemble kidnappings and create chaos. Bass also argued that the deployment of federal troops to the city in response to protests was an unnecessary misuse of taxpayer money.</p>

The report suggested Bessent argued that removing Powell could destabilize the economy and that a firing was unnecessary since the Fed is already expected to cut interest rates. In a Truth Social post, Trump called the story "untruthful," stating, "People don't explain to me, I explain to them!" The incident comes amid escalating criticism of Powell by Trump allies and highlights the unprecedented pressure on the central bank's independence. (not investment advice)</p>
