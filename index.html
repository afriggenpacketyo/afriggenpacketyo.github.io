          <p>Searches for Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in 2007, have resumed in Portugal's Algarve region. Portuguese and German authorities are focusing on abandoned buildings and wells near Praia da Luz.

          <p>A couple volunteering at Vindolanda, a Roman fort near Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland, unearthed a sandstone carving of Victoria, the Roman goddess of victory. The artifact was found in rubble near former infantry barracks, which were built in 213 A.D. during a tumultuous time. Experts believe the stone was part of a larger, brightly painted work, symbolizing the end of war and the establishment of the fort. The discovery is considered rare, and the artifact will be displayed at the Vindolanda museum next year, offering insight into the grandeur and symbolism of Roman forts.</p>

Despite declining sales in the U.S. and Europe, Australian sales jumped to 3,897 vehicles, with the Model Y experiencing a 122.5% year-over-year increase. However, Tesla's global sales have faced challenges due to increased competition and reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk's political activities. Tesla's rebound in Australia contrasts with lower sales in other regions, although the company has seen positive results in Norway and Turkey.</p>
