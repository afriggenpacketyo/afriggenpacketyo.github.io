          <p>Snap's stock experienced a significant drop after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter revenue but declined to provide guidance for the second quarter, citing macroeconomic uncertainties impacting advertising demand. The company's finance chief noted some advertisers reported impact from changes to the de minimis exemption, which allows duty-free shipments under $800 into the U.S. Snap lowered its full-year adjusted operating expenses and cost guidance for stock-based compensation. Despite these challenges, Snap reported an increase in daily active users and revenue from its Snapchat+ subscription service, highlighting areas of growth amidst broader economic concerns.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed executive orders modifying auto tariffs to provide some relief to carmakers, addressing concerns that tariffs would raise production costs and squeeze profits. The changes modify tariffs so that carmakers paying a 25 percent tariff on auto imports are not subject to other levies, such as those on steel and aluminum. Automakers will also qualify for tariff relief for a proportion of the cost of their imported components, though these benefits will be phased out over two years. Despite these concessions, analysts warn that administration policies will still add thousands of dollars to car prices and endanger the financial health of automakers and their suppliers.</p>

Trump introduced Hegseth to members of the Michigan National Guard, praising his work, while Hegseth lauded Trump for restoring the warrior ethos and rebuilding the military. This display of support comes amidst turmoil within the Pentagon, including the departure of several top aides and allegations of financial mismanagement and sexual assault against Hegseth, all of which he denies.

          <p>Florida lawmakers have given final approval to a bill that would ban fluoride in public drinking water, despite concerns from dentists and public health advocates about the impact on dental health. The bill, which now goes to Governor DeSantis, is based on arguments that high levels of fluoride could pose a risk to children’s intellectual development. Opponents of the ban argue that fluoridation is a safe and effective way to prevent tooth decay, particularly for vulnerable families, and that the decision should be left to local communities. Utah became the first state to pass a similar ban last month.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney and his Liberal Party narrowly failed to win a majority in the Canadian Parliament, securing 169 of 343 seats and requiring support from other parties to govern.

Despite the minority government, the result is seen as a success for the Liberals, who were initially predicted to lose badly.

In a new report, the former Labour prime minister says voters "feel they're being asked to make financial sacrifices and changes in lifestyle when they know the impact on global emissions is minimal". The report calls for the rapid deployment of carbon capture and storage technology, greater use of AI to make energy grids efficient and investment in small scale nuclear reactors. Downing Street said it would not be changing course on net zero - and rejected Sir Tony's suggestions that the public was no longer prepared to make sacrifices to meet green goals.</p>

The proposal aims to save over $330 billion and address the root causes of rising college costs. Under the plan, existing income-contingent repayment arrangements would be replaced with a new "repayment assistance plan," and Pell grants would face new limits.

          <p>Three people were killed in a shooting in the Swedish city of Uppsala, with police reporting that a masked assailant carried out the attack. The motive for the shooting is currently unclear, and police are investigating it as a homicide. The shooting occurred in Uppsala's center, one day before the city celebrates a spring festival that traditionally draws some 100,000 visitors. Sweden has experienced a wave of gang-related violence in recent years, but police have not yet indicated whether this shooting is related to gang activity.</p>

The reports come at a difficult time for the university, which is suing the Trump administration over federal funding cuts. The reports detail incidents of bias and discrimination, with many Muslim students expressing concerns about expressing their political opinions. The university has promised to address the issues and curb bigotry, but faces challenges in balancing free speech and combating discrimination.</p>
