          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed that Meta Platforms attempted to recruit OpenAI employees with substantial signing bonuses, reaching up to $100 million, alongside attractive annual compensation packages. Altman noted that despite Meta's aggressive pursuit, none of OpenAI's key personnel have accepted these offers. He acknowledged Meta's perception of OpenAI as a major competitor and commended their persistent efforts to innovate in the AI sector. Meta's attempts to bolster its AI division come after reported delays in releasing its latest AI model, signaling Zuckerberg's determination to invest heavily in top AI talent. The context is Meta's ongoing efforts to compete in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. Optimism surrounding OpenAI remains high given their ability to retain talent.</p>

          <p>The Florida Panthers clinched their second consecutive Stanley Cup championship, defeating the Edmonton Oilers 5-1 in Game 6 of the final series. This win marks the NHL's first back-to-back champions since Tampa Bay in 2020 and 2021, solidifying the Panthers as a potential dynasty. Sam Reinhart's outstanding performance, scoring four goals, contributed significantly to the victory, while Sergei Bobrovsky's stellar goaltending secured the win. The Panthers' success is attributed to key players like Matthew Tkachuk, Reinhart, and Aleksander Barkov, along with strategic trade deadline acquisitions. The team's journey to victory included overcoming injuries and maintaining a strong, healthy roster throughout the playoffs, leading to their dominant performance and cementing their place in NHL history. The Panthers' win represents a significant achievement for the team and its fans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia has become the first country to eliminate all sexual activity-based restrictions on plasma donation, effectively lifting the ban on gay and bisexual men. The new rules, approved by the country's health products regulator, are estimated to expand the donation pool by 625,000 people. While blood donation still requires a three-month waiting period for individuals engaging in anal sex with new or multiple partners, plasma donation is more accessible due to pathogen inactivation processes. This decision, praised by LGBTQIA+ advocates, aims to increase plasma supplies amid rising global demand and reduce stigma, although some argue that blood donation rules remain conservative compared to other countries.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported conducting a series of air strikes in the Tehran area, targeting an Iranian centrifuge production site and several weapons factories. According to the IDF, the centrifuge production facility was being used to accelerate Iran's uranium enrichment program for nuclear weapons development. The IDF also stated that the strikes hit facilities producing raw materials and components for surface-to-surface missiles. Iran has consistently asserted that its nuclear program is solely for civilian purposes. The strikes represent an escalation in the ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran.</p>

          <p>Dozens of families are calling for an inquiry into maternity care at Leeds Teaching Hospitals (LTH) NHS Trust, citing concerns about inadequate care leading to baby deaths and injuries. Tassie Weaver recounts being dismissed by a midwife despite high-risk factors, resulting in her son's stillbirth, which an NHS trust review identified as potentially preventable. A total of 67 families have now reported experiencing inadequate care at LTH's maternity units, and three additional whistleblowers have shared concerns about the standard of care. While the trust claims to be making improvements, families are urging Health Secretary Wes Streeting to launch an independent review led by senior midwife Donna Ockenden, following a BBC investigation into avoidable deaths at the trust.</p>

Hegseth's tenure has been marked by controversy, including his stance on transgender troops and his use of an unsecure messaging app to share sensitive military information.

          <p>Japan's exports experienced a 1.7% year-over-year decline in May, the steepest drop since September 2024, primarily due to a significant decrease in shipments to the U.S. and China. Exports to the U.S. fell by 11.1%, with automobile exports plummeting by 24.7%, while exports to China decreased by 8.8%. The Bank of Japan has cautioned that the country's growth is likely to moderate due to trade uncertainties and a slowdown in overseas economies.

California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the deployment as political theater, diverting resources from critical wildfire work and border security.

The judge argued that the policy would cause psychological distress and fear for transgender individuals forced to travel with passports conflicting with their gender identity. Trump's executive order had directed agencies to recognize only two sexes, arguing that efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex attack women.</p>

          <p>China is expected to play an active role in mediating a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, although analysts caution about the limits of its potential influence. Both countries have exchanged strikes for five consecutive days, prompting China to advise its citizens to leave both countries due to the severe security situation. President Xi Jinping has called for de-escalation and offered China's constructive role in restoring peace, while Foreign Minister Wang Yi has condemned Israel's attack but also expressed Beijing's readiness to help resolve differences. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which includes Iran, has also condemned Israel's strikes and advocated for peaceful resolution.</p>
