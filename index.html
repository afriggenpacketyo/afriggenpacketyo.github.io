Discussions focused on potentially easing U.S. restrictions on chipmaking software, jet engine parts, and ethane, with the U.S. seeking confirmation that China would restore flows of critical minerals.

Critics point to statements from officials like FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino, who condemned violence against police in Los Angeles, while Trump has downplayed the severity of the January 6th events and issued pardons to rioters. Democrats also highlighted Trump's swift deployment of the National Guard to California, contrasting it with the delayed response to the Capitol attack, raising questions about the administration's selective approach to law and order.</p>

          <p>The White House is reportedly pushing for a rare mid-decade redistricting effort in Texas, with the goal of weakening Democratic prospects in future elections. This move has caused unease among some Texas Republicans, who worry that an attempt to harm Democrats could inadvertently endanger Republican incumbents in the 2026 elections. The redistricting push highlights the ongoing political battles over electoral boundaries and the potential consequences for both parties.</p>
