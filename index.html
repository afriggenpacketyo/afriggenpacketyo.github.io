          <p>A federal grand jury has been empaneled in Fort Pierce, Florida, slated to begin meeting in January, to investigate what a key Trump ally describes as a decade-long conspiracy against former President Donald Trump. Conservative attorney Mike Davis, an informal adviser to Trump administration officials, claims this grand jury will consider criminal charges against top Democratic figures, alleging they colluded to impede Trump, starting with the 2016 Russian interference investigation and extending to current criminal cases. Davis has publicly pushed for this investigation, aiming to hold "lawfare Democrats" accountable for their perceived politicized use of the legal system, which he claims includes efforts to bankrupt and imprison Trump. The article notes that court documents confirm the grand jury's empanelment at the Trump administration's request, though the U.S. Attorney's Office has not commented on its purpose.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has embarked on his first Asia trip this term, with a packed agenda focusing on investment deals and peace efforts, culminating in a face-to-face meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping to address the ongoing trade war. Trump expressed hopes for a "complete deal" with China, aiming to secure benefits for U.S. farmers and discuss issues like fentanyl. The extensive trip, which includes stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, is taking place amidst a persistent U.S. government shutdown, causing federal workers to miss paychecks, disrupting air travel, and threatening federal food aid. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer criticized the President for undertaking foreign travel while "America is shut down."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced an additional 10% tariff on Canadian imports, citing a negative TV commercial that used excerpts from a 1987 speech by President Ronald Reagan to criticize U.S. tariff policies. The ad, aired by the province of Ontario, ran during Game 1 of the World Series, despite Ontario Premier Doug Ford's statement that it would be pulled next week. Trump characterized the ad as a "serious misrepresentation of the facts" and a "hostile act," escalating existing trade tensions between the two countries. This decision follows Trump's earlier threat to halt trade talks with Canada over the controversial advertisement, further impacting Canadian exports and the broader economic relationship.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police have issued a direct appeal for Hadush Kebatu, a migrant convicted of sexual assault, to surrender himself after his mistaken release from HMP Chelmsford in Essex. Kebatu, jailed for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman, was set free weeks after his sentencing and has since traveled to east London, with CCTV footage placing him in the Dalston area. Commander James Conway urged Kebatu to contact authorities for a "safe and controlled" return, noting his expressed desire to return to Ethiopia. The incident has sparked outrage, with Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy ordering an independent investigation and implementing new prison release procedures to prevent future errors, amid concerns about systemic failures in the prison system.</p>

          <p>The White House Family Theater, a private cinema used by presidents for over 80 years, is being demolished as part of the East Wing's redevelopment to construct a new $300 million ballroom. Converted from a cloakroom in 1942 by Franklin Roosevelt, the theater screened countless films and served as a rehearsal space for presidential speeches, holding significant historical and cultural value. Presidents from Jimmy Carter, who screened over 400 films, to Donald Trump enjoyed the venue, with Bill Clinton once calling it the "best perk" of the White House. Critics lament the destruction of this piece of American history, though reports suggest a new theater might be rebuilt.</p>

          <p>An Atlanta carjacking victim, 51-year-old Yoshay Carter, was arrested and charged with aggravated assault after allegedly shooting a boy who was breaking into his car. Police found the minor with a gunshot wound to the foot, and the boy admitted to the attempted vehicle break-in. Carter stated the shooting happened during a confrontation with the boy. While Georgia law allows using force to prevent criminal interference with property, it generally prohibits force intended to cause death or great bodily harm unless preventing a "forcible felony." The article highlights that police have not confirmed the applicability of self-defense laws in this specific case, leaving the legal outcome ambiguous for the car owner.</p>

The following day, two bodies were found near the initial caller's location.

The sales of these lab-grown diamonds are rapidly increasing, with market projections showing substantial growth from $25.89 billion in 2024 to $74.45 billion by 2032. This surge is driven by their identical sparkle and significantly lower cost compared to natural diamonds, challenging traditional perceptions of precious stones.</p>

          <p>China's housing market is experiencing a significant downturn, characterized by a growing wave of property foreclosures and liquidations on major e-commerce platforms like Alibaba and JD.com. An industry report reveals that properties in judicial auctions are selling at a record low of 77% of their appraised value, which is actively suppressing home prices and buyer sentiment. The number of foreclosed properties is rapidly increasing, with economists estimating over one million additions this year, more than doubling 2020 levels. This escalating situation, drawing comparisons to the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis, raises serious concerns about the stability of financial institutions burdened with bad debt and the potential for broader economic instability.

Upon confrontation, her stepfather claimed it was a "safety plan" for his "girls," while her mother defended him, calling her "ungrateful." Feeling violated, the woman removed the profile, changed passwords, and demanded an apology, leading to family backlash and accusations of being "dramatic."</p>

          <p>Timothy Mellon, an heir to a prominent banking family and a billionaire railroad magnate, has been identified by The New York Times as the mystery donor who contributed $130 million to pay U.S. military troops during the government shutdown. President Donald Trump had previously announced the donation from an unnamed "great patriot" and "friend." However, the article notes that Mellon's donation amounts to only about $100 per service member, a small fraction of the nearly $6.4 billion needed bi-weekly for military pay. Concerns have also been raised that using these private funds could violate the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending unappropriated funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UCLA's football team suffered a devastating 56-6 loss to No. 2 Indiana, a performance interim coach Tim Skipper lamented as a "throwback" to their early-season struggles. The Bruins' offense managed a mere 201 yards, with the offensive line failing to protect quarterback Nico Iamaleava, who threw two interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown early in the game. Defensive issues, such as missed tackles and numerous penalties, further compounded their problems, leading to a lopsided score. This crushing defeat represents a significant regression for a team that had recently shown promise with three consecutive wins, dimming hopes for their season, and highlights fundamental issues the team must address.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's favorability among Hispanic adults has significantly declined since he began his second term, according to an AP-NORC poll. The survey shows only 25% of Hispanic adults now hold a favorable view of Trump, down from 44% before his term started, with 73% believing the nation is headed in the wrong direction. This drop is notable given that nearly half of Hispanic voters backed him in the 2024 election. The decline is linked to concerns over his hardline immigration enforcement, which directly impacts Latino communities, and rising financial strain on Hispanic households. The article indicates a growing negative perception among younger Hispanic men and even Hispanic Republicans.</p>

          <p>A viral bar chart claiming the UK is Europe's "sexual assault capital" is misleading, despite using accurate numbers, due to significant differences in legal definitions and reporting practices across countries. DW Fact Check explains that the UK's seemingly high rate reflects its consent-based legal overhaul in 2003 and its "input statistics" counting method, rather than a higher prevalence of sexual assault. Criminologists advocate for victim surveys, not police reports, for accurate comparisons, as crime statistics often only capture a fraction of actual incidents. The article also debunks claims linking increased sexual assault rates to "uncontrolled mass immigration," citing a lack of evidence and contrasting data.</p>

          <p>Ladakh, India, is grappling with a deep sense of uncertainty after deadly protests last month called for greater autonomy and statehood for the Buddhist-Muslim enclave bordering China and Pakistan.

Protesters feel betrayed by New Delhi's "negligence" since Ladakh was carved out as a separate union territory in 2019, leading to widespread unemployment.

Harris, who lost the 2024 race to Donald Trump, reiterated her warnings about Trump becoming a "tyrant" and running an authoritarian government, claims the White House dismissed as "absurd lies." She expressed certainty that her grandnieces would see a female president in their lifetime. While not committing directly, Harris left the door open for another presidential bid, though a recent California poll showed less than a third of voters, including under half of Democrats, support her running again in 2028.</p>
