          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 18:23:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has unveiled a sweeping immigration plan, "Operation Restoring Justice," proposing the deportation of 600,000 asylum seekers from Britain to avert "civil disorder." The strategy involves withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), repealing the Human Rights Act, and scrapping international treaties that impede forced deportations. Farage asserts this will immediately halt small boat crossings, while critics from the Labour Party and other political figures dismiss the proposals as lacking practical details and abandoning human rights commitments. The announcement follows weeks of protests over migration, with polling indicating immigration is now the top concern for UK voters, boosting Reform UK's standing.</p>

          <p>West Ham United captain Jarrod Bowen publicly apologized for confronting fans after the team's 3-2 EFL Cup loss to Wolves, marking their third consecutive defeat. Bowen, restrained by stewards, reacted to comments from the traveling supporters at the final whistle, expressing his passion for the club. Manager Graham Potter called for unity, acknowledging the team's "pain" and collective hurt over the results, which include conceding 11 goals in three games. This incident further intensifies pressure on Potter, who has a meager record of five wins in 22 matches, as the club faces a critical period, including an upcoming match against Rangers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida Republicans are reportedly planning a significant redrawing of congressional districts before the 2026 midterm elections, potentially targeting three to five Democratic-held House seats. This move follows a Florida Supreme Court decision upholding the state's current gerrymandered map, which already favors Republicans. Florida House Speaker Daniel Perez has formed a select committee to examine redistricting, prompted by national conversations and a desire for legal guidance on the state's "Fair Districts" provisions. Critics, including Democratic Senator Shevrin Jones, decry the effort as a "power grab" aimed at diluting minority votes. The plan also aligns with President Trump's broader push for mid-decade redistricting in GOP-controlled states.</p>

          <p>The parents of 7-month-old Emmanuel Haro, Jake Mitchell Haro and Rebecca Renee Haro, have appeared in a California court, charged with their child's murder and making a false police report. Emmanuel was reported missing nearly two weeks ago, after his mother initially claimed she was assaulted and the baby abducted. Authorities now presume the child is deceased and are actively searching for his remains, having conducted extensive searches with cadaver dogs. Both parents are held on $1 million bail, with the father having a previous conviction for willful cruelty to a child. The case has deeply impacted the community as the search for justice continues.</p>

          <p>China is preparing for the 80th anniversary of its World War II victory over Japan, using the occasion to showcase the People’s Liberation Army's (PLA) strength and solidarity. However, the event is shadowed by the recent removal of former navy chief of staff Li Hanjun due to corruption allegations. While some question if the ongoing anti-corruption drive, a key focus for President Xi Jinping, might hinder the PLA's war readiness, others argue it demonstrates Beijing's resolve to build a "capable of winning wars" force. The upcoming parade is expected to reveal the latest weaponry and a new generation of military commanders.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's drastic cuts to USAID have led to a "fire sale" of valuable equipment, including medical supplies, vehicles, and educational materials, from over 5,000 canceled foreign-aid projects. Millions of dollars worth of assets are being auctioned off at a significant loss or simply abandoned, with little guidance from leadership. This chaotic closeout, driven by project terminations and lack of support, raises concerns about wasted taxpayer money and potential national security risks, as auctioned items could fall into undesirable hands. The American pullback from humanitarian aid is projected to result in over 14 million additional deaths by 2030, leaving a significant vacuum for other organizations to fill.</p>

Despite the potential for market unease, traders continue to anticipate a September rate cut, with a high probability of a 0.25% reduction. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's recent remarks at Jackson Hole also hinted at potential policy adjustments, suggesting a rate cut could be on the horizon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lawyers for former special counsel Jack Smith have strongly defended him against an ethics probe into his handling of investigations against President Trump, calling the allegations "imaginary and unfounded." The Office of the Special Counsel launched the probe into potential Hatch Act violations, which limits political activities of federal employees, following a complaint from GOP Senator Tom Cotton. Smith's attorneys assert that his prosecutorial decisions were based solely on evidence and legal guidelines, not political influence, and that the notion of justice yielding to politics is antithetical to the rule of law. The investigation is seen as politically motivated, especially given the context of other Justice Department employees investigating Trump being fired.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the removal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, citing allegations of mortgage fraud, an unprecedented move challenging the central bank's independence. Cook, appointed by Joe Biden, has vowed to sue, stating Trump lacks the authority to remove her "for cause" under the Federal Reserve Act and will not resign. The Fed itself issued a statement emphasizing governors' long, fixed terms and removal protections as vital safeguards for monetary policy. This action, which could allow Trump to replace Cook with someone more favorable to lower interest rates, has caused long-dated US government securities to sell off, signaling investor concern over the Fed's credibility.

Tragically, a 60-year-old contract firefighter died from a cardiac emergency while battling Montana's Bivens Creek fire.

          <p>Short-term Treasury yields fell while long-term yields rose following President Trump's attempted removal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, indicating investors are betting on lower near-term rates but higher long-term inflation. Trump cited mortgage fraud allegations, which Cook denies, vowing to challenge her removal. Analysts suggest Trump is effectively usurping the Fed's forward guidance, leading to a steeper yield curve. This market reaction implies investor concern that a politically influenced Fed might be less vigilant against inflation in the future, prompting a decline in the U.S. dollar and highlighting the significant impact of political interference on financial stability.
