        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal agents in Brighton Park, Chicago, shot a woman after their vehicles were allegedly rammed and boxed in by ten cars during a patrol. The Department of Homeland Security stated agents opened fire when a driver displayed a semi-automatic weapon, injuring the woman who was later released from the hospital. DHS claimed the woman was previously named in an intelligence bulletin for doxxing and posting threats against ICE online, though no corroborating information was released. This incident sparked significant protests, with local officials and Chicago police disputing DHS's initial location claims and accusations of non-cooperation, highlighting a tense and controversial situation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Oregon issued a temporary restraining order, effectively blocking the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland. The judge, a Trump appointee, ruled that the President lacked a "colorable basis" to federalize the Guard, citing evidence that demonstrations at the Portland immigration facility were not significantly violent or disruptive. This decision supports the state's lawsuit arguing against federal authority to deploy the Guard without local consent. The order, set to expire on October 18th, underscores the complex legal intersection of federal-state relations and military involvement in domestic law enforcement, affirming the rule of law.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Long queues for store openings and limited-edition items are increasingly becoming a social phenomenon in the UK, transforming waiting from an inconvenience into an activity in itself. People are embracing queuing as an exciting and exhilarating experience, fostering camaraderie and offering opportunities to meet new friends. Psychologists attribute this trend to the anticipation of a reward, which triggers a dopamine release, alongside the allure of exclusivity for "hard to get" items. Brands are actively leveraging this by creating "experiential marketing" events with free products, unique stock, and TikTok-worthy experiences, often using the queue itself as content generation.</p>

          <p>WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert is facing renewed scrutiny after past comments about superstar Caitlin Clark's substantial off-court earnings resurfaced, following her denial of recent alleged remarks to a player. Engelbert had previously stated Clark would earn millions in endorsements, echoing themes that players "should be grateful" for the league's platform. While denying specific allegations about Clark, Engelbert acknowledged that if players feel unappreciated, the league and she personally "have to do better." This controversy, which has drawn backlash from fans and players, unfolds amid ongoing negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement, potentially impacting future league relations.</p>

Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, marking a significant historical moment. Curry, 53, who grew up Catholic and entered Lutheran ministry through an unconventional program, hopes his leadership will encourage greater diversity within the church. He will navigate challenges common to mainline Protestant denominations, including declining membership and ongoing theological debates, such as LGBTQ+ inclusion. This article highlights a pivotal step towards a more inclusive future for the ELCA, emphasizing the importance of diverse representation in religious leadership.</p>

          <p>Thousands of people defiantly participated in a banned Pride march in Pecs, Hungary, challenging a police prohibition on LGBTQ+ rallies. The demonstration directly confronted Prime Minister Viktor Orban's ultra-conservative government, which has increasingly restricted LGBTQ+ rights and passed a law allowing Pride march bans under the pretext of "protecting children." Several Members of the European Parliament joined the rally in solidarity, highlighting growing concerns about the restriction of fundamental human rights in the country. Despite the threat of fines up to €500, protesters waved rainbow and EU flags, openly condemning the government's actions as a "dictatorship."</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has vehemently condemned the Trump administration's intent to federalize 300 Illinois National Guard members, calling the demand "absolutely outrageous and un-American." The White House confirmed the plan, citing "ongoing violent riots and lawlessness" that local leaders allegedly failed to quell, specifically referencing clashes near an ICE facility in Broadview. Pritzker, however, asserted there was no need for military troops in Illinois and refused to deploy them, stating the federal action was about "control" and a "manufactured performance," not public safety.

          <p>"Freshers' flu," a pervasive cold-like illness, rapidly spreads among university students due to a perfect storm of new viral exposures and compromised immune systems. Experts explain that the influx of thousands of students from diverse locations into close quarters creates a "mixing pot" of unfamiliar respiratory viruses. Compounding this, factors like late nights, poor diet, the significant stress of settling into a new environment, and increased alcohol consumption during freshers' week severely weaken the body's natural immune responses.

The ruling by US District Judge Rudolph Contreras reinforces an earlier 2021 court order that explicitly prohibited such actions, requiring these individuals to be released to the "least restrictive setting available" if they are not deemed a danger or flight risk. This decision counters recent reports of ICE instructing shelters to detain soon-to-be 18-year-olds and addresses accusations of the administration reviving family separation tactics.
