          <p>A 34-year-old Wyandotte County Sheriff's Deputy, Elijah Ming, was shot and killed while responding to a domestic violence call in Kansas City, Kansas. The nine-year veteran was assisting a woman moving out of her home when a man inside opened fire without warning. The suspect, who also fired on other responding officers, was wounded in a subsequent gunfight and taken into custody after a brief standoff.

          <p>CBS's decision to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in 2026 has raised questions about the viability of the traditional late-night television format. While the network cited financial pressures, with the show reportedly losing $40 million annually, the cancellation's timing has drawn scrutiny. The article explores the industry's shift towards streaming, declining linear TV ad revenue, and the high costs of production. The future of the format may hinge on upcoming decisions, such as Disney's contract renewal for "Jimmy Kimmel Live."</p>

          <p>During talks at his Turnberry golf resort in Scotland, President Donald Trump indicated a trade deal with the European Union was close, though he maintained the chances were "50-50." Meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Trump highlighted that a few sticking points remained but a deal could be reached quickly if overcome. The discussions are being closely watched by global markets, as a successful agreement could stabilize the €1.4 trillion in transatlantic trade that has been disrupted by tariff disputes. Trump also noted that pharmaceuticals would likely be excluded from any deal.</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic argues that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's recent move to weaken his country's anti-corruption agencies is a direct consequence of a shift in U.S. foreign policy under the Trump administration. It posits that by dismantling programs promoting good governance and showing tolerance for global kleptocracy, the U.S. has removed the external pressure that previously encouraged reform in countries like Ukraine. The piece suggests that this new "Trump Doctrine" protects autocrats and normalizes corruption, creating a global environment where even leaders like Zelensky feel empowered to protect allies from investigation.</p>

          <p>A group of 21 Democratic senators, led by Chris Van Hollen, is calling on the Trump administration to stop funding the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a private organization distributing food in Gaza. The letter to the Secretary of State expresses grave concerns over the GHF's methods, which involve armed contractors and have been linked to hundreds of civilian deaths. The senators are demanding the U.S. resume support for UN-led aid mechanisms amid a worsening hunger crisis, with agencies like UNICEF warning that supplies for malnourished children are nearly depleted. The U.S. has pledged $30 million to the GHF.</p>

          <p>Megan Horneman, CIO of Verdence Capital Advisors, has expressed concern that the stock market is overly complacent and trading at unsustainably high levels. She warns that investors are not adequately factoring in risks such as the upcoming U.S. trade tariff deadline, uncertainty around Federal Reserve policy, and overbought technical conditions, particularly in growth stocks. Horneman suggests that a "valuation correction" could occur if expected interest rate cuts do not materialize and trade issues persist. While cautious in the short term, she remains a long-term bull and sees potential pullbacks as buying opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has initiated a daily "tactical pause" in fighting in parts of Gaza to allow for the distribution of humanitarian aid as the hunger crisis deepens. The move, which includes establishing secure land routes for aid agencies, comes after intense international criticism over the risk of famine and images of emaciated children. While the UN welcomed the step, it reiterated that a full ceasefire is necessary to reach everyone in need. The announcement was made as aid trucks from Egypt and Jordan began moving toward Gaza, though fighting continued in other areas.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's private visit to his Turnberry golf resort in Scotland was met with protests on Saturday. Dozens of demonstrators gathered to express their opposition to the U.S. president, holding signs and chanting, with one protester telling reporters that many locals "loathe him." While the protesters were kept at a distance from the president's golf game, hundreds more gathered for a separate demonstration in Edinburgh. The protests criticized Trump and also British Prime Minister Keir Starmer for a recent trade deal with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Cybersecurity experts and federal agencies are warning of a significant increase in "quishing," a scam where criminals use malicious QR codes to steal personal and financial information. Hackers place fake QR code stickers on everything from parking meters to promotional flyers, tricking people into visiting phishing websites or downloading malware. The FTC has issued a warning, and a recent study found that 26% of all malicious links are now sent via QR codes. Experts advise the public to be cautious and avoid scanning unexpected codes, as this low-effort tactic has a high return for cybercriminals.</p>

          <p>Preparations are moving forward to retrofit a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet, donated by the Qatari royal family, for President Trump's use as Air Force One. Senior U.S. officials have reportedly seen the schematics for the plane, which is valued at $400 million and will be given to the presidential library after Trump's term. The gift has raised constitutional questions regarding the emoluments clause, which prohibits a president from accepting gifts from foreign states without congressional consent. The plane will require extensive and costly security checks and renovations before it is ready for presidential use.</p>

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that President Trump is open to a trade deal with the European Union but requires a "good enough" offer to prevent the imposition of 30% tariffs on August 1. Speaking ahead of crucial talks between Trump and the European Commission president, Lutnick emphasized that the EU must open its markets further to U.S. exports. His comments suggest a path to an agreement exists, but it remains unclear what specific concessions would satisfy the administration. The president himself has maintained that the chances of reaching a deal are roughly 50-50.</p>

          <p>The underperformance of the Consumer Discretionary stock sector is signaling that investors believe many U.S. households are reaching a financial breaking point. While the broader S&P 500 is at record highs, this sector is nearly flat for the year, reflecting concerns about high interest rates and shifting spending patterns. Analysts point to a "K-shaped economy," where high-income households continue to spend while lower-income consumers pull back. This suggests a fragile outlook for consumer spending for the remainder of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The incident has highlighted a national divide, with some condemning the protest as racist and harmful to tourism, while others support it as a legitimate expression of political dissent.

The plan allows for up to $5,000 in annual contributions and offers a one-time $1,000 government contribution for children born in a specific timeframe. However, the article suggests that 529 education savings plans and custodial Roth IRAs provide more significant, tax-advantaged growth for long-term goals.
