          <p>Local officials reported that an Israeli airstrike on the European Gaza hospital in Khan Younis resulted in at least six deaths and dozens of injuries. According to local sources, Israeli warplanes dropped six bombs on the hospital's inner courtyard and surrounding area. The Israeli military claimed that it had conducted a "precise strike" on a Hamas base beneath the hospital. The injured and deceased were transported to Nasser Hospital, which had also been struck earlier in the day. The situation in Gaza remains tense as conflict continues to impact civilian infrastructure and healthcare facilities. </p>

          <p>Phoenix Suns star Kevin Durant posted a brief reaction on X to the NBA Draft Lottery results, which saw the Dallas Mavericks land the top pick despite having only a 1.8% chance. Durant's tweet highlighted the potential stress tanking places on an organization, given the unlikelihood of securing a top pick even with poor performance. The article also notes the Suns' current crossroads, needing to decide whether to rebuild after an unsuccessful season despite having stars such as Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal. The NBA lottery odds have flattened in recent years, which makes it more unlikely that teams who hit the reset button will end up being rewarded with the rights to a top three selection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>State leaders across the United States are expressing concerns about potential budgetary challenges stemming from proposed federal aid cuts by the Trump administration. Governors fear that reductions in federal funding for infrastructure, disaster response, education, and social programs could leave states unable to maintain essential public services. Republicans argue that states should bear more financial responsibility, but state officials warn that they cannot absorb significant federal cuts without drastic measures, such as reducing healthcare access for low-income families. The proposed budget cuts, including those targeting education and environmental protection, reflect a broader effort to revitalize federalism by shifting financial burdens to state and local governments.</p>

HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. supports the move, echoing his long-standing concerns about fluoride's safety.

While Trump calls it "a great gesture," some Democrats argue it violates the U.S. Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which prohibits elected officials from accepting gifts from foreign states without congressional approval. The plane, intended for use as Air Force One, would be transferred to Trump's presidential library after his presidency. The White House maintains that any donation would comply with the law, but experts suggest the arrangement raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have announced a temporary reduction in tariffs, easing trade tensions and boosting stock prices. Under the agreement, the U.S. will reduce tariffs on goods from China to 30 percent, while China will reciprocate. Economists warn that the short-term nature of the deal limits its benefits, as companies remain hesitant to make long-term investments due to ongoing uncertainty. The agreement is an executive action, not a legally binding treaty, meaning tariffs could be reinstated or increased after 90 days. The move signals a potential de-escalation in the trade war, but long-term economic uncertainty persists.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite signs of economic improvement, such as easing inflation and a steady job market, credit card debt forgiveness remains a relevant option for many Americans struggling with high-interest balances. Experts argue that economic improvement doesn't always translate to immediate relief for households burdened by debt. Credit card interest rates remain elevated, making it difficult for borrowers to make significant progress on their balances. Debt forgiveness can provide targeted relief by reducing the debt obligation and offering a path out of a seemingly endless cycle of minimum payments and compounding interest. While debt forgiveness has trade-offs, it can be a viable solution for those overwhelmed by their balances and unable to find relief through other means.</p>

          <p>Israeli fighter jets conducted airstrikes on Khan Younis in an attempt to kill Mohammad Sinwar, a top Hamas commander, according to Israeli military officials.

Sinwar is believed to be a senior Hamas military leader and the brother of Yahya Sinwar, who masterminded the October 7, 2023, attacks.</p>

          <p>DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria suggests Alphabet (Google) should consider a "big bang breakup" of its businesses to unlock greater value for investors. Luria argues that Google's current market capitalization is undervalued due to concerns about its search engine's dominance in the face of AI chatbots. By spinning off YouTube, Search, Google Cloud, Waymo, and its AI segments into separate entities, Luria estimates the combined value of these businesses could reach $3.7 trillion, compared to Google's current market cap below $2 trillion. He believes that individual businesses would trade at comparable levels to their peers, with Waymo comparable to Uber, Google Cloud to Snowflake, YouTube to Netflix, and Googleâ€™s TPU business to Nvidia.

The Dodgers' coaching staff is exploring potential mechanical adjustments and pitch conviction issues to help Sasaki regain his velocity and improve his overall effectiveness.

          <p>Inflation retreated in April, driven by lower prices for consumer staples, but economists warn that tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump could reignite inflationary pressures. While the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.3% in April, the smallest annual increase since February 2021, tariffs are expected to add to consumer costs. Current tariff policies could cost the average U.S. household an extra $2,800, according to a Yale Budget Lab report. Economists anticipate that the impact of tariffs on inflation will become more noticeable in the coming months, creating uncertainty about the long-term inflation outlook.</p>
