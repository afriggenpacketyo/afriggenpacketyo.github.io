          <p>Police in London arrested 474 people at a demonstration in Parliament Square supporting Palestine Action, a group recently banned under UK terrorism laws. The mass arrests, the largest by the Metropolitan Police in a decade, occurred after protesters displayed signs of support, which is now a criminal offense. The government defended the ban and the police response, citing national security, while human rights groups like Amnesty International criticized the arrests as a disproportionate threat to freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>Protests have erupted across Israel in opposition to the government's plan to expand its military offensive into Gaza City. Demonstrators, including families of hostages still held by Hamas, argue the plan endangers the lives of both hostages and soldiers. The protests reflect growing public and military dissent against Prime Minister Netanyahu's strategy, with polls indicating most Israelis favor a deal to release hostages and end the war.</p>

          <p>Scientists have confirmed that a meteorite fragment that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, is approximately 4.5 billion years old, making it more ancient than our planet. The rock, identified as a chondrite, created a loud boom as it entered the atmosphere before a piece struck the residence. This event marks the 27th meteorite recovery in Georgia, and researchers hope its analysis will contribute to understanding and guarding against future asteroid threats.</p>

Many residents, particularly the elderly, rely on Ukrainian pensions and savings to survive, as local wages are insufficient. The occupying authorities are also pressuring residents to accept Russian citizenship to access essential services like healthcare, creating an environment of coercion and uncertainty for those who remain.</p>

          <p>In the investigation into the death of Minnesota nurse Alexandra Pennig, a small metal piece from a bathroom door lock found under her body proved to be the pivotal clue. Initially reported as a suicide by her colleague Matthew Ecker, detectives suspected foul play. The placement of the lock piece suggested the door was broken down before Pennig was shot, contradicting Ecker's story and leading to his conviction for second-degree murder and a 30-year sentence.</p>

          <p>Actress Lindsay Lohan has stated that she and her husband chose to raise their family in Dubai to escape the intense media scrutiny she faced in Hollywood. Lohan revealed that her experiences with paparazzi in her youth were terrifying and led to extreme PTSD, a key factor in her decision to live abroad. She believes that social media has given celebrities more control over their own narratives compared to the early 2000s, but she values the privacy and safety that life in Dubai provides for her son.</p>

          <p>A major tax and spending bill signed by President Trump is becoming a central point of contention for both Republican and Democratic lawmakers during the August congressional recess. Republicans are promoting its tax relief and immigration enforcement provisions, while Democrats are highlighting its cuts to Medicaid and the expiration of Affordable Care Act subsidies. The legislation's unpopularity in recent polls is fueling Democratic hopes of using it as a key issue for the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

          <p>A provision in President Trump's new tax bill creating a federal tax deduction for up to $25,000 in tip income has left many service workers with questions.

          <p>An Atlantic staff writer highlights the 1958 satirical novel "The Rise of the Meritocracy" by Michael Young as a particularly relevant read today. The book, which introduced the term "meritocracy," was intended as a critique, envisioning a dystopian future where society is stratified by educational achievement rather than class. This dystopian vision culminates in a populist rebellion against the meritocratic elite, a theme that resonates with current political and social discussions.</p>

          <p>This article explores a pragmatic approach to ethical eating for individuals concerned about animal welfare but who find a strict vegetarian or vegan diet difficult to maintain. It suggests a "reducetarian" diet, which focuses on reducing animal suffering by making more conscious choices, rather than complete elimination. This includes opting for pasture-raised meat over factory-farmed products, eating larger animals like cows instead of chickens to minimize the number of lives taken, and being mindful of misleading welfare labels on products.</p>

          <p>In her book "SLIP," author Mallary Tenore Tarpley details her lifelong struggle with an eating disorder, moving from a pursuit of "perfect" recovery to accepting life in a "middle place." Tarpley argues that the all-or-nothing approach to recovery can be detrimental, and that embracing setbacks as part of the process has allowed her to live a full life. The book combines memoir with research to explore this nuanced perspective, particularly relevant as diet culture re-emerges with trends like GLP-1 drugs.</p>

Observers point to his calls to prosecute political opponents, firing of government statisticians, pressure on media and academic institutions, and efforts to gerrymander electoral maps as evidence of a systematic dismantling of democratic norms.

Experts attribute this to a lack of cooperation from California's state and local law enforcement, which forces ICE to conduct more visible and labor-intensive street arrests rather than relying on transfers from jails and prisons, which are more common in Republican-led states.</p>

          <p>The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to hold an emergency session to discuss Israel's plan to expand military operations and take control of Gaza City. The proposal from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has drawn widespread global condemnation and sparked protests within Israel. The meeting was requested by several European council members, reflecting international concern that the move risks violating humanitarian law and escalating the conflict.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is dismissing the asylum applications of dozens of immigrants, some of whom have been waiting for years, because they did not undergo a mandatory "credible fear" interview upon entering the U.S. This screening was often skipped during the surge of arrivals in previous years due to a shortage of asylum officers. Now, these applicants are being told their cases are closed and they must start the process over, leaving them without work permits and facing potential detention.</p>

          <p>A research team in China has developed a new set of genome editing tools that can precisely manipulate large DNA fragments, from thousands to millions of base pairs. This breakthrough, called programmable chromosome engineering (PCE), makes a decade-old gene editing technique much more efficient and easier to use. The advance is expected to accelerate crop improvement, offer new avenues for treating genetic diseases, and aid in the development of artificial chromosomes for synthetic biology.</p>

He defines this breakthrough as the point when a robot can perform a complex task, like cleaning a room, in a completely new and unfamiliar environment. While he believes hardware is sufficient, Wang states that the crucial missing piece is more advanced "AI for embodied intelligence," suggesting current models are not yet adequate for the task.</p>

          <p>Residents in the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Porter Ranch and Granada Hills are being asked to cease all non-essential water use, including flushing toilets, due to a major water service outage. The disruption, affecting about 9,200 households, began when a critical water control valve broke, and has been compounded by a subsequent failure of a temporary bypass pipe. Officials warn that continued water use is depleting pressure in the system, which could delay complex repairs and the full restoration of service.</p>

The rainy season in July and August frequently brings severe weather to the region. However, this year's storms were somewhat unusual in that they primarily affected the northern areas of the capital, whereas previous major floods in 2016 and 2023 were concentrated in the city's southern districts.</p>
