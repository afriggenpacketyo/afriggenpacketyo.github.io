          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal came ashore in South Carolina with sustained winds of 50 mph, though it had reached 60 mph earlier. The storm is causing scattered showers, thunderstorms, and the potential for flash flooding across both North and South Carolina, with rainfall totals expected to reach 2 to 4 inches and isolated amounts up to 6 inches. A Tropical Storm Warning remains in effect for a portion of the coastline, including Myrtle Beach. The storm is forecast to weaken into a tropical depression as it moves further inland and is expected to dissipate by Monday.</p>

          <p>A vehicle crashed into a strip mall in Herriman, Utah, leading to a massive fire and a subsequent explosion that launched the building's roof into the sky. The incident resulted in several injuries and prompted temporary evacuations for residents within a one-mile radius due to concerns over a gas leak. Herriman Police and Unified Fire responded to the scene, closing a major road to manage the situation. The evacuation order was lifted in the early morning hours after the immediate danger from the gas leak had passed, allowing residents to return home.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Education Secretary has stated that the government's recent U-turn on a £5 billion welfare reform package has made future spending decisions more challenging. This reversal puts pressure on the upcoming budget and diminishes the likelihood of scrapping the two-child benefit cap, a policy Labour had considered lifting to combat child poverty. The policy climbdown, forced by a rebellion of Labour MPs, means that removing the cap now comes at a significant cost. The government insists it is supporting families in other ways amid the cost of living crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two months after losing their position in the German government, the Green Party is struggling to redefine its identity and role in opposition. Party leaders have put forth a strategy paper aiming to reconnect with the public, particularly after facing criticism for policies like the controversial heating law. The party is dealing with internal challenges, a lack of personnel in eastern Germany, and the perception of being out of touch with everyday concerns. While they aim to refocus on their core issue of climate protection, the current political climate makes it a difficult topic to champion effectively.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new data sorting system using memristors, a type of electronic component that combines memory and processing functions. This innovation aims to overcome the "Von Neumann bottleneck," a fundamental limit on data transfer speeds in traditional computer architectures that separates memory from the CPU. The team from Peking University and the Chinese Institute for Brain Research built a prototype that demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and energy efficiency. This technology could enhance performance in demanding fields like artificial intelligence, web searches, and scientific computing.</p>

          <p>A California family who supported Donald Trump's immigration policies is expressing shock after the Canadian-born mother, Cynthia Olivera, was detained by ICE during her permanent residency interview. Olivera, who was brought to the US without authorization as a child, has three US-born children and no criminal record. Her husband, a US citizen, says he voted for Trump believing the crackdown would target violent criminals, not his wife. Despite having a work permit, Olivera is now in a detention center awaiting deportation to Canada, highlighting the administration's broad approach to enforcing immigration laws.</p>

The data, dated to the end of 2023, shows that nearly 375,000 of these individuals hold jobs that are more substantial than minor side employment. Dietmar Bartsch of the Left Party highlighted the trend, suggesting many older Germans work out of necessity rather than choice.

The campaign allegedly began after the jets were used in clashes between India and Pakistan, with Chinese defense attaches spreading doubts about the aircraft's performance to current and potential buyers. The effort was reportedly aimed at persuading nations like Indonesia to cancel orders and encouraging others to purchase Chinese-made planes instead. While French officials have not directly linked the online disinformation to the Chinese government, they assert the lobbying by embassy officials was a clear attempt to damage the Rafale's reputation.</p>

The owner, Andrew Board, personally stopped the shoplifter and brought him back to the shop. However, police dealt with the offense through a community resolution, which required the thief to pay for the stolen goods and banned him from the store, but did not result in a criminal conviction. Board argues this sends the wrong signal and fails as a deterrent, reflecting a wider national issue where a majority of reported shoplifting offenses do not lead to charges.</p>

          <p>Monasteries and convents across Germany are facing a significant decline, with dozens closing each year due to a shrinking number of members. The number of convents dropped from over 1,600 to under 1,000 in a decade, with the population of nuns and monks falling dramatically since its peak in 1960. This trend is attributed to the church's diminished influence and increased professional opportunities for women outside religious orders.

          <p>The death toll from catastrophic flash floods in central Texas has risen to at least 50, with recovery efforts ongoing for dozens of missing people. The disaster, triggered by torrential rains, caused the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes, devastating communities and a Christian summer camp. Among the missing are 27 girls from Camp Mystic. The article notes the event highlights the increasing frequency of extreme weather due to the climate crisis and raises questions about the adequacy of warnings and the impact of federal budget cuts on the National Weather Service.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from China indicates that genetic factors play a significant role in shaping brain criticality, the crucial balance between neural excitation and inhibition. This balance is widely believed to enhance the brain's ability to process information effectively. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, established a strong link between brain criticality and cognitive functions, suggesting a shared genetic foundation. These findings define brain criticality as a biological phenotype, creating new opportunities for research into brain function and the origins of neurological and mental dysfunctions.</p>

          <p>Chilean tennis player Nicolas Jarry is preparing to face Britain's Cameron Norrie in the fourth round of Wimbledon after a challenging year marked by significant health issues. Jarry has been battling vestibular neuritis, a condition affecting the nerve connecting the ear and brain, which causes severe vertigo and balance problems. The condition emerged when he was ranked in the world's top 20 and has since caused his ranking to fall to 143. His emotional victory to reach this stage at his favorite tournament matches the achievement of his grandfather, who reached the same round in 1974.</p>

          <p>In April 2022, murder charges against Barry Morphew in the disappearance of his wife Suzanne were dismissed just before trial, though prosecutors reserved the right to refile. The dismissal came after the judge sanctioned the prosecution for repeatedly failing to turn over potentially exculpatory evidence. This included barring key expert witnesses and revealing the discovery of unknown male DNA in Suzanne's car that matched profiles from unsolved sexual assault cases. The article recounts the case's bizarre twists, including a "chipmunk alibi," a tranquilizer gun theory, and Suzanne's affair, which complicated the initial investigation.</p>

          <p>Barry Morphew has been indicted for the first-degree murder of his wife, Suzanne, for a second time, following the discovery of her remains in a shallow grave. The new indictment reveals that her body had likely been moved at least twice after her death. A key piece of new evidence is the presence of a wildlife tranquilizer compound in her bone marrow, a drug that Barry Morphew had access to and admitted to using on deer. The initial charges against him were dropped in 2022, but this new forensic evidence has led to his re-arrest and a new indictment in the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made his first public appearance since the recent 12-day war with Israel, attending a religious mourning ceremony in Tehran. His absence during the conflict had fueled speculation that he was in seclusion. The war, which included Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear sites and a massive Iranian missile barrage against Israel, has left over 900 dead in Iran and caused significant damage. In the aftermath, Iran has suspended cooperation with the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, further escalating tensions over its nuclear program, which Israel feared was aimed at developing atomic weapons.</p>

          <p>Japan is set to export used navy destroyers to the Philippines in a move designed to bolster deterrence against China's maritime activities, according to a report. The plan involves six Abukuma-class destroyer escorts, which are smaller destroyers armed with anti-ship and anti-submarine missiles. This transfer marks a significant step in the growing military cooperation between the two U.S. allies, who both face challenges from Beijing's assertive actions in the region. To navigate Japan's pacifist constitution, the deal will reportedly treat the outfitting of the ships for Manila as a joint development project.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the United Nations is facing a severe crisis as the US, its largest contributor, reviews its funding and membership in international organizations. The author contends that a potential 87% cut in US funding under the Trump administration, combined with declining support from other nations, threatens the UN's ability to conduct humanitarian, peacekeeping, and development work. The piece warns that the failure of the UN would leave a vacuum filled by the "law of the jungle," leading to a more dangerous, poorer, and less stable world, and urges democracies to fight to save the institution.</p>

          <p>A High Court ruling has found that investigations by MI5 into its own conduct were "deficient" after the agency admitted to providing false evidence to three courts. The case centers on a violent MI5 agent, known as X, and the agency's attempts to cover up its actions, including lying about whether it had confirmed his status to a BBC journalist. Secretly obtained material revealed that MI5 withheld key evidence, misrepresented officers' recollections, and ignored written records that contradicted its court testimony. The court has ordered a new, more robust investigation and will consider contempt of court proceedings against individuals involved.</p>
