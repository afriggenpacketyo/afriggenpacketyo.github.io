        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Campbell's CEO Mick Beekhuizen has noted a significant rise in consumers cooking at home, reaching levels not seen since the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This trend, observed across all income brackets in the meals and beverages category, suggests that people are tightening their budgets due to economic uncertainties. The increase in home cooking is reminiscent of the period when the pandemic caused widespread economic disruption and altered spending habits. This shift in consumer behavior comes as economists and Wall Street analysts are closely monitoring the U.S. economy amidst concerns about recession risks stemming from tariff policies.</p>

          <p>Mount Etna, located on the Italian island of Sicily, has erupted, releasing hot ash and lava, though officials report no immediate danger to local residents or air travel. The volcano department of Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology noted increasing intensity in the explosions before reporting a lava fountain emerging from the southeast crater. The eruption was triggered by the collapse of part of Etna's southeast crater, leading to lava flows, but tour groups were restricted from the summit area as a precaution. Mount Etna is considered Europe's most active volcano, experiencing frequent eruptions that typically cause minor disruptions such as volcanic dust covering nearby towns.</p>

China has countered these claims, asserting that the U.S. is instigating new economic and trade tensions. The potential dialogue between the two leaders offers a glimmer of hope for resolving ongoing trade disputes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Harvard University study, tracking nearly 50,000 women over 30 years, indicates that daily coffee consumption may contribute to healthy aging, particularly in maintaining mental sharpness and physical strength. The study, presented at NUTRITION 2025, found that middle-aged women who consumed caffeinated coffee experienced these benefits, while decaf coffee and tea did not show the same effects. Researchers noted that each additional cup of coffee was linked to a 2% to 5% greater chance of healthier aging, emphasizing that the health benefits appeared specific to coffee's unique combination of bioactive compounds. While acknowledging the study's limitations, researchers suggest moderate coffee intake can be part of a healthy lifestyle when combined with other positive behaviors.</p>

Emelie Vanasse, one of the first women to serve as an Army infantry officer and graduate from Ranger School, emphasizes that she met the same standards as men. While acknowledging the importance of physical fitness, she argues that lethality extends beyond physical capabilities, encompassing tactical skills, decision-making, and leadership.

          <p>Mount Etna in Italy erupted, sending a large ash cloud into the sky and prompting aviation alerts. The eruption occurred at Etna's southeast crater, with the volcanic cloud reaching an estimated height of 21,325 feet. While officials halted tourist visits to the volcano, there were no immediate reports of impact on the local population. The aviation alerts were later eased as volcanic activity and ash emissions decreased.</p>

          <p>A man has been charged with a federal hate crime after allegedly attacking a crowd at a Colorado rally for Israeli hostages, injuring eight people. Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, is accused of using a makeshift flamethrower and incendiary devices, shouting ‚ÄúFree Palestine‚Äù during the attack. The FBI said Soliman told police he planned the attack for a year and had specifically targeted what he described as the ‚ÄúZionist group‚Äù.</p>

          <p>Mexican citizens participated in the nation's first-ever judicial elections, a move championed by President Claudia Sheinbaum but criticized as a power grab by the ruling party. Voters chose from thousands of candidates for federal and regional judgeships, a task complicated by the sheer number of names on the ballot and a lack of public familiarity with the contenders. Critics fear the election will lead to a partisan judiciary vulnerable to corruption and political influence, while supporters argue it will help curb criminal cartels and promote democracy.</p>

          <p>US manufacturers have warned that Donald Trump‚Äôs trade war is negatively affecting production, leading to a decline in the manufacturing sector. The ISM purchasing managers‚Äô index fell below 50, signaling contraction, with companies citing uncertainty and rising costs due to tariffs. The dollar has weakened against other currencies, nearing a three-year low against sterling. Concerns about the economic impact of Trump's trade policies have intensified, particularly after the announcement of a 50% tariff on steel and accusations against China for violating a trade truce (not investment advice).</p>
