          <p>Federal agents arrested Milwaukee Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan for allegedly assisting an undocumented immigrant, Eduardo Flores Ruiz, in evading arrest after he appeared in her courtroom.

A U.S. Marshals Service spokeswoman confirmed Dugan's arrest on courthouse property, and she is in custody pending her presentment in U.S. District Court.

          <p>Online scammers are increasingly using 'wrong number' text messages, enhanced by AI, to deceive phone users into divulging personal information and financial account details. These seemingly harmless texts are designed to validate active mobile numbers and build relationships, ultimately leading to 'pig butchering scams' where victims are slowly manipulated into giving up their life savings. In 2024, consumers lost $470 million to scams initiated via text messages, a five-fold increase since 2020. Experts advise ignoring and marking such messages as spam to avoid becoming a target.</p>

          <p>A recent poll indicates that nearly two-thirds of Americans disapprove of President Trump's tariffs on international trade, primarily due to concerns about rising inflation. Even nearly half of Republicans believe the tariffs will negatively impact inflation. While a majority think the tariffs could create manufacturing jobs in the U.S., a larger percentage believe they will negatively affect America's economic leadership globally. The poll underscores public anxiety about the economic consequences of the tariffs, particularly regarding their potential to drive up prices.</p>

          <p>Reports suggest the United States proposed that Ukraine recognize Russia's control over Crimea as part of a ceasefire agreement. However, Ukraine insists that doing so would violate its constitution. An analysis by the Robert Lansing Institute for Global Threats and Democracies Studies outlines risks of such recognition, including undermining international law, alienating allies, and provoking internal political fallout. Recognizing the annexation would be a seismic shift in US foreign policy and damage the credibility of US support for democracy and the rule of law globally.</p>

          <p>'On Swift Horses' is a romantic melodrama set in the 1950s, exploring themes of lust and longing in a postwar love triangle. The film follows Muriel, who marries Lee and moves to Southern California, while Lee's brother, Julius, becomes involved with a man in Las Vegas. The movie delves into the characters' desires and secrets but struggles to fully explore the psychological depth beneath the surface. Despite some episodic management, the acting, particularly by Daisy Edgar-Jones and Will Poulter, is a saving grace.</p>

          <p>Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, known for his extreme right-wing views, addressed a gathering at Yale University. He defended his policies, including restricting food for Palestinian inmates, and expressed support for President Trump’s plan to clear out Gaza. Ben-Gvir's remarks and history of supporting violence against Arabs continue to draw criticism. He dismissed concerns about starving Palestinians as 'naive' and refused to apologize for his past admiration of a mass murderer.</p>

          <p>The UN World Food Programme (WFP) has depleted all its food stocks in Gaza after a seven-week Israeli blockade, delivering its last remaining food to hot meals kitchens. The UN says Israel is obligated under international law to ensure supplies for the 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza. Severe shortages of medicine, medical supplies, and fuel are also impacting hospitals and water production. The WFP warns that food prices have skyrocketed, and without urgent action to open borders for aid, its critical assistance may be forced to end.</p>
