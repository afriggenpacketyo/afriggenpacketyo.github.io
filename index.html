Bueckers, who was the first player selected in the WNBA Draft, suggested that there was a reason for the Mavericks' good fortune. The NBA lottery odds have been flattened in recent years, making it more difficult for teams who are rebuilding to land a top-three selection.

          <p>House Republicans are pushing forward with legislation to enact President Trump's domestic agenda, including tax cuts, Medicaid adjustments, and food assistance modifications, despite facing opposition from Democrats and internal dissent. The legislation aims to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts while offsetting costs through cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. The plan faces challenges in the Senate, with some Republicans expressing concerns about its fiscal responsibility and proposed Medicaid cuts. Democrats are primarily criticizing the bill's health care provisions, estimating that millions of Americans could lose insurance coverage if it becomes law.</p>

          <p>A preliminary investigation by British maritime authorities into last year's Bayesian superyacht sinking off Sicily, which resulted in seven deaths, indicates that the yacht was likely capsized by a strong gust of wind and sank rapidly. The report highlights that the yacht's tall single mast, an uncommon design choice, increased its vulnerability to capsizing in high winds. The investigation also revealed that a deckhand delayed waking the captain as the storm approached, instead posting a video of the squall on social media. The report emphasizes the need for a thorough inspection of the hull to fully understand the causes of the sinking.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to permit foreign states to own up to 15% of British newspapers and news magazines, reversing a previous ban. This change follows a takeover bid of the Telegraph and the Spectator by RedBird IMI, backed by the Abu Dhabi ruling family. The government believes this move will help cash-strapped publishers raise vital funding while still protecting media plurality. The new law sets the threshold for State-Owned Investors (SOIs) at 15% of shares or voting rights in a newspaper or news magazine.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced his support for two bills aimed at streamlining housing development in urban areas by easing the permitting process. Newsom's revised state budget proposal will also include provisions to reform the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and remove other impediments to new housing construction. The governor praised Assemblymember Buffy Wicks and state Sen. Scott Wiener for sponsoring bills designed to expedite the development of infill projects. The proposal looks to force permit deadlines on the Coastal Commission, allow housing development projects over $100 million to use CEQA streamlining usually available to smaller projects, and create a fund, paid for by developers, to finance affordable housing near public transit.</p>

          <p>NASA engineers successfully revived long-dormant thrusters on Voyager 1, the farthest spacecraft from Earth, before a planned communications blackout. The fix addresses the accumulation of propellant residue in the backup thrusters, which could have led to their failure. The mission team had to take a risk by switching Voyager 1 to its primary roll thrusters and turning them on before attempting to fix and restart the heaters. This involved the possibility of an explosion if the thrusters were activated before the heaters were ready.</p>

While the CDC praised President Trump for his efforts, experts warn that the proposed cuts could undermine the momentum gained.

          <p>Missouri Republicans are putting abortion on the ballot again, seeking to overturn a recent decision by voters to protect abortion rights. The Republican-controlled legislature approved a measure that would ask voters to ban abortion except in medical emergencies or in cases of sexual assault reported within 48 hours and before 12 weeks of pregnancy. The measure will appear on the ballot in November 2026, though the governor could call for a special election sooner. The move bucks the trend of voters siding with abortion rights in recent ballot measures.</p>
