          <p>Intense storms brought severe flash flooding to the New York City metropolitan area, causing significant disruptions. Heavy rainfall led to submerged roads, stalled vehicles, and rescues in parts of New Jersey and New York's Westchester County. The flooding also severely impacted public transportation, with suspensions and major delays affecting New York City's subway system and Metro-North train services. New Jersey's governor declared a state of emergency as authorities urged residents to avoid travel due to the hazardous conditions.</p>

          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, slightly exceeding market forecasts despite facing internal and external pressures. The growth represents a deceleration from the previous quarter, with challenges including a housing downturn and trade tensions with the U.S. While industrial output was strong, retail sales growth slowed, pointing to underlying fragility in consumer demand. Economists remain cautious, urging Beijing to implement further fiscal stimulus to support sustainable growth and offset ongoing economic headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of wealthy landowners, including charities, has initiated a High Court challenge against the UK government's recent leasehold and freehold reforms. They argue that the 2024 Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act, which aims to make it cheaper for leaseholders to extend leases or buy freeholds, infringes on their property rights. Leaseholder advocates fear the legal battle will delay much-needed changes, leaving many trapped in properties with escalating ground rents and unable to sell, creating significant uncertainty for homeowners across the country.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a new plan to supply Ukraine with "top-of-the-line weapons" through NATO allies, who will be reimbursed by the United States. The deal, confirmed by NATO chief Mark Rutte, aims to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities, particularly its air defense systems. Simultaneously, Trump issued a 50-day ultimatum to Russia, threatening 100% secondary tariffs on its remaining trade partners if a peace agreement is not reached. This marks a significant shift in Trump's stance, combining military support for Kyiv with economic pressure on Moscow.</p>

          <h2>Port of Los Angeles Reports Record June Traffic as Shippers Rush to Pre-empt Tariffs</h2>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles experienced its busiest June in its history, processing a record number of shipping containers. Port executives attribute the surge to a "tariff whipsaw effect," with importers rushing to bring in goods, particularly from China, ahead of President Trump's looming tariff deadlines. This influx of holiday and consumer products highlights the market uncertainty created by shifting trade policies. Officials anticipate a subsequent slowdown in volume once new tariffs are fully implemented, as import costs rise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report by brokerage firm Jefferies highlights China's increasing prominence and efficiency in the global biotechnology sector.

          <p>Shares of fintech companies, including Block and PayPal, rebounded after a recent slump, as financial analysts suggested the market overreacted to a potential threat. The initial drop was triggered by reports that JPMorgan Chase might start charging data aggregators for access to customer financial information. However, analysts noted that any new fees would likely be negligible for large fintech platforms and would not be a "business model-breaking" cost, helping to restore investor confidence in the sector.

          <p>The UK government has announced it will restart processing asylum claims from Syrian nationals, lifting a pause that was implemented over seven months ago after the collapse of the Assad regime. The Home Office stated it now has sufficient information to make accurate assessments of risk for individuals returning to Syria. This policy change could put thousands of asylum seekers in scope for returns, and officials hope the first enforced returns could happen by the end of the year, creating significant uncertainty for those affected.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis posits that President Trump's recent shift to a tougher policy on Russia is driven less by a strategic change and more by personal frustration and a sense of humiliation. According to White House sources, Trump feels that Vladimir Putin has ignored his repeated calls to end the war in Ukraine, making him look weak. This perceived defiance reportedly pushed Trump to authorize new weapons for Ukraine and threaten tariffs, not out of new-found support for Kyiv, but to reassert his own strength on the world stage.</p>
