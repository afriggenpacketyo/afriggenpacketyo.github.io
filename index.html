          <p>Uber and Waymo have expanded their partnership by launching a robotaxi service in Atlanta, covering approximately 65 square miles but excluding highways and the airport. This service utilizes Waymo's driverless technology integrated into electric Jaguar I-PACE SUVs and operates without human supervisors on board, contrasting with Tesla's pilot robotaxi service in Austin, which includes a human valet. Waymo's expansion into Atlanta follows its launch in Austin and signifies the company's growing presence in the autonomous vehicle market, aiming to compete with Tesla and Chinese companies like Baidu's Apollo Go. Uber's stock experienced an 8% increase following the announcement, highlighting investor confidence in the partnership and the potential of robotaxi services.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that ongoing uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs warrants a cautious approach to cutting interest rates. Powell noted the difficulty in predicting how much of the tariff inflation will be passed on to consumers, emphasizing the Fed's wait-and-see approach. Despite pressure from President Trump for faster rate cuts, the Fed has maintained its current stance, citing low employment and decent economic growth as reasons to hold steady, though some governors have expressed openness to considering rate cuts as early as July. Powell highlighted that the Fed expects a meaningful increase in inflation this year, further justifying the current policy, but mentioned that the summer data should provide more clarity on consumer price responses to tariffs.

          <p>The head of UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini, has strongly criticized the U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), labeling it a "death trap" that endangers more lives than it saves. This condemnation follows reports from the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, stating that dozens of people have been killed near GHF sites, with claims that the Israeli army targets those seeking aid. Lazzarini insists that humanitarian principles must be upheld, allowing experienced organizations like UNRWA to provide assistance with respect and dignity, while GHF defends its operations and accuses the UN of pushing false information. The controversy highlights the challenges of delivering aid in Gaza and the ongoing disputes over aid distribution methods.</p>

The new target aims for 5% of GDP to be spent on core defense and related areas, with pressure mounting on low spenders like Spain. While the 2% target is not legally binding, political pressure from leaders like President Trump has pushed many countries to increase their spending, with some, including Canada, Belgium, Portugal and Italy, planning to meet the target soon. Spain, however, argues for a focus on smart procurement rather than simply increasing spending.</p>

          <p>Alex Caruso celebrated winning an NBA championship with the Oklahoma City Thunder, jokingly comparing it to his previous title with the Lakers, which was won in the NBA bubble during the COVID-19 pandemic. Caruso, who was traded to Oklahoma City, highlighted the difficulty of winning with the Thunder due to the team's relative inexperience. He praised his younger teammates for their ability to learn and grow throughout the playoffs and also had to give his teammates an accelerated course on how to uncork champagne bottles. He was a valuable bench player in both championship runs.</p>

          <p>The conflict in the Middle East has led many insurance underwriters to avoid offering coverage to vessels with perceived U.S., Israeli, or U.K. links, regardless of price.

The situation is fluid, with underwriters reducing the notification period from 48 to 24 hours due to the uncertainty, while concerns about Iran blocking ships and China's appetite for Iranian oil also influence the market.

Starmer argues that the current welfare system is unsustainable and traps people on benefits, necessitating reform to ensure its future viability. The proposed changes aim to save Â£5 billion a year by 2030, tightening eligibility for Personal Independence Payments (Pip), but face opposition due to concerns about pushing people into poverty and a lack of consultation. The government is counting on these savings to meet its tax and spending rules.</p>
