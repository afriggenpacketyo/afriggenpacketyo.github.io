          <h2>US Federal Reserve Maintains Interest Rates Amid Political Pressure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 14:56:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has opted to maintain its benchmark interest rate, continuing a cautious strategy amid ongoing economic uncertainties, particularly those stemming from tariff policies. This decision comes despite significant public pressure from President Donald Trump, who has advocated for a rate cut to stimulate economic growth. The Federal Open Market Committee's vote was not unanimous, with two Trump-appointed governors dissenting in favor of a rate reduction, a rare public division. The Fed signaled it will continue to closely monitor inflation and incoming economic data before considering future adjustments to its monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 14:56:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury yields climbed after the Federal Reserve announced it would hold its current interest rates, a decision largely anticipated by financial markets. The central bank's stance, influenced by concerns that tariffs could fuel inflation, was articulated by Chair Jerome Powell. This policy decision prompted a discernible market reaction, with the 10-year Treasury yield rising by five basis points as investors adjusted to the Fed's outlook. The stability in rates was further supported by a government report released the same day, which showed that U.S. economic growth in the second quarter was stronger than economists had initially forecast.

          <h2>Trump Advocates for Eliminating 'Blue Slip' Tradition to Appoint Loyal Federal Prosecutors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 14:55:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is publicly calling to end the Senate's "blue slip" tradition, an informal rule allowing home-state senators to veto presidential nominees for federal judges and U.S. attorneys. This push comes after his appointee for U.S. Attorney in New Jersey was blocked from a permanent post by the state's Democratic senators. Critics express concern that abolishing this long-standing check on presidential power would permit the appointment of political loyalists to powerful judicial positions. Such a change could potentially undermine the independence of the justice system, particularly in states represented by opposition senators, by enabling politically motivated prosecutions. </p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order eliminating the "de minimis" trade exemption for all countries, which had allowed imported packages valued under $800 to enter the U.S. tariff-free. This policy expands on a previous order that targeted only China and Hong Kong, directly affecting e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu that built business models around the provision. The administration asserts this action closes a loophole used to evade duties and import illicit substances such as fentanyl. The change is expected to have a broad impact on online retailers and consumers who have benefited from tax-free, low-cost international goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major international aid organizations, including Doctors Without Borders, have condemned the recent airdrops of humanitarian aid into Gaza, describing them as futile, dangerous, and largely symbolic. Experts in the field contend that these missions are far more expensive and less effective than land-based convoys and often fail to reach the most desperate populations amid the widespread chaos. This criticism comes as the United Nations and other agencies warn that a severe famine is actively unfolding, with an urgent need for at least 600 aid trucks daily. These groups are calling on Israel to fully open land crossings for the safe and efficient delivery of essential supplies.</p>

While no major damage or serious injuries were reported, officials urged the public to remain cautious near coastlines due to the risk of strong, unpredictable currents.

While not directly tied to the Fed's rate, fixed-rate mortgages have also remained in a high range due to broader economic uncertainty. Conversely, the high-rate environment continues to benefit savers, who can find high-yield savings accounts offering returns above 4%, providing an advantage against inflation.

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has confirmed it will maintain access to critical weather data from a U.S. military satellite program, reversing a decision that had alarmed meteorologists. This data, from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, is essential for accurately forecasting storms and hurricanes. The Department of Defense had previously suggested cutting off access due to cybersecurity concerns, a move that could have severely compromised forecast models just before a predicted active hurricane season. The last-minute reversal averts a potential crisis, ensuring that forecasters retain this vital tool for protecting public safety.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has detailed his strategic vision for artificial intelligence, emphasizing the creation of "personal superintelligence" designed for individual empowerment rather than large-scale automation. This philosophy was shared just before an earnings report and follows Meta's multi-billion dollar investment in AI talent and a new research lab. In a public letter, Zuckerberg distinguished his approach from competitors who he claims are focused on replacing human labor. This massive investment in AI is reminiscent of Meta's expensive, long-term bet on the metaverse, a strategy that has faced considerable scrutiny from Wall Street investors.</p>

          <p>CBS News correspondent Norah O'Donnell is set to publish a new book, "We the Women," which aims to bring to light the stories of overlooked female pioneers in American history. The project was inspired by O'Donnell's own discoveries during research, such as learning about Mary Katharine Goddard, the female printer whose name is on the Declaration of Independence. The book will chronicle the contributions of revolutionary women from 1776 to today, including figures like Katharine Wright and Emily Warren Roebling. Timed for release before America's 250th anniversary, the book is described as a passion project to fill a significant gap in historical education.</p>

          <p>A significant bureaucratic bottleneck at the U.S. Department of Education is delaying debt relief for tens of thousands of public servants. As of June, over 65,000 applications for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Buyback program were pending, a situation that advocacy groups describe as making the program "functionally unavailable." This option was created to allow borrowers to make retroactive payments for past periods of forbearance to meet the 120-payment requirement for debt cancellation. The delays, which the article links to administration staff reductions, are preventing eligible borrowers from receiving their earned forgiveness and moving forward with their financial lives.</p>

          <p>Despite reporting another quarter of declining same-store sales and missing Wall Street's earnings targets, analysts are identifying early signs of a successful turnaround at Starbucks. Company executives highlighted that customer traffic improved sequentially each month during the quarter, with significant growth observed among non-rewards members for the first time in years. Analysts are optimistic about CEO Brian Niccol's report that the recovery is ahead of schedule, pointing to new service programs and upcoming menu innovations. While investor confidence is not fully restored, many view these developments as promising indicators that the company's strategy is taking hold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a 25% tariff on all imports from India, effective August 1, along with an additional, unspecified "penalty." The administration justified the move by citing India's historically high tariffs and what it describes as strenuous non-monetary trade barriers. In his announcement, Trump also directly linked the penalty to India's significant purchases of military equipment and energy from Russia, framing the trade action as a response to both economic and geopolitical issues. This decision marks a significant escalation in trade tensions with a key global partner and continues the administration's use of tariffs as a foreign policy tool. (not investment advice)</p>

Bove, who defended Trump in his New York criminal trial, is a former federal prosecutor. During his confirmation hearings, he forcefully denied being a political operative, asserting his legal independence and stating, "I am not anybody's henchman."</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old student has been convicted of assaulting two female police officers during a violent disturbance at Manchester Airport in July of last year. The man, Mohammed Fahir Amaaz, was found guilty of causing actual bodily harm to one officer, who suffered a broken nose, and of assaulting another. The altercation, which was captured on widely shared mobile phone footage, depicted a chaotic and prolonged struggle in the airport's car park area. While the jury reached a verdict on two counts, it was unable to decide on a third assault charge involving a male officer, for which prosecutors are now seeking a retrial.</p>
