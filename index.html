          <h2>US Birth Rate Experiences Slight Uptick After Years of Decline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 00:05:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CDC data indicates a 1% increase in US births in 2024, totaling approximately 3.6 million, marking a slight reversal in a long-term decline that began around 2008 during the Great Recession. Demographers caution against interpreting this as a definitive trend, citing ongoing economic uncertainties, housing costs, and childcare expenses that continue to challenge families. The report highlights a record-low birth rate among teenage girls and young women, while births among women aged 40-44 have increased, a trend observed since 1985. The rise in births appears to be driven by Hispanic and Asian women, while birth rates for Black, American Indian, and Alaska Native women have decreased. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Netflix and Sonia Friedman Productions have collaborated to bring "Stranger Things: The First Shadow" to Broadway's Marquis Theatre, creating a fusion of screen fluidity and stage dynamism. Directed by Stephen Daldry and Justin Martin, the play serves as a prequel to the popular Netflix series, set in 1959 Hawkins, exploring the origins of Henry Creel and other familiar characters. While the production boasts impressive visual effects and stagecraft, critics note that the plot suffers from pacing issues, attempting to condense an entire season's worth of content into a single theatrical experience. Despite narrative gaps, the play appeals to a younger demographic and showcases the potential for theater to compete with film and television in terms of spectacle.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. reiterated his controversial claim that autism is "20 times worse than Covid-19" in terms of economic, social, and moral impact.

Kennedy vowed to uncover the cause of autism by September, promising a "massive testing and research effort." The CDC reports that the increasing number of autism diagnoses is due to improved diagnostic tools, not an epidemic.

They argue that the failure of even one supplier could lead to production shutdowns across the industry, impacting workers and jobs.

          <p>China is grappling with persistent academic misconduct, which threatens the nation's innovation efforts, according to state media. Despite efforts to strengthen research integrity, violations remain frequent due to weak penalties. The People's Daily argues that academic dishonesty wastes resources, undermines fair competition, and damages China's international reputation. The call for increased punishment comes as China accelerates its hi-tech drive and prioritizes technological self-sufficiency amid competition with the United States.</p>

          <p>At least two dozen people have been killed after gunmen opened fire on a group of domestic tourists visiting a popular beauty spot in Indian-administered Kashmir. The attack took place in Pahalgam, a picturesque town in the Himalayas often described as the "Switzerland of India". The region's chief minister, Omar Abdullah, said the attack was "much larger than anything we've seen directed at civilians in recent years". US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and EU chief Ursula Von der Leyen were among world leaders who condemned the attacks.</p>

Meta, which owns Instagram, says its new accounts have "built-in protections" and it shares "the goal of keeping teens safe online".
