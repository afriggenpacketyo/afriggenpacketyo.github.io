He faces a potential sentence of life in prison or even death depending on the case's details.

          <p>PBS has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration challenging an executive order that seeks to cut off federal funding to NPR and PBS. The lawsuit alleges that the administration is unlawfully interfering in the operations of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and violating the First Amendment through viewpoint discrimination and illegal retaliation. Trump's executive order instructs the CPB to cease direct funding to NPR and PBS to the maximum extent allowed by law. The order also prevents indirect funding by prohibiting local public radio and television stations from using taxpayer dollars to support the organizations.</p>

          <p>Wall Street has coined the term "TACO trade" (Trump Always Chickens Out) to describe the market's reaction to President Trump's tariff announcements, where investors buy the dip expecting him to back down. Trump was reportedly furious upon learning about the expression, which underscores his tendency to threaten tariffs but then lower or delay them. Despite initially disdaining Trump, many industry titans sought accommodation with him during his 2024 campaign, only to find that he was serious about tariffs, albeit without a clear plan. This pattern of volatility and reversals is what the TACO trade seeks to exploit.</p>
