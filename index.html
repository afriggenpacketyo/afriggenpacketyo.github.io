          <p>The Supreme Court has decided not to review a challenge to Maryland's ban on assault weapons, leaving the lower court's ruling upholding the law intact. Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissented from the decision. Justice Kavanaugh noted that other federal appeals courts are considering the issue, suggesting the Supreme Court will address it soon. The court also declined to consider a challenge to Rhode Island's ban on large-capacity magazines, keeping that law in place as well. This decision comes after the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that expanded the right to bear arms, leading to ongoing legal battles over gun control measures.</p>

          <p>A new international study has found that colon cancer patients who participated in a three-year exercise program experienced improved survival rates. The research, presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting and published in The New England Journal of Medicine, showed that the exercise program kept the disease at bay, with benefits rivaling some drugs. Patients in the exercise program became more active and had 28% fewer cancers and 37% fewer deaths from any cause. Experts suggest that cancer centers and insurance plans should consider making exercise coaching a standard of care for colon cancer survivors.</p>

The UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) will redesign routes, many of which were established around 70 years ago, with initial changes focusing on the airspace around London. Aviation Minister Mike Kane stated that modernizing airspace will help reduce pollution from flying and pave the way for new technologies. However, environmental groups like Friends of the Earth have expressed concerns that redesigning flight paths will expose more communities to noise and air pollution.</p>

          <p>Cybercriminals are increasingly using sophisticated subscription scam campaigns on platforms like Facebook to trick users into providing credit card information. These scams involve creating convincing websites that appear to be real online stores, often selling products like clothing and electronics, but actually sign users up for recurring payments. One common tactic is the "mystery box" scam, which promises a surprise package at a bargain price but enrolls users in hidden subscription terms. Bitdefender researchers have uncovered over 200 active websites involved in this coordinated campaign, many of which share a single Cyprus address.</p>

          <p>Shares of major U.S. steel companies experienced a significant jump after President Trump announced a doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum. The tariffs, enacted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, are set to take effect on June 4. The European Union is preparing countermeasures in response to the higher tariffs, which have caused turmoil in global markets. The surge in steel stocks follows a planned partnership between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, which the White House claims will create jobs and ensure steel is made in America.</p>

          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Norway surged by 213% in May, contrasting with a downward trend across Europe. This increase was primarily driven by sales of the revamped Model Y compact SUV. While Tesla's European sales have suffered due to reputational damage and CEO Elon Musk's political activities, Norway's strong EV incentives and the popularity of the Model Y have contributed to the rebound. Industry groups reported lower May sales for new Tesla vehicles in Spain, Portugal, Denmark, and Sweden, but Norway remains an EV leader due to consistent policies supporting electric vehicle adoption.</p>
