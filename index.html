            <p>Chinese authorities in Harbin have issued arrest warrants for three individuals, Katheryn A. Wilson, Robert J. Snelling, and Stephen W. Johnson, alleging they are NSA agents involved in cyberattacks during the Asian Winter Games. Chinese cybersecurity experts claim the individuals used artificial intelligence to launch these attacks, targeting critical information infrastructure and enterprises like Huawei. The police are offering cash rewards for clues related to the suspects' whereabouts, also implicating the University of California and Virginia Tech in the attacks without providing specific details of their involvement. The incident escalates tensions surrounding cybersecurity between the U.S. and China.</p>

Average UK pay continued to increase, rising by 5.9%, but increases in employer National Insurance Contributions and National Minimum Wage hikes are expected to put pressure on salaries.

            <p>The U.S. Treasury market experienced an unusual sell-off following President Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs, which ultimately led to their suspension. Yields on the 10-year Treasury soared to their highest level since February, while the 30-year Treasury bond yield reached its highest since November 2023. The sell-off has sparked debate about who was selling, with speculation focusing on China, Japan's life insurers, and hedge funds. Some analysts believe China may be weaponizing its Treasury holdings, while others suggest that Japan's life insurers may be reducing their exposure due to concerns about U.S. policy changes.

            <p>Mexico is grappling with the debate of whether to ban "narcocorridos," a genre of music that glorifies drug trafficking, in an attempt to reduce violence. The debate was reignited after a concert ended in a brawl when the artist refused to sing corridos, which were prohibited in that region. While President Claudia Sheinbaum considers a ban "absurd," others in her party advocate for it, despite criticism from lawyers and doubts about its effectiveness. Attempts to prohibit corridos have existed since the late 20th century, with experts arguing that the new wave of prohibitionism is political demagoguery.</p>

            <p>Oil giant BP has emerged as a prime takeover candidate, with speculation focusing on potential suitors like Shell, Exxon Mobil, and Chevron. The speculation has been fueled by BP's recent strategic reset, which includes cutting renewable spending and boosting investment in its core oil and gas business. This move follows a period of underperformance relative to its industry peers, leading to a depressed share price and reigniting merger rumors. Analysts suggest that a potential merger could be driven by the need to reduce costs and return cash to shareholders. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Lawyers for the driver charged with killing NHL player Johnny Gaudreau and his brother, Matthew, are expected to argue that the brothers contributed to the fatal crash by cycling while impaired. Salem County prosecutors argue that there is no law banning cycling while intoxicated in New Jersey, and that witnesses said the brothers were riding single-file on the edge of the road. Prosecutors have accused Higgins of being impaired by alcohol and fueled by road rage when he ran into them.</p>
