          <p>Police in Nassau County, New York, are investigating the tragic death of a 61-year-old man who was fatally injured after being pulled into an MRI machine. The incident occurred at an open MRI facility when the man, reportedly wearing a large metallic chain, entered a room where a scan was actively in progress. The machine's powerful magnetic field forcefully drew him in, resulting in a medical episode from which he died the next day. This event underscores warnings from the FDA about the critical importance of screening individuals and objects for magnetic items before they enter an MRI environment to prevent such dangerous accidents.</p>

          <p>Germany's women's national team has secured a place in the Euro 2025 semifinals after a dramatic 6-5 penalty shootout win against France. The German squad played with only ten players for over 100 minutes after an early red card, which also resulted in a French penalty goal. Despite the setback, Germany equalized and held on through extra time, with goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger making a crucial save in the shootout to clinch the victory. The team will now face Spain as they continue their tournament campaign, demonstrating remarkable resilience after a difficult group stage performance.</p>

          <h2>Interest in Learning Mandarin Declines Across Western Nations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 18:00:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent data indicates a significant drop in the popularity of learning Mandarin in Western countries, a reversal of a years-long trend that positioned it as the language of the future. University enrollments for Mandarin in the United States fell by 25% in 2021 from their 2013 peak, with similar declines observed in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Even in European nations like Germany and France, where interest is still growing, the rate of expansion is modest compared to other languages. This shift suggests a waning of the linguistic appeal and perceived utility of Mandarin in the Global North.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has committed to a new target of halving the number of sewage discharges from water companies by the year 2030. This pledge marks the first time ministers have set a clear goal on the issue, which has sparked public outrage amid rising pollution levels in the nation's rivers and coastlines. The announcement follows new data showing that serious pollution incidents in England rose by 60% in 2024 to a record high. The plan also includes measures to ban plastic-containing wet wipes and reduce phosphorus pollution, aiming to overhaul the under-scrutiny water sector.</p>

          <p>Much of the United Kingdom is under yellow weather warnings for heavy rain and thunderstorms, raising concerns about potential flash flooding, power cuts, and travel disruptions. While a more severe amber warning for London did not result in the feared widespread flooding, localized impacts remain possible across the country through Monday. The threat is exacerbated by recent heatwave conditions that have left the ground dry and less able to absorb water. The Met Office continues to monitor the situation as the unsettled weather, which developed over France, moves north across the UK.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has initiated a libel lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal's publisher, Dow Jones & Company, and its leader, Rupert Murdoch, seeking at least $20 billion in damages.

Trump has vehemently denied the report, calling the letter a fake and accusing the newspaper of journalistic failures.

A US-brokered pact led to the ceasefire announcement, but reports of gunfire and looting in Suweida city on Saturday suggest the agreement is failing to hold.

For Barcelona, a loan deal with an option to buy presents a low-risk financial move amid their ongoing economic constraints.

Although the bomb only slightly injured Hitler and the coup quickly failed, the event has become a powerful symbol of German resistance.

          <p>The investigation into a deadly explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility that killed three deputies is now focused on explosives collected from a Santa Monica apartment. The three deputies who died had responded to a call at the apartment complex the day before the blast, where a bag of grenades was reportedly discovered in a storage unit. Authorities are trying to determine if these were the same materials that caused the fatal explosion. The Santa Monica building was evacuated as federal and local bomb squads continue to search for any additional explosive materials.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering United HealthCare CEO Brian Thompson, are accusing Manhattan prosecutors of illegally obtaining their client's confidential medical records. The defense claims the District Attorney's office used a fraudulent subpoena to compel Aetna to turn over the information, violating health privacy laws. They are requesting a full evidentiary hearing and have suggested that sanctions, potentially including dismissal of the charges, may be appropriate. Sources from the DA's office contend that they requested limited information and that the additional materials were sent by Aetna in error.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has condemned the United States for imposing visa sanctions on a Supreme Court justice involved in the prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro. The sanctions, targeting Justice Alexandre de Moraes and his family, were described by Lula as unacceptable interference in another country's justice system. The US action came after Moraes ordered Bolsonaro to wear an electronic monitor while he awaits a verdict on charges of attempting to overturn the 2022 election. This diplomatic friction highlights the ongoing political tensions surrounding the legal fate of the far-right former leader.</p>

          <p>More than 100 people have been arrested across the United Kingdom during demonstrations protesting the government's decision to proscribe the activist group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. The largest protest occurred in London, where 55 people were arrested for displaying placards in support of the group, which is now a criminal offense. The ban followed an incident where activists broke into an RAF base and damaged aircraft. The arrests, many of which involved elderly protesters, highlight the contentious nature of the government's decision and the ongoing tensions surrounding pro-Palestinian activism in the UK.</p>

          <p>Major champions Henrik Stenson and Bryson DeChambeau have criticized the R&A's enforcement of slow-play rules at The Open, calling the approach inconsistent and chaotic. Both golfers were spoken to by officials during the third round, with Stenson's group being warned for being just a few minutes over their allotted time. This occurred after the first two rounds saw groups taking nearly six hours to play. The golfers argue that it is unfair to suddenly crack down on minor time infractions on the weekend after allowing significant delays earlier in the tournament, suggesting a more consistent system is needed.</p>
