        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage demand has plummeted nearly 13% as interest rates reach a two-month high, reflecting growing economic uncertainty. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increased to 6.90%, impacting refinance applications, which dropped 20%. Purchase applications also fell 7%, with homebuyers facing climbing home prices and stock market volatility. These factors have created a challenging environment for prospective homebuyers, as noted by Joel Kan of the Mortgage Bankers Association, leading to stalled market movement.

          <p>The European Union has fined Apple $571 million and Meta $228 million for breaching the Digital Markets Act, which requires Apple to allow developers to inform customers of alternative offers outside the App Store.

          <p>A 6.2 magnitude earthquake struck Istanbul, Turkey, causing widespread concern and prompting residents to evacuate buildings. The earthquake's epicenter was in the Sea of Marmara, about 25 miles southwest of Istanbul, followed by several aftershocks, including one measuring 5.3. While initial reports indicated no serious damage or injuries, authorities urged residents to stay away from potentially unstable structures. Turkey is prone to earthquakes due to its location on major fault lines, recalling the devastating 2023 earthquake that resulted in over 53,000 deaths.</p>

          <p>The anti-abortion movement is increasingly embracing fetal personhood, leading to legislation that could treat fetuses as people and punish women who have abortions with homicide charges. This shift is driven by a growing alliance with the Republican party and a focus on punishing wrongdoers. While most Americans support legal abortion in some circumstances, the movement is prioritizing judicial appointments over public opinion. The movement is also seeking to convince courts that the 14th amendment already recognizes embryos and fetuses as people from the moment of conception.</p>

While courts have coercive powers, their effectiveness depends on democratic cultural norms and public vigilance. History shows that presidents have historically complied with court orders due to a shared commitment to self-government under a constitution. The political branches also play a role, with open defiance of a Supreme Court order potentially leading to impeachment, emphasizing the importance of upholding the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Pressure is building on UK finances as Rachel Reeves pushes for a US trade deal. The government borrowed more than expected last year, placing more pressure on the public finances ahead of the full impact of US tariffs being felt on the UK economy. There is growing expectations that Reeves could cut public spending or raise taxes later this year in order to stick to her self-imposed borrowing rules. US Vice-President JD Vance has said there was a "good chance" of a trade deal.</p>

          <p>The UK government faces increasing pressure on public finances due to higher-than-expected borrowing, with borrowing reaching £151.9bn in the year to March. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is seeking a trade deal with the US to avoid import taxes on UK exports. Economists warn that Reeves may need to cut public spending or raise taxes to meet borrowing rules, especially given sluggish economic growth and higher interest rates. The IMF has forecast lower growth for the UK in 2025, citing tariffs, rising inflation, and borrowing costs.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to clear the driving test backlog by next summer, aiming to provide at least 10,000 extra driving tests per month. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander acknowledged that current wait times are "totally unacceptable". New measures will help reduce average waiting times to no more than seven weeks by summer 2026, missing the original target by eight months. Plans include doubling training capacity for driving examiners and reintroducing overtime pay incentives.</p>

          <p>The article explores the themes of rebellion in the Star Wars franchise, questioning whether the series' reliance on "chosen one" heroes undermines its message of egalitarianism. The author argues that the twist in "The Empire Strikes Back," revealing Darth Vader as Luke Skywalker's father, shifted the drama from political animosity to Oedipal mythos, creating a cliché of saviors born with special destinies. The franchise's exploration of political inequality and messy heroism is contrasted with the more simplistic trope of a chosen one saving the day.</p>
