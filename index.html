          <p>Brentford striker Yoane Wissa has issued a public statement demanding the club allow him to leave for Newcastle United before the transfer deadline. He accuses Brentford of breaking a promise and unfairly increasing his transfer price from a reported £40 million to around £60 million. Wissa, who has not been training with the first team, stated that being forced to stay would "tarnish four wonderful years" at the club and urged the owners to honor their agreement.</p>

          <p>At the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin, China's President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged to deepen trust and improve their strained relationship. Xi emphasized that the two nations should be partners, while Modi noted a new "atmosphere of peace and stability" between them. This meeting, Modi's first in China in seven years, comes as both countries face trade pressures from the United States and signals a potential diplomatic reset, with an agreement to resume direct flights that were suspended in 2020.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has confirmed that a baby has died from whooping cough, marking the first such fatality in the UK this year. The infant's mother had not received the whooping cough vaccine during pregnancy, a measure recommended to provide passive immunity to newborns. This tragic event highlights growing concerns among health officials about declining vaccination rates for major childhood diseases in England, none of which met the 95% uptake target required for herd immunity last year.</p>

          <p>Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has harshly condemned ongoing nationwide protests over economic conditions, labeling the actions of some demonstrators as approaching "treason and terrorism." The statement follows a period of escalating unrest that has seen deadly violence, including protesters setting fire to a government building in Makassar and the ransacking of the finance minister's home. Tensions have been further inflamed by the recent death of a protester who was run over by a police vehicle.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines whether the Trump administration's actions are normalizing authoritarianism in the United States. It highlights several examples, including fawning praise from cabinet members, calls for the arrest of political opponents, and the revocation of Secret Service protection for a rival. Observers and activists, some with direct experience living under autocratic regimes, express growing concern that these patterns mirror the consolidation of power seen in other countries.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order to prohibit city police from collaborating with National Guard troops or federal agents if President Trump deploys them to the city. The order is a preemptive response to Trump's threats to send federal forces to address crime, a move Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker have called unconstitutional. The directive affirms that Chicago police will continue to enforce local laws but will not be deputized for federal actions like immigration enforcement or patrols.</p>

In contrast, only 14% of pupils with perfect first-week attendance became persistently absent, prompting calls for a strong focus on initial attendance.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.1 billion after Saturday night's drawing produced no grand prize winner. This now ranks as the fifth-largest jackpot in the history of the game. While no ticket matched all six numbers, nine tickets across the country matched the five white balls to win $1 million each. The jackpot has been growing since it was last won in May, setting the stage for Monday's massive drawing.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers Suffer Sloppy 6-1 Loss to Diamondbacks Despite Strong Outing from Pitcher Tyler Glasnow</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers fell to the Arizona Diamondbacks 6-1 in a game defined by uncharacteristic defensive mistakes and a lack of run support. Pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a strong performance, carrying a no-hitter into the sixth inning, but was ultimately handed the loss. The sloppy play, which included two errors and two runners thrown out on the bases, contributed to a frustrating defeat that shrinks the Dodgers' lead in the NL West to a single game.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles City Councilmember Ysabel Jurado has publicly stated her opposition to a proposed Home Depot in Eagle Rock, accusing the retailer of being complicit in federal immigration raids. Her statement follows several recent raids by federal agents in the parking lots of other Home Depot stores, which often serve as gathering spots for day laborers. Jurado argued that the company's failure to speak out against these operations amounts to complicity in actions that terrorize the local community.</p>
