          <h2>White House Criticizes Federal Reserve Leadership Over Spending and Management</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has intensified its criticism of the Federal Reserve, with the Office of Management and Budget director accusing Chairman Jerome Powell of gross mismanagement. The accusation centers on a costly renovation of the Fed's headquarters, which has allegedly run $700 million over budget and includes luxury features like rooftop gardens and VIP elevators. This public rebuke opens a new front in the administration's ongoing conflict with the central bank, which has previously focused on disagreements over interest rate policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant sanctions bill targeting Russia is moving forward in the Senate with growing momentum, reportedly now having the support of the White House. The legislation, co-sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal, proposes severe tariffs of up to 500% on countries purchasing Russian energy, aiming to cripple Moscow's war funding. After initial hesitation from the administration, a recent shift in tone towards Vladimir Putin suggests President Trump is now on board, though some senators like Rand Paul criticize the bill as economically damaging.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines how annuities can complement Social Security to create a more stable retirement income strategy for seniors. It explains that annuity payments can provide the necessary funds to allow retirees to delay claiming Social Security, which can increase their monthly benefits by approximately 8% for each year of deferral past full retirement age. Furthermore, annuities can help manage the taxability of Social Security income and provide a predictable "paycheck" to cover expenses not fully met by federal benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Greater Manchester police officer described being "absolutely terrified" after being punched in the face while attempting to arrest a suspect at Manchester Airport in July of last year. The officer, PC Lydia Ward, suffered a broken nose when the suspect, Mohammed Fahir Amaaz, allegedly struck her, causing her to fall and briefly lose consciousness. The court heard that Amaaz and his brother, Muhammad Amaad, are accused of inflicting a high level of violence on the officers who were responding to a report of an earlier assault. Both men deny the charges.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball will implement its Automated Ball-Strike (ABS) Challenge System during the upcoming All-Star Game, marking a significant step toward its potential use in the regular season. Under the system, the pitcher, catcher, or batter can challenge a ball or strike call, with each team receiving two challenges. A successful challenge is retained. This test follows years of implementation in the minor leagues and a trial during spring training, as MLB continues to integrate technology to improve umpire accuracy, which has already risen significantly since 2008.</p>

          <p>Police in south Belfast have announced they will not assist in dismantling a large bonfire built for the annual Twelfth of July celebrations, despite significant safety concerns. The structure is located near a critical electricity substation for two hospitals and on a site contaminated with asbestos. Following a risk assessment, police determined that intervening to remove the bonfire posed a greater risk than allowing it to proceed. The decision has drawn criticism from some local politicians, while bonfire builders have voluntarily reduced its size as a gesture of compromise.</p>

La Niña, characterized by cooler-than-average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific, typically brings colder, snowier winters to the U.S. Northwest and drier, warmer conditions to the South. While current conditions are neutral, the chance of La Niña developing increases into the fall, which could also favor a more active Atlantic hurricane season by reducing storm-inhibiting wind shear.</p>

The capital, Monrovia, is named after U.S. President James Monroe, and the country's flag is nearly identical to that of the U.S. This shared history has resulted in significant cultural and institutional influences, which may not be widely known but explain the familiarity Trump noted.</p>

It highlights Virginia Woolf's fierce disdain for the concept, which she defined as a dishonest and fashionable approach to art, distinct from the authentic passions of both "highbrow" and "lowbrow" consumers. Woolf famously declared she would "stab, dead" anyone who called her middlebrow. The essay reflects on how the term has evolved from a pejorative label into a more general descriptor for things perceived as harmlessly pedestrian in contemporary culture.</p>

          <h2>Six Indicators That Credit Card Debt Forgiveness May Be a Financially Sound Option</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 12:40:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines several signs that could indicate credit card debt forgiveness is a beneficial financial strategy for those with significant balances. These indicators include situations where monthly interest payments exceed principal reduction, eligibility for a substantial balance reduction, or facing a long repayment timeline that would be more costly than a settlement. The strategy involves negotiating with creditors to pay a lump sum that is less than the total amount owed, which can provide significant savings despite potential fees and a temporary negative impact on one's credit score.

          <p>The original Hermès Birkin bag, created for the late singer and actress Jane Birkin in 1985, has been sold at a Sotheby's auction in Paris for $10.1 million (€8.6m). This sale makes it the most valuable handbag ever sold at auction, following a spirited 10-minute bidding war. The iconic bag was conceived after Birkin lamented to the head of Hermès on a flight that she couldn't find a suitable bag for her needs. The prototype, which features her initials and other unique marks, was donated by Birkin to a charity auction in 1994.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines saw its shares jump 11% after it reinstated its 2025 profit forecast and signaled a stronger summer travel season than analysts had expected. The CEO stated that bookings have stabilized after a previous dip, although at a lower level than initially projected at the start of the year. The airline's positive outlook is driven by strong sales of premium seats and its lucrative partnership with American Express. Delta now anticipates full-year adjusted earnings between $5.25 and $6.25 a share, providing a boost of confidence to the airline industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The bishop of the San Bernardino diocese in Southern California has issued a formal dispensation excusing parishioners from their weekly obligation to attend Mass. The rare move comes in response to widespread fear in immigrant communities following federal immigration enforcement actions on two parish properties. Bishop Alberto Rojas stated the dispensation is necessary because many people, including those in the U.S. without documents, are afraid to venture into public settings. This act of pastoral care aims to alleviate the spiritual burden on those who feel unable to attend church due to safety concerns.</p>

The suspensions range from 10 to 42 days.

An agency official stated they would focus on fixing systemic deficiencies rather than simply firing agents, and the suspended personnel will return to reduced operational duties.</p>

          <p>A new, non-opioid painkiller called Journavx is offering hope for patients with severe pain, but access remains a significant challenge. The drug, the first new type of painkiller in over two decades, is expensive and has been approved by the FDA only for short-term acute pain, such as post-surgery. This narrow approval and slow insurance coverage have made it difficult for chronic pain patients to obtain it. While some patients have been able to use manufacturer coupons, the high cost and limited-use approval mean this potentially less addictive alternative to opioids is out of reach for many.</p>
