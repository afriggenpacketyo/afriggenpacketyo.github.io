          <p>A U.S. District Judge in Maryland has blocked two directives from the Trump administration that targeted diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in schools and universities. The ruling found the Education Department's threat to cut federal funding for institutions with DEI initiatives was unlawful because it violated procedural requirements. Judge Stephanie Gallagher, a Trump appointee, stated the guidance created a "sea change" in regulation, causing educators to fear punishment for lawful speech. Legal advocates for the plaintiffs, which included the American Federation of Teachers, hailed the decision as a significant victory against what they described as the administration's attack on education.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nearly two years after the Hamas attacks, Israel is experiencing profound internal divisions over the protracted war in Gaza, challenging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's initial calls for unity. The conflict has created chasms between secular and religious Israelis, with some on the religious right viewing the war as a divine opportunity, while others protest for a ceasefire and the return of hostages. Opinion polls indicate a majority of Jewish Israelis are not troubled by Palestinian suffering, a view reinforced by government messaging. These societal fractures are exacerbated by political pressure from ultranationalist coalition partners who oppose any deal with Hamas.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin prepare for their summit in Alaska, their primary objectives appear to diverge significantly. Putin seeks international recognition and a validation that Western efforts to isolate Russia have failed, using the meeting to project strength and legitimize territorial claims in Ukraine. Conversely, Trump aims to cast himself as a global peacemaker, driven by a desire to fulfill his campaign promise of ending the war quickly, possibly through a "land-swapping" deal. While Putin's goals are consistent with long-term Russian strategy, Trump's approach is more unpredictable, fluctuating between threats and overtures for a deal.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has issued letters to mayors and county executives in over 30 jurisdictions, warning of potential prosecution if their local policies are perceived as obstructing federal immigration enforcement. Citing a Trump executive order, the letters demand confirmation of compliance with federal law and the elimination of so-called "sanctuary" policies. The move has prompted defiant and critical responses from local leaders, who argue that immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility and that Bondi's threats lack legal merit. Officials from cities like Seattle and Rochester, New York, have dismissed the assertions as untruthful and reiterated their commitment to protecting all residents.</p>

Having received a wild card invitation for her 25th appearance, she follows in the footsteps of Renée Richards, who played at age 47. Despite a current singles ranking of 654th following a series of injuries, the seven-time Grand Slam champion and two-time U.S. Open winner continues to demonstrate remarkable longevity in the sport. This milestone comes after she recently became the oldest player to win a WTA singles match since 2004.</p>

Her daughter found three silver aluminum audition discs while donating the late singer's records to the British Library's Sound Archive. These previously unheard tracks, including "What A Difference A Day Makes," will be released by Decca to mark the 80th anniversary of VJ Day. The discovery adds a significant new chapter to the legacy of the "Forces' Sweetheart," who became a symbol of hope during World War Two with iconic songs like "We'll Meet Again."</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is preparing for a nearly 20% increase in the number of data centres, with almost 100 new facilities planned, largely driven by the growth of artificial intelligence. Research from Barbour indicates most will be built within five years, with major investments from tech giants like Google and Microsoft. However, this expansion is raising significant concerns about the immense strain on national energy and water resources. Experts warn that the increased demand could lead to higher consumer utility bills and environmental impacts, prompting calls for companies to bear the infrastructure costs rather than the public.</p>

Commissioners cited significant concerns over the environmental impact of sonic booms on residents, wildlife, and property, as well as impacts on public access and natural resources. The commission also questioned whether the launches, many for SpaceX's commercial Starlink network, should be exempt from state review as federal activities. While the vote does not halt SpaceX's activities, it signals a major regulatory conflict between the state and the space company over its accelerated launch schedule.</p>

Their encounters, from Germany in 2017 to Helsinki in 2018, have generally projected mutual respect, though their methods differ greatly. Former officials describe Putin as meticulously prepared, often dominating conversations with lengthy monologues, while Trump is known for a more freewheeling, personality-driven style that prioritizes personal relationships. As they prepare to meet in Alaska, analysts suggest Putin will likely use his KGB-trained tactics to try and manipulate the meeting to his advantage, knowing Trump's belief that personal rapport translates to state-to-state success.</p>

The company announced plans to produce a new electric truck starting at $30,000 by 2027, built on a purpose-designed platform with 20% fewer parts to reduce costs. This strategy, developed by a team including former Tesla engineers, moves away from retrofitting gas-powered models and aims to streamline production significantly.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Berkshire Hathaway revealed in a regulatory filing that it acquired a new stake in UnitedHealth during the last quarter, purchasing over 5 million shares worth approximately $1.6 billion. The investment is notable given that the health insurer's stock has been struggling, down nearly 50% for the year amid a Justice Department investigation and a lowered earnings outlook. The move aligns with Warren Buffett's history of value investing in beleaguered but fundamentally strong companies. Following the disclosure of Berkshire's investment, shares of UnitedHealth surged 6% in extended trading, signaling renewed investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge in Texas is set to dismiss a lawsuit challenging a state law that restricts property ownership for Chinese citizens, which is scheduled to take effect soon. The suit, filed by the Chinese American Legal Defense Alliance on behalf of three Chinese nationals, argued the law is unconstitutional and discriminatory. Following oral arguments, the plaintiffs' lawyer stated that the judge intends to dismiss the case on the grounds that the plaintiffs lack legal standing to sue. The legal team plans to appeal the decision once the official opinion is issued, continuing the fight against the controversial measure.</p>

          <p>Since its 2020 public debut, AI software company Palantir has seen its stock surge over 1,700%, driven by significant government contracts and strong retail investor interest. The company recently surpassed a $430 billion market valuation after reporting its first-ever quarter with over $1 billion in revenue. Government contracts, particularly with the U.S. military, remain a core driver, accounting for 55% of revenue. Despite its astronomical growth, Palantir's valuation is exceptionally high compared to its revenue, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio dwarfing that of tech giants like Apple and Microsoft.

          <p>Wholesale retailer Costco has announced that it will not sell the abortion pill mifepristone at its pharmacy locations. In a statement, the company attributed the decision to a "lack of demand from our members and other patients," suggesting that individuals typically receive the medication directly from their medical providers. The move was praised by the Alliance Defending Freedom, an anti-abortion advocacy group that had campaigned against retailers selling the drug. Costco's decision adds another dimension to the complex landscape of abortion access in the United States, where retail pharmacies play a crucial role.</p>

          <p>Although mpox has faded from headlines in many parts of the world, the virus continues to spread rapidly across Africa, with outbreaks now present in 24 countries. This marks a significant expansion from a year ago when the World Health Organization declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. A new, more transmissible strain has emerged in the Democratic Republic of Congo and is spreading to neighboring nations. Experts criticize the global response as dangerously inadequate, citing undercounted cases, stalled vaccine distribution, and cuts to foreign aid, warning that the virus is becoming entrenched in the human population.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has launched a campaign for a special November election, asking California voters to approve a redrawing of the state's congressional maps. The move is a direct response to efforts in Republican-led states like Texas, prompted by Donald Trump, to gerrymander districts to secure a U.S. House majority. Newsom framed the "Election Rigging Response Act" as a necessary "fire with fire" strategy to protect democracy from partisan power grabs. If approved, the measure would temporarily suspend the state's independent redistricting commission to create a new map favoring Democrats, which could significantly alter the balance of power in Congress.</p>
