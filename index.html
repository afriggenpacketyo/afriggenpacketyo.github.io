          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-05 03:45:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a recent surge in electric vehicle sales, the United States is lagging behind global competitors like China and Europe in EV adoption. The article attributes this to weaker government support, the recent expiration of a significant $7,500 tax credit, and higher average vehicle prices compared to other markets. Analysts predict a sharp decline in EV demand, further complicated by President Trump's efforts to roll back pro-EV policies and tariffs, creating uncertainty for both consumers and automakers.

          <p>The UK government has announced that police forces will receive expanded powers to manage and place conditions on recurring protests, allowing them to consider the cumulative impact on communities. This move, which could lead to protests being relocated, comes after nearly 500 arrests at a recent demonstration and heightened security concerns within the Jewish community following a deadly synagogue attack. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the measures are necessary to balance the right to protest with residents' freedom to live without fear and intimidation.</p>

          <p>At least nine children have died in India after allegedly consuming a contaminated cough syrup, prompting three states to ban the product. The Indian Health Ministry confirmed that samples of 'Coldrif' cough syrup, produced by Sresan Pharma, contained toxic levels of diethylene glycol (DEG), an industrial solvent. This incident places India's large pharmaceutical industry, which supplies 20% of the world's generic medicines, under renewed scrutiny following similar contamination issues linked to child deaths in other countries like The Gambia and Uzbekistan.</p>

          <p>Russia conducted extensive missile and drone attacks across Ukraine, with a primary focus on the western city of Lviv, located near the Polish border. The strikes killed at least two people in the Lviv region and targeted energy infrastructure in Zaporizhzhia, causing power outages for over 73,000 residents. The intensity of the assault prompted neighboring Poland to scramble its own fighter jets, along with allied NATO aircraft, to secure its airspace against any potential spillover from the conflict.</p>

          <p>In Sidoarjo, Indonesia, rescuers are searching for 26 missing students after a prayer hall at an Islamic boarding school collapsed, bringing the death toll to 37. The structure failed while a third floor was being added, a project authorities say was undertaken without the required building permits. This tragedy has highlighted the widespread problem of illegal and unsafe construction in Indonesia, prompting a thorough police investigation into potential negligence by the school's management.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a British doctoral student at Cornell University recounts his decision to flee the United States after participating in a pro-Palestine protest on campus. He describes being banned from campus, going into hiding, and ultimately self-deporting after learning the Department of Homeland Security had obtained his Google data and his student visa was terminated. The writer suggests he was targeted due to his activism, race, and religion, and discusses the use of advanced AI surveillance technologies by U.S. immigration authorities to monitor non-citizens.</p>

The author suggests that recent military posturing and maritime strikes against alleged drug cartels are not part of a clear plan but rather impulsive actions that could backfire by strengthening authoritarian leaders like Nicolás Maduro. This approach is seen as a regression to outdated interventionist policies, potentially alienating regional partners and creating a power vacuum that benefits competitors like China.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking President Trump's attempt to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland without the governor's consent. Judge Karin Immergut ruled that the administration's justification for the deployment was "untethered to the facts" and did not meet the high legal standard required for such a military intrusion into civil affairs. The decision, which the Trump administration is expected to appeal, was celebrated by Oregon officials as a defense of state sovereignty and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Six Democratic candidates vying for California's governorship gathered at a labor forum in San Diego, where they identified housing affordability, the cost of living, and healthcare as the state's most pressing issues. While largely in agreement on policy, candidates sought to differentiate themselves through their personal stories and political experience. Former U.S. Health Secretary Xavier Becerra emphasized his extensive government background, while former Assembly Majority Leader Ian Calderon highlighted his perspective as a millennial and the first of his generation elected to the state legislature.</p>
