          <p>Federal authorities have arrested 29-year-old Jonathan Rinderknecht, accusing him of maliciously igniting a fire on New Year's Day that later escalated into the devastating Palisades Fire. The blaze, one of the most destructive in Los Angeles history, resulted in 12 deaths and the destruction of nearly 7,000 structures. The Department of Justice alleges that after starting the fire, Rinderknecht attempted to create a false narrative of himself as a concerned citizen reporting the incident.</p>

          <p>Country music icon Dolly Parton has publicly addressed and dismissed recent health rumors, assuring fans she is "not dying" and is actively working. Her statement came after her sister, Freida Parton, posted a request for prayers that sparked widespread concern among the public. Parton, 79, explained she had neglected her health following her husband's death but was now addressing minor issues, humorously referencing an AI-generated image of her on her deathbed.</p>

          <p>Investigators have revealed that digital evidence, including a troubling ChatGPT image, was crucial in the arrest of Jonathan Rinderknecht for allegedly starting the fatal Palisades Fire. Months before the incident, Rinderknecht reportedly prompted the AI to generate an image of a "dystopian painting" featuring a burning forest. Additionally, after the fire started, he allegedly asked ChatGPT if a person is at fault for a fire caused by a cigarette, which prosecutors believe was an attempt to create a more innocent explanation for his actions.</p>

          <p>Sir Jim Ratcliffe, co-owner of Manchester United, has publicly backed manager Ruben Amorim, stating the coach needs a three-year timeframe to demonstrate his capabilities. This statement comes amidst a difficult period for the club, which finished 15th last season and has had a poor start to the current one despite significant transfer spending. Ratcliffe dismissed media speculation about Amorim's immediate future, emphasizing that the club will not be run on "knee-jerk reactions" and is focused on long-term profitability and success.</p>

          <p>Nike's new CEO, Elliott Hill, has identified the revitalization of its China operations as a critical component of the company's overall comeback strategy. Hill plans to shift the focus of Nike's 5,000 mono-brand stores in China from sportswear to being more anchored in specific sports, such as running, to create a stronger connection with consumers. The company faces challenges including a recent 9% sales drop in the region and increased costs from U.S.-imposed tariffs, which are projected to be a significant headwind.

          <p>The article explains the function and benefits of a single-purpose reverse mortgage, a less common financial tool for homeowners aged 62 and older. Unlike more flexible reverse mortgages, this type is offered by state or local agencies for a specific, pre-approved expense, such as property taxes or essential home repairs. This option typically features lower costs and is aimed at low-to-moderate-income seniors, allowing them to access home equity without incurring monthly payments, though availability and eligibility can be limited.

          <p>Police have confirmed that Jihad Al-Shamie, the man who killed two people in an attack at a Manchester synagogue, made a 999 call pledging his allegiance to the Islamic State group. The call was made after Al-Shamie had driven his car into worshippers outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation before being shot dead by police. Authorities also revealed that the suspected explosive belt he was wearing was a non-viable hoax device, and they plan to release four more individuals who were arrested during the subsequent investigation without charge.</p>

The ceremony, led by Rabbi Benjamin David, included prayers for peace and acknowledged the ongoing conflict and the many victims in both Israel and Gaza.</p>

          <p>A government shutdown threatens the commercial real estate market with significant and widespread impacts beyond the immediate halt of some residential sales. The lack of federal economic data, such as employment reports, creates uncertainty for investors, while tighter credit conditions can make financing more difficult to obtain. Sectors like retail and hospitality face an immediate drop in demand due to furloughed federal workers, and the processing of leases, permits, and financing for federally-linked properties, including those managed by the GSA or funded by HUD, is likely to be delayed.

          <p>A new analysis of federal data indicates that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has likely made more arrests inside or around immigration courts in New York City than in any other city this year. The study estimates 460 such arrests in NYC, with over 90% of those detained having only civil immigration charges rather than criminal records. Immigration attorneys suggest this increased enforcement in NYC may be a response to the city's sanctuary policies, creating a difficult situation for immigrants who risk arrest by attending their required court hearings.</p>

This call comes as the debate over reparatory justice continues, with proponents arguing it could help address systemic inequalities, while the UK government has stated it will not pay financial reparations.</p>

The case is seen by some conservatives as a new avenue to challenge mail-in voting practices, which have been a frequent target of Republican criticism.</p>
