          <h2>Japan's Inflation Rate Eases in June but Remains Above Central Bank's Target</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 23:13:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, decreased to 3.3% in June, aligning with economists' expectations and down from a 29-month high. This marks the 39th consecutive month that inflation has exceeded the Bank of Japan's 2% target, driven by persistent price pressures on non-subsidized items. While the easing was helped by the government releasing stockpiled rice, economists remain cautious due to the depreciating yen, which could increase import prices and impact consumer spending. The economic outlook is further complicated by political uncertainty from an upcoming election and potential U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article questions the official reasoning behind CBS's decision to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in 2026, suggesting political factors may be at play. While the network cited a "purely a financial decision," the author points to a pattern of decisions by parent company Paramount that appear to appease President Trump, a frequent target of Colbert's criticism. The piece highlights recent events, including the settlement of a lawsuit filed by Trump against CBS and the departure of the head of "60 Minutes," as potential evidence that the network's editorial independence is being compromised to secure a major merger deal.</p>

          <h2>Fox News Host Jesse Watters Concedes Error in Report on Governor Newsom's Call with President Trump</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 23:00:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fox News host Jesse Watters acknowledged on-air that his program had made a mistake in its reporting about a phone call between California Governor Gavin Newsom and President Trump. The admission follows a $787-million defamation lawsuit filed by Newsom, who alleged Watters' show falsely claimed he lied about the timeline of the conversation. Watters stated he had misinterpreted a social media post from Newsom and offered a qualified apology, saying the governor was "confusing and unclear." In response to the on-air statement, Newsom's office indicated the lawsuit would proceed, with the governor stating, "See you in court buddy."</p>

          <p>Veteran MP Diane Abbott has been suspended from the Labour Party after stating in a BBC interview that she does not regret the 2023 comments that led to her initial suspension. Last year, she lost the party whip for a letter suggesting that Jewish, Irish, and Traveller people experience prejudice similar to racism but not the same as racism based on skin color. In the new interview, Abbott reiterated her view that there are different types of racism, prompting her immediate suspension pending another investigation. Abbott stated it is "obvious this Labour leadership wants me out," while the party emphasized its zero-tolerance stance on antisemitism.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are moving forward with a vote on a package to rescind approximately $9 billion in government funding, a key request from President Trump. The bill, which narrowly passed the Senate, targets about $8 billion in foreign assistance programs and $1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. The process was temporarily complicated by debates over releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein, but the measure is now advancing toward a final House vote. The administration must act before a Friday deadline, after which the money would be spent as originally appropriated by Congress.</p>

In Atlanta, marchers gathered at Ebenezer Baptist Church to connect Lewis's legacy of nonviolent protest with current opposition to the administration's policies.

          <p>Amid growing pressure from his supporters, President Trump has directed the Justice Department to seek court approval for the release of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein. This move follows a backlash against Attorney General Pam Bondi after she announced the department found no evidence of a "client list" and confirmed Epstein's death was a suicide. The order is seen as an attempt to quell conspiracies and satisfy a base that has been demanding transparency. It remains unclear which grand jury materials will be requested for release or when a court might rule on the matter.</p>

The two-time major champion claimed a spectator whistled during his backswing, causing a distraction at a critical moment on a difficult hole. Rahm was visibly upset, turning to the gallery and sarcastically calling the timing "very smart." He later downplayed the incident to the media, acknowledging that while the timing was bad, his reaction was also a way to release tension and that he ultimately hit a bad swing, regardless of the noise.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a new military drone capable of taking off and landing vertically on its tail, similar to a rocket, before transitioning to horizontal flight. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which resembles the U.S. military's MQ-35 V-BAT, was tested for reconnaissance and situational awareness in a mountainous region. This design allows for high-speed flight comparable to a fixed-wing drone while retaining the flexibility of vertical deployment, eliminating the need for a runway. The drone was developed by a state-owned subsidiary of AVIC, the same company that produces China's stealth fighters and other advanced military drones.</p>

The suit, filed by the state's attorney general, argues the decision was "arbitrary and capricious" and motivated by President Trump's "personal animus" toward the project. The Federal Railroad Administration canceled the funds after a review cited significant budget shortfalls and missed deadlines, finding "no viable path" forward for the train intended to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco.

The president has reportedly discussed the legally untested idea of firing Powell, his own appointee, over the Fed's strategy to combat inflation by keeping rates relatively high. The piece outlines the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices, its political independence, and the legal ambiguities surrounding a president's ability to remove a Fed chair.

The article notes that metabolically, cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are nearly identical and both contribute to health issues like diabetes and obesity when consumed in excess.

He works at a 1940s-themed tea room and antiques shop, where his knowledge and passion are adored by customers. Lincoln says he admires the era's elegance and sense of community, and he feels it is important to remember the sacrifices made during that time, a sentiment his supportive family shares.</p>

          <p>A BBC feature details how intensified immigration raids under the Trump administration are profoundly altering life in Southern California, home to an estimated 1.4 million undocumented immigrants. The article describes a climate of fear that has forced many into hiding, disrupting businesses, community events, and daily routines. It highlights recent large-scale raids on cannabis farms, which led to hundreds of arrests and the death of a worker, as well as the deployment of National Guard troops to quell protests. While the administration points to the arrest of serious criminals, activists and residents describe the operations as a "programme of terror" against communities.</p>

          <p>An ice core believed to be up to 1.5 million years old has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, where scientists will begin the process of melting it to study Earth's ancient climate. Drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, the core contains trapped air bubbles, dust, and volcanic ash that can reveal information about temperature, wind patterns, and atmospheric composition from a previously unknown period. Researchers hope the data will help them understand a mysterious shift in the planet's glacial cycles and provide insights into how Earth's climate system responds to high concentrations of greenhouse gases.</p>

          <p>Starting next July, shoppers using 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) services like Klarna and Clearpay will face tougher affordability checks under new regulations from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

This means some shoppers may be denied credit at the point of sale. The new framework will also provide users with the right to complain to the Financial Ombudsman and ensure clearer information on fees and cancellation rights is available.

          <p>A federal filing reveals that Elon Musk's brain-computer interface company, Neuralink, registered itself as a "small disadvantaged business" (SDB) with the U.S. Small Business Administration. The filing, dated in April, occurred shortly before a financing round valued the company at $9 billion and while Musk was leading a government efficiency initiative for the Trump administration. An SDB designation, which requires a business to be majority-owned by socially and economically disadvantaged persons, can provide preferential access to federal contracts. The Justice Department has previously fined companies for making false claims about their SDB status.</p>

The 62-count indictment alleges the defendants created and authenticated false police reports depicting immigrants as victims of fabricated crimes. These bogus reports were then used to help the immigrants apply for U-visas, a special status for crime victims who assist law enforcement, in exchange for thousands of dollars. The defendants face charges including conspiracy, mail fraud, and bribery, with state officials indicating that additional charges are likely to follow.</p>

The disclosure followed public speculation prompted by photographs showing bruising on his hand and swollen legs. A presidential physician confirmed the diagnosis, stating it is frequent in individuals over 70 and that Trump remains in "excellent health" with no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis. The White House press secretary attributed the hand bruising to frequent handshaking combined with his use of aspirin for cardiovascular prevention.</p>

The men, citizens of other countries with no ties to Eswatini, were removed under the Trump administration's third-country deportation program for individuals with serious criminal convictions, including murder and sexual assault against a child. Human rights groups have raised alarms about the practice, pointing to Eswatini's poor human rights record, which includes reports of torture and extrajudicial killings.

          <p>This political analysis from the BBC's Chris Mason argues that the Labour Party's leadership had very limited options regarding Diane Abbott's latest suspension. He posits that because Abbott stated she did not regret the 2023 comments that led to her first suspension, maintaining consistency required the party to take the same disciplinary action again. The article emphasizes the context of Labour's recent history with antisemitism and leader Keir Starmer's pledge to "tear out this poison by its roots." This commitment to an unflinching stance on the issue made re-suspending Abbott almost inevitable once she reaffirmed her original, controversial position.</p>

Colbert, who has hosted for a decade and consistently ranked number one in broadcast late-night ratings, informed his audience he was only told of the decision the previous day.

          <p>American consumers are facing record-high beef prices this summer, with a pound of ground beef averaging $6.12 in June, a nearly 12% increase from last year. Experts attribute the surge to a decades-long decline in the U.S. cattle herd, which is now at its smallest size since 1951. Factors contributing to the tight supply include persistent drought, high feed costs, and ranchers selling cattle to capitalize on high prices rather than breeding. The situation is exacerbated by a ban on cattle imports from Mexico due to a parasite outbreak and the potential impact of widespread tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
