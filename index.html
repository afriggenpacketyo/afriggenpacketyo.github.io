          <p>Archaeologists have reconstructed 2,000-year-old wall paintings from a Roman villa in Central London, piecing together thousands of fragments of wall plaster. The frescoes, discovered in 2021, depict musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit, revealing details about the affluence of the area during Roman times, described as the "Beverly Hills of Roman London". The team is still searching for a missing fragment bearing the artist's name, scored with the Latin word "Fecit," meaning "has made this." The find suggests a thriving settlement outside of central Roman London, indicating the Romans' commitment to settling and investing in the city.</p>

          <p>Martin Kettle discusses the complexities of regime change in Iran, highlighting the potential for enduring troubles and miseries for ordinary people. While the current theocratic regime is repressive and exports authoritarianism, its overthrow would remove an international threat, particularly to Israel, and disrupt terrorist activities. However, the article cautions that regime destruction does not guarantee successful regime change, and a defeated Iran could lead to civic instability, given its size, natural resources, and the presence of the old regime's adherents. History suggests that regime change for revolutionary regimes is a particularly messy business, with no easy path to lasting happiness.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government will resume issuing international student visas but will require applicants to make their social media accounts public for thorough screening. The move follows a temporary halt in interviews for "F," "M," and "J" visa applicants. Prospective students will be vetted for hostile attitudes toward U.S. citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles. The Trump administration has tightened standards for international students, citing alleged acts of anti-Semitism during student protests against Israel.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump questioned the immigration status of workers installing new flagpoles at the White House, appearing to make the remarks in jest. He asked the workers, "Any illegal immigrants?" during a press conference, following a question about his administration's deportation efforts. The workers shook their heads, and Trump added, "If there were, we'll find out." The comments came as Trump instructed ICE officers to oversee the largest mass deportation program in history.</p>

Herzog claimed that recent Israeli strikes have had a genuine impact on Iran's nuclear program, while reiterating the country's commitment to defending itself.</p>

          <p>Faced with rising tariffs, businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower duty costs by altering product materials, dimensions, or compositions. This legal practice involves reclassifying products under different "harmonized system codes" to qualify for lower tariff rates. Examples include manufacturers bundling steel and aluminum elements to qualify for lower duties, and clothing companies modifying designs to fit into different categories. The Supreme Court has previously ruled such practices legal, as long as goods are honestly presented to customs officers.</p>

Nippon Steel finalized a $14.1 billion deal to make U.S. Steel a wholly-owned subsidiary after receiving approval from President Trump, reversing his initial opposition. Nippon Steel has pledged to invest around $11 billion by 2028 in U.S. Steel and maintain its headquarters in Pittsburgh.</p>
