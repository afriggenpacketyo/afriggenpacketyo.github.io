          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a suspected double bomber with alleged ties to animal rights extremist groups, is currently facing an extradition hearing in London after successfully evading the FBI for 21 years. He was eventually located in a secluded cottage in north Wales last year, having been on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list for a series of bombings in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2003. Former FBI agents involved in the case recount missed opportunities to apprehend him before his disappearance, noting that a suspected bomb-making factory was later discovered in his abandoned vehicle following a high-speed chase. This long-awaited development underscores the enduring commitment of law enforcement agencies to pursue justice, regardless of the time elapsed.</p>

          <p>Global financial markets are bracing for a week of continued volatility, particularly in bond markets across the UK and Europe, following unprecedented yield movements. Adding to the economic unease is the political uncertainty in France, where President Emmanuel Macron might call a snap election, raising concerns about investor confidence ahead of Fitch's sovereign debt rating review on September 12. The European Central Bank (ECB) is set to convene on Thursday, with expectations that interest rates will remain at 2%, though President Christine Lagarde is anticipated to address the French political landscape in her press conference. This confluence of factors highlights a critical period for assessing European economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan is rapidly expanding its long-range strike capabilities by developing a new class of low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), known as suicide drones. This initiative aims to provide an affordable alternative to expensive cruise missiles, enabling potential strikes deep within mainland China, including major cities like Beijing and Shanghai, with a reported range of at least 1,000km. The effort involves cooperation with the US, specifically Kratos’ Unmanned Systems Division, and the new system is expected to debut at the Taipei Aerospace & Defence Technology Exhibition this month. This strategy represents a significant shift in Taiwan's defense planning to counter China's formidable arsenal.</p>

          <p>Sky-watchers across much of the UK are set to witness a rare and stunning total lunar eclipse this Sunday evening, which will transform the full Moon into a deep red "Blood Moon" as it passes through Earth's shadow. The full eclipse is scheduled from 18:30 to 19:52, with visibility depending on location, offering eastern parts of the UK the longest viewing window. This celestial event, caused by Rayleigh scattering of light through Earth's atmosphere, is a natural spectacle last seen in the UK in 2022. Enthusiasts are advised to find a clear horizon for the best view, with binoculars or telescopes enhancing the experience.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory are developing advanced TRISO fuel, described as the "most robust nuclear fuel on Earth," to power a new generation of nuclear reactors by 2030. This innovative uranium-based fuel, crafted into small pebbles, is designed to be more efficient and safer than traditional fuel rods, as it cannot melt in a reactor. The initiative aims to boost domestic production of high-assay, low-enriched uranium, reducing reliance on foreign sources and offering a cleaner, stable, low-carbon energy solution. This breakthrough holds immense potential for strengthening U.S. energy security and supporting renewable energy integration.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that international leaders who attempt to appease Donald Trump often face negative consequences, citing examples like India's Narendra Modi and France's Emmanuel Macron. The article suggests that Trump's relationships are personal and impermanent, driven by ego rather than policy, and he respects strength over subservience. It questions why UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer continues a strategy of "Trump-whispering" ahead of an upcoming state visit, despite little apparent benefit and potential reputational cost. The author advocates for resistance and alternative options as a more effective approach when dealing with the former US president.</p>

          <p>A collaborative US-China research team has achieved a significant scientific breakthrough by harnessing the energy from rapidly collapsing vapor bubbles, known as cavitation, to launch millimetre-scale robots. The method involves quickly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles that then violently collapse, generating a powerful launching force. This innovative technique allows scientists to precisely control the launch of these tiny jumpers up to 1.5 meters into the air, and even enable them to swim in water. The study demonstrates cavitation's potential as an efficient and controllable mechanism for robotic propulsion.</p>
