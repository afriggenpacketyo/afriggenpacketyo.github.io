          <p>Paraguayan officials have proposed a new law to encourage the local assembly of electronic and digital goods using imported components, primarily from China. The plan aims to create jobs, diversify the economy, and leverage global trade disputes, such as U.S. tariffs on Chinese and Brazilian goods, to position Paraguay as an attractive manufacturing hub. This initiative would allow businesses to import parts and brand the finished products as “Made in Paraguay,” potentially reducing costs and boosting the national industry.</p>

          <p>American sprinter and former world champion Fred Kerley has been provisionally suspended by the Athletics Integrity Unit and is facing a potential two-year ban. The suspension was issued due to three "whereabouts failures," meaning he missed doping tests over a 12-month period. Kerley, who won silver and bronze medals at the last two Olympics, has announced he will challenge the suspension, arguing that he was not at fault for at least one of the missed tests.</p>

          <p>Shares of Spirit Airlines fell sharply after the company issued a warning about its ability to remain in business for the next year. In a quarterly report, the budget carrier stated there is "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue as a going concern, citing persistent adverse market conditions and weak demand for domestic leisure travel. Despite emerging from bankruptcy earlier this year and implementing cost-cutting measures, the airline is struggling with profitability and needs to secure more liquidity.</p>

Homeowners must still pay for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance, and failing to do so can lead to default and foreclosure, making it a complex financial decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released its annual country reports on human rights, which have been significantly shortened and altered, drawing criticism from rights advocates. The new reports remove entire categories of abuse, such as gender-based violence and violations of assembly rights, and soften criticism of partner countries like El Salvador. Critics argue the changes, which cut about two-thirds of the content from previous years, weaken a vital tool for accountability and signal a retreat from U.S. leadership on human rights.</p>
