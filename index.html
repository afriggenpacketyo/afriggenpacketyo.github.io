          <p>China is currently drafting its 15th five-year plan as its citizens face significant economic pressures, including employment instability, stagnant wages, and deflationary risks. Many individuals, like a former analyst whose salary was halved after a layoff, are now forced to deplete their savings to cover daily expenses, drastically cutting back on discretionary spending. This trend of reduced domestic consumption poses a major challenge for policymakers, who hope the new long-term economic blueprint will provide solutions to boost consumer confidence and spending power across the nation.</p>

          <p>The suspect accused of fatally shooting conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, has been appointed a defense attorney. Kathryn Nester, a veteran former federal public defender, will lead the legal team for Robinson, who faces an aggravated murder charge that could carry the death penalty in Utah. Kirk was shot and killed during a speaking event at Utah Valley University. According to court documents, Robinson allegedly confessed in a text message, stating he acted out of frustration with Kirk's rhetoric.</p>

          <p>A sniper attack at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas resulted in the death of one detainee and critical injuries to two others. The gunman, identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, fired from the rooftop of a nearby building before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted attack, noting that unspent shell casings found at the scene contained anti-ICE messages. This event follows other recent security threats at ICE facilities, prompting calls from officials to temper political rhetoric against the agency.</p>

          <p>The NFL's finance committee has approved a minority stake sale in the Chicago Bears that values the franchise at a record-breaking $8.9 billion. The deal involves the sale of a 2.35% stake held by the estate of the late Andrew McKenna to the team's existing majority owners, the McCaskey and Ryan families. This valuation significantly surpasses the team's estimated worth of $6.4 billion from the previous year and sets a new benchmark for minority stake sales in the league. The team is currently exploring options for a new stadium to replace Soldier Field. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recently appointed U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, is reportedly preparing to seek a grand jury indictment against former FBI Director James Comey for allegedly lying to Congress. This move comes despite a recommendation from career prosecutors who, after a monthslong investigation, found insufficient evidence to establish probable cause for a crime. The decision follows direct public calls from former President Donald Trump to prosecute his political adversaries, including Comey, raising concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>A generic drug named leucovorin, typically used to mitigate chemotherapy side effects, is showing promise as a treatment for some children with autism. The drug, a derivative of folic acid, is believed to bypass a blockage that prevents folate from reaching the brain, which may contribute to neurological issues. Some parents report significant improvements in their children's speech after starting the off-label treatment. While the FDA is beginning the approval process for this use, researchers emphasize the need for larger clinical trials to confirm its efficacy and determine proper dosage.</p>

According to the article, China seeks to redress these imbalances by promoting a more equitable and effective framework for international cooperation, countering what it views as a persistent Cold War mentality and hegemonism.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles court has granted pop superstar Taylor Swift a five-year restraining order against a man who allegedly stalked her and attempted to enter her home on multiple occasions. The man, Brian Jason Wagner, is also accused of writing numerous letters to Swift, claiming they were in a relationship, and successfully changing his driver's license address to hers with the DMV. The order requires Wagner to stay away from Swift's homes, vehicles, and workplaces, and prohibits him from owning firearms. This is not the first time the singer has had to seek legal protection from stalkers.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the proposed deal to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. suggests it could consolidate significant media power under allies of Donald Trump. The agreement would reportedly place the platform's U.S. operations under a new group of investors, including media mogul Rupert Murdoch and Oracle's Larry Ellison, both prominent Trump supporters. This arrangement could give these figures influence over one of the nation's most popular social networks in addition to their existing control over major cable news and entertainment outlets. The article raises concerns about the potential for unprecedented media consolidation and its impact on the information landscape.</p>

          <p>Canada's Supreme Court has issued a temporary stay on an order to cull nearly 400 ostriches at a farm in British Columbia, the site of an avian flu outbreak. The farm's owners had been fighting the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) order, and their recent obstruction of agents led to their brief arrest. The case has drawn international attention, with the court's decision pausing the cull while it decides whether to hear the owners' full appeal. The CFIA has argued that the cull is necessary to prevent the virus from persisting and potentially mutating.</p>

          <p>The family of Joshua Jahn, the 29-year-old identified as the suspect in the deadly sniper attack on a Dallas ICE facility, has expressed profound shock and anguish. In brief interviews, his mother and brother conveyed their distress and inability to process the event, with his mother repeatedly apologizing amidst sobs. Jahn's brother told reporters that Joshua was not particularly political and had not expressed strong feelings about ICE, contrary to evidence of anti-ICE messages on shell casings found at the scene. The family's reaction provides a personal and tragic dimension to the public investigation into the shooting.</p>

          <p>Shares of Canadian mining company Lithium Americas nearly doubled after reports that the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the firm. The proposal emerged during renegotiations of a $2.2 billion Department of Energy loan for the company's Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada, a joint venture with General Motors. An administration official stated that if loan repayments are deferred, the government wants a small equity stake to reduce risk for taxpayers. This move reflects a broader White House strategy to secure domestic supply chains for critical minerals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This editorial argues that while the boom in renewable energy investment is encouraging, it is insufficient to address the climate crisis unless accompanied by a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels. The article highlights that seven of nine planetary boundaries have now been breached, underscoring the urgency of the situation. It notes positive trends, such as record global investment in clean energy, but criticizes major emitters for falling short on their climate pledges. The piece concludes that responsible politicians must accelerate the green transition while simultaneously ensuring a decisive end to the fossil-fuel era.</p>

          <p>As U.S. consumer debt reaches new highs, financial experts are highlighting common pitfalls that can sabotage repayment efforts. Key mistakes to avoid include only making minimum payments, which barely reduces the principal balance and maximizes interest costs over time. Other detrimental habits are accumulating new debt while paying off old balances, failing to seek professional help from credit counselors, and draining emergency savings for debt payments. Experts stress that changing the underlying spending habits that led to the debt is just as crucial as making consistent payments. (not investment advice)</p>

While medical groups like the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) are aligned in recommending the annual flu shot for everyone 6 months and older, their advice on the COVID-19 vaccine now differs. The CDC suggests parents of healthy children "may receive" the shot after discussion with a doctor, whereas the AAP strongly recommends it for young children.

          <p>Ukraine is escalating its war strategy by focusing on long-range drone and missile strikes against Russia's economic infrastructure, particularly its oil and gas industry. Having rapidly developed its domestic weapons production, Ukraine is now capable of hitting targets deep inside Russia, aiming to disrupt the revenue funding the Russian military. This campaign, which has already damaged numerous refineries and reduced Russia's oil exports, is seen by some Ukrainian officials as a form of self-imposed sanctions that could be decisive in ending the war. This approach is being pursued as Ukraine seeks to create leverage independently of fluctuating international support.</p>
