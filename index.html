          <p>S&P Global announced that advertising tech firm AppLovin and stock trading platform Robinhood will be added to the S&P 500 index, effective September 22. This news caused shares for both companies, which went public in 2021, to jump significantly in extended trading. Inclusion in a major index typically boosts a stock's value as fund managers are required to purchase shares to align with the index's updated composition. The move comes after both companies were previously overlooked in index rebalancing, and it further increases the S&P 500's concentration in technology companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter has publicly questioned the lack of updates regarding a complaint against Snap's "My AI" chatbot. The complaint, which raised concerns about potential harms to young users, was referred by the FTC to the Department of Justice earlier this year. Slaughter emphasized that the public deserves to know the status of the investigation, highlighting the issue amid broader scrutiny of AI and child safety. Her comments also come as President Trump attempts to remove her from the commission, a move she is currently challenging in court.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added only 22,000 jobs in August, far below forecasts and marking the weakest job growth in 15 years, excluding the pandemic era. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, its highest since late 2021, while previous months' data was revised downward, indicating the labor market is faltering. Economists attribute the slowdown to factors including the Trump administration's tariffs and economic uncertainty. The disappointing report has solidified expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its upcoming meeting to stimulate the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Trade Commission, under new leadership appointed by President Trump, has voted to vacate the nationwide ban on noncompete agreements that was finalized during the Biden administration. The rule, which was set to invalidate most existing noncompetes and ban new ones, had been halted by a federal judge and was under appeal. The new FTC chair, Andrew Ferguson, argued the ban was an overreach of authority but stated the agency would still pursue enforcement against specific abusive noncompete agreements.

          <p>U.S. immigration authorities conducted a large-scale raid on a Hyundai-LG battery factory under construction in Georgia, detaining 475 people, most of whom are South Korean nationals suspected of working illegally. Officials described it as the largest single-site enforcement operation in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, stemming from a criminal probe into unlawful employment. The raid has sparked diplomatic concern from South Korea, which urged the U.S. to respect the rights of its citizens and warned against infringing upon the interests of its investors amid ongoing trade relations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has ruled that the Trump administration's attempt to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Venezuela and Haiti was illegal. The decision by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen blocks the administration's move, stating that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the authority to unilaterally revoke the protections. The judge criticized the decision-making process as rushed and unprecedented in the program's history.

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to officially rename the U.S. Department of Defense as the Department of War, restoring a name last used in the 1940s. The order states the change is intended to 'project strength and resolve' and better reflect a focus on 'warfighting' and a 'warrior ethos.' The new name will initially be a secondary title pending congressional approval for a permanent change, which would involve a costly overhaul of emblems and materials. The move has been framed by the administration as a restoration of military focus, while critics have called it a childish and concerning shift in tone.</p>

          <p>Nearly a year after Thomas Tuchel was appointed as the manager of England's national football team, questions remain about the team's tactical direction and identity. Having managed only four games, Tuchel's tenure has so far seen few new players capped and a mix of squad selections, from veteran players to surprising omissions. The article analyzes his tactical approach, which appears to favor a physically imposing, ball-dominant style using flexible 4-4-1-1 and 3-2-5 formations. While some statistics show signs of a more aggressive pressing game, the overall performance has yet to clearly distinguish itself from the previous era.</p>

The article highlights examples such as a nominee for the Federal Reserve board who plans to remain in his White House role, and the use of military lawyers as temporary immigration judges.

Massachusetts leads the nation, with residents spending an average of $915 per year, followed by Rhode Island at $573. At the other end of the spectrum, North Dakotans spend the least, at just $50 annually. For many states, lottery sales are a significant source of revenue, accounting for an average of 1% of general funds and as much as 3% in states like Rhode Island and South Dakota. This highlights the important fiscal role these games of chance play in state budgets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of crime data examines the frequent claims by President Trump that Chicago is a 'hell hole' and the 'murder capital of the world.' While Chicago did record the highest total number of homicides of any U.S. city in 2024, its homicide rate per capita ranked tenth among large cities, with places like Memphis and Baltimore being significantly higher. Furthermore, overall violent crime in Chicago has been falling, down 11% from 2023 and roughly half of pre-pandemic levels. Experts caution against ranking cities due to differing borders and reporting methods, noting that perceptions of crime are often shaped by high-profile incidents.</p>

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed her pointed written response to a dissenting opinion by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. Barrett explained that Jackson's 'spirited argument' in a recent case 'merited a spirited response,' emphasizing that their disagreements are confined to legal ideas, not personal animosity. Quoting her mentor, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, she said, 'I attack ideas. I don't attack people.' Barrett stressed that despite vigorous debates on the page, the justices maintain a collegial and friendly relationship, a dynamic she wants the public to understand.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced a pause on the country's electric vehicle mandate, which would have required 20% of new car sales to be electric by 2026. The move is part of a broader economic strategy to contend with U.S. trade policies, which also includes a new 'Buy Canadian' policy prioritizing domestic goods for federal contracts. This policy shift comes as Canada's economy shows signs of weakness, with job losses and rising unemployment. While longer-term EV goals for 2030 and 2035 remain, the immediate pause is intended to help Canada's auto sector manage the impact of U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Washington D.C. police have arrested two 17-year-olds in connection with the June 30 shooting death of Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, a 21-year-old congressional intern. The intern was an innocent bystander struck by stray bullets. The suspects are being charged as adults with first-degree murder while armed. Tarpinian-Jachym's killing was cited by President Trump as a justification for deploying National Guard troops to the capital as part of a federal law enforcement intervention. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro used the arrests to argue for tougher prosecution of juvenile offenders, whom she referred to as 'criminals,' not kids.</p>

          <p>The eight largest U.S. technology companies saw their combined market capitalization increase by $420 billion this week, reaching a total of $21 trillion. This surge was largely driven by a favorable court ruling in Google's antitrust case, which boosted shares of both Alphabet and Apple. The ruling removed a significant overhang for the companies and cleared the path for potential future AI partnerships. Broadcom also contributed significantly to the gains after announcing a major new AI chip customer. These eight mega-cap companies now account for an unprecedented 36% of the S&P 500's total value.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest U.S. unemployment data, which showed a surprising rise to 4.3% and weak job creation, could lead to a further decline in mortgage rates. A faltering labor market increases the pressure on the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy by cutting its benchmark interest rate at its upcoming meeting. Lenders often price anticipated Fed cuts into their mortgage offers in advance, and the weak jobs report may lead them to expect a larger rate cut than previously thought. This could provide a welcome opportunity for homebuyers and homeowners looking to refinance, though the window for lower rates may be brief. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Joseph Emerson, the off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot who attempted to shut down the engines of a passenger flight in October 2023, has pleaded guilty to federal charges of interfering with a flight crew. Emerson was riding in the cockpit jump seat when he tried to pull the fire suppression handles, an act he later attributed to a mental breakdown and lack of sleep. The plea agreement was reached as Emerson wishes to take full responsibility for his actions, which forced the plane to divert and land safely with over 80 people on board.

Rayner stepped down after an ethics investigation found she had breached the ministerial code by failing to pay sufficient tax on a property sale. Her departure prompted a significant restructuring of the government's frontbench, with David Lammy appointed as the new deputy prime minister and Shabana Mahmood becoming home secretary. The shake-up, which also saw Yvette Cooper named foreign secretary, marks the biggest change in Labour's 14 months in power and triggers a new deputy leadership election.</p>
