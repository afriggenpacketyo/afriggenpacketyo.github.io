        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exxon Mobil's first-quarter earnings surpassed Wall Street estimates, driven by volume growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana, coupled with effective cost-cutting strategies that mitigated the impact of declining crude oil prices. CEO Darren Woods acknowledged the market's volatility, citing strong demand offset by higher supply and uncertainty stemming from President Trump's tariffs. The company reported a 6% decrease in profits to $7.71 billion, or $1.76 per share, while global production increased by 20% to 4.55 million barrels per day. Exxon Mobil returned $9.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, demonstrating financial stability amid market fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a slowdown in hiring, the US jobs market performed better than expected in April, adding 177,000 jobs amidst economic uncertainty caused by President Trump's trade policies. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.2%. This article contrasts the positive jobs data with recent figures showing a contraction in US GDP, which has fueled fears of a recession. Economists attribute the GDP decline to a surge in imports as consumers and companies anticipated the implementation of tariffs, which suggests the jobs market may be more resilient than initially feared.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that his administration will be revoking Harvard University's tax-exempt status, escalating the ongoing dispute with the Ivy League school. This decision follows the freezing of $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts to Harvard after the university rejected demands to discontinue its diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. The revocation of tax-exempt status means Harvard would be required to pay federal income taxes, and donations to the university would no longer be tax-deductible. Harvard is likely to pursue legal action in response to this move.</p>

          <p>China's Commerce Ministry indicated that it is "evaluating" an offer from the U.S. to hold talks on tariffs, potentially opening the door to de-escalate the trade war. Despite this shift, the ministry warned against using talks for coercion or extortion. This article contrasts China's openness to negotiations with its previous accusations of the U.S. using tariffs to bully the world. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence that China wants to reach a deal, emphasizing the need for de-escalation.</p>

          <p>Temu is discontinuing sales of goods imported directly from China to the US, shifting to a "local fulfillment model" as the duty-free rule for low-value packages ends. This decision comes as President Trump closed the "de minimis" exemption, which allowed retailers to ship packages under $800 without duties or taxes, a rule that benefited Chinese online retailers like Temu and Shein. The move is expected to push up prices for US customers, though Temu claims its pricing will remain unchanged as it transitions to locally based sellers. This article examines the implications of the tax rule change for online shoppers and retailers.</p>

Some customers who took advantage of the glitch reported donating the discounted items to local food banks.

Japan aims to achieve "win-win" results while highlighting its contributions to the U.S. economy through investment and job creation. Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato suggested that Japan could use its holdings of U.S. Treasuries as a bargaining chip in the negotiations.</p>

          <p>Marco Rubio has assumed the role of interim national security adviser in addition to his existing positions as secretary of state, acting administrator of U.S.A.I.D., and acting archivist for the National Archives and Records Administration.

The appointment follows the removal of Michael Waltz as national security adviser.

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party achieved a narrow victory in a parliamentary special election in Runcorn and Helsby, signaling a potential shift in British politics. The party's candidate, Sarah Pochin, won by just six votes, seizing a seat that had been safely held by Labour. Reform U.K. is also expected to make significant gains in mayoral and local council elections, potentially accelerating the country’s shift toward a more polarized, multiparty system. The results could put pressure on Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch.</p>

          <p>For 2025, some older workers can leverage a 401(k) "super funding" opportunity to help them catch up, as Americans expect they will need $1.26 million to retire comfortably, and more than half expect to outlive their savings, according to a Northwestern Mutual survey. The article details that Thanks to Secure 2.0, the 401(k) catch-up limit has jumped to $11,250 for workers age 60 to 63 in 2025, but that 3% of retirement plans haven't added the feature for 2025, according to Fidelity data. For those plans, catch-up contributions will automatically stop once deferrals reach $7,500, the company told CNBC. While pretax 401(k) contributions offer an up-front tax break, you'll owe regular income taxes on withdrawals, depending on your future tax bracket. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Marco Rubio’s appointment as US national security adviser on top of his role as secretary of state could help streamline communications with Beijing despite his hawkish views on China, according to some analysts. Rubio will be the first secretary of state since Henry Kissinger to hold both roles at the same time and the latest appointment makes him a direct counterpart of China’s Wang Yi. On Thursday, US President Donald Trump said national security adviser Michael Waltz – who has been under pressure since it emerged a journalist had been added to a group chat discussing classified information – would leave his post and had been nominated to become the next US ambassador to the United Nations instead.</p>
