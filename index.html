        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Todd Blanche, previously Donald Trump's personal criminal attorney, has been appointed acting Librarian of Congress, a move that follows the firing of Carla Hayden, the first woman and Black person to hold the position since 2016. The appointment of Blanche, along with two other Justice Department officials to Library of Congress positions, has stirred controversy, particularly among Democrats who question Trump's authority to fire the previous librarian, given the library's status as an agency of the legislative branch. New York Rep. Joe Morelle has requested an inspector general review of Hayden's firing, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called for a congressional commission to appoint the Librarian of Congress. The article highlights the ensuing turmoil and the library staff's uncertainty regarding the leadership changes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is pushing cities and counties to promptly ban homeless encampments, citing public safety risks and unsanitary conditions. Newsom introduced a model ordinance to address persistent encampments and allocated $3.3 billion in funding for housing and drug treatment programs. This move follows a Supreme Court ruling that allows cities to criminalize sleeping outside if shelter spaces are unavailable. The governor's office claims its approach has already cleared over 16,000 encampments and warns that cities could lose state funding if they don't make progress in reducing homelessness.</p>

          <p>Six Bulgarians have been sentenced to jail in the UK for spying on behalf of Russia, targeting individuals perceived as enemies of Vladimir Putin. The spy ring, which operated in multiple European countries, focused on investigative journalists and Russian dissidents, with evidence revealing plans for kidnapping and assassination. The group, motivated by money, referred to themselves as "minions" and communicated frequently about the Russian GRU agency. The case is considered one of the largest foreign intelligence operations uncovered in the UK, exposing the inner workings of a Russian spy cell.</p>

Alexander, originally from New Jersey, was serving in the IDF when captured and is reported to be in contact with his family.

          <p>Germany has tightened its border controls, ordering federal police to turn away non-EU citizens without a visa, including asylum seekers who have already applied in another EU country. This policy, based on Chancellor Friedrich Merz's election pledge, aims to prevent migrants from reaching Germany and motivate neighboring countries to manage migration. The move is legally controversial, as it potentially conflicts with EU laws requiring assessment of asylum applications in the country of first entry. The policy has drawn mixed reactions from German politicians, with left-wing parties criticizing the rejections and the far-right AfD calling for even stricter measures.</p>

          <p>A power failure caused major disruptions to the London Underground network, London Overground, and the Elizabeth line, leading to line suspensions and severe delays. Transport for London reported that the issues stemmed from a short power outage, with power subsequently restored. The National Grid attributed the problems to a "fault" on its transmission network in central London. Passengers experienced significant inconvenience, with some stations closed and inconsistent information from staff. Claire Mann, TfL's chief operating officer, apologized for the disruption and stated efforts were underway to restore the network.</p>

          <p>The first group of white South Africans granted refugee status by the US has arrived, following claims of racial discrimination made by President Trump. South Africa denies any persecution of white Afrikaners and has criticized Trump's assertions. The resettlement scheme, which did not involve the UNHCR, has drawn criticism, with some questioning why Afrikaners' applications were expedited compared to other groups. Trump claimed a "genocide" of white farmers was occurring, despite the claims being widely discredited. Tensions between the US and South Africa have been strained over this issue and other diplomatic disagreements.</p>

The study, funded by Lilly, also noted additional health benefits, such as improved blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and cholesterol numbers.
