          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Paris has reopened the Seine River to public swimmers, a legacy project of the 2024 Olympics. The city has established three supervised outdoor pool zones, complete with amenities, which will be free to access until late August. The original ban, enacted in 1923, was due to severe pollution from sewage and industrial waste, but a €1.4 billion investment in water quality improvement, including a massive underground storage tank, has made swimming safe again. This initiative, championed by Mayor Anne Hidalgo, aims to enhance the quality of life for Parisians and adapt the city to climate change, fulfilling a long-held promise.</p>

          <p>Conor Coady, former captain of Wolves, paid a heartfelt tribute to his late friend and teammate Diogo Jota, who died in a car crash at age 28. Coady described Jota as a dream to work with, the heart and soul of the dressing room, and an amazing person whose death has deeply affected everyone. He recalled Jota's tenacity and talent from his first training session, highlighting his crucial role in Wolves' promotion to the Premier League and subsequent success. Coady expressed immense pride in Jota's achievements at Liverpool, emphasizing that Jota was an even better teammate than he was a footballer, and that their shared memories will last forever.</p>

          <p>Scotland's rugby team narrowly defeated the Maori All Blacks 29-26 in a thrilling opening match of their New Zealand summer tour. Both teams scored four tries, but a crucial first-half penalty by Adam Hastings ultimately decided the outcome in Whangarei. The predominantly second-string Scottish side faced a relentless Maori attack but demonstrated clinical finishing and a formidable defense, especially in the final moments. After the Maori All Blacks erased a deficit to make it a three-point game, Scotland held firm through a prolonged defensive stand deep into stoppage time, forcing a turnover to clinch a hard-fought and famous victory on the North Island.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed allegations of a 'binge drinking culture' and serious safeguarding failures at Bangor Cathedral in Wales. Former choir members described an environment where there was 'any excuse to bring out the wine,' including a 'seven last shots of Christ' drinking game held on Good Friday. These claims follow the immediate retirement of Archbishop Andrew John, who was also Bishop of Bangor, after critical reports highlighted a culture of blurred sexual boundaries and excessive alcohol consumption. The Church in Wales acknowledged the concerns, stating that alcohol is no longer generally available after services and that a new policy is being developed to address the inappropriate behavior.</p>

          <p>The 90-day pause on President Trump's proposed 'liberation day' tariffs is set to expire, creating significant uncertainty for global markets and US businesses. The administration has not achieved its stated goal of securing numerous new trade agreements, leaving the possibility of steep tariffs on dozens of countries looming. Business leaders and economists warn that even the current tariff levels are contributing to inflation, with mid-sized businesses facing an estimated $82.3 billion in additional costs. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has noted that these costs will ultimately be passed on to consumers, despite the administration's insistence that other countries bear the burden.

A survey by the UK Pride Organisers Network revealed that over 85 Pride organizations have seen a drop in corporate sponsorships, forcing some to cancel, scale back, or introduce admission fees for previously free events. Organizers attribute the funding crisis to rising operational costs and a reduction in corporate Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) budgets, particularly from US-based companies. Despite these challenges, organizers remain resilient, vowing that the Pride movement will find ways to persevere and continue providing safe, celebratory spaces for the community.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have successfully restored damaged outer ear tissue in mice by activating a 'genetic switch,' a discovery that could have future implications for human organ regeneration. The study, published in the journal Science, found that mice lost their regenerative ability due to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a key compound in tissue repair. By turning on an 'evolutionarily disabled' genetic pathway, the researchers enabled the complete restoration of lost cartilage and tissue in the mice's ears. While acknowledging the long road to human application, the Beijing-based team is hopeful, as their findings suggest this regenerative mechanism might also be present in other organs.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the intense media outrage over the punk band Bob Vylan's 'Death to the IDF' chant at Glastonbury serves as a significant diversion from the ongoing humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. While the chant sparked widespread condemnation and accusations of antisemitism, the author contends that this narrative deliberately conflates criticism of the Israeli military with hatred of Jewish people. This focus on a punk band's controversial statement overshadows the grim reality in Gaza, where the death toll has surpassed 57,000 amid a devastating siege. The author suggests that this 'Vylanising' of the discourse is a strategy that is losing its effectiveness as more people see the disconnect between such controversies and the observable facts on the ground.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's President William Lai Ching-te is facing a dilemma over how to commemorate the island's World War II history, as his administration's approach is criticized for potentially revisionist undertones. Critics accuse Lai's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) of honoring the Republic of China's (ROC) wartime victory against Japan while simultaneously downplaying the ROC's historical roots on the Chinese mainland before 1949. The Kuomintang (KMT) government retreated to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the civil war but continued to use the ROC title. President Lai's government, however, has consistently emphasized a distinct Taiwanese identity, creating a complex political challenge in reconciling the island's wartime legacy with its modern identity.</p>

The piece argues this is not surprising, as the U.S. historically supported many of these repressive regimes as bulwarks against communism.

          <p>Britpop band Oasis officially reunited for their first concert in 16 years, delivering a powerful performance to a sold-out stadium in Cardiff, Wales. The show, which many fans thought would never happen due to the long-running feud between brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher, kicked off their Live '25 tour. The band played a two-hour set filled with their iconic 1990s hits like 'Wonderwall' and 'Champagne Supernova,' sparking massive sing-alongs from the ecstatic crowd of over 60,000. While the famously sparring brothers kept some distance on stage, they shared a brief hug at the end, marking a momentous occasion for a generation of fans.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was awarded the Order of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, the Caribbean nation's highest civilian honor, making him the first foreign leader to receive it. The award was presented by President Christine Carla Kangaloo during Modi's two-day visit aimed at strengthening diplomatic and economic ties. The visit focused on boosting investment in energy, health, and security, building on a relationship rooted in the 19th-century arrival of indentured Indian laborers. As part of the visit, Modi also announced that sixth-generation citizens of Indian origin in the dual-island nation would now be eligible for Overseas Citizen of India cards.</p>

          <h2>Trump's False Claim About Wind Farms in China is Promptly Fact-Checked</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 23:11:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump recently made a false claim during an attack on renewable energy, stating he has 'never seen a wind farm in China' and questioning if the country uses them at all. Social media users and journalists quickly fact-checked the assertion, pointing out that China is, in fact, the world's leading producer of wind energy, with more than triple the capacity of the United States. The statement came as Trump's new legislation is set to eliminate tax credits for wind and solar power, a move that the Rhodium Group estimates could halt up to 72% of new projects. Critics, including trade unions and columnists, have described the policy as a significant act of strategic self-harm.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers do not plan to alter their trade deadline strategy despite third baseman Max Muncy suffering a bone bruise in his left knee. While the injury is expected to sideline him for about six weeks, the team was relieved it wasn't a season-ending ligament tear. General manager Brandon Gomes stated the front office will rely on internal options like Tommy Edman to cover third base in the interim. With Muncy expected back with over a month remaining before the playoffs, the Dodgers feel no urgent pressure to pursue a high-profile replacement on the trade market, expressing confidence they can weather his temporary absence while he recovers.</p>

          <p>Several shark sightings in the waters off Far Rockaway, Queens, led to the temporary closure of a stretch of beach on the Fourth of July. Drones and social media captured footage of sharks swimming unusually close to beachgoers, prompting swift action from city officials to ensure public safety. The New York City Emergency Management drone unit monitored the activity, and the beach was reopened after about an hour. The incident occurred just days after New York's governor reassured the public that enhanced shark surveillance and safety measures were in place at state beaches ahead of the holiday weekend, highlighting ongoing efforts to protect swimmers.</p>

          <p>As the United States increases its focus on China's dominant shipbuilding industry, competitors like South Korea and Japan are positioning themselves to step up. South Korea's new president, Lee Jae-myung, has campaigned on supporting the domestic sector, which he described as being in a 'major crisis,' and has outlined a policy guide to boost the industry. The new administration's plans focus on developing advanced autonomous and eco-friendly vessels through digitalization and automation. These measures aim to re-establish South Korea as a global maritime power, potentially capturing market share amid shifting geopolitical and trade dynamics affecting China's shipbuilding sector.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has denied a last-ditch effort to halt the deportation of eight immigrants to South Sudan, clearing the way for their removal by the Trump administration. Lawyers for the men had argued they could face 'perilous conditions' in the war-torn country, but the judge ruled he was bound by a previous Supreme Court order. The case is part of a broader legal battle over the administration's aggressive deportation policies, which target individuals with serious criminal convictions. The men, from various countries including Vietnam, Mexico, and one from South Sudan, were scheduled to be flown out of the U.S. following the ruling.</p>

          <p>A protest in Mexico City against gentrification and mass tourism escalated into violence, as a small group of masked individuals began smashing storefronts and harassing tourists. The march, which started peacefully in the popular Condesa and Roma neighborhoods, was organized by locals concerned about soaring rents and displacement driven by an influx of 'digital nomads.' Protesters held signs demanding stricter housing laws and an end to what they see as foreigners taking over their homes. The demonstration, which later moved to the U.S. Embassy, highlights mounting tensions in the capital over the social and economic impacts of its growing popularity with international visitors.</p>
