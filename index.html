          <p>In an interview, Stephen Miran, chair of President Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers, addressed the economic volatility resulting from the administration's trade policies, including tariffs on China. Miran argued that short-term market fluctuations do not necessarily indicate long-term economic problems, and that firms are merely awaiting the outcomes of trade negotiations and tax bill decisions. He also mentioned the administration's focus on deregulation to boost domestic production and competitiveness. Miran defended the president's understanding of trade deficits, stating that a decline in trade with China would indeed reduce the deficit.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Britain, France, Germany, and Poland, during a joint visit to Kyiv, urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to a 30-day cease-fire in Ukraine, warning of "new and massive" sanctions on Russia's banking and energy sectors if he refuses. The proposed cease-fire, coordinated with the White House, aims to de-escalate the conflict, and European leaders pledged to strengthen the Ukrainian military to ensure a lasting peace. Despite these efforts, the Kremlin dismissed the threat of new sanctions and reiterated its opposition to a cease-fire without the cessation of Western military aid to Ukraine.</p>

Scientists and conservationists emphasize the economic and ecological benefits of preservation, noting increased biodiversity and spillover effects for the fishing industry.
