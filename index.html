            <p>Russell Westbrook, embracing a non-traditional role, played a pivotal part in the Denver Nuggets' Game 1 playoff win against the Los Angeles Clippers.

His self-described job is to disrupt the game, which was lauded by teammates and coaches alike for its defensive intensity and offensive aggression.
