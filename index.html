          <p>The number of Americans aged 55 and older experiencing homelessness is rising, with estimates projecting a near tripling by 2030. Factors contributing to this trend include the death of a spouse, divorce, job loss, eviction, and medical issues. Healthcare providers express concern over the vulnerability of this aging population, who often suffer from complex chronic conditions. The article highlights the story of a 65-year-old woman in California struggling with homelessness and health issues, illustrating the challenges faced by many older individuals without adequate support or resources. The professor at the University of Pennsylvania whose research focuses on homelessness and assisted housing policy stated that the major impact is on health care systems. Optimism here is low, due to the tragic and ongoing issue.</p>

          <p>Japan, known for its pacifist constitution, is shifting its focus towards global arms exports to strengthen ties with allies and enhance the interoperability of its forces. This change is driven by security concerns rather than solely seeking profits from increased global arms demand. By exporting arms, Japan aims to standardize maintenance processes and create joint training opportunities with purchasing countries. The move also seeks to bolster Japan's defense industrial base, which has faced challenges due to reliance on U.S. weapon purchases. The article underscores Japan's desire to build domestic capacity and ensure its security in a changing global landscape. This is a relatively stable development.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have released details on key aspects of President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," including changes to tax and Medicaid provisions. The Senate version proposes steeper cuts to Medicaid funding and a permanent extension of the $10,000 state and local tax deduction. Differences between the House and Senate versions, particularly on Medicaid and SALT, could create challenges for the bill's passage. The Senate version also includes provisions to end taxes on tips, overtime, and auto loan interest, while increasing the Child Tax Credit to $2,200. The bill is still being debated.</p>

Chang Youli, a stylist of traditional Chinese clothing (hanfu) based in the city, has noticed many people are joining her trade to cater to a particular type of traveller. The elaborate costumes, typically donned for photoshoots at scenic or historical points of interest, have exploded in popularity in tandem with calls from the government to embrace traditional culture as a means of expressing national confidence. A cottage industry has developed to meet this new demand, employing costumiers, make-up artists and photographers – with some enterprising minds packaging these services together for an all-in-one experience.

          <p>The scientist responsible for overseeing the CDC team that collects data on Covid and RSV hospitalizations resigned on Monday. Dr Fiona Havers told colleagues in an email that she no longer had confidence the data would be used “objectively or evaluated with appropriate scientific rigor to make evidence-based vaccine policy decisions”, according to Reuters. She resigned before a planned meeting of a new vaccine panel put in place by Robert Kennedy Jr after he fired all 17 members of the CDC’s independent vaccine advisory panel. This is a concern for the future.</p>
