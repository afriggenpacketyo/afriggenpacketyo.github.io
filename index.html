          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him "stupid" and doubting the likelihood of a rate cut. Trump argued that the Fed's key borrowing rate should be significantly lower, claiming that higher rates are costing the U.S. "hundreds of billions" of dollars. He also stated that he believes Powell dislikes him and suggested he would do a better job as Fed chair. Market expectations indicate no rate cut is anticipated at the current meeting, with the next move expected in September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he is undecided on whether the U.S. military should join Israel's attacks on Iran, but noted it may not be too late for a nuclear program deal. He mentioned that Iran had sought talks, even suggesting a White House delegation, but Trump believes it is very late for discussions. Iran responded via social media, denying any request to "grovel" and warning against threats, promising reciprocal measures. An Iranian official cautioned that U.S. intervention would risk "all-out war," as the conflict with Israel continues, with both sides exchanging fire and causing casualties. The optimism score reflects the high level of geopolitical risk.</p>

          <p>FreshRealm is recalling pre-made chicken fettuccine alfredo meals sold at Kroger and Walmart due to possible Listeria contamination. The recalled products have the USDA mark of inspection and establishment numbers "EST. P-50784," "EST. P-47770," or "EST. P-47718" printed on the packaging. The chicken dishes could be linked to a possible outbreak strain of Listeria, which has been associated with three deaths and one fetal loss. Consumers are urged not to consume the products and to either throw them away or return them to the place of purchase. The recall and potential health risks associated with Listeria warrant a low optimism score.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei threatened the U.S. with "irreparable damage" if Washington follows through with a military strike against Iran. Khamenei stated that any American military entry will be met with irreparable damage, and the potential involvement will backfire. The U.S. has been attempting to broker a deal over Iran's nuclear program, but talks have yet to bear fruit. Washington has previously insisted it was not directly involved in the hostilities, but President Trump's recent comments have stoked speculation over a potential direct U.S. military attack against Iranian sites. The optimism score reflects the high level of geopolitical risk and potential for escalation.</p>

          <p>The trailer for the new Bruce Springsteen biopic, *Deliver Me From Nowhere*, has been released, featuring Jeremy Allen White portraying The Boss during the recording of his album *Nebraska*.

White studied hundreds of archive videos to capture Springsteen's mannerisms and voice. Fan reaction to the trailer has been cautiously optimistic, with praise for White's portrayal and the film's recreation of the *Nebraska* era.

It also discusses how gossip can be a valuable social tool for building intimacy and addressing the male loneliness epidemic.

          <p>General Mills announced that it will remove artificial coloring from all of its products by the end of 2027. The company stated that 85% of its retail products and "nearly all" of its school offerings are already made without "certified colors." It will remove the dyes from all of its cereals and school products by the summer of 2026. This decision follows a similar announcement from Kraft Heinz and reflects a growing consumer demand for natural ingredients. The move towards healthier food products contributes to a higher optimism score.</p>
