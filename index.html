          <p>Liverpool has submitted an improved £35 million bid for Crystal Palace's captain, Marc Guehi, which now includes a 10% sell-on clause. Crystal Palace has countered, requesting an additional £5 million in bonuses, as negotiations continue ahead of the transfer deadline. With Guehi's contract expiring next summer, Palace is reluctant to lose the 25-year-old on a free transfer. The club is actively trying to sign two new central defenders, which could facilitate Guehi's move to Liverpool.</p>

          <p>Chelsea has abruptly canceled striker Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich, instructing him to return to London after he had already traveled to Germany for a medical. The decision came after fellow Chelsea striker Liam Delap sustained a serious hamstring injury during a match, potentially sidelining him for six to eight weeks. The sudden reversal has reportedly left Jackson angry, as Chelsea's attacking options were unexpectedly reduced from four strikers to just one fit player.</p>

          <p>Yemen's Houthi movement has officially confirmed the death of its self-proclaimed Prime Minister, Ahmed Ghaleb Nasser al-Rahawi, in an Israeli airstrike on the capital, Sanaa. The strike, which the Israel Defense Forces described as targeting a "military target," also killed several other senior Houthi officials, including the foreign and justice ministers. Rahawi was considered a figurehead rather than a key military decision-maker, and the movement's ultimate leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, was not among the casualties.</p>

The judge ruled the practice unlawful for detaining migrants in the country's interior, affirming that due process must be afforded to those subjected to it.</p>

          <p>Several local councils in the UK are continuing to pursue legal action to prevent hotels from being used to house asylum seekers, despite a recent Court of Appeal ruling against such a challenge. The court overturned an injunction obtained by Epping Forest District Council, but the council is now considering an appeal to the Supreme Court. The ruling has not deterred other councils, who argue the practice violates planning laws and creates public safety risks, amid ongoing protests and counter-demonstrations.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Federal Appeals Court Rules Trump's Global Tariffs Unlawful</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump's imposition of broad "reciprocal tariffs" on nearly all U.S. trading partners represents an illegal overreach of executive power. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which the administration used for justification, does not grant the president the authority to impose such taxes. The tariffs will remain in place until mid-October to allow for a likely appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, creating uncertainty for businesses and global trade.</p>

          <p>After a comprehensive, two-year study identified agricultural pollution as a major contributor to Iowa's water quality problems, public officials have quietly cut the funding intended to promote its findings. The report, which links farming practices to contaminants in drinking water sources for 600,000 people, has been controversial in the politically influential farm state. Sources involved in the project state that over $400,000, earmarked for public awareness and education, was "zeroed out" without explanation, hindering efforts to address the issue.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor Rebecca Patterson has warned that President Trump's efforts to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook could threaten the central bank's independence and harm the U.S. economy. Patterson, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, argues that politicizing the Fed could lead to weaker stock market performance, higher inflation, and reduced foreign investment over the long term. While markets might initially react positively to politically motivated interest rate cuts, she believes the sustained damage to institutional integrity would ultimately hurt the economy.

          <p>President Donald Trump's uncharacteristically low public profile and empty weekend schedule have fueled widespread speculation on social media about his whereabouts and health. The 79-year-old president has not been seen in public since a cabinet meeting early in the week. This comes after recent observations of bruising on his hands, which the White House previously attributed to a diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency. Despite the rumors, Trump posted on Truth Social Friday to address a court ruling on his tariffs.</p>
