            <p>The Bank of Korea (BOK) decided to keep its policy rate steady at 2.75% amidst ongoing challenges including U.S. tariffs and the anticipation of a snap presidential election following the removal of Yoon Suk Yeol from office. South Korea faces a 25% tariff on automobiles, steel, and aluminum, impacting major exporters like Hyundai and Kia. The BOK had previously lowered its 2025 growth forecast due to these economic pressures, while inflation remains slightly above the bank's target. The Kospi stock index experienced a slight increase following the announcement, while the won weakened against the dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Faced with the potential of increased tariffs on South Korean cosmetics, U.S. consumers are reportedly panic-buying Korean beauty products, according to retailers. With a 25% tariff looming after a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, stores like Senti Senti in Brooklyn are seeing customers purchase multiples of their favorite items. The Personal Care Products Council expresses concerns over potential price hikes, as the cosmetic industry relies on a complex ecosystem, making it difficult for small businesses to plan. Retailers are preparing for price increases as early as late April or early May, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs.</p>

            <p>Following a report indicating a rise in autism diagnoses, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced new NIH studies to investigate potential environmental factors contributing to autism, pushing back against the idea that increased diagnoses are solely due to better recognition. Kennedy emphasized the need to address the "environmental exposures" behind the rise, citing concerns about the impact of autism on families and children's futures. Experts acknowledge the increasing rates of diagnoses and potential environmental factors, but also attribute a significant portion of the increase to the expanding definition of autism. Autism Speaks has criticized Kennedy's comments, calling them "extremely disappointing and damaging."</p>

            <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that tariffs implemented by the Trump administration could create a challenging scenario for the central bank, potentially leading to both increased inflation and a slowdown in economic growth. Powell indicated the Fed is prepared to remain patient and assess the impacts of these policies before making adjustments to interest rates. Economists have lowered expectations for U.S. economic growth and forecast higher inflation due to tariffs, which are essentially taxes passed on to consumers. While some Fed officials believe the impact of tariffs will be temporary, others are more focused on fighting the inflationary effects, creating some division within the Fed's interest rate-setting committee.

The report highlights the use of straw buyers and "ant trafficking" to bypass a UN embargo, exacerbating gang violence and instability in Haiti.

She claims her business cannot survive the short-term pain caused by the tariffs, as raising prices to cover the costs would make her products unaffordable for customers.

            <p>Scientists are increasingly focused on the search for life on other planets, driven by discoveries of exoplanets and advancements in telescope technology, such as the James Webb Space Telescope. The detection of a gas produced by simple marine organisms on planet K2-18b has brought the prospect of finding alien life closer. While confirming life on another world could transform humanity's understanding of its place in the universe, it also raises questions about the nature of such life and its potential impact on Earth. Missions to Mars and icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn are also underway to search for signs of past or present life within our solar system.</p>

            <p>Japan's March exports rose by 3.9% year-on-year, falling short of expectations, as tariffs began to impact trade. Exports to the U.S., Japan's second-largest trading partner, increased by 3.1%. The data does not fully reflect the impact of recent U.S. tariffs on auto imports, steel, and aluminum. Japan is currently engaged in trade negotiations with the U.S., covering tariffs, military support costs, and trade fairness. Automobiles are Japan's top export to the U.S., accounting for a significant portion of shipments. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Los Angeles County officials are considering doubling misdemeanor fines for those participating in street takeovers, including spectators, from $500 to $1,000. The move aims to deter the illegal events, which often result in damaged vehicles, injuries, and even fatalities. The county also plans to urge social media platforms to remove and demonetize posts promoting street takeovers. The number of street takeovers has decreased in some areas, but has increased in Supervisor Holly J. Mitchell's district, prompting the proposed measures.</p>

            <p>Residents of Chelsea, Michigan, formed a human chain to move 9,100 books from Serendipity Books' old location to a new storefront. About 300 people participated in the "book brigade," passing books one-by-one along a sidewalk. The move took just under two hours, and the books were even placed back on the shelves in alphabetical order. The bookstore has been in Chelsea since 1997, and the community rallied to support the move.</p>

            <p>Scientists have found promising hints of life on the distant exoplanet K2-18b, detecting molecules associated with life in its atmosphere using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). A Cambridge team found chemical signatures of dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and dimethyl disulphide (DMDS), gases produced by marine phytoplankton and bacteria on Earth. While this detection is not yet conclusive, it represents the strongest evidence yet of possible life on another world. Researchers emphasize that further data is needed to confirm these results and rule out non-biological explanations for the presence of these gases.</p>

Riley emphasized the importance of building a roster that is not overly reliant on the portal, and with high player prices, he can afford to be more selective. While USC may consider adding a linebacker or offensive lineman, Riley expressed confidence in the current players and their commitment to the team.

            <p>Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among Latinas, who face systemic and cultural barriers to early screening. Latinas are less likely to be screened early enough due to cultural, systemic and environmental factors, which puts them at greater risk to die a totally preventable death. A lack of awareness about dense breasts, which can obscure cancer on mammograms, and lower rates of BRCA mutation screening contribute to the problem. Barriers to healthcare access, language barriers, and cultural stigmas also play a role in delayed diagnoses and treatment.</p>
