          <p>This article recounts the harrowing experience of Michelle Renee, a California bank manager who, along with her daughter, was kidnapped and forced to rob her own bank in 2000. The perpetrators strapped fake dynamite to Michelle, her daughter, and her roommate, and threatened to detonate it if she didn't comply with their demands. After successfully robbing the bank and returning home, Michelle and her daughter were freed, and the authorities were alerted. The subsequent investigation revealed a web of lies and deceit, with one of the kidnappers falsely claiming that Michelle was in on the plot. Despite overwhelming evidence of her innocence, Michelle faced intense scrutiny and was treated like a criminal during the trial of her kidnappers, but she was ultimately vindicated when the true mastermind confessed decades later.</p>

          <p>Despite much of the world moving past the coronavirus pandemic, many hospitals in Japan continue to enforce strict visitation policies, causing distress for patients and their families. A group of physicians and social workers are now advocating for the abolishment or reduction of these restrictions, arguing they infringe on human rights. One doctor recounts his family's struggle to visit his cancer-stricken mother-in-law, highlighting the inconsistencies and lack of scientific basis for the policies. While the health ministry has recommended considering visitation opportunities, the decision remains with individual facilities, prompting concerns that policies may revert to strict measures based on infection rates.</p>

          <p>Yosemite National Park's Tioga Road, a scenic section of Highway 120, will reopen to all traffic on Memorial Day, marking the park's eastern entrance accessible after its closure due to winter conditions.

Visitors planning to enter Yosemite during peak hours over the holiday weekend will require reservations, and limited services are expected along Tioga Road.

          <p>John Woeltz, a crypto investor, was arrested in New York City for allegedly kidnapping and torturing an Italian tourist. The victim, who arrived from Italy on May 6th, was lured to Woeltz's home under the pretense of retrieving Bitcoin he had previously been forced to send the suspect. According to prosecutors, the victim was then tied up and tortured for several weeks, enduring electric shocks, a saw cut to his leg, and forced crack cocaine use. The victim managed to escape and flagged down a traffic agent, leading to Woeltz's arrest; evidence recovered from the scene included weapons, body armor, and disturbing photographs.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in Scientific Reports suggests that a dog owner's work-related stress can transfer to their canine companions. Researchers found that dog owners who frequently ruminate about work issues at home are more likely to have dogs exhibiting stress-related behaviors. This phenomenon, known as "crossover," highlights dogs' sensitivity to their owners' moods and potential changes in care routines. The article suggests that employed dog owners could improve their pet's well-being by avoiding work-related thoughts when at home, as dogs can pick up on human feelings through subtle cues and changes in behavior.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man who was wrongfully deported to Mexico despite facing risks of harm in both countries. The man, who is gay, had been granted protection from being returned to Guatemala but was instead sent to Mexico, a decision the judge deemed lacking due process. The ruling adds to a series of court findings against recent Trump administration deportations and highlights the administration's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway has become the first train company to be renationalized under the Labour government, marking a shift towards public ownership of rail services. The government emphasizes plans to improve services and reinvest profits into infrastructure, while unions express concerns over potential outsourcing. The renationalized service will be integrated into Great British Railways, which will oversee all railway infrastructure, though the organization's official establishment awaits parliamentary approval. While the government cannot promise lower fares, it assures passengers of "great value for money."</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has implemented new restrictions on press access at the Pentagon, limiting reporters' access to many areas unless accompanied by a government escort. The restrictions, justified by Hegseth as necessary to protect national security, have been met with strong criticism from the Pentagon Press Association, which views them as an attack on press freedom. The National Press Club has urged the Pentagon to reverse course, arguing that restricting access undermines public trust and limits the ability of journalists to report on the military.</p>

          <p>Swarms of midges have become a significant nuisance at the World Exposition in Osaka, causing discomfort among visitors and raising concerns about potential health issues. The small flies are present on walls and pillars, forcing people to swat them away, and while they don't bite, dead midges can trigger allergic reactions. Expo organizers are taking measures, such as spraying insecticide and installing repellent lights, to combat the infestation, with Osaka Gov. Hirofumi Yoshimura seeking assistance from an insecticide manufacturer.</p>

          <p>New York City's beaches opened for the season with 280 lifeguards, falling short of the required number, amid a continued staffing shortage. Despite this, the number of lifeguards is higher than last year's Memorial Day weekend, and city officials anticipate an increase in staffing as summer progresses. Incentives like increased hourly wages and signing bonuses are being offered to attract more lifeguards, and efforts are being made to make training more accessible. While beachgoers expressed relief at seeing lifeguards on duty, the city remains focused on ensuring beach safety despite the ongoing shortage.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, a feminist author, journalist, and activist known for her book "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape," has died at the age of 90. Her book, published in 1975, reframed sexual assault as a crime of power and violence rather than passion, leading to changes in laws and societal attitudes. While the book was widely praised, it also drew criticism for its feminist ideology and assertions about the role of men. Brownmiller remained a vocal advocate against pornography and taught at Pace University until her 80s.</p>
