          <p>American sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson's challenging week concluded with her failing to qualify for the 200-meter final at the U.S. track and field championships. She missed advancing by just one-hundredth of a second, finishing fourth in her heat. This comes shortly after her arrest on a domestic violence charge for an alleged assault on her boyfriend, which disrupted her preparations. While she has an automatic entry to the world championships for the 100-meter race as the defending champion, her opportunity to compete in the 200-meter event has now ended.</p>

          <p>A group of at least 51 Democratic legislators has fled Texas to deny Republicans the necessary quorum to vote on a controversial new congressional map. The proposed redistricting plan, backed by former President Trump, aims to create more GOP-leaning districts and solidify the party's majority ahead of future elections. Democrats argue the move is a partisan power grab that gerrymanders districts unfairly, while Republicans, including the governor, have condemned the walkout. This action halts the special legislative session, which also included disaster relief funding, and could result in fines for the absent lawmakers.</p>

          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake was reported in the New York City and New Jersey area, with its epicenter located near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. While the quake was minor, residents across the region reported feeling brief but distinct shaking, with some describing it as feeling like a large impact against their homes. The U.S. Geological Survey confirmed the event, noting that such tremors are rare but not unheard of on the East Coast. No significant damage or injuries were reported, and officials stated there was little cause for alarm.</p>

          <p>In an interview, economist Jeffrey Sachs expressed concern that aggressive U.S. rhetoric and trade policies toward China could become a self-fulfilling prophecy leading to conflict. He argued that the U.S. initiated the trade war and must now show prudence, as both nations have economic leverage over each other. Sachs advised that China should focus on expanding exports to markets in Africa, Asia, and Latin America rather than relying on the U.S. and Europe. He predicted continued friction but hoped that the mutual benefits of trade would encourage rationality and prevent major escalation. (not investment advice)</p>

The collapse occurred following a 4.2 magnitude tremor, trapping the workers deep underground in collapsed tunnels. The state-owned mining company, Codelco, expressed condolences to the families of the victims. Authorities have now shifted their focus to a criminal investigation to determine if the collapse was caused by mining activities or natural tectonic shifts.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov Volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in centuries, sending a plume of ash and gas thousands of feet into the air. The event occurred just days after a massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck the region, raising questions about a potential connection. Seismology experts suggest that while the quake likely didn't cause the eruption directly, its seismic waves could have destabilized a system that was already close to erupting. An aviation alert was issued, but the sparsely populated area faces no immediate threat.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, announced that applications for a $50 billion stabilization fund for rural hospitals will be available in early September. This fund was created as part of recent legislation that also made significant cuts to Medicaid, raising concerns about the financial viability of rural healthcare providers. Dr. Oz stated the money is intended to support workforce development, system right-sizing, and the adoption of technology like telehealth. The legislation also introduces new work requirements and eligibility checks for some Medicaid recipients. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers managed to secure a 3-0 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays, relying on strategic baserunning and timely hitting rather than power. After struggling offensively for much of the series, the Dodgers manufactured runs through aggressive sends, a double-steal, and a sacrifice fly. Pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5 ⅔ scoreless innings, and the bullpen closed out the game despite a tense ninth inning. The win gave the Dodgers a winning 5-4 record on their nine-game road trip, providing some needed momentum for the slumping lineup.</p>

They are leveraging their backgrounds as prosecutors to campaign on platforms of restoring the rule of law and providing a check on executive power.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for consumers who were victims of mis-sold car finance, with estimated payouts to be less than £950 per deal. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while hidden commissions were not broadly unlawful, excessively high commissions could be deemed unfair. The FCA will consult on the details of the scheme, which could cover millions of agreements dating back to 2007 and cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion. The first payouts are anticipated to begin next year. (not investment advice)</p>
