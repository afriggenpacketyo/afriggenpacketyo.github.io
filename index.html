          <p>Switzerland is holding a second national referendum on the introduction of electronic identity cards, after a previous proposal was rejected in 2021 due to data privacy concerns. The revised plan, which is optional and government-run, stores data on users' smartphones rather than a central server to address these issues. Supporters argue it will streamline online bureaucratic processes, but opponents remain wary of potential privacy infringements and data misuse, despite polls suggesting increased public support this time.</p>

This long-running conflict, rooted in drug trafficking and territorial disputes, has resulted in numerous murders and violent attacks across Scotland. The feud has now gained international dimensions, with gang leaders operating from abroad and forming alliances with global crime networks like the Kinahan cartel.</p>

          <p>The article provides a detailed overview of Transnistria, the internationally unrecognized breakaway region in eastern Moldova that serves as a strategic Russian military and operational base. It traces the region's history from the Soviet era, through its post-Soviet war of secession supported by Russia, to its current status as a dictatorial, oligarch-controlled territory. The piece also details its economic structure, the presence of Russian troops, and the ongoing geopolitical tensions it creates between Moldova, the EU, and Russia.</p>

          <p>The UK, France, and Germany have reactivated the "snapback" provision of the 2015 nuclear deal, reimposing comprehensive UN sanctions on Iran due to its continued nuclear escalation and lack of cooperation with inspectors. The move follows Iran's suspension of inspections after US and Israeli strikes on its nuclear facilities, effectively dismantling the landmark agreement. While European powers state diplomacy is not over, Iran has condemned the sanctions as illegal and unjust, further escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>The British government will underwrite a £1.5 billion loan to support Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and its extensive supply chain after a cyberattack forced the carmaker to halt all production for weeks. The prolonged shutdown has put thousands of jobs at risk and threatened smaller suppliers with bankruptcy, prompting this unprecedented government intervention. The loan is intended to provide financial stability and ensure suppliers are paid as JLR works to recover from the hack and resume operations.</p>
