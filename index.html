          <p>The United Kingdom and the European Union have finalized a comprehensive agreement aimed at resetting their relationship following Brexit. The deal encompasses various sectors including security, energy, trade, travel, and fisheries, with officials from both sides hailing it as a new chapter after years of tense relations. The agreement seeks to reduce bureaucratic obstacles for British businesses, facilitate food and drink exports, and extend fishing rights for EU trawlers in UK waters until 2038. British travelers will also benefit from the use of eGates at EU airports, reducing passport control queues, though some issues like youth mobility schemes remain under discussion.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones, according to a statement from his office.

          <p>The Democratic primary for mayor of Pittsburgh has evolved into a proxy fight between the progressive and centrist wings of the Democratic Party, as the city seeks direction after recent national election losses. Incumbent Mayor Ed Gainey, a progressive, faces a challenge from Corey Oâ€™Connor, a well-funded centrist, with outside political groups injecting money into the race. The candidates differ most sharply on housing policy, with Gainey advocating for mandated affordable housing throughout the city, while Oâ€™Connor favors a neighborhood-by-neighborhood approach. The outcome of the primary, which is likely to determine the next mayor, will test the strength of progressive policies in Pittsburgh.</p>

          <p>President Trump and President Putin are scheduled to discuss the war in Ukraine, marking their third known conversation since Trump's second term began. The call occurs amidst a flurry of diplomatic activity aimed at resolving the three-year conflict, with both Russia and Ukraine attempting to sway Trump with flattery. Despite Trump's initial promise to swiftly end the fighting, deep divisions remain between the warring countries, with Russia recently launching deadly drone strikes on civilian targets. Trump also plans to speak with President Zelensky of Ukraine and European allies, as international pressure mounts for a ceasefire and negotiated solution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is scheduled to speak separately with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy to address the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Trump aims to halt the "bloodbath" and discuss trade, while the Kremlin confirmed the call will consider the outcome of recent negotiations in Istanbul. The U.S. mediation follows face-to-face talks between Russian and Ukrainian representatives, although significant progress on a peace process remains elusive. Trump's recent shift towards criticizing Putin and supporting a ceasefire suggests a change in approach, but the contours of a resolution remain uncertain due to maximalist Russian demands and Ukraine's reluctance to concede territory.</p>

The attack resulted in civilian casualties, including one death and several injuries, and occurred amidst ongoing peace talks and meetings between U.S. officials and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy in Rome.

          <p>Portugal's center-right coalition secured victory in a snap election but failed to achieve a majority, as the hard-right Chega party experienced a significant surge in votes. The results solidify Chega's transformation from a protest movement into a prominent political force, capitalizing on anti-immigration sentiment and economic resentments. While Prime Minister LuÃ­s Montenegro's coalition has refused to ally with Chega, the election outcome suggests Portugal is likely headed for another unstable minority government. Analysts suggest the party's success is partially attributed to its promises of tougher immigration measures and a focus on law and order.</p>

Some borrowers report credit score drops of over 100 points due to missed payments, highlighting a lack of understanding of the repayment process.

The Conservatives have criticized the deal as a "surrender," particularly regarding fishing quotas and agricultural rules, while the Liberal Democrats advocate for rejoining the EU's customs union. The success of Starmer's strategy depends on whether opposition parties campaign heavily on these issues, indicating ongoing public controversy over Brexit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Domestic energy prices in the UK are forecast to decline in July, marking the first drop in the regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. The average household's annual bill is predicted to decrease by Â£129, representing a nearly 7% reduction. While this decrease offers some relief to households facing high energy costs, bills remain significantly above levels seen at the start of the decade. Experts emphasize the need for policy action from the UK government to further reduce energy bills and upgrade homes at scale.</p>

          <p>Despite efforts to improve polling accuracy, pollsters continue to face challenges in accurately predicting election outcomes, as demonstrated by the 2024 election results. Nonresponse bias, where those who participate in polls differ significantly from those who don't, remains a key issue. While pollsters have attempted to address this through weighting and modeling, these methods can be influenced by unconscious biases and assumptions. The Dartmouth Poll, despite its sophisticated methodology, serves as an example of the difficulties in overcoming these challenges, highlighting the need for continued innovation in polling techniques.</p>
