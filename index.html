          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly approved a massive tax and spending bill, a key legislative priority for the Trump administration, with a 51-50 vote requiring the Vice President to break the tie. The legislation, which extends trillions in tax cuts and increases spending on border security and defense, now returns to the House for final approval. The bill's passage followed a marathon session and intense negotiations to secure support from hesitant Republican senators concerned about its projected $3.3 trillion increase to the federal deficit and cuts to social programs. The White House is pushing for the bill to be signed into law by the July 4th holiday. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spanish banking giant Santander is set to acquire British high street bank TSB from its current owner, Sabadell, in a deal valued at up to £2.9 billion. This marks the second time in a decade that TSB, a bank with roots stretching back over 200 years, has been sold. The future of the TSB brand remains uncertain, as Santander has not commented on whether it will be retained. The acquisition comes as Santander continues to streamline its UK operations by closing branches in response to the growing trend of digital banking. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Over 170 charities and aid groups are calling for the dissolution of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a US and Israeli-backed system for delivering aid into Gaza. The groups argue the system, which bypasses the UN and uses private security firms, has led to grave danger for civilians, with medical teams reporting over 500 deaths near its aid routes since late May. The UN has stated the plan breaches humanitarian rules by failing to protect civilians. Concurrently, the Israeli military is reviewing a recent airstrike on a Gaza cafe that resulted in 24 fatalities.</p>

The city also scored high on work-life balance, with short commute times and a large remote workforce. Other top-ranking cities included Richmond, Virginia, and Seattle, Washington, while the study also highlighted cities excelling in specific areas like employer-sponsored healthcare and remote work friendliness.</p>

The conflict erupted over Musk's vocal opposition to the president's major tax and spending bill, which Musk argues will dangerously increase the national debt. In response to Musk's campaign against the legislation, Trump suggested he might direct the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a program Musk once led, to review subsidies for Musk's companies like SpaceX and Tesla.

Lululemon, known for its high-end athleisure wear, stated it takes the protection of its intellectual property seriously and will pursue legal action when necessary.

The lawsuit alleges that Liu used his final two weeks at Apple to download proprietary files related to the Vision Pro headset and other projects to his personal accounts. Apple claims Liu did not disclose his new job at Snap, a maker of smart glasses, and could use the stolen trade secrets there. The tech giant is seeking damages and a forensic inspection of Liu's devices to ensure the confidential information is deleted.</p>

The spending blitz, which includes acquiring a major stake in ScaleAI to hire its CEO and offering massive compensation packages, could add $1 billion in annual expenses. Despite the high cost, investors seem confident in the long-term potential for AI to drive revenue growth and cost savings for the company. The goal is to build a "superintelligence" unit to advance Meta's AI capabilities, particularly its Llama large language model, to better compete with rivals like Google and OpenAI.

The bill, which required Vice President JD Vance to break a 50-50 tie, now heads back to the House of Representatives, where its fate is uncertain due to divisions within the Republican conference. The legislation extends tax cuts from 2017, funds mass deportations, and cuts spending on social safety net programs like Medicaid. Despite its passage in the Senate, opposition from both moderate and fiscally conservative House Republicans could derail its path to becoming law. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid his public feud with President Trump over a major spending bill, Elon Musk has threatened to form his own political party, dubbed the "America Party." This article explores the significant hurdles such a venture would face in the U.S. political system, which is dominated by a two-party, "winner-takes-all" structure. Experts note that successful third parties are rare, often acting as "spoilers" that pull votes from major candidates rather than winning elections themselves. While Musk has immense financial resources, building a grassroots movement and overcoming systemic barriers would be a formidable challenge for any new political faction.</p>

The judge found "no rational basis" for the administration's plan, which was initiated by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and involved laying off 10,000 employees.

          <h2>Waffle House Removes Egg Surcharge as Market Prices Decrease</h2>

          <p>Waffle House has officially removed the 50-cent surcharge it had added to egg orders, signaling a normalization of egg prices after a period of record highs. The restaurant chain, which serves hundreds of millions of eggs annually, implemented the temporary charge in February due to soaring wholesale costs caused by a major avian flu outbreak. The removal of the surcharge reflects a broader trend of falling egg prices, which Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins noted is providing relief to families. Overall food prices have continued to climb, but the stabilization of this breakfast staple marks a welcome change for consumers.</p>
