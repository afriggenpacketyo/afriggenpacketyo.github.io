          <p>Following a summit, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation's (SCO) new development strategy extending to 2035. This long-term plan is designed to guide the bloc's direction for the next decade, emphasizing a unified stance against unilateral actions and bullying, seen as an implicit critique of U.S. policies under President Trump. The strategy advocates for a multilateral trading system centered around the WTO, positioning the SCO as a key force in promoting a multipolar global order amid escalating geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama has declared an ambitious plan for the nation to become a fully digital, cashless economy by 2030, aligning with its goal of EU integration. However, financial and cybersecurity experts express skepticism, citing the country's high rate of economic informality, a population heavily reliant on cash, and significant vulnerabilities in its digital infrastructure, as demonstrated by major cyberattacks in recent years. Critics argue that the plan is unrealistic and potentially dangerous without first establishing robust cybersecurity measures and addressing the digital divide, especially in rural areas.</p>

          <p>Extortion rackets are crippling Cape Town's economy, with organized crime syndicates systematically targeting sectors like nightlife, construction, and transportation. Business owners, particularly non-South African nationals, face intimidation and violence for refusing to pay protection money, leading to a climate of fear that stifles economic activity. Despite some high-profile arrests, law enforcement struggles to combat the issue, with a low conviction rate and internal corruption hindering progress, while infrastructure projects worth millions are stalled due to the pervasive threat.</p>

She indicated that President Trump has agreed to an American presence to backstop these efforts, though the White House has previously stated it would not deploy ground troops. This development comes amid ongoing negotiations to broker a ceasefire, with Ukraine demanding robust security guarantees to prevent future Russian aggression, a condition the Kremlin has consistently rejected.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has retracted its subpoena compelling former Special Counsel Robert Mueller to testify regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. The decision was made after the committee learned of health issues that prevent the 81-year-old from appearing, with his family recently disclosing his 2021 Parkinson's disease diagnosis. Mueller, who served as FBI Director from 2001 to 2013, was subpoenaed for information relevant to the period when Epstein was under FBI investigation, as part of the committee's broader inquiry into the matter.</p>

          <p>A coronal mass ejection from the sun over the weekend is expected to create a geomagnetic storm, potentially making the aurora borealis visible across parts of Canada and 18 northern U.S. states on Monday night.

While not expected to be as intense as the major storm in spring 2024, it presents a significant opportunity for skygazers in states like Montana, Michigan, Maine, and New York to witness the phenomenon.</p>

          <p>Motorists across India are reporting reduced mileage and increased engine maintenance costs following the nationwide rollout of E20 fuel, which contains 20% ethanol. While the government promotes the blend as a way to reduce oil imports and save billions, a recent survey found that many owners of older vehicles are experiencing unusual wear on components like fuel lines and pumps. Despite a Supreme Court challenge being dismissed, experts remain divided, acknowledging the fuel's environmental benefits but cautioning about its corrosive effects on vehicles not designed for high ethanol content.</p>

          <p>With gold prices remaining near record highs, financial experts are advising investors on the best strategies for September amid economic uncertainty. For those prioritizing stability and long-term wealth preservation, physical gold like coins and bullion is recommended, though it requires secure storage. Investors seeking liquidity and diversification may prefer gold ETFs, which are easily traded but incur management fees. For higher growth potential and risk, gold mining stocks are an option, but require thorough research into company-specific operational factors beyond the price of gold itself.

          <p>A study by a top Chinese investment bank, CICC, estimates that Chinese exporters are shouldering only about 9% of the cost burden from U.S. tariffs, suggesting they hold significant bargaining power. The research indicates that U.S. importers are absorbing the majority of the costs by compressing their profit margins, as they are unable to fully pass the price increases to consumers or shift them back to the manufacturers. According to the analysis, the average price of Chinese goods imported into the U.S. dropped only slightly despite a substantial tariff increase.</p>

While finding the situation of soldiers picking up trash preferable to more aggressive operations, the writer humorously suggests that if taxpayers are funding this deployment, the troops could also help with personal chores.</p>
