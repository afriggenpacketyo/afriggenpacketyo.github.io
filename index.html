          <p>This article analyzes the immediate political fallout from Charlie Kirk's assassination, focusing on the rapid attribution of blame to left-wing extremism by conservative figures and President Trump. It argues that this narrative is factually incomplete, pointing to data from the Center for Strategic and International Studies which indicates that far-right extremists have perpetrated the majority of recent domestic terror attacks. The piece critiques the rhetoric as a politically motivated effort to shape a narrative of fear while ignoring broader trends in political violence across the ideological spectrum.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United's new striker, Yoane Wissa, has achieved a career milestone by joining the Premier League club, demonstrating remarkable resilience after a traumatic event. In 2021, just before a planned move to Brentford, he was the victim of an acid attack at his home that could have ended his career and cost him his sight. Despite the physical and mental trauma, his determination to succeed never wavered, a trait noted by his former manager. His recent £55 million transfer is seen as a testament to his perseverance and unwavering focus on his professional goals.</p>

          <p>In the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's fatal shooting, security measures have been significantly increased for prominent political figures, including President Donald Trump. Officials moved the location of a presidential speech as a precaution, and several politicians, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have canceled public events due to safety concerns. The ongoing manhunt for the shooter has created a climate of unease, prompting some officials to state they will begin carrying firearms for personal protection. The incident has intensified national concerns over the potential for political violence.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has found former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty of orchestrating a plot for a military coup to remain in power after his 2022 election loss. The justices ruled that his conspiracy culminated in the January 8, 2023 storming of government buildings by his supporters, and he now faces a potential prison sentence of over 40 years. Bolsonaro, who has maintained his innocence and called the trial a politically motivated "witch hunt," was convicted on five charges, including leading an armed criminal organization. The verdict is a landmark moment for Brazilian democracy.</p>

          <p>This article provides a profile of Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old conservative activist who was assassinated, detailing his significant influence on the modern Republican party. It traces his journey from a suburban Chicago high school student concerned with textbook bias to the founder of Turning Point USA, a powerful youth organization. Kirk initially focused on economic issues but later became a prominent voice in culture wars, championing conservative social stances and effectively branding the MAGA movement for younger audiences. His charismatic, media-savvy approach earned him a loyal following and a powerful, albeit informal, role as a political strategist.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have initiated a procedural change, often called the "nuclear option," to make it easier to confirm President Trump's sub-cabinet level nominees. The move is designed to overcome what they describe as an unprecedented blockade by Democrats, who have slowed the confirmation process to a crawl in protest of the administration's policies. While Majority Leader John Thune argued the change is necessary to allow the president to assemble his team, Democrats warned that altering Senate rules would be a decision Republicans will come to regret. A last-minute effort to reach a bipartisan compromise failed before the vote.</p>

This article explains that in the current elevated interest rate environment, savers have better options for their money.

          <p>Average U.S. mortgage rates have dropped to 6.35% for a 30-year term, their lowest point in almost a year, potentially signaling a new opportunity for prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing. The decline is attributed to a cooling 10-year Treasury yield and widespread market expectation that the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate at its upcoming meeting. While rates could fall further, the article notes the market's volatility and suggests that now may be an opportune time for consumers to explore their options rather than waiting for an ideal but uncertain lower rate.

          <p>Nadine Menendez, the wife of former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, has been sentenced to 54 months in federal prison for her conviction in a widespread bribery case. She was found guilty of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, gold bars, a luxury car, and other benefits in exchange for her husband's political influence. While her defense requested a lighter sentence due to her ongoing cancer treatment, the judge described her as a "central participant" in the corruption scheme. Her husband is currently serving an 11-year sentence for his role in the same conspiracy.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has outlined the financial structure of a new tariff and investment deal between the U.S. and Japan. Under the agreement, Japan will invest $550 billion in American-based projects, and the two countries will split the resulting profits 50/50 until Japan's initial investment is fully recouped. After that point, the profit-sharing arrangement will shift dramatically, with the U.S. receiving 90% and Japan receiving 10%. The deal is intended to boost U.S. domestic manufacturing in critical sectors while providing Japanese consumers with lower tariff rates.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock price fell by 6% on Thursday, a day after a record-setting 36% rally, as investor enthusiasm was tempered by new analysis. The initial surge was fueled by the company's announcement of massive new contracts and a forecast for fourteen-fold growth in cloud infrastructure. However, a subsequent report revealed that a single client, OpenAI, accounts for a $300 billion portion of this future revenue. This heavy dependence on one customer raised concerns among analysts about the sustainability of Oracle's projected growth, leading to the sharp stock pullback. (not investment advice)</p>
