          <p>The U.S. National Guard has been deployed to Washington D.C. following President Trump's directive to address what he terms "out of control" violent crime. Armored vehicles and approximately 800 troops are expected, along with 500 federal agents, now that the president has assumed control of the city's police force. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has strongly opposed the move, labeling it an "authoritarian push" and denying the administration's claims about the city's crime rate. The White House has indicated this is just the beginning of a month-long operation to arrest violent criminals.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate hundreds of scientific research grants to UCLA that were abruptly suspended. The ruling states the government's action, which froze over a third of a $584 million fund, violated a previous court order preventing such terminations. The administration had cited alleged antisemitism and discrimination at the university as justification for the freeze. This decision specifically applies to National Science Foundation grants, while funds from the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy remain suspended.</p>

          <p>Contrary to the Trump administration's claims of targeting the "worst of the worst" criminals, a new immigration detention center in Florida, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," is holding individuals with no criminal history, including DACA recipients. One such detainee, a father of three U.S. citizens brought to the country as a child, was arrested after a traffic stop. Federal data shows nearly half of all migrants detained by ICE in June lacked a criminal record, challenging the administration's narrative. An ICE official stated that being undocumented is a crime, although it is legally a civil violation.</p>

          <p>An annual global human rights report from the Trump administration asserts that the human rights situation in the United Kingdom has deteriorated over the past year. The document specifically cites concerns over restrictions on freedom of expression, particularly political speech deemed "hateful," and threats of violence motivated by antisemitism. It points to the government's response to the Southport attacks and the implementation of buffer zones around abortion clinics as examples of chilling free speech. The UK government responded by stating it proudly upholds freedoms while ensuring citizen safety.</p>

          <p>Rapper and YouTube personality DDG was briefly detained at gunpoint by Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies in what appears to have been a "swatting" incident. The artist stated he was at a paintball event when police surrounded him, acting on a false report that he was armed and planning to harm himself and others. DDG described the experience as terrifying, saying he was held for about 20 minutes before being released. Swatting involves making a fake emergency call to provoke a large, aggressive law enforcement response to a specific location.</p>

          <p>Kim Keon Hee, the wife of South Korea's impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol, has been arrested, a first for a former first lady in the country's history. She faces serious allegations including stock fraud, bribery, and influence peddling, which she denies.

          <p>A recent collision between Chinese and Philippine ships is anticipated to escalate tensions in the contested South China Sea. While China has not officially confirmed the collision, a coastguard spokesperson acknowledged taking "necessary measures" to expel a Philippine vessel from the area. Experts warn the incident could prompt China to increase its maritime presence and enhance coordination between its navy and coastguard to assert its territorial claims more forcefully. The event underscores the volatile nature of the region's maritime disputes and the potential for further confrontations.</p>

          <p>While overall cancer survival has doubled in the last 50 years, a new study reveals that progress has been starkly uneven across different types of the disease. Cancers like melanoma now have 10-year survival rates above 90%, thanks to advances in early detection and treatment. However, cancers of the pancreas, esophagus, stomach, and lungs have seen little improvement and retain very low survival rates. Researchers and health charities are calling for a renewed focus on these deadlier cancers, urging investment in research and early detection to close the widening survival gap.</p>

Macron accepted France's responsibility for the events, which continued even after Cameroon's independence in 1960 and resulted in tens of thousands of deaths. The move is part of a broader, though contested, effort by Macron to confront France's colonial past in Africa.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles police have arrested four teenagers believed to be part of a gang responsible for a string of burglaries targeting high-profile celebrities, including actor Brad Pitt. The investigation began after Pitt's Los Feliz home was ransacked in late June by thieves who shattered a window to gain entry. Authorities state the suspects, aged 16 to 18, also targeted other actors and professional athletes. Police noted that criminals are becoming more sophisticated, sometimes using surveillance and Wi-Fi jammers to monitor their targets before striking.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the European Union have publicly appealed to President Trump to defend Europe's security interests during his upcoming summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. They expressed apprehension that a deal on the Ukraine war could be struck without their involvement, potentially at their expense. In a statement, the leaders emphasized that any path to peace must respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The plea highlights European anxiety over being sidelined in critical negotiations and concern that Trump might agree to concessions favorable to Russia.</p>

          <p>Health experts are warning of an increased risk from Vibrio vulnificus, a "flesh-eating" bacteria, as rising ocean temperatures allow it to thrive in new regions. The bacteria, which can be fatal in one in five cases, enters the body through open wounds and is most common in warm coastal waters. Cases are now being reported further north in the Carolinas, Connecticut, and New York. Microbiologists say that warming waters due to climate change are expanding the bacteria's habitat, heightening the danger, particularly during hurricane season when flooding can increase exposure.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, who is serving four life sentences for the murder of four University of Idaho students, is reportedly being subjected to relentless taunting from other inmates at the Idaho Maximum Security Institution. Despite being held in solitary confinement, prisoners are said to be yelling at him through the ventilation system at all hours. According to a retired homicide detective with prison contacts, the constant harassment is "driving him crazy" and causing him to lose sleep. Prison officials are reportedly unlikely to intervene as the taunts do not pose a direct physical threat to Kohberger.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks rallied on Tuesday, with major indexes approaching record highs, after a new report showed inflation was slightly lower than economists had anticipated. The consumer price index for July held steady at a 2.7% annual rate, below the 2.8% forecast. This positive data increased traders' bets that the Federal Reserve will have the justification it needs to cut interest rates at its September meeting. Lower interest rates would reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, potentially providing a significant boost to the economy and investment prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Peach farmers in California's Central Valley are facing a 30% reduction in their harvest this year, a direct consequence of an unusually warm winter. Stone fruit trees, including peaches, require a certain number of chilling hours below 45 degrees to properly regulate their growth and nutrient cycles for the following season. The lack of consistent cold weather, an effect of climate change, disrupted this crucial dormancy period, leading to a smaller crop. The shortage is beginning to impact consumers, who are now paying higher prices for the popular summer fruit.</p>

This is the second major transfer of its kind this year, occurring as the White House pressures Mexico to intensify its crackdown on drug trafficking. Among those transferred are suspected members of the notorious Jalisco New Generation (CJNG) and Sinaloa cartels. The move demonstrates continued, albeit tense, collaboration between the two countries on security issues, particularly the flow of fentanyl across the border.</p>
