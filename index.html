          <p>The East Block of Parliament Hill in Ottawa was placed on lockdown after a man barricaded himself inside the building, prompting a large police presence and evacuation. According to the Parliamentary Protective Service, an emergency alert was issued urging people to seek shelter and avoid the area. While there were no reported injuries, a bomb squad was potentially involved, and a section of Wellington Street was closed. Because of the upcoming federal election in Canada, Parliament is currently dissolved, and there’s little activity in the area.</p>

          <p>As President Trump's tariffs come into effect, U.S. consumers are reportedly engaging in a shopping spree to purchase goods before prices increase. Economists anticipate that tariffs will raise prices for everyday items and potentially trigger a recession. While stocking up on some items might seem prudent, experts caution consumers against going into debt to beat the "tariff effect." They advise taking a long-term view and prioritizing financial stability, especially considering the high levels of household debt.</p>

          <p>Economists are expressing concern over the formula underpinning President Trump's "reciprocal" tariff plan, citing flawed assumptions. They argue that the formula's elasticity rate is lower than it should be in practice, leading to inflated tariff rates. A report from the Cato Institute also found that the trade-weighted average tariff rates used to justify the tariffs are higher than they are in reality.</p>
