          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-07 00:19:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent 7.7 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar has deepened the country's existing political turmoil, as the ruling military junta attempts to leverage the disaster to consolidate control. The earthquake, which has resulted in thousands of deaths and significant economic losses, prompted the junta to declare a state of emergency and request international aid, a stark contrast to their response to the 2008 Cyclone Nargis. While some hoped the disaster might lead to peace talks between the junta and resistance forces, analysts believe a lasting ceasefire is unlikely due to deeply entrenched battle lines and a lack of common ground.</p>

          <p>A severe weather system has caused widespread destruction across the Midwest and South, resulting in at least 20 fatalities and numerous injuries. Tornadoes and flash floods have prompted emergency declarations and evacuations in multiple states, including Tennessee, Kentucky, and Arkansas. The extreme flooding has also disrupted interstate commerce, potentially leading to shipping and supply chain delays, especially around major cargo hubs like Louisville and Memphis. The article also notes that the increased weather events are happening when NWS forecast offices are experiencing 20% vacancy rates after Trump administration job cuts.</p>

          <p>Abigail Disney, film-maker and heiress to the Disney fortune, expresses deep concern over the current political climate and criticizes the unchecked accumulation of wealth. She argues that billionaires who cannot live on $999 million are "sociopaths" and highlights the moral failings of figures like Trump and Musk, particularly their disregard for the suffering caused by cuts to vital aid programs. Disney advocates for increased taxes on the wealthy and grassroots activism to counter the influence of wealth and privilege in American society. She also suggests that Trump's economic policies, including tariffs, will ultimately harm low-income consumers and lead to economic instability.</p>

          <p>Al Barile, the guitarist for the pioneering Boston hardcore band SS Decontrol (SSD), has died at the age of 63 after battling colon cancer. SSD was a key figure in the straight-edge scene of the early 1980s, known for their short, fast, and aggressive songs railing against government and societal hypocrisy. Barile formed SSD as a reaction against what he saw as insincere mainstream music, drawing inspiration from bands like the Ramones and Minor Threat. The band's debut album, "The Kids Will Have Their Say," is considered a landmark in hardcore punk.</p>

          <p>President Trump is standing firm on his decision to impose sweeping tariffs on imports, despite the resulting shockwaves through global stock markets. He defended the tariffs as necessary "medicine" to fix the economy, predicting a return of jobs and investment to the US. Top officials echoed this sentiment, downplaying fears of a recession and asserting that the tariffs would be implemented as planned. However, the announcement has triggered significant market declines in Asia, with analysts predicting continued volatility and potential for a global recession.</p>

          <p>The venture capital industry is experiencing significant turnover at the senior level, with many top executives leaving established firms. This trend is attributed to factors such as slow decision-making in large firms, a focus on asset management rather than founder support, and the rise of smaller, specialized venture capital firms. Some investors are seeking greater control over their decisions and a return to the basics of venture capital, while others may be facing pressure due to recent downturns in the industry. The shift is also facilitated by the increasing ease with which individuals can start their own venture capital funds.</p>

The judge ordered the government to bring Abrego Garcia back to the United States, but the Justice Department has appealed the ruling.

          <p>The Indian rupee is predicted to decline at the market's open due to the widespread selloff in Asian equities, fueled by concerns that US tariffs could trigger a global economic slowdown. Risk aversion is expected to drive the dollar/rupee exchange rate higher, with investors seeking safe-haven assets. The market's reaction reflects anxieties that Trump's tariffs will contribute to inflation and hinder global economic growth. The article points to a broad exit from risk assets and a flight to safe havens like US Treasury bonds and the Japanese yen.</p>

          <p>Global financial markets are experiencing significant volatility, with Asian stock markets plunging and U.S. stock futures coming under renewed selling pressure. These market movements follow President Trump's announcement of tariffs on imports, which has sparked fears of a global trade war. China has retaliated with tariffs on U.S. products, further escalating tensions. Economists warn that these tariffs could lead to inflation, reduced consumer spending, and slower economic growth, though some analysts anticipate that the Trump administration may eventually ease tariffs in exchange for trade concessions.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs and the subsequent responses from other nations have created significant uncertainty for investors.

Experts are debating the potential consequences of the trade war, including rising consumer prices and an increased risk of recession. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has dismissed recession fears, while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has affirmed that the tariffs will remain in place.</p>

This year's race marks a gradual reopening of North Korea, which has been slow to ease its border restrictions since the pandemic began.

          <p>A US judge has strongly criticized the Trump administration for mistakenly deporting a man to a prison in El Salvador. Judge Paula Xinis reaffirmed her ruling demanding the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the US, stating that he was seized without lawful authority and held without legal basis. The judge described the situation as a "grievous error" that "shocks the conscience." Trump officials claim they lack the authority to remove him from jail in El Salvador, while the Justice Department has requested an appeals court to dismiss Judge Xinis' order.</p>

          <p>Democrats are criticizing President Trump for spending the weekend golfing while markets are plummeting due to his tariff policies. They argue that Trump is out of touch with the concerns of Americans who are seeing their retirement savings diminish. Senator Adam Schiff stated that the image of Trump on a golf cart while people's retirement accounts are in flames may be the most enduring image of his presidency. Other Democratic lawmakers are calling for a reversal of Trump's tariffs and an end to what they are calling the "dumbest trade war in history."</p>

          <p>U.S. crude oil prices have fallen below $60 a barrel, reaching their lowest level since 2021, due to growing fears that President Trump's global tariffs could trigger a recession. The decline in oil prices reflects concerns that tariffs could lead to higher prices for businesses, which in turn could slow down economic activity and reduce demand for oil. The recent price drop follows back-to-back 6% declines last week, indicating a significant shift in market sentiment. (not investment advice)
