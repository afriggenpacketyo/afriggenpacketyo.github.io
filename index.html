          <p>A 21-year-old Ukrainian national, Roman Lavrynovch, has been charged with three counts of arson with intent to endanger life after fires at two properties and a car linked to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The Metropolitan Police arrested Lavrynovch in Sydenham, south-east London, in connection with incidents over a four-day period, including a vehicle fire in Kentish Town, a fire at Starmer's private home, and a fire at an address where he previously lived. Lavrynovch is scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court, and the charges highlight the potential dangers faced by public figures and their families. The swift action by law enforcement demonstrates a commitment to protecting individuals from targeted attacks.</p>

          <p>The FBI has issued a warning about "malicious actors" using AI-generated voice messages to impersonate senior U.S. officials, targeting current and former government figures and their contacts.

They send malicious links that claim to move conversations to a separate messaging platform, enabling them to steal information and target other officials or associates.

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told lawmakers that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been resorting to buying replacement parts on eBay and using 3D printers to create new parts for its aging systems. Duffy explained that the FAA's equipment is decades old, necessitating these unconventional measures to maintain operations. The Trump administration is pushing for a major overhaul of the air traffic control system, including replacing radars, control towers, and telecommunications systems, at a potentially high cost.

DeSantis argued that individuals should have the choice to avoid overexposure to fluoride, despite concerns from dentists and public health advocates about potential negative impacts on dental health. Some local governments in Florida, like Miami-Dade County, had already moved to remove fluoride from their water ahead of the statewide ban. The move follows a push by figures like Robert F.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher due to changes in the economy and policy. Speaking at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference, Powell noted that conditions have significantly changed over the past five years, including a period of surging inflation. He suggested that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon, and that more frequent supply shocks could pose a difficult challenge for the economy and central banks. Powell's remarks highlight the balancing act the Fed faces in supporting employment while controlling inflation, especially amidst potential impacts from tariffs and other policy changes.</p>

          <p>Settling credit card debt can provide relief, but it complicates future credit access, as lenders view it as a sign of repayment inability. Cards included in settlement agreements are usually closed, and other accounts may face reduced limits or denial of transactions. Debt settlement remains on credit reports for seven years, impacting credit scores. Rebuilding credit involves monitoring reports, starting with secured credit cards, and responsible use, like timely payments and low balances. Waiting six months after settlement before applying for new cards can help stabilize credit profiles, showcasing patience and responsible financial behavior.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding President Donald Trump's executive order to limit U.S. citizenship to children born on American soil to lawful permanent residents. The justices focused on the legality of nationwide injunctions blocking the order, with concerns raised about the power of individual district judges to halt presidential policies. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson questioned whether limiting nationwide injunctions would create a "Catch Me If You Can" system of justice, while other justices explored the potential for delays in resolving legal issues.

The Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) found that the costs of essentials like technology, education, and healthcare have made a basic quality of life out of reach for many. The analysis also revealed that the official unemployment rate understates economic distress, with the "functionally unemployed" rate topping 24%. The findings underscore the need for policies that support upward mobility for low- and middle-income Americans.</p>
