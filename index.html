          <p>Japan continues to rank poorly in gender equality, holding 118th place out of 148 countries in the 2025 gender gap report, according to the World Economic Forum. Despite some improvements in women's economic participation, Japan lags significantly in political empowerment, reflected by the low number of female government ministers and the absence of a female prime minister. The report estimates that achieving full gender parity globally will take 123 years, with Japan showing slow progress compared to other advanced economies. While there has been increased presence of women in the workforce, the country remains poorly ranked in female participation in management positions.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles District Attorney announced criminal charges against multiple individuals involved in recent immigration protests. The charges range from assault on peace officers to commercial burglary and vandalism, with potential prison sentences varying based on the severity of the alleged crimes. The DA emphasized that while peaceful protests are respected, violent acts such as hurling dangerous objects at police officers will not be tolerated. These charges highlight the legal consequences for those who engage in criminal behavior during protests, while the DA also acknowledged the thousands who participated in legitimate, peaceful demonstrations.</p>

          <p>Israeli lawmakers rejected a preliminary vote to dissolve the parliament, known as the Knesset, according to a statement released by the Knesset. The opposition-submitted bill failed to pass, with a vote of 61-53, falling short of the required majority in the 120-seat parliament. Had the vote succeeded, it could have initiated a snap election, potentially leading to a change in government.

The government aims to transform the public realm and boost economic potential through these long-term investments.

This discovery provides insights into how tyrannosaurs evolved from small, fleet-footed predators to formidable giants. The new species exhibits early evolutionary stages of key features, such as skull anatomy, that contributed to the tyrannosaurs' powerful bite force.</p>
