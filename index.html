          <p>Kim Kardashian attended the fifth annual Academy Museum Gala in a nude-colored Maison Margiela gown paired with a matching mask that completely obscured her face. The bold fashion choice generated significant online discussion, with some users calling it "strange" and "unnecessary," while others praised the look as obsessive and artistic. Kardashian appeared to humorously acknowledge the look in a social media video with her makeup artist, continuing her history of making provocative and conversation-starting fashion statements at high-profile events.</p>

          <p>A fragile ceasefire in Gaza was tested as Israel launched air and artillery strikes, alleging that Hamas had violated the agreement by firing on its soldiers. In response, Israel halted the transfer of aid into the territory "until further notice" and struck dozens of what it called Hamas targets, resulting in at least 38 reported deaths in Gaza. Hamas denied involvement in the initial clashes and reaffirmed its commitment to the ceasefire, which had previously seen the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners. The U.S. State Department also issued a warning about potential Hamas attacks on Palestinian civilians.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police are investigating a report that Prince Andrew asked his police bodyguard to find damaging information on Virginia Giuffre in 2011. The request allegedly occurred just before a newspaper published a photo of the prince with Giuffre, who accused him of sexual assault when she was 17. This development follows Buckingham Palace's announcement that Andrew would relinquish his royal titles amid ongoing scrutiny of his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Giuffre's family stated the decision was a "vindication for our sister and survivors everywhere."</p>

While declining to speculate on the November Budget, he acknowledged the affordability crisis and stated that officials are "looking at all of these issues." The government is under pressure to reduce energy costs, with Labour having previously pledged to lower average bills.

          <p>A leaked Telegram chat containing racist, homophobic, and antisemitic messages has intensified infighting within the Young Republicans organization. The messages, which included a member writing "I love Hitler" and another calling for the sexual assault of the group's national chairman, have fractured the organization along lines drawn during a recent contentious leadership election. While some state chapters quickly condemned the rhetoric, others that had supported the members involved in the chat remained silent or questioned the messages' context. The scandal reveals deep-seated animosity and ideological fissures within the youth wing of the Republican party.</p>

          <p>Over 91,000 pounds of frozen breakfast burritos and wraps distributed to U.S. schools through federal meal programs have been recalled due to potential listeria contamination. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service issued the alert for products made by M.C.I. Foods between September and October. The contamination was discovered during routine testing of egg ingredients from an external supplier. While no illnesses have been reported, institutions are urged to discard the products, which are served to millions of children in low-income areas.</p>

          <p>The recent jewel heist at the Louvre Museum was a highly professional and swift operation, lasting only a few minutes, according to French authorities. Thieves used a mechanical ladder to access a first-floor gallery shortly after the museum opened, then used power tools to smash display cases and steal priceless items from France's crown jewel collection. The masked robbers escaped on scooters, and investigators are now reviewing CCTV footage. One item, possibly the crown of Empress Eugénie, was reportedly found dropped near the museum, highlighting the chaotic nature of the getaway.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protestors, including naturalist Chris Packham and singer Feargal Sharkey, gathered at the London Aquarium to demand the release of 15 gentoo penguins. Organized by Freedom For Animals, the demonstration argued that the penguins are "trapped in a basement without sunlight or fresh air" and that their captivity is unjustified as they are not an endangered species. The aquarium, owned by Merlin Entertainments, defended the habitat, stating it was designed with veterinary specialists and allows the penguins to exhibit normal behaviors. Campaigners called the enclosure a "blight on the reputation of London's attractions."</p>

          <p>J.D. Power has released its 2025 North American Airport Satisfaction Study, ranking "mega airports" based on factors like ease of travel, terminal facilities, and staff performance. The top three airports remained unchanged from the previous year, excelling in fundamental services such as cleanliness and TSA efficiency, as well as food and retail offerings. An expert noted that while the ongoing government shutdown is affecting air travel, it has not yet had a "huge impact" on the satisfaction rankings. The study provides a benchmark for passenger experience at the continent's busiest airports. (not investment advice)</p>

Authorities have arrested at least nine individuals in connection with the shooting, with several facing capital murder charges.

          <p>Pakistan and the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire following more than a week of intense and deadly fighting along their shared border. The agreement, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, aims to establish mechanisms for lasting peace after clashes that saw both sides claim to have inflicted heavy casualties. The conflict had escalated after the Taliban accused Pakistan of carrying out attacks in Kabul. Under the new agreement, the Taliban has committed not to support groups that attack Pakistan, a key point of contention for Islamabad.</p>
