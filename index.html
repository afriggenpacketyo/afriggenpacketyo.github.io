            <p>President Trump announced the U.S. would begin direct talks with Iran, starting Saturday, during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, while also imposing tariffs on Israel. Iranian Foreign Minister Araghchi confirmed the talks, but referred to them as "indirect high-level talks" in Oman, emphasizing it as a test for America. The announcement occurred amidst market volatility, with the Nasdaq, S&P 500, and Dow Jones experiencing significant fluctuations after consecutive losses. Trump dismissed concerns about the tariffs impacting the markets, stating negotiations with other countries are underway. Optimism Score: 40</p>

            <p>Economists warn that China may have "nothing to lose" in the escalating trade war with the U.S., especially after President Trump threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports. Experts suggest that China will retaliate, as the marginal economic impact of Trump's threats on China is declining as the effective tariff level quickly builds up. The profit margin for China's export sector is around 30 to 40 per cent. If the US imposes tariffs exceeding 35 per cent, it would wipe out most of their profits. Optimism Score: 30</p>

            <p>President Trump threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports if China retaliates against the U.S.'s 34% import fee, escalating the trade war between the two nations. China's commerce ministry vowed to "fight to the end" if Trump doesn't back down, raising concerns about the potential economic impact on consumers and global markets. Economists warn that the conflict could slam economic growth and potentially trigger a recession, while the White House insists on structural changes to trade agreements. The US imported about $439 billion worth of goods from China last year. Optimism Score: 25</p>

            <p>Iran announced it would hold indirect talks with the U.S. in Oman, opening a potential path to diplomacy over Iran's nuclear program, though differing on the format, after President Trump said the U.S. would have direct talks with Iran. Iran's foreign minister stated that the dialogue would be "as much an opportunity as it is a test" and that the ball is in America's court. During Trump's first term, he withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran negotiated by former President Barack Obama and signed by several world powers. Optimism Score: 50</p>

            <p>Formula 1 drivers continue to praise the Suzuka circuit as one of their favorites, despite the difficulty of overtaking and the potential for uneventful races. Fernando Alonso noted the resurfacing of the track changed the race from a two-stop strategy to a one, adding in the difficulty of overtaking to an event where there were no significant tyre-pace offsets developing, and the race was always likely to be processional. Max Verstappen described the race as fun, highlighting the challenge of pushing to the limit around the demanding circuit. The drivers enjoy the challenge of driving flat out for an hour and a half around the greatest circuit on the planet. Optimism Score: 80</p>

            <p>More and more journalists are leaving traditional media outlets for independent platforms like Substack, signaling a shift in the media landscape. Substack's co-founder argues this represents a significant media disruption, allowing writers and podcasters to connect directly with their audience. Former Fox News and NBC personalities have embraced this model, finding success with niche sites and subscription-based content. This trend reflects a desire for independence and a direct connection with audiences, bypassing corporate constraints. Optimism Score: 70</p>

Residents have criticized the government's response, while officials report that most fatalities were caused by collapsing walls. The government has set up emergency shelters, but access to drinking water remains limited in several areas. Optimism Score: 10</p>

            <p>Former Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean argues that the central bank should cut interest rates to at least 4% in May to combat the financial turmoil caused by Trump's trade tariffs. He believes an aggressive strategy is needed to counter the negative effects on business and consumer confidence. Bean emphasizes the uncertainty created by the tariffs, which could delay investments and reduce consumer spending. Financial markets have already priced in a rate cut, but Bean suggests a larger reduction is necessary to prevent a financial accident. (not investment advice)</p>
