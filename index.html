          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest amid an ongoing trial where he is accused of plotting a coup. The decision follows allegations that Bolsonaro violated previous restraining orders by using allies' social media to encourage attacks on the judiciary and foreign intervention. This legal development occurs as pro-Bolsonaro rallies take place in Brazil and has been cited by U.S. President Trump as a reason for imposing new tariffs on some Brazilian goods. The order also prohibits Bolsonaro from receiving most visitors and using a mobile phone.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered the remains of an auroch, an extinct breed of Bronze Age cattle, within a cave system in the Yorkshire Dales. The find was part of a larger archaeological project surveying caverns near Ingleborough, which also uncovered evidence of Neolithic human burials. This discovery helps illuminate the prehistoric farming and living practices of people in the region. The project, funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, underscores the vital role of recreational cavers in uncovering subterranean history, as many sites require specialized skills to access and document.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) concludes that Taiwan's energy supplies would be exhausted rapidly in the event of a military blockade by China. Based on 26 war-gaming scenarios, the analysis found that Taiwan's coal supplies would last only seven weeks, with oil reserves depleted in 20 weeks. The report suggests a blockade would not be a low-risk option for Beijing, as it would likely incur high casualties and could easily escalate into a wider conflict involving the United States. Such aggressive action would also alert other nations and deplete Chinese assets needed for a potential invasion.</p>

          <p>A large-scale manhunt is ongoing for a military veteran suspected of fatally shooting four people at a bar in Anaconda, Montana. Authorities have identified the suspect as Michael Paul Brown, 45, who they believe is armed, dangerous, and may have stolen a vehicle containing camping gear. The victims, all local residents, were reportedly known to the suspect, who was a regular at the bar. While investigators search the rugged terrain, the small, tight-knit community is mourning the loss of the four individuals killed in what the attorney general described as a cold-blooded murder.</p>

          <p>Over £100 million in Premium Bond prizes, including eleven awards of £100,000, remain unclaimed in the United Kingdom. Critics argue that the operator, the government-owned National Savings and Investments (NS&I), is not doing enough to locate the winners, especially those with older, paper-based bonds. The NS&I states it has successfully paid over 99% of prize winners since the draws began in 1957 and provides tracing services for mislaid accounts. However, consumer advocates and solicitors are calling for reforms to make the process less bureaucratic, particularly for those tracing bonds inherited or gifted years ago.</p>

House Republicans passed a motion to compel the members' return, authorizing warrants for their civil arrest, though Texas law enforcement lacks jurisdiction outside the state. The Democratic lawmakers maintain their actions are a constitutionally protected tool to protest what they call an authoritarian power grab designed to silence voters.</p>

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who also serves as interim NASA administrator, is set to announce an accelerated plan to develop a nuclear reactor on the moon. This directive establishes a more definitive timeline for fission surface power, which is considered essential for future lunar and Martian exploration and a potential lunar economy. The move is seen as a response to a joint Russo-Chinese plan to build a similar reactor by the mid-2030s, which could create a "keep-out zone" and hinder U.S. presence. The initiative also signals NASA's continued involvement in nuclear development despite the recent cancellation of a joint Pentagon program for nuclear-powered rockets.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that a makeshift migrant detention center in South Florida, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," will serve as a model for a new federal strategy. The plan involves establishing similar state-run facilities near airports in states like Arizona, Nebraska, and Louisiana to detain and deport unauthorized migrants more efficiently. Noem claims this model is more cost-effective and facilitates quicker turnarounds than the current system, which relies on private prison contracts. However, the initiative faces legal challenges over state authority in federal immigration matters and criticism regarding inhumane conditions and lack of due process for detainees.</p>

In communities like DeWitt, Iowa, where Ukrainians have filled critical workforce shortages, employers and local advocates are appealing for a change in policy.

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society reveals a significant increase in early-stage colon cancer diagnoses among people aged 45 to 49, directly linked to a rise in screenings for this age group. Following recommendations to lower the screening age to 45, screening rates for this demographic jumped 62% between 2019 and 2023. This uptick in testing is credited with catching the disease earlier, which is considered promising news by health experts. However, researchers caution that screening rates among younger adults remain suboptimal and inequitable, highlighting the need for continued public health efforts to expand access.</p>

          <p>President Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, after the agency issued a large downward revision to May and June's job growth numbers. The president baselessly accused the commissioner of political bias and manipulating the data, which was revised down by 258,000 jobs. Former officials and experts defend the BLS process, explaining that such revisions are a normal feature of data collection as more complete survey responses become available over time. While acknowledging the revision was large, they assert it reflects the standard, apolitical process of refining preliminary estimates and not a failure or manipulation by the agency.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The policy had effectively closed the asylum system to those entering the country illegally, a measure the administration credited for a sharp drop in border apprehensions. The court ruled that while the government could pause access to the asylum system, it could not ignore other laws protecting migrants from being returned to places where they face persecution or torture. This directive effectively reopens pathways for migrants to request humanitarian refuge, though they will likely remain detained during processing.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Finds Trump's Government Efficiency Agency Overstates Cost Savings</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News review indicates that the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) continues to significantly overstate its cost-cutting achievements. An analysis of three of the largest claimed cuts, related to canceled COVID-19 testing contracts, found the actual savings were approximately $165 million, less than 3% of the $6.4 billion DOGE reported. Experts note the agency often claims savings based on the total potential value of contracts, a ceiling that is rarely reached, rather than the actual unspent funds. This practice of "transparency theater" has led to claims of $199 billion in total savings, a figure analysts believe is highly inflated.</p>

          <p>The owners of the Dali, the cargo ship that crashed into Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge, are suing the vessel's builder, Hyundai Heavy Industries. The lawsuit alleges that a defectively designed switchboard on the ship was unreasonably dangerous and led to a power outage that caused the catastrophic collision. The complaint contends that insecure wiring connections came loose during normal operation, resulting in the loss of power and steering. This legal action follows a Justice Department lawsuit seeking to recover over $100 million in cleanup costs, which alleged the ship's owners recklessly ignored known electrical problems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article in The Atlantic argues that a series of recent events represents a significant assault on truth by the Trump administration. These include the removal of Trump's two impeachments from a Smithsonian exhibit, the defunding and shutdown of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner over revised economic data. The article also points to the confirmation of Jeanine Pirro, a proponent of false 2020 election claims, as a top prosecutor. The author suggests these actions collectively undermine factual reporting, statistical integrity, and the historical record to serve a political agenda.</p>

          <p>California is on track for one of its worst wildfire seasons in recent memory, with nearly 100,000 more acres burned so far this year compared to the five-year average. The increased activity is largely driven by major fires in Central and Southern California, where dry vegetation and heat waves have created critical fire conditions. The state's largest active blaze, the Gifford fire, has scorched over 65,000 acres and is exhibiting erratic, plume-dominated behavior. With a widespread heat wave forecast for the southern half of the state, officials warn of an elevated risk for more fires and unpredictable growth.</p>

          <p>A review of the Hollywood Bowl's production of "Jesus Christ Superstar" hails Cynthia Erivo's performance in the title role as magnetic and divine. The production, directed by Sergio Trujillo, embraced the show's rock opera roots, creating a concert-like atmosphere that emphasized the emotional intensity of the performances. Erivo's portrayal was praised for its modern yet timeless quality, while Adam Lambert as Judas and Phillipa Soo as Mary Magdalene also delivered powerful, musically rich performances. The reviewer called Erivo's turn as Jesus a transcendent and unforgettable experience that established the savior as a queer Black woman.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has stated that Democrats will move forward with a plan to redraw the state's congressional maps if Texas Republicans succeed in their own redistricting push. The proposed California measure would be a "trigger" plan, only appearing on the November ballot if Texas approves its new map adding five Republican seats. This sets up a high-stakes political battle that could influence control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterms. California Democrats, who hold a supermajority, would have a tight deadline to draw a new map and pass legislation for a special election before their recess ends.</p>

          <p>The global competition for rare earth elements, critical for everything from electronics to military technology, has placed developing nations at the center of a strategic battle between the U.S. and China. China currently dominates the supply chain, controlling over 60% of mining and 85% of processing, creating a significant vulnerability for Western nations. As the U.S. and its allies scramble to diversify their sources, countries with rare earth reserves are becoming the new geopolitical front line.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has filed paperwork to block the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from providing abortions, rolling back a Biden-era policy. The proposed rule would end access to abortions at VA hospitals for veterans in cases of sexual assault or incest, or when a pregnancy endangers their health. The administration called the previous policy "legally questionable," aligning with long-standing efforts to prevent federal funding for abortion access. Critics argue the move robs veterans of the freedom to control their own bodies and could jeopardize care, as doctors in states with abortion bans already face ambiguity in providing medically necessary procedures.</p>
