            <p>The White House has released the results of President Trump's annual physical, stating that the 78-year-old president "remains in excellent health." According to the report from Capt. Sean P. Barbabella, Trump exhibits "robust cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, and general physical function." A colonoscopy in July 2024 revealed diverticulosis and a benign polyp, with a follow-up recommended in 2027. The report concludes that Trump is fully fit to execute the duties of Commander-in-Chief and Head of State, reassuring the public about his physical and cognitive well-being.</p>

Despite the exemptions, a 20% tariff on all Chinese products remains in effect.</p>

            <p>The Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) antitrust case against Meta, focusing on the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, has commenced. The FTC argues that Meta's acquisitions were part of a strategy to eliminate competition and maintain a monopoly over the social media market. The FTC seeks to force Meta to unwind its purchases of both Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing that this will foster competition and improve services for consumers. Meta counters that it is being unfairly punished for its success and that its acquisitions were approved by regulators over a decade ago.</p>

            <p>Senator Cory Booker (D-N.J.) has voiced strong opposition to President Trump's tariff plans, calling for their "full-throated, unequivocal condemnation." Booker's stance contrasts with some other Democrats who have defended the targeted use of tariffs. This highlights the ongoing debate and divisions within the Democratic party regarding trade policy and the use of tariffs as a tool for economic leverage, especially as it pertains to trade relations with China.</p>

Understanding your attachment style can be key to changing how you manage your finances long-term. (not investment advice)</p>

This requires a different approach to innovation, college admissions, and civic education. Elite institutions should increase their undergraduate student body, establish admissions policies with a merit threshold and a geographic or socioeconomic lottery, and restore merit scholarships. By focusing on pluralism, viewpoint diversity, and a new business model, universities can better serve society and maintain the pillars of a free society.</p>
