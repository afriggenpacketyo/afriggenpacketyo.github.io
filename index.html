        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two blind women traveling from New Orleans to Orlando said they were the only passengers on their Southwest Airlines flight after a nearly five-hour delay. They claim the airline rebooked most other passengers on an earlier flight from a different gate but failed to inform them, a potential violation of the Air Carrier Access Act. Southwest disputed the claim that the women were forgotten, stating the flight they were on was their originally scheduled one, despite the long delay. As compensation for the delay, the airline offered each of the women a $100 travel voucher, but the passengers emphasized the need for improved communication for travelers with disabilities.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering significant changes to driving laws in England and Wales, including mandatory eye tests every three years for drivers over 70. This proposal follows a coroner's report that called the UK's self-reporting system for visual health the "laxest in Europe" after an inquest into deaths caused by drivers with failing eyesight. The new road safety strategy also aims to lower the drink-driving limit to align with Scotland's stricter standard and introduce penalty points for passengers not wearing seatbelts. The government states these measures are necessary to address the high number of road fatalities and injuries.</p>

          <p>This article explores the concept that newly formed black holes emit a form of "music" through gravitational waves. While mature black holes are known for letting nothing escape, the process of their formation—such as from a star's collapse or the merger of two smaller black holes—creates powerful vibrations in spacetime. These distortions quickly settle into a mathematically perfect shape determined by the black hole's mass and spin, a process that radiates energy outward as gravitational waves. Scientists describe these waves as a kind of pure, strange music that, with advancing technology, we will soon be able to experience and study more closely.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has introduced a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan (about $501) annually for each child under the age of three. This initiative builds on similar pilot programs already active in over 20 provinces. According to analysis, the subsidy is expected to have a more significant impact in less affluent regions where the payment represents a larger portion of the average resident's income. For example, the subsidy amounts to over 13.5% of an average income in the poor province of Gansu, compared to just 4.1% in the wealthy city of Shanghai, potentially boosting consumption and birth rates more effectively in rural areas.</p>

          <p>Chip manufacturers Nvidia and AMD have reached an agreement with the U.S. government to pay 15% of their revenue from certain semiconductor sales in China. This arrangement is part of a deal to secure export licenses for advanced chips, such as Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308, which were specifically designed for the Chinese market following earlier U.S. export restrictions. The agreement comes amid easing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing and follows extensive lobbying efforts by Nvidia's CEO. The move is seen as a pragmatic step to allow American companies to compete in the critical Chinese market while adhering to U.S. regulations.</p>

The plan, which involves moving Palestinian civilians to designated safe zones, has drawn international condemnation over fears it will worsen the humanitarian crisis and endanger remaining hostages.

This warming has led to the arrival of species not typically found in UK waters, such as octopus, bluefin tuna, and mauve stinger jellyfish. While the appearance of these new species is remarkable, scientists warn it is a clear indicator of an ecosystem in flux. The rising temperatures are also negatively impacting cold-adapted native species like cod, pushing them to their limits and forcing them to move north, highlighting the profound and disruptive effects of marine heatwaves.</p>

This move addresses a growing problem where the number of graduates significantly exceeds available positions, with an estimated 4,000 more nursing and midwifery graduates than vacancies. While nursing unions welcomed the news as a source of hope for students, employer representatives raised concerns about how the new measures would be funded, given that trust budgets are already under immense pressure.</p>

This incident highlights broader concerns about plastic contamination in food, as experts have long warned that chemicals from plastic packaging can leach into food and pose significant health risks to humans.</p>

          <p>In the Chargers' preseason game against the New Orleans Saints, quarterback Trey Lance delivered a strong performance, bolstering his chances in the competition for the backup role. Lance showcased his dual-threat ability, completing seven of fourteen passes and rushing seven times for 48 yards, including a five-yard touchdown run. His growing confidence and ability to extend plays with his legs have seemingly closed the gap with Taylor Heinicke, who appeared rusty in his first preseason action. Coach Jim Harbaugh praised Lance's decision-making and expressed satisfaction with his game-time experience, as the Chargers went on to win the game 27-13.</p>

          <p>The Lee Fire in western Colorado has grown to become one of the largest in the state's history, charring over 167 square miles and forcing widespread evacuations. As a precautionary measure, all 179 inmates at the Rifle Correctional Center were safely evacuated and relocated to another facility. The massive blaze, which is only 6% contained, is being fought by over a thousand firefighters who are working to protect communities and infrastructure amid gusty winds and dry conditions. Health officials have issued air quality warnings due to heavy smoke from the Lee Fire and the nearby Elk Fire, which is also burning across thousands of acres.</p>

          <p>A man was arrested at the U.S.-Mexico border after U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents discovered an endangered spider monkey hidden in a backpack inside his vehicle. The man, Juan Manuel Valdez, admitted to purchasing the monkey in Mexico and did not have the required permits for its importation. He initially claimed the monkey was for his children before stating he intended to sell it to a friend. The incident highlights the persistent issue of illegal wildlife trafficking, which threatens endangered species, undermines conservation efforts, and can introduce diseases and disrupt local ecosystems. The rescued monkey is now in the care of wildlife authorities.</p>

          <h2>Preliminary Study in Mice Suggests Potential Link Between Nose-Picking and Alzheimer's Risk</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 2022 study conducted on mice suggests a surprising connection between nose-picking and an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's-like symptoms. Researchers found that when the nasal tissue is damaged, certain bacteria, like Chlamydia pneumoniae, have a clearer path to the brain via the olfactory nerve. In response to this infection, the mouse brains deposited amyloid-beta protein, a key feature found in the brains of humans with Alzheimer's disease. While the findings are preliminary and have not been replicated in humans, they offer a new avenue for understanding how the disease may begin and suggest that avoiding damage to protective nasal tissue could be beneficial.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared that homeless people in Washington D.C. must "move out, IMMEDIATELY," vowing to provide them with places to stay "FAR from the Capital." This statement is part of a broader plan he intends to announce to address what he describes as out-of-control crime and a lack of cleanliness in the city. The move follows a recent order deploying federal law enforcement to the capital's streets. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has pushed back against the president's characterization, stating that violent crime has been driven down to a 30-year low and criticizing comparisons of the city to a war zone.</p>

          <p>Leading Democrats have strongly criticized the Republican-led effort to redraw congressional maps in Texas, defending their state colleagues who fled to prevent a legislative quorum. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker labeled the mid-decade redistricting push as "cheating" and an attempt to undermine democracy at the behest of Donald Trump. Senator Bernie Sanders called the plan undemocratic but stated that Democrats have no choice but to fight back against such tactics. In response, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to have the absent lawmakers arrested upon their return to the state and has vowed to call continuous special sessions until the matter is resolved.</p>

          <p>A 60-foot passenger vessel named Discovery ran aground in powerful surf near Honolulu's Kewalo Basin Harbor. The boat, with two crew members aboard, was captured on video being tossed by large waves, nearly flipping on its side before coming to rest in shallow water. The operator reported that two large waves hit the stern, causing a loss of propulsion after it went aground. No one was injured in the incident, and the boat's fuel and batteries were removed to prevent pollution. The vessel's owner, Atlantis Adventures, is working with authorities to safely remove the boat and inspect it before returning it to service.</p>

Vance stated that while the president is reviewing his options, no firm decision has been made, acknowledging the complexity of the U.S.-China relationship. This potential move is part of the administration's broader effort to pressure Russia to end its war in Ukraine. In response, Beijing's embassy in Washington asserted that China's trade with Russia is normal cooperation conducted within the framework of international law, signaling potential for further trade friction.</p>

          <p>Fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued a public apology following criticism that a shoe he designed with Adidas Originals culturally appropriated a traditional Mexican sandal. The Oaxaca Slip-On was inspired by huaraches made by Indigenous artisans but was reportedly produced in China without partnership or credit to the Oaxacan communities. Mexico's president was among those who spoke out against the design. In his statement, Chavarria expressed deep regret that the shoe was not developed in a meaningful partnership with the community, and Adidas has also apologized, stating its commitment to a respectful dialogue to honor the region's cultural legacy.</p>
