            <p>A doctor in Berlin faces murder charges for allegedly killing 15 patients under his palliative care, driven by a "lust" for killing. Prosecutors allege the doctor administered anesthetics and muscle relaxants without consent, causing respiratory arrest. The victims ranged from 25 to 94 years old, and the doctor is also accused of arson to cover up the crimes. This case has drawn comparisons to other instances of medical professionals murdering patients, raising concerns about oversight in end-of-life care.</p>

Travelers from countries with 'weak passports' often face extensive questioning and long visa wait times. The Trump administration is reportedly planning a new version of the Muslim ban, potentially targeting 43 countries, mostly in Africa. The authors argue that the ability to travel freely should be a right, not a privilege based on one's place of birth, and advocate for more liberal border policies.</p>

            <p>The U.K. Supreme Court ruled that the 2010 Equalities Act defines a woman as someone born biologically female. This decision arose from a challenge to a Scottish law aiming for 50% female representation on public boards, which included transgender women in its definition. The court clarified that while transgender people are protected from discrimination, the definition of 'woman' in the Act refers to biological sex. This ruling has implications for sex-based rights and single-sex facilities, amidst ongoing debates about transgender rights in the U.S. and the U.K.</p>

            <p>Vice President JD Vance asserted that the Trump administration would not allow the 'illegal migrant invasion' under President Biden to be ratified. Vance stated that the administration intends to deport those who entered the country illegally and criticized those who demand 'due process' for illegal aliens. He argued that American voters elected the Trump administration to address the illegal immigration issue, which has placed burdens on schools, hospitals, and other essential services.

            <p>A recent survey indicates that Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass's approval ratings have significantly declined, likely due to her handling of the devastating fires in January. Nearly half of those polled had unfavorable views of Bass, a 17 percentage point increase compared to the previous year. While the poll did not explicitly link the decline to the fires, analysts suggest it is a contributing factor. The survey also revealed that over 40% of respondents knew someone personally affected by the fires, which killed at least 30 people and destroyed thousands of homes.</p>

            <p>Health officials in Oregon are investigating three cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a rare and fatal brain disorder, after two people died. CJD is caused by misfolded proteins called prions and leads to rapid brain deterioration. The investigation is prompted by concerns about potential environmental or dietary exposure, particularly given the recent detection of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in wild deer in California and Washington. While there are no known cases of humans contracting prion diseases from consuming deer meat, the potential risk remains a concern.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for allegedly manipulating the Social Security system by declaring 6,300 living individuals as 'dead' in the Death Master File. This action was reportedly taken to prevent these individuals, who were part of humanitarian programs, from receiving benefits and working legally in the U.S. Critics argue that this misuse of the database could have severe consequences for those affected, disrupting their access to financial services and causing bureaucratic nightmares. This action is seen as a disturbing example of the administration's willingness to disregard norms and due process.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Fishery regulators are recommending a third consecutive year of commercial salmon fishing restrictions along the California coast to aid the recovery of declining Chinook salmon populations. While some recreational fishing will be allowed, the continued suspension is causing significant economic hardship for the fishing industry. Those in the fishing industry blame California's water management policies for prioritizing water supplies for agriculture over the needs of salmon. Biologists cite a combination of factors, including dams, habitat loss, and climate change, as contributing to the decline in salmon populations.</p>
