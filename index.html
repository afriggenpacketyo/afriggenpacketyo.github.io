          <p>The U.S. has deported eight men, most of whom are not South Sudanese nationals, to South Sudan after a prolonged legal battle. These men, convicted of serious crimes like murder and sexual assault, were sent to the unstable country because their home nations refused to accept them. This action follows a Supreme Court ruling that overturned a lower court's block on the deportation, highlighting the Trump administration's policy of using third countries for removals amid concerns about due process and the deportees' safety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated that the government's recent U-turn on a £5 billion welfare reform package has made future spending decisions more challenging. She did not commit to scrapping the two-child benefit cap, a policy limiting benefits to two children per family, noting that its removal would carry a significant cost. The reversal, forced by a Labour MP rebellion, puts pressure on the Chancellor ahead of the autumn budget, as the government seeks ways to reduce child poverty without compromising its fiscal rules.</p>

          <p>The 18-year-old cold case of Jennifer Kesse, who vanished from her Orlando condo in 2006, is now an active investigation following the discovery of new DNA evidence. Her father, Drew Kesse, who has relentlessly pursued the case, was informed by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) that they have narrowed down persons of interest. The breakthrough is credited to the family's private investigation team and new technology, including AI enhancement of security footage showing Kesse's car being moved by an unidentified person.</p>

          <p>A recent study from the Africa Centre for Strategic Studies describes the military relationship between China and Tanzania as "very special" and unlike any other on the African continent. According to the research, Tanzania's military structure, including its inventory, doctrines, and order of battle, is heavily influenced by China's People's Liberation Army (PLA). This deep-seated connection is part of a broader trend of close ties between China and African nations governed by former liberation movement parties that have maintained power since independence.</p>

          <p>This article explores the reasons behind the silence of the American evangelical community regarding the Trump administration's effective shutdown of the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Once a celebrated bipartisan initiative credited with saving 26 million lives, PEPFAR's funding has been frozen, leading to clinic closures and an estimated 75,000 deaths. The analysis suggests a combination of factors for the lack of outcry, including political loyalty to Trump, a general distrust of government programs, compassion fatigue, and a focus on domestic culture war issues over foreign humanitarian crises.</p>

This connection has historical roots, such as the "Argo" mission which involved a makeup artist, and continues today with the agency assisting on films and TV shows filmed at its Langley headquarters.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that California's environmental policies are creating contradictions, leading to higher gas prices and increased pollution. Despite having vast oil reserves, the state's regulations have led to refinery closures, forcing a greater reliance on imported oil from countries with lower environmental standards, which paradoxically increases global emissions. The author contends these policies disproportionately harm working-class families who cannot afford electric vehicles, functioning as a regressive tax while undermining both energy independence and national security.

          <p>A shop owner in Durham, UK, who personally stopped a man from stealing a crate of beer, has criticized the lack of legal consequences for the offender. The thief was dealt with through a "community resolution," which involved paying for the stolen goods and being banned from the store, but resulted in no criminal conviction. The shopkeeper, Andrew Board, argues that this approach fails as a deterrent and reflects a wider national problem where a majority of reported shoplifting offenses do not lead to charges.</p>

          <p>A sharp decline in the number of monks and nuns is forcing dozens of monasteries and convents across Germany to close their doors and sell their historic properties. The number of convents has fallen by over 40% in a decade, a trend attributed to the church's diminishing influence and greater professional opportunities for women. This decline has wider societal impacts, as religious orders hand over control of schools and hospitals, and communities face the loss of these long-standing cultural and spiritual centers.</p>

          <p>Global markets are bracing for a volatile week, with two major events taking center stage: the July 9 deadline for US-EU trade negotiations and the OPEC International Seminar in Vienna. While a full trade deal is considered impossible by the deadline, the potential for new tariffs keeps investors on edge. Simultaneously, the OPEC+ group is expected to decide on another oil output hike amidst fluctuating crude prices, adding another layer of uncertainty to the economic outlook.

Despite the prosecutor's portrayal of overwhelming circumstantial evidence of a conspiracy, Baker's potential testimony could introduce significant doubt for a jury.</p>

          <p>A new study by Chinese researchers has demonstrated that genetic factors play a significant role in shaping "brain criticality," the crucial balance between excitement and inhibition in neural activity. This balance is known to be essential for the brain's information processing capabilities and overall cognitive function. Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the research establishes a link between genetics, brain criticality, and cognitive abilities, positioning criticality as a biological phenotype that could help in understanding brain function and disorders.</p>

Furthermore, tests on her bone marrow revealed a mixture of tranquilizer chemicals that only Barry Morphew had access to in the area, suggesting her death was not immediate and bolstering the theory that she was drugged before being killed.</p>
