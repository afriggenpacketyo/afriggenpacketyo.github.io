          <p>This article analyzes the long-term implications of Prince Andrew's decision to stop using his royal titles, suggesting he is unlikely to appear at public royal events for at least six months, with future appearances potentially rare. The move, driven by public outcry and concern over his continued links to Jeffrey Epstein, is seen as a symbolic message of displeasure from the Palace, consulted with King Charles and Prince William. Despite the loss of status, Andrew maintains his innocence and will continue to live at Royal Lodge. The upcoming posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre is expected to keep the controversy alive.</p>

          <p>An altercation at a Florida McDonald's escalated into a "McMess" when a worker shot a customer in the neck, resulting in a minor wound. This article reports that the incident began after the worker informed two men in the drive-thru that online orders overwhelmed the store, leading to alleged threats from the customers. The confrontation continued inside the restaurant, with both sides reportedly brandishing firearms. The worker, Yoan Soto, has been charged with felony tampering with evidence for fleeing, while the customers face trespass and disorderly conduct charges. The sheriff emphasized that threatening mass shootings or violence is unacceptable.</p>
