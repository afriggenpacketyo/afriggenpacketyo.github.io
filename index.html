          <p>Argentina's highest court upheld a corruption conviction against former President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, effectively barring her from holding public office and derailing her plans for a political comeback. The court validated the lower court's sentence, which she was appealing, preventing her from running in future elections. The case involves allegations of corruption during her time in office, specifically related to public works contracts. This ruling has significant implications for Argentine politics, potentially reshaping the political landscape and future elections.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass imposed a curfew in downtown Los Angeles following five days of anti-ICE protests, citing concerns about vandalism and looting. The curfew, spanning one square mile, aims to protect lives and property after nearly 200 arrests and looting of 23 businesses. President Trump deployed the California National Guard and U.S. Marines to protect federal property, escalating tensions with Governor Newsom, who argues the deployment is illegal and immoral. The protests were triggered by immigration raids in the Westlake District, downtown, and South LA, with demonstrators attempting to obstruct federal agents.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appellate court has ruled that the tariffs imposed by President Trump can remain in effect until at least the end of July, pausing a lower court ruling that had blocked them. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Trump administration's request to pause the ruling pending appeal, with oral arguments scheduled for July 31. The tariffs, which include levies on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, have faced legal challenges from businesses and state governments arguing that the president lacks the legal authority to impose them. The trade war has rocked markets and drawn criticism from both parties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California agricultural centers are experiencing an increase in immigration enforcement actions, causing alarm among workers. Federal immigration authorities are showing up at farm fields and packinghouses, leading to workers fleeing. The Times reviewed a video that showed a worker running through a field under the cover of early morning fog, with at least one agent in pursuit on foot and a Border Patrol truck racing along an adjacent dirt road. These actions are impacting undocumented workers who are afraid to take their kids to school, afraid to go to graduation, afraid to go to the grocery store. The harm is going to be done.</p>

          <p>Residents in Japan with foreign roots are increasingly speaking out against racial profiling by police, with some taking legal action. A survey revealed that over 71% of foreign nationals in Japan have been questioned by police in the past five years, significantly higher than the rate for Japanese citizens. Lawyers argue that these questionings often lack sufficient probable cause, violating the Police Duties Execution Act. The issue gained attention after a viral video showed a police officer stating that people with dreadlocks are likely to carry drugs, sparking concerns about discriminatory practices.</p>

The report calls for a national Play Strategy for England, including updating planning policies and opening school playgrounds to the community outside of school hours.
