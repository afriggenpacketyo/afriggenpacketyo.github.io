            <p>A 19-year-old from Kansas City, Missouri, named Owen McIntire, was arrested and charged with arson after two Tesla Cybertrucks were set on fire at a Tesla dealership on March 17. The FBI investigated the incident, and McIntire faces federal charges including unlawful possession of an unregistered destructive device and malicious damage by fire. Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a stern warning against future attacks on Tesla properties. The incident caused over $200,000 in damages to the vehicles and charging stations.</p>

            <p>Harvard University is under investigation by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform regarding its use of taxpayer money and compliance with civil rights laws, particularly concerning antisemitism. The investigation follows the Trump administration's halt of $2.2 billion in funding to the school. The committee seeks documents and communications to determine if legislation is needed to ensure higher education institutions receiving federal aid comply with the law. Harvard maintains it complies with the law and has made strides in combating antisemitism, but rejects demands undermining its independence and constitutional rights.</p>

            <p>Gary Shapley was removed from his position as interim IRS commissioner just two days after his appointment, following an internal power struggle involving Elon Musk. Sources indicate that Musk advocated for Shapley's appointment, bypassing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's authority. Bessent reportedly complained to President Trump and supported Michael Faulkender's appointment instead, citing the need to restore trust in the IRS. Shapley, known for his whistleblower claims regarding the Hunter Biden tax probe, will remain an advisor to Secretary Bessent.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is implementing a new rule to reclassify some career civil servants as "at-will" employees, a move aimed at streamlining the process of firing underperforming or subversive employees. The White House claims this will empower agencies to swiftly remove employees in policy-influencing roles who subvert presidential directives. The Office of Personnel Management estimates that around 50,000 positions will be affected, stripping them of protections afforded to civil service employees. The administration asserts that employees will not be required to support the president politically but must faithfully implement the law and administration policies.</p>

            <p>The Australian government is facing criticism for shooting koalas from helicopters in Budj Bim National Park. The government claims the action is to end the koalas' suffering from starvation and burns following a recent bushfire. However, animal welfare advocates argue that logging, development, and climate change have severely reduced the koalas' habitat, exacerbating the problem. Experts are skeptical of the aerial cull, suggesting rescue should be the first option, but the government argues it's not feasible due to the terrain and safety risks.</p>

This action follows a recent Supreme Court ruling allowing the administration to resume deportations under the AEA, but requiring due process for detainees.
