          <p>A rare and intense dust storm swept through northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, plunging the region into near-total darkness during the day. The National Weather Service issued dust storm warnings, marking the first time such a warning was issued for Chicago. The storm, driven by strong winds over exceptionally dry soil, significantly reduced visibility, creating hazardous conditions on major highways and at airports. The event is considered unusual, reminiscent of dust storms from the Dust Bowl era, with soil moisture levels at record lows. The article highlights the storm's impact on visibility and transportation, as well as the meteorological conditions that led to its formation.</p>

          <p>Elton John has strongly criticized the government's plans regarding AI copyright, labeling ministers as "absolute losers" and expressing feeling "incredibly betrayed." He argued that exempting technology firms from copyright laws would amount to "theft" from artists, particularly young artists lacking the resources to fight big tech. The government's rejection of proposals to force AI companies to disclose the material used to develop their programs has sparked outrage among musicians and artists. The article highlights the potential impact on artists' income and legacy, as well as the broader debate surrounding AI and copyright protection.</p>

          <p>This article argues that President Trump's alleged corruption is not an isolated phenomenon, but rather part of a long history of American politicians being influenced by foreign interests. The author points to past instances of corruption, including the Clinton Foundation and Hunter Biden's activities, to illustrate that the problem extends beyond one administration or political party. The article suggests reforms to prevent foreign lobbying and financial arrangements between politicians' families and foreign entities. It concludes that a future administration must enforce existing anti-corruption laws and prosecute any former presidents found to have abused their office for personal gain.</p>

          <p>Europe is experiencing a renaissance in sleeper train travel, driven by environmental concerns and a desire to compete with short-haul flights. The European Union plans to double high-speed rail traffic by 2030, linking major cities. In contrast, the United States is cutting funding for public infrastructure and prioritizing cars and planes. The article argues that America's car-centric culture has led to increased congestion and unhappiness, while its investment in transit remains limited. It contrasts America's focus on niche projects like the Hyperloop with China's successful high-speed rail network, highlighting the need for consistency, conviction, and adequate funding to revitalize American railways.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent diplomatic moves in the Middle East, including engaging with Syria and pursuing deals with Gulf nations, indicate a shift in U.S. foreign policy that has sidelined Israel. The article notes that Trump's actions, such as lifting sanctions on Syria and seeking a deal with Iran, diverge from Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's preferences. While the U.S. maintains its ties with Israel, Trump's focus on Gulf States and his pursuit of regional peace deals suggest a new dynamic in which Israel is no longer at the center of American foreign policy in the region.</p>

          <p>Despite growing public regret over Brexit, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's efforts to improve relations with the European Union are facing strong opposition from the British news media. Many tabloids, which supported Brexit, are criticizing the upcoming summit with the EU and accusing Starmer of seeking to rejoin the bloc. The article discusses the challenges Starmer faces in navigating the divisive legacy of Brexit and the hostile media landscape, which often promotes a jingoistic narrative of British exceptionalism. It also notes the rise of Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party, which is putting pressure on the Conservatives and complicating Starmer's efforts.</p>
