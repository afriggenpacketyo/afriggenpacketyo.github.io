          <p>An immersive Elvis Presley experience in London has drawn criticism from some attendees who felt misled by initial advertising. The show, "Elvis Evolution," was promoted as featuring a holographic projection of the star, but instead uses AI to upscale archive footage. While some fans and critics have praised the production, others have labeled it "atrocious," citing the high ticket prices and lack of a hologram as reasons for their disappointment and requests for refunds.</p>

The warning came after Bolsonaro's allies circulated a video of a speech he gave, which the judge believes was intended for social media distribution. This development is part of an ongoing investigation into allegations that Bolsonaro planned a coup, for which he is already under orders to wear an ankle monitor and is barred from foreign travel.</p>

          <p>A Bangladeshi military F-7 training jet crashed into a school in Dhaka, resulting in at least 27 fatalities, many of whom were students. The pilot, who also died, reportedly tried to steer the aircraft away from crowded areas after a mechanical failure occurred shortly after takeoff. The incident, which injured over 170 people, is one of the nation's deadliest aviation disasters in decades, prompting a national day of mourning and a formal investigation by the armed forces.</p>

The new measures will freeze assets and impose travel bans on gang leaders, corrupt officials, and suppliers of equipment like small boats.

          <p>An analysis of President Donald Trump's economic policies highlights his frequent use of tariffs as a primary tool for foreign policy leverage, often blurring the lines with traditional sanctions. This approach allows for unilateral action without congressional approval and generates revenue, but creates significant uncertainty for global markets and US businesses. Critics express concern that this strategy could destabilize global trade and international relations, linking high tariffs historically to periods of de-globalization and conflict.

          <p>The pilot of a SkyWest flight approaching Minot, North Dakota, had to take sudden evasive action to avoid a B-52 military bomber that was not communicated to them by air traffic control. The pilot later apologized to passengers for the "aggressive maneuver," explaining that he saw the faster-moving military aircraft on a converging course and had to turn sharply. The FAA and the Air Force are now investigating the incident, which highlighted a communication breakdown between the airport's control tower and the nearby Air Force base.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while widely criticized, Donald Trump's universal tariffs may have a "silver lining" by exposing the self-defeating internal trade barriers within other countries and trading blocs. The piece suggests that nations like Canada and China, as well as the European Union, are being forced to confront and remove long-standing domestic hurdles to commerce in response to the tariff pressure. This could potentially lead to a net positive outcome by spurring them to free up their own economies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Annie Farmer, a key witness and one of Jeffrey Epstein's earliest accusers, is urging the government to release information related to the case, stating that if there is "nothing to hide," it should be made public.

Farmer remains skeptical of the Trump administration's handling of the files and is disturbed by calls from some to pardon Epstein's accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>

          <p>The White House has removed a Wall Street Journal reporter from the press pool for President Trump's upcoming trip to Scotland, in an act of retaliation for a recent article. The newspaper had published a story about an alleged birthday letter Trump sent to Jeffrey Epstein, which prompted the president to file a $10 billion lawsuit. The move was condemned by the White House Correspondents’ Association as an attack on free speech and an attempt to punish a media outlet for unfavorable coverage.</p>

Dr. King's family responded by supporting transparency but urged the public to view the files in the context of the FBI's historical surveillance and disinformation campaigns against the civil rights leader.</p>
