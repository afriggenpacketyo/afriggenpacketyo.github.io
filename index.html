            <h2>US Stock Markets Experience Gains Following Trump Tariff Easing</h2>

            <p>US stock markets saw an upswing after the White House announced a rollback of tariffs on certain Chinese-made electronics, including smartphones. This decision offered a reprieve to tech companies, particularly Apple, which manufactures most of its iPhones in China. While the initial market reaction was positive, with tech stocks leading the gains, President Trump hinted that these exemptions might be temporary. Investors are cautiously optimistic, balancing the relief from immediate tariff pressures with concerns about potential future complications in trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A federal judge in Vermont is weighing whether to release Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish Ph.D. student at Tufts University, who is challenging her detention by immigration authorities as a violation of her free speech rights. Ozturk was detained after co-authoring an editorial critical of Tufts' handling of resolutions related to Israel. Her attorneys argue that her detention and transfer to Louisiana were designed to punish her for protected speech. The Justice Department contends that federal courts lack jurisdiction due to ongoing removal proceedings, sparking a debate over habeas jurisdiction and constitutional liberties.</p>

            <p>A CNBC Supply Chain Survey reveals that President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. due to high costs and the challenge of finding skilled labor. Most companies surveyed believe it would be more cost-effective to relocate supply chains to lower-tariffed countries. The survey also indicates that many companies feel the Trump administration is "bullying corporate America." Respondents anticipate increased automation and potential layoffs as a result of the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

Meta contends that it has done nothing wrong and that the acquisitions have fostered growth and innovation.

In both scenarios, he expects the Fed to cut interest rates, with the timing depending on the magnitude of the tariffs.

The debate centers on the potential dangers posed by these investments and the level of control Chinese entities have over critical assets.</p>
