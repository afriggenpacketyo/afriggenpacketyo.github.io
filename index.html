          <p>An eyewitness and former aid truck driver has alleged that American security personnel, alongside the IDF, indiscriminately fired upon Palestinian civilians seeking food at U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) aid sites. The individual, who provided secretly recorded videos to CBS News, described scenes of intense desperation and claimed the shootings were a regular occurrence during his several weeks working in Gaza. The GHF has categorically denied these allegations as baseless, while the IDF stated it is investigating reports of harm to civilians near these locations and will take action against any deviation from the law.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Colombia are responding to two separate deadly attacks. In the western city of Cali, a car bomb targeting a military aviation school killed at least five people and injured dozens more, with officials blaming a narco cartel for the terrorist act. In a separate incident near Medellin, a police helicopter was attacked with a drone while on a mission to eradicate coca crops, resulting in the deaths of at least 12 individuals. The defense minister attributed the helicopter attack to the EMC guerrilla group, an offshoot of the former FARC rebels, highlighting a recent surge in violence across the country.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders has responded to comments made by his teammate, Dillon Gabriel, who distinguished between "entertainers" and "competitors." While some speculated the remark was aimed at Sanders, Gabriel later clarified he was referring to the media. Sanders stated that he spoke with Gabriel and is unconcerned by others' words, emphasizing that such comments do not affect him or his focus. The situation highlights the quarterback dynamics in Cleveland's crowded roster, where veteran Joe Flacco has been named the regular-season starter.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Alina Habba, a former personal lawyer for Donald Trump, was not lawfully appointed as the acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey and has disqualified her from participating in ongoing criminal cases. The judge concluded that the Trump administration's novel process to install her in the position was legally invalid after a 120-day interim deadline had expired. While the decision voids her authority, the judge stayed the ruling to allow for an appeal, which Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed would be filed immediately. The ruling does not automatically dismiss indictments previously approved by Habba.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has announced it will continuously vet over 55 million visa holders for violations of law, with potential for revocation and deportation if infractions are found. This policy expansion is part of a broader immigration crackdown that includes screening for "anti-American" views. In a separate move, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced an immediate halt to issuing new work visas for commercial truck drivers, citing safety concerns and the need to protect American jobs. The trucking industry has previously disputed claims of being flooded by foreign drivers, noting immigrants make up a significant portion of the existing workforce.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new congressional redistricting plan designed to make five Republican-held House seats more favorable to Democrats. The move is a direct response to a similar effort in Texas, where Republicans, at Donald Trump's urging, redrew maps to bolster their own majority. California Democrats argue their action is necessary to neutralize the Texas gerrymandering and give voters a fair choice. Unlike the Texas plan, California's new map requires voter approval in a special election on November 4, a step proponents say upholds democratic principles despite the partisan nature of the redrawing.</p>

          <p>A fourth-generation Texas cotton farmer, facing significant financial losses from traditional agriculture, has successfully pivoted his business to solar grazing. Instead of planting crops, he now rents out his flock of 6,000 sheep to act as natural lawn mowers for large-scale solar farms, keeping vegetation from obstructing the panels. This innovative approach has proven highly profitable, turning a potential six-figure loss from cotton farming into a substantial profit. The trend reflects a growing challenge for small and mid-sized farms, with many struggling to break even in the face of low prices and unpredictable yields.</p>

          <p>In an effort to reverse six consecutive years of declining sales, Jeep has unveiled the redesigned 2026 Cherokee, featuring the brand's first hybrid system. The new model, which is larger and offers more cargo space, is equipped with Stellantis's new 1.6-liter turbo-four hybrid powertrain. The reintroduction of the Cherokee, which was discontinued in 2023, is a key part of the strategy under new Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa to regain market share in the competitive midsize SUV segment. The vehicle will be produced in Mexico and is expected to arrive in dealerships late this year.</p>

          <p>A global arms race for hypersonic missiles, which travel at over five times the speed of sound and are highly maneuverable, is intensifying, with China and Russia currently leading development. These weapons are difficult to detect and intercept with current defense systems, posing a significant strategic challenge. While the U.S. and UK are now investing heavily to catch up, their focus on counter-insurgency over the past two decades allowed rivals to advance. Experts note that while the technology alters strategic timeframes, defensive measures are being developed, and some of the capabilities claimed by Russia may be overstated.</p>

The 25-year-old, who has been used sparingly this season by manager Jimmy Thelin, delivered a standout performance that included creating multiple chances and winning most of his duels. His display has intensified calls from fans and pundits for him to be in the starting lineup.</p>

This strategy aims to increase the low household penetration rate of robotic cleaners by bridging cutting-edge technology with mainstream price points. The company is also investing heavily in AI research and expanding its supply chain to Vietnam to navigate U.S. tariffs and support its global ambitions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying its campaign for the removal of Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, following unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud. After Cook stated she would not be bullied into resigning, a top Trump official sent a letter to Fed Chair Jerome Powell urging him to remove her from the board. This represents an unprecedented challenge to the central bank's independence, though the Fed chair does not have the legal authority to fire another governor. The Department of Justice is reportedly investigating the claims, which were publicized by the head of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency.</p>

          <p>President Trump has voiced strong support for the Resolution Copper mine project in Arizona, which would be built on land sacred to the San Carlos Apache Tribe. His endorsement came after a federal appeals court issued a temporary stay, halting the transfer of the federal land, known as Oak Flat, to the mining companies Rio Tinto and BHP. Trump met with mining executives and criticized the court's decision, emphasizing the project's job creation and the nation's need for copper. The Apache Tribe hailed the court's decision as a crucial, albeit potentially temporary, victory in their long-running legal battle to protect the sacred site.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests President Trump's recent shift toward providing U.S. "security guarantees" for Ukraine has been undermined by Russia's immediate and firm rejection of the concept. Despite European leaders leaving a White House meeting with optimism, Russia's foreign minister has repeatedly stated that the presence of any foreign troops in Ukraine is unacceptable. This public dismissal of a core component of the proposed peace framework makes the American president's position appear weak on the international stage. The situation casts doubt on the viability of an upcoming bilateral meeting and the overall strategy for resolving the conflict.</p>

Alex Freeland had a career-best three hits in the win, part of a late-series surge where the Dodgers scored 20 runs.

While the ruling nullified the massive fine, it upheld the trial court's finding that Trump and his organization were liable for fraud. Other non-monetary penalties, such as a ban on Trump serving as a company director in the state for three years, remain in place. The New York Attorney General's office, which brought the case, plans to appeal the decision on the fine to the state's highest court.</p>
