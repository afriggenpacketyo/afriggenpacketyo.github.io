          <h2>Google Offers Buyouts to Employees Across Multiple Divisions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Google has offered buyouts to employees in several divisions, including knowledge and information (K&I), central engineering, marketing, research, and communications. This move is part of Google's ongoing efforts to reduce headcount since the layoffs of 12,000 employees in 2023, with the "voluntary exit program" applying to U.S.-based employees. The K&I unit, which houses Google's search, ads, and commerce divisions, underwent a reorganization in October, and finance chief Anat Ashkenazi emphasized cost-cutting measures to support increased AI infrastructure spending in 2025. Google is also revamping its internal learning platform to focus on AI tool training for employees. The memo sent out by Google executive Nick Fox indicated that employees who are not meeting expectations may want to take the buyout, while those who are excited by their work and doing well should remain with the company. Optimism regarding the company's future is somewhat tempered by the layoffs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel stated that Commerzbank's current share price is too high for a potential takeover offer. UniCredit has acquired a 28% stake in Commerzbank since September through derivatives and has ECB authorization to hold up to 29.9% of the lender. Orcel indicated that UniCredit would not proceed with an acquisition offer at a premium to Commerzbank's current share value, as it would not provide value for their investors. Shares of the German bank have surged 76% year-to-date, benefiting from a broader rally of German equities following Berlin's fiscal policy changes. Orcel emphasized that UniCredit is far from a merger bid and would first seek a constructive solution to opposition from the German government. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia announced partnerships with European countries and companies to expand its infrastructure and software presence in the artificial intelligence sector. CEO Jensen Huang highlighted key European partnerships at Nvidia's GTC event in Paris, emphasizing Nvidia's role as an infrastructure company that can help countries build data centers using its GPUs. Nvidia seeks to embed itself in national-level AI infrastructure, particularly as U.S. export restrictions impact revenue in China. Key partnerships include Mistral, which will build an "AI cloud" using Nvidia Grace Blackwell chips, and infrastructure projects in Italy and Armenia. The company is also working with telecommunications firms like Orange and Telefonica, focusing on "sovereign AI" with data centers located regionally within the EU. The expansion will significantly increase AI computing capacity in Europe over the next two years.</p>

          <p>Seventeen police officers were injured in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, during a second night of violence involving petrol bombs, bricks, and fireworks. Five people were arrested, bringing the total number of officers injured to 32, and police used baton rounds and a water cannon to disperse protesters. The unrest began after a peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault in the town, with Sinn FÃ©in First Minister Michelle O'Neill condemning the disorder and calling for it to stop. PSNI Chief Constable Jon Boutcher highlighted the critical underfunding of the PSNI and the need to activate mutual aid resources, while Alliance Party assembly member Sian Mulholland reported that some homes displayed stickers indicating the nationality of residents. The situation is tense, with concerns about illegal immigration and potential fatalities.</p>

Masaaki Okawara, president of Ohkawara Kakohki Co., and two other men will receive about 166 million yen ($1.15 million) in damages, with the court recognizing their arrests and indictments as illegal. The investigation involved the export of spray-drying apparatus suspected of being used in biological weapons production, but prosecutors withdrew the indictment in July 2021. A Tokyo police investigator testified that the case was "fabricated," and a former investigator cited ambition as the motive for building the case. The Metropolitan Police Department will review its investigation of the case.</p>

Despite disagreements on issues like trade and spending, the right is united in the belief that the left must not be allowed another year like 2020. The events in LA remind the right of their shared concerns about radical left street disorder and the perceived alignment of the liberal establishment with these movements. This unity is driven by a fear of chaotic, violent left-wing radicals and a sense that mainstream liberals are in thrall to these extremists.</p>

In LA, an overnight curfew is in force after clashes between protesters and law enforcement, while Trump has deployed thousands of troops, triggering a dispute with state officials. Demonstrations have spread to other cities, including San Antonio, New York, and San Francisco, with arrests reported in several locations. The protests stem from anger over ICE raids targeting areas with prominent Latino populations, leading to accusations of racist thuggery and concerns over the use of federal forces without state consent.</p>

          <p>German start-up Proxima Fusion has raised 130 million euros ($148 million) in a Series A funding round to develop the world's first commercial nuclear fusion power plant. The financing, co-led by Cherry Ventures and Balderton Capital, marks the largest private fusion investment round in Europe to date. CEO Francesco Sciortino emphasized the rapid pace of developments in nuclear fusion, describing it as the "ultimate" source of clean energy. If replicated at an industrial scale, nuclear fusion could provide virtually limitless clean, safe, and affordable energy, though some researchers remain skeptical about its near-term scalability.</p>

The argument is based on the premise that these companies knew their actions were likely to cause lethal climate harms, as indicated by internal documentation. The author, a former prosecutor, suggests that proving causation would require linking a death to heat, climate-attribution studies, and proof of the companies' role as primary drivers of greenhouse gas emissions.

          <p>Homeowners are saving on insurance by upgrading their houses to be more resistant to disasters like hurricanes and wildfires. States are developing insurance discount programs, modeled after Alabama's, to encourage homeowners to strengthen their houses.

California offers smaller discounts for wildfire-resistant upgrades, but some experts argue that these discounts are not enough to motivate homeowners. Disaster experts emphasize the importance of community-wide retrofitting to withstand extreme weather and for insurance companies to account for these improvements in their coverage decisions.</p>

          <p>Seattle is grappling with balancing the need for more housing with the preservation and growth of trees to combat climate change. Trees provide cooling shade, absorb carbon pollution, and reduce stormwater runoff, but are often seen as obstacles to development. The Bryant Heights development showcases how to build density while saving trees, with architects integrating 86 housing units around existing mature trees. Seattle's updated tree protection ordinance aims to preserve trees on private property during development, with developers generally supporting the code for its predictability and flexibility. The city is working to reverse canopy shrinkage by planting more trees in parks and public areas, and increasing tree replacement requirements for development.</p>
