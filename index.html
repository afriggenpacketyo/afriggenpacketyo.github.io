        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Microsoft is set to lay off 3% of its workforce across all levels, teams, and geographies as part of organizational changes aimed at positioning the company for success in a dynamic marketplace. According to a company spokesperson, these job cuts are not related to performance. The company reported better-than-expected results and an upbeat quarterly forecast in late April. This reduction will affect thousands of employees, as Microsoft had 228,000 employees worldwide at the end of June, and is likely the largest round of layoffs since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 10:31:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.3% annually in April, less than economists expected, signaling that inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Housing and energy costs drove inflation, while grocery prices slightly dropped, with egg prices declining 12.7% but remaining high due to bird flu outbreaks. Economists are closely monitoring the impact of President Trump's tariffs, but the effects may be delayed due to exemptions and front-loading of purchases by consumers and businesses. The Federal Reserve is expected to hold off on cutting rates as it assesses the impact of trade policies, potentially leading to a longer wait for relief on borrowing costs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists and policymakers anticipate a resurgence of inflation as companies adapt to President Trump's trade war, despite a slight cooling in U.S. inflation reported in April. The Consumer Price Index rose 2.3 percent annually, the slowest pace since early 2021, but experts predict prices will accelerate due to import taxes. While a temporary trade truce with China reduces near-term inflation peaks, the overall direction points upward, with some economists forecasting inflation to reach 3.5 percent by year-end. Companies built up inventories before tariffs took effect, delaying the full impact of these levies on consumer prices until the summer.</p>

Brazil is planning a major rail link to Peru's Chancay megaport, financed by China, to reduce dependency on Atlantic shipping lanes, while Colombia considers joining China's Belt and Road Initiative. This trend indicates that US trade policies under President Trump are driving Latin America closer to Beijing.

The data indicates a steep drop in demand in China, while U.S. manufacturers aggressively stockpile key inputs to buffer against tariffs.

          <p>A temporary tariff truce between the U.S. and China offers companies some relief but prolongs economic uncertainty, making future business planning difficult. The U.S. will reduce its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China will lower its tariff on American goods to 10%. Experts warn that absent a formal trade deal, there's no guarantee that President Trump won't raise tariffs again, and Beijing won't retaliate. The agreement reduces the odds of a U.S. recession this year, but businesses still face added costs, likely passing some onto consumers.</p>

          <p>A recent trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. has been criticized for its limited scope and potential to undermine American exporters. The deal includes commitments to roll back tariffs on only a few product categories, leaving many issues unresolved. Experts argue that the agreement pales in comparison to the benefits the U.S. could have gained by remaining in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The tariffs imposed by Trump have undermined U.S. exporters' competitiveness and pushed other countries to sign agreements among themselves.</p>

          <p>The second Trump administration is facing scrutiny for increasingly blurring the lines between public office and personal benefits, raising ethical concerns. The plan to accept a luxury jet from the Qatari royal family exemplifies this trend, as the president would use the plane while in office and then transfer it to his presidential foundation. This administration is showing striking disdain for norms of propriety and traditional legal guardrails around public service. Critics point to the Trump administrationâ€™s disbanding of a Justice Department unit dedicated to investigating cryptocurrency crimes as an example.</p>

          <p>Germany's new finance minister, Lars Klingbeil, has presented a plan to invest â‚¬1 trillion in defense and infrastructure, challenging the EU's fiscal framework. The plan, which involves suspending Germany's constitutional debt brake, has raised concerns about whether Berlin is adhering to the rules it once enforced on others. While Germany argues its plans fall within the scope of revised EU rules, critics suggest the spending goes beyond what is allowed, potentially undermining fiscal discipline across the bloc. The European Commission is expected to make a decision on the plan by summer.</p>

GM expects to use these new batteries in full-size electric vehicles like the Chevrolet Silverado and Escalade IQ beginning in 2028. These batteries will use more prevalent and less expensive minerals like magnesium, which can help reduce costs. GM's expectations come after Ford Motor announced its intention to launch similar LMR batteries before 2030.</p>

          <p>Experts are recommending several debt relief strategies to help consumers cope with economic pressures such as inflation and potential tariffs. Debt consolidation, particularly using HELOCs due to their lower interest rates, is considered a strong option. Balance transfer cards with 0% introductory rates are also viable for those with good credit. Debt management plans and debt settlement are other strategies, though they have potential downsides. Good financial planning, including budgeting and expense tracking, remains essential for managing and reducing debt. (not investment advice)</p>
