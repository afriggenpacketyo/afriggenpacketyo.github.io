          <p>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, which allows taxpayer money to be used to help qualifying students pay for private school tuition. The governor highlighted the "fearless commitment" of the House and Senate members who supported the bill, while Attorney General Ken Paxton praised it as a historic step for students' educational freedom. However, Texas Democrats have criticized the legislation, arguing that it will siphon funds from already underfunded public schools, benefiting wealthier students who already attend private schools. The article details the financial provisions of the bill, including $10,000 per year for most private school students and up to $30,000 for students with disabilities.</p>

          <p>A recent survey in Japan reveals that nearly 30% of individuals in common-law relationships have chosen not to legally marry due to the country's surname law, which requires couples to adopt the same last name. The rate is higher among those in their 20s, with over 60% indicating they would marry if separate surnames were permitted. While the main opposition party supports the option of separate surnames, conservative members of the ruling party oppose the move, fearing it would undermine traditional family values. The article points out that common-law couples do not have access to the same benefits as legally married couples, such as tax deductions and inheritance rights.</p>
