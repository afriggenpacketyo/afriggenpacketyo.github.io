          <h2>China Evaluates Potential Trade Negotiations with the United States</h2>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce stated it is considering initiating trade negotiations with the United States, indicating a possible softening of Beijing's stance in the ongoing tariff war. This assessment follows repeated statements from senior US officials expressing a willingness to negotiate on tariff issues, along with messages relayed through various channels. China insists that the US must demonstrate sincerity by addressing its "wrong practices" and removing all tariffs imposed on China. The ministry spokesperson cautioned that any insincerity or use of talks as a cover for coercion would be unacceptable to China.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the United States' focus on "beating China" lacks a clear alignment of purpose, goal, and means, which is essential for success in any conflict. The article suggests that the Trump administration's approach to China has been chaotic, with even close associates struggling to articulate a coherent strategy. The author contends that fuzzy thinking regarding China is not exclusive to the Trump administration, referencing a Democratic bill from 2020 aimed at promoting trade and consumer protection between the US, Canada, and Mexico. The article suggests the US needs to focus on its own strengths rather than solely trying to undermine China.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States held their second round of tariff talks, primarily focusing on Japan's proposals to increase imports of American agricultural products.

          <p>The troubled rollout of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is creating challenges for college-bound students, particularly those from low-income backgrounds. Delays, error messages, and glitches on the site, compounded by cuts to the Department of Education, have made it difficult for students to access financial aid. Many students are struggling to navigate the system and are unsure if they will receive aid in time to complete college. Education equity groups are working to help underrepresented students navigate the FAFSA system, but the process remains grueling for many.</p>

          <p>Santa Cruz, California, has implemented a "soda tax" on sugar-sweetened beverages, defying a statewide ban that prohibits local governments from imposing such taxes until 2031. The tax adds 2 cents per ounce to nonalcoholic beverages with added sweeteners and a high calorie count. The city council framed the campaign as a battle against the American Beverage Association, which resonated with voters. The American Beverage Association criticized the tax as a violation of the statewide ban and an unfair burden on working families. The tax does not apply to certain beverages, such as those intended for medical use or 100% natural fruit juice.</p>

Despite initial skepticism towards U.S. support for Ukraine, Trump has recently shown signs of a more favorable stance, including an economic deal granting the U.S. a stake in Ukraine's mineral revenues. Analysts caution against drawing firm conclusions, as Trump's approach has been inconsistent, and differences exist among his advisors. Trump's frustration with Putin's demands for concessions has led to sharp criticism and threats of increased economic pressure on Russia.</p>

State Superintendent Ryan Walters supports the proposal, stating he would share the data with federal authorities, citing an executive order from President Trump. However, Governor Kevin Stitt opposes the measure, questioning the need to gather immigration status from students and replacing board members who supported the proposal. The White House clarified that it's not a directive to enter schools but to prevent criminals from hiding in schools and churches.</p>
