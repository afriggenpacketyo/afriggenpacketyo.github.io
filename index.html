          <p>Medical experts are raising alarms over a dramatic spike in malaria cases and deaths in Zimbabwe, which have more than tripled since the previous year. The surge is directly linked to the Trump administration's earlier decision to cut funding for the nation's primary malaria research and prevention program. This loss of aid has crippled the distribution of essential supplies like mosquito nets and medicine, leading to what experts are calling a preventable and devastating public health crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent discussion among medical professionals, several plastic surgeons and nurses identified specific cosmetic procedures they would not undergo themselves due to what they consider unacceptably high risks. Procedures such as Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs), rib removal for waist slimming, and surgical leg lengthening were cited for their potential for life-threatening complications like blood clots, sepsis, and severe nerve damage. The article serves as a cautionary overview of the potential dangers associated with certain popular but highly invasive surgeries.</p>

          <p>The Green Party in the United Kingdom is at a strategic crossroads as it holds a leadership election, pitting different visions for the party's future against each other. Deputy leader Zack Polanski is advocating for a bolder, "eco-populist" approach designed to challenge the elite and connect with voter anger. This contrasts with the more moderate, broad-appeal strategy of current co-leader Adrian Ramsay and new MP Ellie Chowns, who argue their proven method led to the party's record success in the last general election.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that President Trump's recent diplomatic shifts following his meeting with Vladimir Putin are threatening the unity of the Western alliance against Russia's invasion of Ukraine. By abandoning calls for an immediate ceasefire and appearing open to the idea of territorial concessions by Ukraine, Trump is seen as undermining the collective position of his European and Ukrainian partners. The upcoming White House meeting is therefore a high-stakes attempt by European leaders to steer the U.S. president back toward a unified stance.</p>

          <p>The United States is currently experiencing a historically low birth rate, which has fallen below the level required for natural population replacement, mirroring demographic trends seen in countries like Japan. Experts point to multiple factors, including a significant decline in teenage pregnancies and a broader societal shift where women under 30 are having fewer children. This ongoing trend raises long-term concerns about future economic growth, the size of the workforce, and the sustainability of social programs like Social Security.</p>

          <p>A massive concert by the ultra-nationalist singer Thompson has starkly highlighted the deep political and historical divisions within Croatian society. The event featured the widespread use of a chant associated with the country's World War Two-era Nazi-allied Ustasha regime, drawing strong condemnation from human rights organizations. However, supporters, including some government officials, defend the chant as a patriotic symbol from the 1990s war of independence, exposing fiercely conflicting interpretations of the nation's history and identity.</p>

          <p>Japan is facing a severe and accelerating population decline, having lost citizens for 15 consecutive years, and is currently projected to shrink by half by the end of the century. The crisis is driven by record-low birth rates, falling marriage rates, a punishing work culture, and a stagnant economy, creating profound long-term challenges for the nation's workforce, healthcare system, and defense. The government has implemented various measures, from promoting matchmaking apps to encouraging relocation to rural areas, in a difficult attempt to reverse the trend.</p>
