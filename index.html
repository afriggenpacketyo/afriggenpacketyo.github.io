          <p>The European Commission has formally accused Chinese online retailer Temu of violating the Digital Services Act (DSA), a significant regulation governing major tech firms in the European Union. The commission's investigation found a high risk of illegal products being sold on the platform, which is designated a 'very large online platform' under the law. Key complaints include products not complying with EU standards, the use of fake discounts and reviews, and an app design considered addictive. Temu now has the opportunity to respond to these allegations but could face substantial fines if the EU determines a violation has occurred.</p>

          <p>San Francisco 49ers defensive end Tarron Jackson was hospitalized following a serious collision during a Sunday training camp practice. According to head coach Kyle Shanahan, Jackson was conscious and had movement in his extremities before being transported to Stanford Hospital for evaluation. The 27-year-old player, who was placed on a backboard and taken off the field, had signed with the team in January and was competing for a spot on the 53-man roster. The injury casts significant uncertainty on his immediate prospects for the upcoming NFL season.</p>

          <h2>Germany Proposes 'Construction Turbo' Law to Address Housing Shortage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 07:07:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's government is advancing a 'Bau-Turbo' (construction turbo) plan to tackle its severe housing crisis by streamlining building regulations. The proposed legislation aims to expedite approvals for new residential projects, allowing municipalities to bypass certain planning laws and automatically approving applications after two months if not vetoed. While proponents believe this will save billions and stimulate construction, critics express concerns about the loss of green spaces and argue that it won't be a short-term fix. The plan is part of a broader effort to increase affordable housing in a country facing soaring rents.</p>

          <p>Pentagon Undersecretary for Policy Elbridge Colby is championing a strategic shift to prioritize countering China, even at the expense of U.S. commitments in other regions like Europe and the Middle East. This 'America First' approach suggests that to confront Beijing's rising military and economic power, the U.S. must consolidate its resources in the western Pacific. This stance has created divisions, with some Republicans and allies criticizing it as a retreat from global responsibilities, while others in the MAGA movement praise it. Colby's influence was highlighted during a recent, though ultimately reversed, pause in weapons shipments to Ukraine, reflecting an ongoing debate within the administration about America's global role.</p>

          <p>The California horse racing industry's plan to use Historical Horse Racing (HHR) machines to supplement purses and ensure its survival is facing significant obstacles, primarily from the state's powerful Indigenous tribes.

Industry leaders have been exploring pathways to introduce HHR, but tribal leaders view it as an infringement on their sovereignty and express skepticism that it can save a declining sport.

Meanwhile, Apple also saw positive results, with its shipments in China growing by 4% year-on-year, its first increase since late 2023.

While the agreement averts higher tariffs, the new 15% rate on most EU goods will likely increase costs for American consumers. German carmakers face significant new costs, even though the tariff is lower than previously threatened. Conversely, U.S. carmakers may benefit from the EU dropping its own tariffs. The deal is seen as a political victory for President Trump, but it has also exposed divisions within the EU, with some member states criticizing the terms as a submission to U.S. pressure.</p>

The author explores various motivations for Murdoch's stance, including his historical tendency to back winners, a personal dislike for Trump, and a desire to protect his journalistic institutions. Ultimately, the piece suggests that in an era of increasing attacks on the media, Murdoch's defiance, whatever the reason, serves as a crucial bulwark against intimidation.</p>

The city of Hayward used eminent domain to forcibly remove 205 families, paying them minimal amounts for their property before destroying the town to build an industrial park. This act of displacement shattered a vibrant, self-sufficient community and destroyed generational wealth for its residents. The story is gaining renewed attention through California's reparations taskforce and local efforts, which recently committed $1 million to a redress fund for former residents and their descendants.</p>

          <p>Despite forecasting a nearly threefold increase in net profit for the first half of 2025, shares of Chinese jewelry company Laopu Gold have fallen. The Hong Kong-listed stock, which has surged over 2,000% since its debut last year, saw a retreat as investors likely engaged in profit-taking. Analysts attribute the decline to a reset in market expectations and concerns over rising gold prices, although the company's growth is considered less tied to commodity fluctuations due to its unique, craft-focused designs popular with younger consumers. The company's success contrasts with otherwise tepid luxury spending in China. (not investment advice)</p>

While some allies have privately urged him to change his approach, the White House has consistently defended him, valuing his 'warrior ethos' and his execution of key administration priorities like Operation Midnight Hammer.

          <p>This article details how Elon Musk's SpaceX has come to dominate the U.S. space program, effectively superseding NASA and creating a national dependency on a single individual. The piece traces NASA's decline from its ambitious, government-funded golden age to an era where it rents rockets from private firms, a shift that rescued a near-bankrupt SpaceX. Now, Musk's vision of colonizing Mars, driven by personal ambition and apocalyptic fears, dictates America's goals in space, with his companies holding indispensable contracts for military and government launches. This privatization has raised concerns about the immense power wielded by one man over a critical national asset.</p>

          <p>As the use of GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy explodes, this article explores the significant unanswered questions about their long-term impact on the human brain and behavior. These medications work by affecting digestion and by disrupting dopamine pathways in the brain, which powerfully suppresses cravings for food, alcohol, and other compulsive behaviors. While this offers immense therapeutic potential, scientists remain uncertain about the broader consequences of modulating human desire. Key questions remain about whether these drugs could dampen productive motivations, alter emotional experiences, or have unforeseen effects on our personalities over decades of use.</p>

He has criticized Lombardo's response to a new federal law that introduces work requirements for Medicaid recipients. The race is expected to be highly competitive in the purple state, which often splits tickets and is considered one of five toss-up gubernatorial contests for 2026.</p>

The author draws parallels between the current enforcement tactics and the oppressive regime he escaped, creating terror within his community.

The investigation began when one of the women, a former forensic accountant, learned about the stalled case of an older couple's mysterious death from two decades prior. Over two and a half years, the amateur sleuths navigated dead ends and potential dangers to uncover the perpetrator. Their success not only brought closure to the case but also gave the women a new sense of purpose, and they are now tackling a second, more complex investigation.</p>

Since August 2024, the virus has impacted more than 75% of the state's dairy farms, causing steep declines in milk production, cattle deaths, and reproductive issues. The funds were provided through a USDA emergency assistance program, with payments expected to increase as more claims are processed.

The model predicts that the 15% tariff on most European goods will cause global exports to the U.S. to drop by over 46% by 2027 compared to the recent average. This is because countries are expected to rewire trade relationships away from the U.S. to avoid the new tariffs. As a result, China is projected to see a massive $485 billion decrease in its exports to the U.S., shifting its import focus toward countries like Russia and Vietnam. (not investment advice)</p>
