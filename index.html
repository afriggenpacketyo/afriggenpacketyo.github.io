          <p>The families of some British victims from the June 12 Air India crash have reportedly received misidentified remains, compounding their trauma. A lawyer representing over 20 families stated the errors were discovered by the London coroner's office during DNA verification checks after repatriation from India. One family had to cancel funeral plans after being informed the casket they brought home contained the remains of an unknown individual. The families are now demanding greater accountability and a more thorough explanation from Indian authorities.</p>

          <p>Demand for mortgages in the U.S. remained stagnant last week as the average contract interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage climbed to a four-week high of 6.84%. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, total application volume saw a negligible increase of 0.8%, with applications to refinance a home falling by 3%. While purchase applications rose slightly, the overall high-rate environment continues to suppress significant activity in the housing market, keeping many potential buyers and refinancers on the sidelines.

          <p>Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon have partnered to allow institutional clients to invest in money market funds with ownership recorded on a blockchain. This move aims to transform the $7.1 trillion money market industry by introducing the efficiency and speed of digital tokens. Unlike stablecoins, these tokenized funds offer a yield, making them an attractive option for corporations and hedge funds to park cash. The initiative, which already includes major players like BlackRock and Fidelity, seeks to enable seamless, real-time transactions and enhance the funds' use as collateral.

          <p>Erik Menendez, who is serving a prison sentence for the 1989 murders of his parents, has been hospitalized with a serious medical condition. His lawyer confirmed the development but did not provide specific details, though some outlets report a kidney issue. The hospitalization comes just weeks before he and his brother, Lyle, are scheduled for a parole hearing after their sentences were recently changed to 50-years-to-life. Menendez's lawyer has called for him to be granted a medical furlough to prepare for the hearing.</p>

State biologists and environmental experts claim that the payment model, which compensates contractors by the volume of debris removed, created an incentive to clear healthy trees and vital natural habitats. This approach allegedly did more harm to some river ecosystems than the storm itself, damaging habitats for endangered species like freshwater mussels and hellbender salamanders.</p>

Additionally, a set of moose antlers affixed to a wing strut created substantial aerodynamic drag.

          <h2>Data Analysis Shows Trump Administration Has Dramatically Increased Immigration Arrests</h2>

          <p>A new analysis of federal data reveals a massive surge in immigration enforcement under the Trump administration, with daily arrests by ICE increasing by 268% in June compared to the same month last year. The data shows that the crackdown is increasingly targeting immigrants with no criminal records, contradicting the administration's claims of focusing only on "dangerous criminals." This intensified enforcement has pushed the number of people in detention to record levels, with facilities now operating significantly over their funded capacity.</p>

          <p>The newly announced trade deal between the United States and Japan is signaling a fundamental shift in global trade dynamics, increasing pressure on other Asian nations to negotiate their own agreements with the U.S. Analysts observe that President Trump's tariff-focused agenda means even key allies are not exempt from tough negotiations. This new reality is expected to compel other major exporters in the region, such as South Korea, to accelerate their efforts to secure favorable trade terms and avoid potential new tariffs.

In response, consumers are altering their shopping habits by starting earlier, frequenting discount stores, and cutting back on nonessential purchases to manage the higher costs.

          <p>A cooling housing market, driven by high mortgage rates and hesitant buyers, is giving rise to a new trend of "accidental landlords." An increasing number of frustrated home sellers are choosing to de-list their properties and offer them on the rental market instead. This influx of new rental supply is creating direct competition for large institutional investors, particularly in Sun Belt markets like Atlanta and Dallas. The trend could potentially limit the ability of major landlords to implement significant rent increases in the near future.</p>

          <p>A political analysis in The Atlantic argues that President Trump's aggressive use of unilateral executive power has established a dangerous new precedent for American governance. The author contends that while a future Democratic president could theoretically use these same powers, the reality is that destroying institutions is far easier than rebuilding them. This dynamic creates a "ratchet of destruction," where the federal government is likely to experience volatile pendulum swings between administrations, ultimately favoring a conservative agenda of a smaller state.</p>

It was later sold and repurposed as a whaling ship before it was wrecked in a storm in 1788.

The EU's primary complaint is its massive €400 billion trade deficit, which it blames on China's protectionist policies and subsidized overproduction, especially of electric vehicles. Tensions are further inflamed by China's restrictions on rare earth mineral exports and recent EU sanctions against Chinese banks for allegedly helping Russia evade sanctions.</p>
