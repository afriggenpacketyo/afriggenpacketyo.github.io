          <p>Lt. Col. George Hardy, a highly decorated Tuskegee Airman, has died at 100, marking the loss of one of the last surviving members of the pioneering Black military pilot unit. Hardy was the youngest Red Tail fighter pilot to fly combat sorties over Europe in WWII, completing 21 missions, and later served in both the Korean and Vietnam Wars. After retiring as a lieutenant colonel in 1971, he dedicated his life to advocating for the Tuskegee Airmen's story, inspiring students with their legacy of courage, resilience, and perseverance against racism and prejudice. His impactful life underscored significant contributions to American military history and the fight for equality, leaving an indelible mark on generations through his advocacy and service.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party has pledged to commence construction on three new towns before the next general election, aiming to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. A taskforce identified Tempsford, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill as initial promising sites among 12 recommendations across England for development. These projects, each planned for at least 10,000 homes with 40% designated as affordable, will be overseen by a New Towns Unit to secure millions in public and private funding for essential services like GP surgeries, schools, and transport. The initiative, drawing inspiration from post-war Labour governments, seeks to address the nation's severe housing crisis and stimulate economic growth.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's global initiatives could represent the vital reform needed by the United Nations, which its General Assembly President described as being at a "make-it-or-break-it moment." The article critiques the UN's current state, highlighting contradictions from key member states like Germany and the US, which, despite advocating for peace, remain principal arms suppliers to conflict zones such as Gaza. It posits that the current system's enablers of destruction undermine the UN's credibility and calls for a reevaluation of global leadership. The author suggests that embracing new models, potentially from China, is crucial for the UN's survival and its ability to effectively address complex international challenges.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump posted an AI-generated cartoon on Truth Social depicting himself firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, amid persistent criticism of Powell's interest rate policies. Trump, who has previously nicknamed Powell "Too Late Powell," has consistently attacked the Fed's cautious approach to rate cuts, despite a recent reduction in rates. Firing a Fed chair is an unprecedented action and legally contentious, with a recent Supreme Court decision indicating the president lacks the authority to remove Fed officials at will. Economists and investors express concern that such a move could severely compromise the Federal Reserve's independence and potentially destabilize financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

Critics argue that such actions threaten the rule of law and could set a dangerous precedent for the weaponization of legal processes against political adversaries, potentially eroding public trust in governmental institutions. The indictment is widely interpreted as part of a broader strategy by Trump to pursue retribution against those he perceives as political enemies.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto has rapidly strengthened to a powerful Category 5 storm in the Atlantic, now boasting maximum sustained winds of 160 mph, and is projected to pass west of Bermuda as a major hurricane. While the U.S. has no immediate watches, dangerous swells are anticipated along the East Coast, causing life-threatening surf and rip currents. Concurrently, Tropical Depression Nine is developing over the northeast Caribbean, expected to intensify into a tropical storm and deliver significant rainfall to Cuba, the Bahamas, and potentially the southeast U.S. coastline early next week. Authorities emphasize the need for continuous monitoring of both systems as the Atlantic hurricane season remains active.</p>

          <p>Modular homebuilder Fading West is actively addressing the nationwide housing affordability crisis by constructing homes in a factory setting, claiming to reduce costs by up to 20% and halve delivery time compared to traditional on-site methods. The company's innovative manufacturing process allows for a 10-ton house to be completed in about seven days. This approach has already provided 82 modular homes for Lahaina wildfire victims in Hawaii, marking a first for FEMA, and is gaining traction in states like New York. Experts suggest modular construction can significantly increase productivity, reduce waste, and offer a more sustainable, less expensive, and better-built product, potentially restoring the American Dream of affordable homeownership.

The loan, underwritten through the Export Development Guarantee, aims to boost JLR's cash reserves for a backlog of supplier payments and protect thousands of skilled jobs.

          <p>California faces a significant housing shortage, a consensus point among lawmakers and academics, yet estimates of its precise scale vary wildly from 56,000 to 3.5 million units. This wide discrepancy stems from differing methodologies, including how researchers establish target vacancy rates, calculate "pent-up demand" from missing households, and define what constitutes "affordable housing." Data availability issues and the inherently localized nature of housing markets further complicate efforts to arrive at a precise statewide figure. Despite these varied estimates, experts uniformly agree the shortage is substantial, emphasizing the urgent need for extensive action and clear policy benchmarks to address the crisis and measure future progress.</p>

This settlement follows similar substantial payouts by Fox News and Newsmax to Dominion over their election claims.

          <p>England's Red Roses secured their third Women's Rugby World Cup title with a dominant 33-13 victory over Canada at Twickenham, played in front of a record-breaking women's rugby crowd of 81,885. Head coach John Mitchell believes the team, which has won 63 of its last 64 Test matches and extended their winning streak to 33 games, is now a "great side" capable of dominating world rugby for a long time. Captain Zoe Aldcroft expressed the team's unwavering belief in their victory and hoped their success would profoundly inspire young girls in sports.

          <p>The southeastern United States is bracing for significant impacts from Tropical Depression 9, which is expected to intensify into a tropical storm and potentially a hurricane, bringing heavy rainfall and widespread flooding. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency, urging residents to prepare for extensive wind, rain, and flooding across the entire state. The National Hurricane Center warns of potential flash, urban, and river flooding from coastal Georgia through the Carolinas and into the southern Mid-Atlantic states. This situation, coming a year after Hurricane Helene devastated the region, highlights increasing storm severity and frequency, which experts link to hotter ocean temperatures and climate change.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the declassification of all federal records pertaining to Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance, a mystery that has captivated the public for nearly 90 years. While the prevailing theory suggests Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan ran out of fuel and crashed near Howland Island, various alternative theories, including one about her being a spy captured by the Japanese, continue to circulate. A U.S. House delegate from the Northern Mariana Islands prompted Trump's order, citing "credible, firsthand accounts" of Earhart being spotted on Saipan. Despite a 1967 FBI review concluding no spy mission, Trump's move aims to provide transparency and potentially shed new light on the enduring aviation enigma.</p>

          <p>The FBI has reportedly fired between 15 to 20 agents who were pictured kneeling at a racial justice protest following George Floyd's death in 2020, with termination letters citing an alleged "lack of judgement." This action aligns with the Trump administration's broader efforts to purge perceived "woke" policies and officials from various parts of the federal government. While proponents argued that kneeling was a tactic to de-escalate tensions with protesters, critics on the right had condemned the gesture. The FBI Agents Association has condemned the dismissals, alleging violations of agents' rights and warning that such actions weaken the Bureau, making it harder to recruit and retain skilled personnel, ultimately increasing national security risk.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how President Trump's unprecedented willingness to openly discuss actions traditionally considered scandalous may be altering public perception of political misconduct. Observers suggest his brazen approach earns him perverse credit for authenticity and desensitizes the public, making once career-ending revelations less impactful. Examples include his explicit calls for legal action against opponents, his comments on firing James Comey, and his acceptance of a luxury plane from Qatar. Critics argue this normalization of behavior undermines the rule of law and neuters traditional checks and balances, while supporters view it as "honest lying" that resonates with their anti-establishment sentiment.</p>

          <p>A deadly shooting at a Dallas ICE field office tragically resulted in the death of 37-year-old detainee Norlan Guzman Fuentes and critically injured two other detainees. The shooter, identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after firing indiscriminately from a rooftop across the street. The FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted attack, with early evidence from shell casings suggesting explicit anti-ICE motives. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem condemned the violence, blaming anti-ICE rhetoric for the attack and ordering an immediate increase in security at ICE facilities nationwide. This incident marks the third attack on a Texas immigration facility this year, highlighting escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>Pakistan's national HPV vaccination campaign, a major public health initiative against cervical cancer, is encountering a significant surge of misinformation, including AI-generated videos and political rhetoric spreading false claims. DW Fact Check thoroughly debunked viral myths, confirming the vaccine's safety and effectiveness in preventing HPV infections and precancerous lesions, contrary to baseless claims of serious adverse reactions or infertility. This widespread skepticism is deeply rooted in Pakistan's history of vaccine mistrust, exacerbated by past incidents like violent attacks fueled by polio vaccine rumors and a covert CIA operation. Despite these considerable challenges, the government is pushing forward, with officials publicly vaccinating their children to build public trust.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Science found that chimpanzees regularly consume fermented fruit in the wild, ingesting significant amounts of alcohol equivalent to a human drinking over half a liter of beer daily. Researchers observed chimps in Ugandan and Ivory Coast national parks consuming fruit with an average alcohol content of 0.3%, with some fruits reaching up to 0.61%. This discovery challenges the long-held notion that regular alcohol consumption is solely a human cultural phenomenon, suggesting deeper evolutionary roots in our closest relatives. The findings echo previous studies and indicate that ethanol exposure is far more common in the natural world than previously thought, impacting various animal species.</p>
