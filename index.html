          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 02:57:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia has reportedly instructed component suppliers to halt production of its H20 general processing units, designed for the Chinese market. This decision follows reports that Beijing advised local tech firms against purchasing these chips, citing national security concerns about potential tracking technology or "backdoors." Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang confirmed ongoing discussions with Chinese authorities, denying the existence of any such features and expressing surprise at the queries. The development underscores the increasing difficulties for American chipmakers navigating complex trade relations and security scrutiny between Washington and Beijing, impacting Nvidia's significant business in the lucrative Chinese market. This situation reflects a broader trend of technological decoupling and national security priorities influencing global supply chains.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's Supreme Court has revised its earlier directive on stray dogs in New Delhi, now mandating that captured animals be sterilized and immunized before release, unless they exhibit rabies or aggressive behavior. This new order also instructs municipal bodies to establish designated feeding zones and warns of legal action against violators. The court's decision follows a previous August 11 ruling to remove 5,000 dogs from "high-risk areas," which had sparked widespread protests from animal rights activists who deemed it illogical, impractical, and inhumane. This updated approach seeks to balance public safety concerns, given nearly 2,000 daily dog bite incidents in New Delhi, with the ethical treatment and welfare of the city's large stray dog population.</p>

          <p>Millions of people across the UK are bracing for substantial travel disruption over the upcoming bank holiday weekend, the last long weekend before Christmas for many regions. This includes widespread rail strikes by the RMT union affecting CrossCountry routes, extensive engineering works on other lines, and forecasts of heavy road traffic, particularly on the M5 between Bristol and Devon. Major events like London's Notting Hill Carnival, Reading and Leeds festivals, and the Women's Rugby World Cup opener are expected to draw large crowds, further exacerbating congestion. Travelers are strongly advised to check their journeys before setting off, as delays and cancellations are anticipated across various transport networks.</p>

          <p>Speciality Steels UK (SSUK), the nation's third-largest steelworks and a component of Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty Steel empire, has been placed under government control following a compulsory winding-up order. Creditors, owed hundreds of millions, successfully argued the company was "hopelessly insolvent," with insufficient funds to cover its substantial monthly wage bill. The government has committed to covering ongoing wages and costs for the nearly 1,500 workers in Rotherham and Sheffield while an independent liquidator seeks a new buyer. This intervention aims to secure the future of a strategically important industry, which has faced challenges from high energy prices and international competition, preventing immediate job losses and ensuring continued steel production.</p>

Conversely, automotive stocks declined as the reduction of duties on European car exports was made conditional on Brussels lowering its own industrial tariffs, creating uncertainty. Traders are also closely monitoring upcoming economic data, including French business confidence, German GDP figures, and the UK's consumer confidence update, all contributing to a cautious and mixed market sentiment.

          <p>Hurricane Erin, currently a Category 1 storm, is moving away from the northeastern U.S. coast but continues to generate dangerous rip currents and rough surf along nearly the entire East Coast for several days. The storm, which briefly intensified to a Category 5 before weakening, still brings tropical storm-force gusts to Nantucket, Massachusetts, and Bermuda, where a tropical storm warning remains in effect. Although Erin is not forecast to make direct U.S. landfall, forecasters warn of life-threatening ocean conditions, with waves of 15-20 feet expected in some areas. Authorities have already ordered evacuations for parts of the Outer Banks and prohibited swimming at various beaches, urging the public to heed local warnings and exercise extreme caution.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate eased to 3.1% in July, a slight decrease from 3.3% in June, marking its lowest level since March but still surpassing economists' expectations of 3%. Headline inflation also dropped to 3.1%, the lowest since November 2024. Notably, rice inflation showed signs of easing, decelerating to 90.7% after two months of more than doubling, contributing to the overall moderation. Despite this cooling, the 3.1% reading marks the 40th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, prompting some experts to suggest the BOJ is "behind the curve" in raising interest rates, potentially impacting purchasing power.

          <p>Aid workers have accused international humanitarian organizations of "whitewashing" Israel's war in Gaza by restricting public language and toning down criticism, fearing repercussions from a new Israeli NGO registration process. This process demands sensitive personal data of Palestinian staff and allows denial of permits to organizations supporting legal action against Israeli soldiers or boycotts, creating a "chilling effect" on the sector. Many NGOs are reportedly self-censoring to maintain operational access, but some workers feel this compromises their advocacy and misrepresents the grim reality in Gaza, where over 62,000 people have been killed.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lauded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) as one of "humanity's greatest companies," suggesting that investing in its stock would be "very smart." Huang's comments, made during a visit to Taiwan, come as Nvidia reportedly asked suppliers to halt production of its China-bound H20 AI chips due to Beijing's security concerns. Despite the U.S. administration's interest in taking equity stakes in chip companies receiving CHIPS Act funding, a Wall Street Journal report clarified there are no plans for shares in firms expanding U.S. investments like TSMC. Huang also discussed Nvidia's plans for a new Taiwan office to support its growing workforce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India and Russia have committed to expanding bilateral trade ties, signaling their defiance of U.S. tariff pressure on New Delhi over its substantial Russian oil imports. Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar emphasized the "steadiest" nature of their relationship, while Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov noted "wide strides" in hydrocarbon cooperation. Plans include boosting India's exports of pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and textiles to Russia to reduce a significant trade deficit, and sending Indian workers to address Russia's labor shortages. This partnership continues despite Western sanctions on Moscow, with India asserting its purchases were requested by the U.S. to stabilize markets, underscoring geopolitical complexities and economic resilience.

          <p>Chocolate lovers face continued price increases due to a lagged impact from soaring cocoa prices, which hit record highs last year amid adverse weather conditions, pest outbreaks, and supply tightness in West Africa. Retailers are still grappling with these elevated costs, which are being passed on to consumers, contributing to significant inflation in sweet treats globally. However, the outlook for next year, particularly by the busy Easter season, appears more optimistic. Softening industrial demand and improving supply from new plantings in Ecuador and Brazil are expected to ease cocoa prices, though they are likely to remain structurally higher at around $6,000 per metric ton.

Kallas stressed the critical need for "credible and robust" security guarantees for Ukraine, emphasizing that the strongest guarantee is a strong Ukrainian army and that these guarantees must be more than "just on paper." Her comments follow recent White House peace talks involving EU leaders and Ukraine, and a separate meeting between former President Trump and Russian President Putin, which Kallas believes only emboldened Putin and yielded no concessions from Russia, leading to increased violence.</p>

          <p>Thailand's former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been cleared of royal defamation (lese majeste) charges by a Bangkok court, narrowly avoiding a potential 15-year prison sentence. Prosecutors had accused Thaksin of breaching the strict lese majeste law, which criminalizes criticism of the monarchy, with remarks made in a 2015 interview regarding the 2014 coup. His legal team successfully argued that his comments were misinterpreted, leading to a rare acquittal in such a case, as acquittals are uncommon in Thailand. This verdict significantly eases a major legal threat to Thaksin, who remains a central figure in Thai politics, and to his family's influential political movement, led by his daughter, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to cancel National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants related to diversity, gender identity, vaccine hesitancy, COVID, and climate change. In a 5-4 decision, the high court lifted a lower court order that had required the NIH to restore hundreds of these grants, though the legal challenge will continue. This ruling enables the administration to pull back awards it deems misaligned with its policy objectives, despite arguments from 16 states and research groups that the cancellations were unlawful and would cause "incalculable losses" in public health. This decision marks a significant win for the administration's efforts to redirect federal funding away from DEI-related initiatives.</p>

          <p>A new international study has uncovered a fascinating communication mechanism in corn plants, revealing they interact with neighbors by releasing linalool, a gas that prompts nearby plants to alter their soil environment. This discovery, published in the peer-reviewed journal Science, offers crucial insights into plant-to-plant communication and its ecological implications. Researchers found that densely planted corn suffered less herbivore damage than those at the edges but also experienced reduced growth, suggesting a trade-off in defense and development. Optimizing the release of linalool could potentially be leveraged for improved pest control and increased crop yields, offering significant advancements for sustainable agricultural practices and food security.</p>
