          <h2>Germany Addresses Illegal Waste Dumping in Czech Republic</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German and Czech authorities are collaborating to clean up illegally dumped waste in the Czech municipality of Jirikov, which includes hazardous materials like fiberglass and car batteries. The waste was initially disguised as recyclable plastic by a German company, but a vigilant mayor uncovered the deception and halted further dumping. Investigations led to the detention of a German waste management CEO and a Czech truck driver, with authorities suspecting this isn't an isolated incident. With the responsible company insolvent, the state of Bavaria is funding the cleanup, and soil and water samples will be analyzed for environmental damage once the waste is removed. The incident has highlighted the need for stronger cross-border cooperation and accountability to prevent such environmental crimes, with EU-wide digital documentation scheduled to be implemented next year. Optimism for the future lies in stricter penalties and investments in safe treatment capacity to deter companies from exploiting loopholes. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Baroness Doreen Lawrence is appealing to witnesses to provide information regarding her son Stephen's murder, as a new review commences following a BBC investigation. This review, conducted independently by the College of Policing, aims to identify any missed or improperly pursued lines of inquiry in the case. Baroness Lawrence emphasizes that this is the last opportunity to achieve full justice for Stephen, who was killed in a racist attack in 1993. The review was initiated after BBC reports named a sixth suspect and exposed police failings, leading to an apology from the Met Commissioner. The Met said its objective remains "to achieve the arrest, prosecution and conviction of all of those responsible for Stephen's murder".</p>

          <p>SK Hynix has announced its readiness for mass production of its next-generation high-bandwidth memory (HBM4) chips, positioning itself ahead of competitors like Samsung and Micron. HBM chips are crucial for AI computing, including Nvidia's AI chips, a major client for SK Hynix. The company's HBM4 chips offer doubled bandwidth and increased power efficiency compared to previous generations, making them suitable for Nvidia's next-generation Rubin architecture. This announcement has driven SK Hynix shares to their highest level since 2000, with the company expecting to double HBM sales for the year, fueled by growing AI demand. Despite competition, SK Hynix is expected to maintain a significant share of the HBM market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a tumultuous week marked by the dismissal of Lord Mandelson and the resignation of Angela Rayner, Labour MPs are reportedly feeling "despondent," according to Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander. Sir Keir Starmer faces scrutiny over Mandelson's appointment as ambassador to the US, given his connections to Jeffrey Epstein. The government dismissed Mandelson after new information surfaced about their friendship, prompting a search for a new ambassador ahead of President Trump's visit. Some Labour MPs have voiced anger over the handling of the Mandelson situation, while opposition parties call for a review of vetting procedures.</p>

          <h2>Cost of Children's Homes Doubles, Care Quality Questioned</h2>

          <p>A report reveals that the cost of residential care for vulnerable children in England has nearly doubled in five years, yet many children still do not receive adequate care. Councils are spending significant amounts on each child placed in care, but the system is described as "dysfunctional." The report highlights concerns about rising costs, a profit-driven market, and the placement of children far from their local communities. The Department for Education acknowledges the issues and plans reforms to improve children's social care.</p>

The crackdown on undocumented workers contradicts the goal of reshoring manufacturing and creating high-paying jobs. The article questions the feasibility of implementing industrial policy in a post-industrial America, given labor shortages and the need for skilled workers. The author suggests that Washington's attempt to contain China and reindustrialise will hurt US and its allies more, while disrupting globalisation and world trade.</p>

          <p>The California Assembly passed Senate Bill 79, a controversial housing bill that would expand high-density housing near public transit hubs, overriding local zoning laws. The bill allows for taller, denser housing near transit corridors, potentially altering single-family neighborhoods. Supporters argue it's necessary to address the state's affordability crisis, while critics claim it strips local authorities of control. The bill now heads to the Senate for a final vote and then to the Governor for signature. The vote came a few weeks after the Los Angeles City Council came out against the bill.</p>
