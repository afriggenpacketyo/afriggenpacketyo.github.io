          <p>Nicole Kidman's famous six-word remark, "Well, I can wear heels now," delivered to David Letterman in 2001 after her divorce from Tom Cruise, has resurfaced and gone viral. This quip, highlighting their height difference, gained renewed attention following her recent split from Keith Urban after 19 years of marriage. Kidman filed for divorce on September 30, citing "irreconcilable differences" and "marital difficulties." The news comes as Urban notably altered a song lyric during a recent concert, further fueling public discussion around the end of their high-profile relationship.</p>

          <p>The UK Conservative Party has unveiled a new borders plan, pledging to remove 750,000 illegal immigrants from the country within five years if they win the next election. This ambitious proposal includes banning asylum claims for individuals entering without permission and transferring appeal processes from courts to Home Office officials. The plan also involves doubling funding for a rebranded "Removals Force" to £1.6 billion annually, aiming for 150,000 removals each year. This initiative, announced at their annual conference, is designed to tighten immigration controls and may involve ending the UK's membership in the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

          <p>Nearly 500 individuals were arrested in central London during a protest supporting Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed by the government. The demonstrations proceeded despite urgent calls from ministers and police to postpone them in the wake of a deadly synagogue attack in Manchester. Organizers, however, asserted the importance of continuing to grieve for both the Manchester victims and the hundreds of thousands affected in Gaza. Police deployed a significant force of 1,500 officers, with the majority of arrests occurring in Trafalgar Square for supporting a proscribed organization, highlighting escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>Iran executed six death-row inmates, alleging they conducted attacks in the country's oil-rich southwest on behalf of Israel. These executions are part of a broader wave of capital punishments, believed to be the highest in decades, following a recent Iran-Israel conflict. Human rights activists, however, warn that Iran frequently relies on coerced confessions and closed-door trials in such cases, particularly those involving accusations of links to foreign entities. The individuals, identified as "Arab political prisoners," were accused of connections to the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahvaz.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker announced that the Trump administration intends to federalize 300 Illinois National Guard members, rejecting an ultimatum to deploy state troops for immigration operations. Pritzker vehemently condemned the federal directive as "outrageous and un-American," asserting that it represents a "manufactured performance" for control rather than a genuine effort to protect public safety. This political clash follows recent confrontations between protesters and federal agents in Broadview, Illinois, and the governor's earlier call for the 25th Amendment to be invoked against the President, underscoring escalating tensions over federal overreach.</p>
