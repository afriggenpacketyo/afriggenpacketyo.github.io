        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lululemon's shares experienced a significant drop in after-hours trading following the release of a disappointing full-year earnings forecast. While the company's second-quarter earnings surpassed estimates, revenue fell slightly short, and it cited the impact of tariffs as a major factor in reducing its profit guidance. The athletic apparel retailer also acknowledged that some of its product lines have become "stale" and are no longer resonating with consumers. This outlook suggests challenges ahead for the company as it navigates economic pressures and evolving customer preferences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated a legal battle over executive power by asking the U.S. Supreme Court to allow the firing of Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter. This move follows lower court rulings that reinstated Slaughter, arguing that FTC commissioners can only be removed for specific cause, such as malfeasance. The White House contends that the president has the authority to remove heads of executive agencies, citing recent Supreme Court precedents in its favor. The case represents a significant challenge to the independence of federal regulatory bodies and the scope of presidential authority over them.</p>

          <p>Northwestern University President Michael Schill has announced his resignation after a turbulent three-year tenure. His leadership was marked by contentious campus protests over the war in Gaza and significant financial pressure from the Trump administration, which froze nearly $790 million in federal research funding. Schill defended his decision to negotiate a peaceful end to a pro-Palestinian encampment, a move criticized by some as antisemitic. The funding cuts have created anxiety and directly impacted student research, highlighting the intense political and financial challenges facing higher education institutions.</p>

          <p>Broadcom reported strong fiscal third-quarter results, driven by a significant 63% increase in revenue from its artificial intelligence products, which reached $5.2 billion. The company's overall revenue and earnings per share surpassed Wall Street estimates, and it provided an optimistic forecast for the current quarter. The growth is largely attributed to demand for its custom AI accelerators and networking components from major cloud companies. Broadcom's performance highlights its strengthening position in the competitive AI chip market, with investors seeing it as a potential challenger to Nvidia's dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's white-ball cricket team suffered a series defeat against South Africa following a narrow five-run loss in the second one-day international at Lord's. Chasing a target of 331, England fell just short, finishing on 325-9 despite strong performances from Joe Root and Jos Buttler. The loss marks England's fifth defeat in six ODI series since the 2023 World Cup, continuing a period of poor form for the team. The final match of the series will be played in Southampton, where England will aim to avoid a clean sweep.</p>

          <p>Activist and attorney Malik Shabazz is organizing opposition to the Trump administration's federal takeover of law enforcement in Washington, D.C. In social media posts, Shabazz called for a ceasefire among local gangs, urging them to recognize the federal forces as the "real enemy" and to unite to protect their community. Shabazz, a controversial figure with a history of antisemitic rhetoric, is offering legal assistance to residents who feel their rights have been violated by National Guard troops and police. The Department of Homeland Security condemned the calls as disgusting and warned against any violence toward law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The start of the new academic year is causing increased anxiety for mixed-status families, where children are U.S. citizens but parents are undocumented. Many of these families are living in a state of fear, restricting their activities and worrying about potential encounters with immigration enforcement, even near schools. While schools are generally considered sensitive locations, reports of parents being detained nearby have instilled a deep sense of insecurity. This climate of fear impacts student attendance and well-being, forcing families to make difficult decisions about their children's education and safety.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has permitted Florida's controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention facility to continue operating, pausing a lower court's order to dismantle it. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that the site, located in the Everglades, is likely not subject to federal environmental reviews because it is state-operated. Environmental groups had sued, arguing the facility's construction violated federal law.

The decision comes amid a national trend of rising non-medical vaccine exemptions and declining vaccination rates since the pandemic.

This rule provides a tangible way to set savings goals by breaking down a large retirement target into smaller, more manageable monthly income amounts.

While the software giant's second-quarter sales and earnings exceeded expectations, its third-quarter guidance fell short of analyst predictions. The company has not benefited from the AI boom to the same extent as its infrastructure-focused peers, and it faces challenges in its marketing and commerce product segments. CEO Marc Benioff remained optimistic, dismissing concerns about AI's threat to the software-as-a-service industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James is asking the state's highest court to reinstate the massive financial penalty against President Donald Trump in his civil fraud case. Her office filed an appeal after a mid-level appellate court eliminated the fine, which was over $500 million with interest, ruling it violated the constitutional ban on excessive fines. That same court, however, upheld the trial's finding that Trump had committed fraud. Trump's legal team is also appealing other punishments from the ruling, including a ban on him holding corporate leadership positions in New York.</p>

          <p>In his new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," neurosurgeon and CNN correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the complex nature of pain and its treatment. He discusses how the brain processes pain signals, sometimes making mistakes like phantom limb pain, and how it can be trained to minimize discomfort through techniques like meditation and distraction. Gupta also examines the body's natural opioid system, which can be activated by actively savoring pleasurable experiences. The book aims to provide a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing pain, from its biological origins to non-medicinal coping strategies.</p>
