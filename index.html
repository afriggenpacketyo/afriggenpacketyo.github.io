          <p>The Trump administration canceled at least 350 Harvard Medical School grants, impacting research on diseases like tuberculosis, Alzheimer's, and ALS, citing concerns about antisemitism and DEI practices at the university. Scientists express devastation, noting the years of work required to secure these grants and the potential impact on scientific breakthroughs. Researchers are worried about the future of their work and the potential loss of talented scientists to other countries. The cuts have affected researchers studying biotic resistance, precursors to breast cancer, and barriers to delivering drugs for Alzheimer's disease.</p>

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem urged Polish voters to elect a right-wing presidential candidate, while Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is positioning himself as a recipient of MAGA soft power. These events occur as transatlantic relations face peril due to Trump's planned tariffs on EU goods, potentially souring ties between the MAGA movement and its foreign allies.

Some students are considering alternative study destinations like Hong Kong or the U.K., while others express anger and disappointment, feeling betrayed by what they believed the U.S. stood for.

          <p>President Donald Trump commuted the federal prison sentence of Larry Hoover, the founder of the Gangster Disciples, who was serving six life sentences for conspiracy, extortion, and drug charges. Despite the commutation, Hoover still faces a 200-year jail term in Illinois for murder, making his release unlikely, as a president is unable to commute state-level sentences. Hoover's lawyer expressed hope that Illinois would send him home for good. While some view Hoover as reformed, authorities allege he continued to lead the gang from prison, raising questions about his true intentions.</p>

          <p>Nvidia shares surged in premarket trading after reporting better-than-expected earnings and revenue, despite challenges from U.S. export restrictions to China.

Nvidia is seen as a bellwether for the broader semiconductor industry and artificial intelligence-related stocks, and its strong results boosted investor confidence.

          <p>The New York Times editorial board argues that President Trump should increase pressure on Russia and Ukraine to agree to a cease-fire deal. While acknowledging Trump's problematic approach to the war, the board agrees with his assessment that the continuing conflict is a tragedy and that ending it could benefit both countries' economies. The editorial suggests a potential deal where Russia retains control of territory in eastern and southern Ukraine, while the West lifts sanctions and integrates Ukraine into the European economy. The board emphasizes the need for Trump to demonstrate resolve against Putin to achieve a successful outcome.</p>

Kendi argues that the Trump administration is systematically attacking Black history by purging content from government websites, removing books from libraries, and cutting funding to historical institutions. He draws parallels to the Atlanta Race Massacre of 1906, where false narratives fueled violence against Black Atlantans. Kendi contends that Trump's actions aim to erase the historical record of racial inequity and injustice, undermining the opportunity for Americans to understand the enduring impact of anti-Black racist policies. He emphasizes the importance of preserving Black history to recognize Black ingenuity and the benefits of Black-led antiracist movements.</p>

          <p>Motown legend Smokey Robinson filed a $500 million defamation lawsuit against four former housekeepers who have accused him of sexual assault, denying all allegations. The lawsuit claims the women fabricated the allegations as part of an "extortionate" lawsuit, and his lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the women's lawsuit, arguing they should not have been granted anonymity. The women allege several incidents dating back to 2006 and seek at least $50 million in damages and a jury trial. Robinson, who is also under criminal investigation, said he welcomed the investigation as exposure to the truth is powerful.</p>

          <p>Financial markets responded positively to a U.S. court ruling that blocked President Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs on imports, with U.S. futures jumping and oil prices rising. The court found that the law Trump cited did not authorize the use of tariffs, but the White House immediately appealed. Despite the uncertain long-term outcome, investors took heart after months of turmoil caused by the trade war. The ruling also pushed the dollar sharply higher against the Japanese yen, and the Bank of Korea's decision to cut its key interest rate further boosted the market.</p>

          <p>Chinese startup DeepSeek quietly released an upgraded version of its R1 reasoning model, marking its first revision since its high-profile debut in January. The company did not make an official announcement, but the upgrade of DeepSeek R1 was released on AI model repository Hugging Face. DeepSeek rose to prominence this year after its free, open-source R1 reasoning model outperformed offerings from rivals including Meta and OpenAI. The upgraded DeepSeek R1 model is just behind OpenAI's o4-mini and o3 reasoning models on LiveCodeBench.</p>
