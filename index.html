          <h2>Tesla's European Car Sales Decline Amid Shift to Chinese EVs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-25 10:20:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's European car sales have experienced a fifth consecutive month of decline, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA), with a 27.9% year-on-year drop in May, totaling 13,863 units. This downturn has also resulted in a decrease in Tesla's European market share, falling from 1.8% in May 2024 to 1.2%. The decline is attributed to increasing competition from traditional automakers and the growing popularity of cheaper Chinese electric vehicles like BYD, which nearly matched Tesla's sales in May. CEO Elon Musk's political activities and rhetoric have also contributed to brand and reputational damage, further impacting sales, despite hopes that the revamped Model Y SUV would boost the company's performance. The stock is down more than 18% year-to-date.</p>

          <p>Thomas Robinson, operating as The Wee Tea Plantation, has been sentenced to three-and-a-half years in jail for defrauding luxury hotels and stores by selling tea falsely advertised as "Scottish-grown." Robinson deceived high-end establishments like Edinburgh's Balmoral Hotel and London's Dorchester Hotel, supplying them with tea that was actually sourced from a wholesaler in Oxford and resold at inflated prices. He also defrauded aspiring tea growers by selling them plants falsely claimed to be engineered for Scotland's climate, when they were simply imported from Italy. The scam, which spanned five years, involved Robinson creating an elaborate backstory and false credentials, including claims of being a former bomb disposal expert and inventor.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, at a news conference during the NATO summit in the Netherlands, celebrated the commitment of NATO allies to increase their defense spending. Trump announced that allies agreed to raise defense spending to 5% of their GDP, a goal previously deemed unattainable. This agreement, known as "The Hague Defense Commitment," is projected to add over $1 trillion annually toward common defense. Trump hailed the agreement as a monumental win for the United States, which he said was previously carrying more than its fair share, and for Europe and Western civilization.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A preliminary assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) suggests that the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have temporarily hindered Tehran's nuclear program, setting it back by several months. The strikes sealed off entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities, including Fordo, and the resumption of the enrichment program hinges on how quickly Iran can clear the entrances and repair essential utilities. The assessment also indicates that some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes occurred. Despite President Trump's claims of "total obliteration," the DIA notes that the underground enrichment infrastructure remains largely intact, though the White House has disputed these findings.</p>

          <p>Japan and NATO have agreed to collaborate closely on issues such as the Middle East crisis, the war in Ukraine, and North Korea's abductions of Japanese nationals. The Bank of Japan may further raise interest rates to counter elevated prices, despite uncertainty caused by U.S. tariff policy. The Philippines plans to acquire five more air surveillance radar systems to enhance its defense capabilities against China's activities in the South China Sea. The UN will reduce staff by 20% and consider realigning institutions due to funding cuts from the United States.</p>

          <p>Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) has criticized Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s appointments to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), noting that many appointees lack significant experience in microbiology, epidemiology, or immunology. Cassidy expressed concern that some appointees may have a preconceived bias against mRNA vaccines and suggested delaying the ACIP conference until the panel is fully staffed with more balanced representation. This criticism comes after Kennedy fired all 17 members of ACIP and replaced them with individuals including vaccine critics, a move that has drawn widespread condemnation from the medical and scientific community.</p>

Allies will submit annual plans to demonstrate progress toward this goal, following pushback from some member states.

Veterans are preparing to launch civil legal action against the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to access their medical records, which they claim are being illegally withheld.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) recommends booster shots for at-risk groups and those in high-risk settings, while also advising testing for individuals experiencing worsening symptoms.
