          <p>Actor Josh Duhamel shared insights into his "doomsday cabin" in Minnesota, revealing he is about 70% prepared for a global catastrophe. He admitted needing to improve his hunting and fishing skills and stockpile more food. Duhamel, who moved off-grid years ago, values the rustic lifestyle as a respite from technology and artificial intelligence, emphasizing a return to basic skills and family time over strict doomsday prepping.</p>

          <p>A UK-based report commissioned by the Australian government found that implementing a social media ban for under-16s is technically possible using various age verification methods, but all carry risks. While identity document verification is most accurate, it raises privacy concerns. Facial assessment technology has a "buffer zone" around age 16, leading to potential inaccuracies. The government plans to enforce the ban by December, with platforms facing significant fines for non-compliance, aiming to protect children despite privacy and access concerns.</p>

Founded in 2001 as a Eurasian security bloc, the SCO has expanded to include 10 member states and now addresses trade and economic issues, positioning itself as an Asian counterweight to Western influence. Leaders are expected to sign a declaration to enhance security, economic, and cultural cooperation, reflecting the bloc's growing regional importance.</p>

          <p>A new book about the Royal Family claims Queen Camilla was the victim of an attempted sexual assault as a teenager, which she reportedly thwarted using her shoe. The incident, said to have occurred on a train to Paddington Station when she was 16 or 17, was later reported to station staff, leading to an arrest. Buckingham Palace has not disputed the account, and sources suggest that if public discussion of this experience helps destigmatize such incidents, it would be a positive outcome from a negative event.</p>

          <p>BYD's Hong Kong-listed shares dropped by nearly 8% after the Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer reported a 30% decrease in quarterly profits compared to the previous year. This decline occurred despite an expansion in overseas sales, primarily attributed to an aggressive price war within its domestic market.

          <h2>Illinois Governor Criticizes Potential Trump Military Deployment to Chicago as "Invasion"</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker strongly criticized the Trump administration's reported plans to send military forces to Chicago, labeling it an "invasion" and suggesting ulterior motives beyond crime reduction. Pritzker argued that such a deployment would be "an attack on the American people" and potentially aimed at influencing future elections. White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson rejected Pritzker's accusations, blaming Chicago's crime rate. This political clash highlights growing tensions between state and federal authorities over the use of military force in domestic affairs.</p>

          <p>Canadensys Aerospace is developing Canada's first lunar rover, a key part of NASA's Artemis program aimed at establishing a sustainable human presence on the Moon. Scheduled for a 2029 launch to the Moon's south polar region, the 35kg rover will search for water, measure radiation, and demonstrate Canadian technology, building on the nation's space history. Engineers face significant challenges, including extreme lunar temperatures and abrasive regolith, as water discovery could enable the Moon to become a "petrol station" for future deep-space exploration.</p>

          <p>The United States has reportedly suspended visa approvals for nearly all Palestinian passport holders, extending beyond previous restrictions on visitors from Gaza. This measure, which prevents Palestinians from traveling to the US for medical treatment, education, or business, further aligns the Trump administration with Israel's right-wing government. The State Department confirmed halting visitor visas for Gaza residents and denying/revoking visas for PLO and PA members ahead of the UN assembly, citing national security interests and undermining peace prospects.</p>

          <p>England has launched the final phase of its largest-ever publicly funded childcare expansion, offering 30 hours per week for children aged nine months to four years. While this provides significant savings for working parents, many nurseries face long waiting lists and staff shortages, limiting availability. The government has increased staff numbers and offered incentives, but retention remains a challenge, and funding rates for providers are often below costs, leading to increased fees and concerns about regional inequalities and the impact on women returning to work.</p>

          <p>The global craze for matcha, driven by its superfood reputation and post-pandemic tourism, has led to soaring demand and supply shortages, even in Japan. Exports of green tea, particularly powdered matcha, have quadrupled in a decade, with the US being the largest market. This boom has caused tencha prices to jump significantly, prompting the Japanese government to consider subsidizing farmers to increase production. However, labor-intensive cultivation and milling processes create bottlenecks, and retailers are rationing supply amidst worries of future harvest impacts from record heatwaves.
