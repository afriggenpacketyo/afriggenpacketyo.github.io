          <p>Sources reported that the Trump administration is restructuring the National Security Council (NSC), reducing its size and scope. This comes weeks after President Trump appointed Marco Rubio as national security advisor, replacing Mike Waltz. The restructuring involves moving some NSC staff to other positions within the administration, with Vice President JD Vance's national security advisor, Andy Baker, taking on a prominent role. The NSC's communications team is also being dissolved as part of the changes, raising concerns about reduced control over bureaucracy.

          <p>Yasmina Asrarguis reflects on the life and tragic death of Sarah Milgrim, who was murdered outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., in what authorities have called a politically motivated, antisemitic attack.

Asrarguis stresses that Milgrim's legacy should not be co-opted for political gain or used as a rallying cry, but rather remembered for her commitment to shared humanity and the pursuit of a peaceful Middle East.</p>

          <p>The use of facial recognition technology in the manhunt for escaped inmates in New Orleans has ignited controversy, with authorities using cameras run by Project N.O.L.A. to aid in recapturing fugitives.

The ACLU has criticized the use of live facial recognition as a radical escalation of surveillance power, while some Republicans in Congress have also expressed opposition.

          <p>President Trump announced a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, projecting the creation of 70,000 jobs and a $14 billion boost to the U.S. economy.

The United Steelworkers union remains opposed to the deal, expressing concerns about job security and the impact on domestic steel-making capacity. The deal would allow U.S. Steel to keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh, and investors reacted positively, with shares of the company jumping more than 21 percent.</p>

The Media Research Center (MRC) Free Speech America project highlighted that Gemini suggested Memorial Day is controversial due to issues with "inclusivity and representation" during the Jim Crow era. Gemini also claimed that Memorial Day is intertwined with national identity and patriotism, which can be complex for individuals with differing perspectives on American history and foreign policy. While Gemini acknowledged the holiday's primary purpose is to honor fallen U.S. military personnel, it noted that the history contains elements viewed through the lens of race.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Japan-based Nippon Steel, stating that U.S. Steel will keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh. The announcement comes after the Biden administration blocked Nippon Steel's bid to buy U.S. Steel. The deal is expected to create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. U.S. Steel praised Trump's leadership, while Nippon Steel applauded his bold action to approve the partnership.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally accused Columbia University of violating federal civil rights law by failing to protect Jewish students, intensifying its targeting of the institution. The move comes as the White House intensifies its crackdown on colleges that refuse to follow its agenda. The administration accused Columbia of breaching Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits recipients of federal funds from engaging in discriminatory behavior. The administration had previously suspended more than $400 million in research funding to Columbia.</p>

These cuts are intended to help pay for tax perks, primarily for the wealthy, that are included in the bill. One way House Republicans are seeking to curb the programs' spending is through new work requirements.</p>

One order directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to streamline its rules and expedite the approval process for new reactors. The administration also set a goal of quadrupling the size of the nation's fleet of nuclear power plants by 2050. The executive orders also call on the secretary of energy to develop a plan to rebuild U.S. supplies of enriched uranium and other nuclear fuels.</p>

          <p>A Georgia man once viewed as a "grieving husband" has been charged in his wife's killing 19 years after fleeing the U.S. with the couple's nanny. Jon Worrell was jailed on murder charges after investigators got a break in the cold case when the nanny, now living in Costa Rica, agreed to talk. Worrell had called police in 2006, saying he found his wife's body at their business. Theories evolved as investigators learned Worrell was having an affair with the nanny at the time of his wife's death and that he fled to Costa Rica, where he and the nanny spent years living together.</p>

Arevalo-Chavez has intimate knowledge of the secretive pact, which involved Bukele's government ceding money and territory to the gang in exchange for reduced violence and electoral support.
