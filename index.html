          <p>The Department of Justice and the SEC have charged two men in connection with a massive Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors, including military veterans, of over $200 million. The scheme involved selling water vending machines that often did not exist and using new investor funds to pay returns to earlier investors. One man, the former owner of Water Station Management, is accused of raising the funds, while a former fund portfolio manager is accused of concealing his financial stake and knowledge of the fraud. Both individuals face up to 20 years in prison if convicted on the federal charges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to block a Mississippi law requiring age verification for social media use, allowing it to go into effect temporarily. The law is broader than a recent Texas ruling on sexually explicit sites, applying to common platforms like Facebook and Instagram and requiring parental consent for minors. Tech industry group NetChoice challenged the law, arguing it unconstitutionally restricts free speech by limiting access to a wide range of information. Although Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted the law is likely unconstitutional, the court denied the request for interim relief, citing procedural grounds.</p>

          <p>Target and Ulta Beauty have announced the end of their partnership, which established Ulta beauty shops within hundreds of Target stores, by August 2026. The collaboration, launched in 2021, was a key strategy for Target to drive store traffic and boost its beauty category sales. The dissolution of the deal is seen as a setback for Target, which has faced declining sales, a significant drop in stock value, and controversy over its DEI initiatives. Analysts suggest that operational issues and retail theft at Target may have contributed to the decision to end the partnership.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club is selling its entire stake in Coterra Energy, citing the company's struggles in the current economic environment. Originally held as a hedge against energy price spikes, the investment has underperformed due to unfavorable commodity price dynamics for both oil and natural gas. The club notes that Coterra's strategy of shifting between the two resources has not been effective this year. The decision to sell, resulting in an approximate 8% loss, was also influenced by potential geopolitical shifts that could further weaken energy prices. (not investment advice)</p>

Newly public documents also reveal Richardson was considered a suspect in the investigation as recently as 2022. Price has pleaded not guilty to all charges, and his defense has questioned the legality of the grand jury proceedings.</p>

          <p>A hiker has died in Tennessee's Savage Gulf State Park following a bite from a venomous snake, believed to be a timber rattlesnake. According to officials, a witness reported that the man had picked up the snake, which then bit him on the hand. First responders transported him to a hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries, possibly due to an allergic reaction. Officials emphasized that while tragic, bites from timber rattlesnakes are rare, and fatalities are even rarer, urging the public to avoid handling wildlife and seek immediate medical attention if bitten.</p>

          <p>German soccer club Bayern Munich has ended its "Visit Rwanda" branding deal, a partnership that drew criticism from fans and human rights activists due to Rwanda's alleged role in the conflict in DR Congo. Instead of citing human rights, the club described the change as a "strategic evolution," now focusing on a youth soccer academy in Kigali. Experts suggest that sustained external pressure from the fan base forced the club's hand. Despite this change, Bayern Munich has faced further scrutiny for signing a new deal with Emirates Airlines, another partner with a questionable human rights record.</p>

The high-end market appears weakest, with only one car estimated above $10 million, a significant drop from previous years. Experts attribute the slowdown to a generational shift, as aging baby boomer collectors are replaced by younger millennials and Gen Zers who prefer newer, more practical, and affordable collectible cars from the 1980s and beyond. This trend is causing prices for pre-1970s vehicles to fall while demand for modern supercars soars. (not investment advice)</p>

The author, Rebecca Solnit, contrasts the action, justified by false claims of high crime, with the violence of the January 6th Capitol riot, which Trump instigated. The article posits that conservatives attack diverse, progressive cities to justify authoritarian control and that this move is a distraction from other issues.

          <p>While President Trump has deployed the National Guard in Washington, D.C., and placed its police under federal supervision, legal experts suggest such a move would be much harder to execute in other cities. Washington, D.C.'s unique status as a federal district gives the president direct authority over its National Guard and the ability to control local police in emergencies. In contrast, state governors command their own National Guard units, and federal law largely prohibits using the military for domestic law enforcement. This legal framework presents a significant obstacle to Trump's threats of similar interventions in cities like Chicago or Los Angeles.</p>

The piece explores how the rise of genetics and the problematic theories of eugenics, pioneered by Francis Galton, attempted to scientifically classify and even breed genius. Ultimately, the article concludes that genius is not just a matter of heritable traits but is also profoundly shaped by social conditions, luck, and timing.</p>

          <p>Spain has activated the EU's disaster assistance mechanism for the first time as it battles widespread wildfires amid a severe heatwave, with the death toll rising to three. The EU has responded by sending two French firefighting planes to the hard-hit Galicia region. Thousands of people have been evacuated across the country, and weather forecasts predict continued high temperatures and winds, raising concerns of further spread. Spain is one of five European nations, including Greece and Turkey, currently struggling with major wildfires exacerbated by extreme summer heat.</p>

          <p>A jury has concluded that Ruth Szymankiewicz, a 14-year-old girl who died after being left alone at a mental health hospital, was unlawfully killed. Ruth, who was supposed to be under constant supervision, was left unaccompanied for 15 minutes by an agency staff member who was on his first shift and had used fake credentials. She was found unconscious in her room at the since-closed Huntercombe Hospital and died two days later. The jury cited insufficient staff training and unsuitable care as contributing factors, as her parents called for systemic changes in children's mental health services.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Times opinion piece praises a new Department of Energy climate report for taking a nuanced position on climate change. The author argues the report is revolutionary for affirming that humans contribute to warming while also concluding it may not be an impending catastrophe and that drastic reduction policies could cause more economic harm than good. The report, created by a small group of independent scientists, found no convincing evidence of increased frequency or intensity of U.S. hurricanes or droughts. The author hopes this report will encourage more open debate, moving climate policy away from dogma and fear.</p>

          <p>The two leading plant-based meat companies, Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, are taking different paths to navigate a stagnant market and address consumer criticism. Beyond is rebranding, simplifying its name to "Beyond" and launching new products with simpler, "cleaner" ingredient lists to counter claims that its food is overly processed. In contrast, Impossible Foods is doubling down on mimicking meat, launching more "indulgent" products and emphasizing a "meatier brand identity," betting that taste remains the single most important factor for consumers. The success of these divergent strategies could shape the future of the alternative protein industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The producer price index (PPI), a measure of wholesale inflation, rose 0.9% in July, its largest jump in over three years and far exceeding economists' forecasts. This surge suggests that President Trump's tariffs are increasingly driving up costs for businesses, which will likely be passed on to consumers soon. While consumer price inflation has remained relatively cool, this report indicates that the ability of businesses to absorb tariff costs may be diminishing. The data complicates the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on whether to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On the eve of a summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Donald Trump has stated he believes the Russian leader is ready to make a deal to end the war in Ukraine. Trump suggested a follow-up meeting with himself, Putin, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would be where a final agreement is made, using the term "divvy things up." This language may alarm Kyiv, as it implies potential territorial concessions. European leaders, while relieved that Trump seems focused on securing a ceasefire, remain wary of his unpredictable nature in the high-stakes negotiations.</p>

          <p>Dr. Richard Lutz, the chief executive of Germany's state-owned railway, Deutsche Bahn (DB), has been dismissed from his role. His departure comes as the once-renowned company faces severe crises related to poor punctuality, persistent financial losses, and aging infrastructure. Under Lutz's leadership since 2017, the on-time performance of long-distance trains has plummeted significantly. The move is part of a broader restructuring effort by Germany's new government, which has pledged to modernize the country's transport systems and has criticized the railway's "dramatic" situation.</p>

          <p>The City of Wolverhampton Council has reversed its decision to introduce higher fees for wider burial plots following criticism from residents and a funeral director who labeled it a "fat tax." The plan would have imposed a 20% surcharge for a 6-foot-wide plot compared to a standard 5-foot one. The council initially defended the move by citing increased demand and the costs of accommodating larger coffins, a practice already in place in other UK councils. However, after a BBC investigation highlighted public opposition, the council announced it would not proceed with the plans.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of the popular weight-loss drug Mounjaro, is increasing its list price in the UK by as much as 170%. This means the cost for a month's supply of the highest dose for private patients could rise from £122 to £330. The company stated the initial UK price was significantly below the European average and the increase aligns it more consistently for fair global contribution. The price change does not affect the heavily-discounted rate paid by the NHS, but it is a major blow to the estimated 1.5 million people who pay for the drug privately.</p>
