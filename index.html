          <p>A man in Paterson, New Jersey, allegedly stabbed two bakery owners over a sandwich he purchased four years ago that he claimed made him ill. The suspect complained about receiving an eggplant sandwich instead of an egg sandwich before attacking the brothers, Mohammed and Abed Assad. The victims sustained non-life-threatening injuries, and the assailant, who has not been identified, remains at large. This incident highlights a concerning trend of extreme violence in the U.S. over disputes related to food service.</p>

          <p>Dame Stella Rimington, the first woman to serve as the director general of the British security service MI5, has passed away at the age of 90. She led the agency from 1992 to 1996 and was the first head to be publicly named upon appointment, a significant shift in the organization's secrecy. Her tenure marked a period of modernization for MI5, and she was widely believed to be the inspiration for Dame Judi Dench's portrayal of "M" in the James Bond film series. Her public identification led to security risks, forcing her and her family to relocate.</p>

Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to remove the absent Democrats from office if they do not return, while the state's attorney general suggested they could be arrested. The proposed map, supported by former President Trump, could significantly favor Republicans in future elections, prompting Democrats to organize events in other states to protest what they call a partisan power grab.</p>

          <p>Shares of Berkshire Hathaway fell after the conglomerate reported a 4% decrease in quarterly operating earnings, largely due to a decline in its insurance underwriting business. Investors were also disappointed by the company's decision to halt its stock buyback program and continue selling off equities, with its cash pile remaining near a record high. The report included a significant $3.8 billion write-down on its Kraft Heinz investment, a move Warren Buffett has previously acknowledged was an overpayment. The results have raised questions about the company's direction as it prepares for a leadership transition. (not investment advice)</p>

The event underscores the volatile intersection of marketing, culture wars, and political endorsements in today's consumer landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The American Free Enterprise Chamber of Commerce (AmFree) is intervening in a federal lawsuit to support the government against California's attempt to reinstate its electric vehicle mandates. The state, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, is challenging congressional resolutions signed by President Trump that blocked California's ability to enforce stricter emissions standards. AmFree argues that the mandates are commercially damaging and that the courts have no authority to review the congressional actions. The case represents a significant battle over states' rights, federal authority, and environmental policy.</p>

The court heard that the act was premeditated, and notes on the boy's phone revealed fantasies of killing a person. The boy received a 12-month detention order, while the girl received a nine-month order, and both are banned from owning animals for life.</p>

          <p>Researchers have identified the cause of a devastating sea star wasting disease that has killed over five billion starfish along North America's Pacific coast since 2013. The culprit is a bacteria, Vibrio pectenicida, which was found in the bodily fluid of infected sea stars. The epidemic has critically endangered species like the sunflower sea star, leading to ecological imbalances such as the explosion of sea urchin populations and the destruction of kelp forests. This discovery provides hope for developing interventions to help restore sea star populations and the broader marine ecosystem.</p>

However, this cap can pose challenges for borrowers needing a larger lump sum for immediate expenses like debt or home renovations.

          <p>Liverpool Football Club held a tribute for forward Diogo Jota during their first home match at Anfield since his death. The 28-year-old Portugal international was killed in a car crash in Spain in July along with his brother. Before a pre-season friendly against Athletic Bilbao, wreaths were laid on the pitch and the stadium's billboards displayed a message of remembrance. The game was paused in the 20th minute, corresponding to Jota's jersey number, for a moment of applause from players and fans of both teams.</p>

          <p>A new clinical trial has found that people lost twice as much weight on a diet of minimally processed, home-style meals compared to a diet of ultraprocessed foods, even when the latter were designed to be nutritionally healthy. Over eight weeks, participants on the minimally processed diet naturally consumed fewer calories and lost more weight and body fat. The study, the largest of its kind, suggests that the level of food processing itself, not just nutritional content like fat or sugar, plays a key role in calorie consumption and weight management.</p>

          <p>Sydney Sweeney's emergence as a figure praised by the political right, culminating in President Trump's endorsement of her ad campaign, presents a significant public relations risk for the rising Hollywood star. This article explores how her reported Republican voter registration and the "great genes" ad controversy have placed her in a precarious position in a polarized American culture. While celebrity political endorsements can be powerful, experts note that they often end badly for the celebrity, especially for an actor who is not yet a box-office titan and relies on broad appeal.</p>

          <p>The son of a British couple detained in Iran since January has learned they are being held separately in two of the country's most notorious prisons. Lindsay and Craig Foreman, from East Sussex, were on a round-the-world trip when they were arrested and charged with espionage, which their family denies. The UK government confirmed that the mother is in Qarchak Prison and the father is in Fashafouyeh Prison, both known for inhumane and unsanitary conditions. The family expressed grave fears for the couple's physical and mental welfare after seven months of uncertainty.</p>

The case has drawn political attention, with local Reform UK leader George Finch alleging the men are asylum seekers and accusing authorities of a "cover-up" regarding their immigration status.

          <p>U.S. Congresswoman Nancy Mace has officially launched her campaign for governor of South Carolina, cementing her transformation from a Trump critic to a staunch loyalist. Once a moderate Republican who condemned the January 6 Capitol attack, Mace now embraces the "super Maga" label in her bid to lead the heavily Republican state. Her campaign announcement focused on pro-Trump credentials, cutting taxes, and fighting "woke ideology" in schools. She enters a crowded GOP primary where she will compete for the support of Trump's base against several other conservative candidates.</p>

The government's decision to ban the group is currently being challenged in the High Court.

          <p>Rupert Matthews, the police and crime commissioner (PCC) for Leicestershire and Rutland, has defected from the Conservative Party to Reform UK, giving the latter party its first-ever PCC. Announcing his decision alongside Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, Matthews stated it was time to cut the "dark heart of wokeness" from the justice system. The move has been criticized by local Conservatives, who argue he should call a by-election as he was elected on a Tory platform. This defection adds to the sense that Reform UK is gaining momentum on the right of British politics.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides guidance on whether purchasing an annuity is a wise financial decision in the current economic climate. It suggests that annuities can be beneficial for near-retirees wanting to lock in currently high interest rates and for risk-averse individuals seeking a guaranteed lifetime income stream similar to a pension. Conversely, it advises against annuities for younger investors with long time horizons, those who may need access to their capital soon, and anyone carrying high-interest debt. The decision ultimately depends on an individual's specific financial situation and risk tolerance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett have intensified their attacks on the Bureau of Labor Statistics, promoting baseless claims that the recent jobs report was "rigged." Following the firing of the BLS commissioner, the White House has sought to justify the move by suggesting federal employees manipulated data to undermine the president. This rhetoric mirrors past efforts to erode trust in government institutions and processes, with Trump explicitly linking the alleged jobs data rigging to his claims about the 2020 election. There is no evidence to support the allegations of data manipulation.</p>

          <p>Following a market bounce after last week's weak jobs report, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to consider buying shares in Wells Fargo and Capital One. He suggested that the weaker economic data increases the likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut, which could boost the market. While remaining bullish on Apple after its strong quarterly report, Cramer recommended that new investors hold off on buying Goldman Sachs due to its recent run-up. The advice reflects a view that certain financial and tech stocks are well-positioned for the current economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>
