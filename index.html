          <p>A Senate Democratic committee report suggests Elon Musk leveraged his influence with the federal government, potentially avoiding over $2 billion in financial liabilities. The report claims Musk's "Department of Government Efficiency" has significantly impacted Washington, supported by President Trump's administration. Democrats accuse Musk of using his influence to evade oversight and derail investigations, as Musk's companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, faced regulatory actions totaling billions on Trump's inauguration day. The report raises concerns about the intersection of corporate power and government regulation.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Navy F/A-18E fighter jet rolled off an aircraft carrier and sank into the Red Sea due to human error, resulting in one minor injury. The $70 million jet was being towed in the hangar bay of the USS Harry S. Truman when the crew lost control, causing the aircraft and tow tractor to fall overboard. An investigation is underway to determine the exact cause of the mishap, which occurred while the USS Harry S. Truman was operating in the Red Sea to protect commercial ships from Houthi attacks. Initial reports suggest a sudden movement of the carrier due to Houthi fire might have contributed to the incident, though this remains unconfirmed.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of lawyers and staff are reportedly leaving the Justice Department's civil rights division due to disagreements with the Trump administration's new priorities. The administration aims to shift the division's focus away from traditional civil rights work, such as investigating police departments, towards pursuing cases against Ivy League schools and liberal cities. The departures accelerated after the administration reopened a "deferred resignation program," allowing employees to resign but continue receiving pay for a period. The new head of the division, Harmeet K. Dhillon, welcomed the turnover, emphasizing a focus on enforcing federal civil rights laws rather than "woke ideology."</p>

          <p>The head of Israel's domestic intelligence service, Shin Bet, announced his resignation following a public dispute with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The clash arose after Netanyahu fired Ronen Bar, the Shin Bet chief, amid an investigation into Netanyahu's aides' dealings with Qatar. Critics viewed the dismissal as an attempt to interfere with the investigation. The Supreme Court initially suspended Bar's firing, but he has now decided to step down in June.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second presidency has seen rapid shifts in US politics, from foreign policy to trade. He promised to end the war in Ukraine, but the conflict continues, and the Trump administration's approach has strained relationships with traditional allies. Immigration policies have become stricter, while the economy shows mixed results with some prices falling but supermarket costs remaining high. The administration's actions have divided the country and raised concerns about government stability. </p>
