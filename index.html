          <p>Harvard University has requested a judge to block President Trump's order that restricts foreign students from enrolling at the university. The order targets international students seeking enrollment at Harvard, escalating the legal battle between Harvard and the Trump administration. The university argues that the order is discriminatory and harmful to its academic community. This move underscores the ongoing tensions between academic institutions and governmental policies regarding international students. The university seeks to protect its diverse student body and maintain its global academic standing. The legal challenge reflects broader concerns about the impact of immigration policies on higher education.</p>

          <p>Grant Hardin, the convicted murderer and former police chief known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," may have fled Arkansas after escaping from prison last month. A federal court filing indicates investigators believe Hardin has left the state to avoid recapture, potentially hiding in the Ozark Mountain region he knows well. U.S. Border Patrol has deployed a special operations team to assist in the manhunt, and the Arkansas Department of Corrections released an updated image of Hardin with facial hair and a slimmer appearance. Hardin was serving a 30-year sentence for murder and 25-year sentences for two counts of sexual assault, and a reward of $25,000 is offered for information leading to his capture.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers rallied to defeat the New York Mets 6-5, splitting their series after a shaky start from pitcher Landon Knack. Knack allowed four runs, including three home runs, in just 3 ⅓ innings, forcing the Dodgers to rely heavily on their bullpen. Michael Conforto delivered a go-ahead RBI single in the eighth inning, completing a three-run comeback and securing the win for the Dodgers.

          <p>Donald Trump and Elon Musk are embroiled in a public disagreement that escalated into personal attacks. The dispute began over Musk's criticism of Trump's tax and spending bill, which Musk called "a disgusting abomination" due to its impact on the federal deficit. Trump responded by questioning their relationship and claiming Musk's opposition was due to the bill's elimination of electric vehicle tax credits. Musk then accused Trump, without evidence, of being in the Epstein files, leading to threats from Trump to cut Musk's government contracts, marking a significant fallout between the two former allies.</p>

          <p>David Brooks argues that the Democratic Party's problems stem from a failure to adapt to the current populist era, characterized by widespread social distrust and a belief that societal systems are rigged. He suggests that Republicans, led by Trump, have been more successful in capitalizing on this sentiment by portraying elites as detrimental to America. Brooks contends that Democrats need visionaries who can shift their entire worldview to address this new historical context, rather than relying on traditional political strategies. The shift requires a fundamental rethinking of the party's message and approach to governance.</p>

          <h2>Analysis of Potential Impacts of Trump's 'Big, Beautiful Bill' on Medicaid and SNAP</h2>

          <p>President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" could significantly impact Medicaid and SNAP, with estimated cuts of $600 billion and $230 billion respectively over 10 years. Republicans aim to reduce "waste, fraud, and abuse" to fund tax cuts and increased border/defense spending. Proposed Medicaid changes include work requirements, increased eligibility checks, restrictions on funding for undocumented migrants, higher copays, and prohibitions on funding for abortion providers and gender transition care. SNAP changes involve raising the age for work requirements and shifting costs to states. The changes could affect millions of Americans relying on these programs.</p>
