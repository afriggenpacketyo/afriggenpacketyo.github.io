In a statement, Child Q expressed profound and lasting trauma, stating she doesn't know if she will "feel normal again."

          <p>President Trump's proposed "Trump Card," a $5 million visa for wealthy immigrants, is encountering substantial legal, tax, and market-related challenges, according to immigration experts. While the administration claims strong interest with 70,000 sign-ups, attorneys suggest the actual market is much smaller and demand may be limited, particularly from key regions like China. Major obstacles include the need for congressional approval to alter existing immigration laws like the EB-5 program and to create an unprecedented exemption from U.S. worldwide income tax for cardholders.

          <p>The White House is intensifying its push for President Trump's signature legislative package, but the bill is facing significant roadblocks in the Senate ahead of a July 4 deadline. Key disagreements among Republicans and procedural hurdles are complicating its passage. The Senate parliamentarian has ruled that several provisions, including a plan to cut Medicaid funding via provider taxes, violate the chamber's budget rules, requiring a 60-vote threshold. This development threatens the delicate compromises made to pass the bill in the House and challenges the GOP's ability to unify.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a period of decline, rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have risen slightly, but there are several key dates this summer when they could fall again. The article suggests that a favorable inflation report in mid-July could prompt lenders to lower rates preemptively. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's meetings at the end of July and, more likely, in mid-September, could result in a formal interest rate cut. A September cut is seen as highly probable, potentially providing relief for both current and prospective HELOC borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple has unveiled a new, complicated system of fees for its European App Store in an effort to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) and avoid a potential â‚¬500 million fine. The changes, which Apple says it is making reluctantly, include a new "core technology commission" on digital purchases made outside the App Store. Critics, including Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, have labeled the new rules as "malicious compliance," arguing they violate the spirit of the regulation and make it commercially unviable for developers to use alternative payment systems.</p>

Gabbard, once an anti-war voice, now finds herself trying to align with an administration celebrating military strikes she reportedly opposed. Her initial intelligence assessment that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon was publicly refuted by Trump, eroding her influence. To regain favor, she has reportedly politicized intelligence to match the president's narrative, a move that has damaged her credibility within the intelligence community she was appointed to lead.</p>

The analysis shows that for 3-month and 6-month terms, a CD currently offers slightly higher returns, while a high-yield savings account marginally outperforms a 9-month CD. Because the interest earnings are so similar, the choice depends on a saver's outlook on future interest rate movements. Locking in a CD rate may be wise if rates are expected to fall, whereas a savings account offers more flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

Crucially, the court's decision establishes that the statute of limitations does not apply in these civil cases, opening a path to justice for other victims.
