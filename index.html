          <p>President Trump's nominee for U.N. ambassador, Mike Waltz, faced a Senate confirmation hearing, addressing questions on foreign policy toward China and Israel. While expected to be confirmed, he was confronted by Democrats over his role in a scandal involving the disclosure of sensitive military details on a messaging app. Waltz defended the use of the app and maintained no classified information was shared, but received sharp criticism for a perceived lack of accountability. The hearing highlighted partisan divides on the U.N.'s role and U.S. engagement on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Severe storms in the Northeast caused flash flooding in New Jersey, leading to the deaths of at least two people whose vehicle was swept away in Plainfield. This incident follows two other flood-related deaths in the same city earlier in the month, prompting the mayor to express grief over the repeated tragedies. Governor Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency, as the heavy rainfall caused widespread disruption, including road closures, water rescues, and significant flight cancellations at Newark Liberty International Airport. The storm also caused a house fire and collapse in a flooded neighborhood.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is advancing two significant bills aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry. The GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill that has already passed the Senate, is expected to become law, while the broader CLARITY Act faces a more uncertain path due to Democratic concerns over potential conflicts of interest related to President Trump's family's crypto ventures. The CLARITY Act defines regulatory authority between the SEC and CFTC, a key demand from the industry. Crypto companies like Coinbase are lobbying heavily for its passage, arguing that regulatory certainty will foster investment and consumer protection. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. consumer price index revealed that annual inflation rose to 2.7% in June, driven by higher grocery and housing costs that were partially offset by lower gas prices. Economists attribute part of the increase to President Trump's tariffs, suggesting that their full price impact on consumers has not yet been realized and will likely intensify in the coming months. The report indicated mixed signals, with prices for items like meat increasing year-over-year, while used car and airline fare prices saw a decline. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, reached 2.9%, pointing towards a trend of generally higher prices ahead. (not investment advice)</p>

The columnist suggests that Trump's inability to control the narrative on this issue, unlike others, signifies his waning influence within his own coalition.

          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by strong performance in its trading and investment banking divisions. The bank's fixed income trading revenue jumped 14%, while investment banking fees rose 7%, both significantly higher than anticipated. CEO Jamie Dimon credited the resilient U.S. economy but reiterated warnings about risks from tariffs, geopolitical conflicts, and high fiscal deficits. Despite a 17% drop in net income compared to the prior year, which included a large one-time gain, the underlying results were robust, and the bank raised its full-year guidance for net interest income.

          <p>The UK government secretly relocated 4,500 Afghans after a Ministry of Defence official inadvertently leaked the personal data of nearly 19,000 applicants seeking to flee the Taliban in 2022. The existence of the leak and the subsequent resettlement scheme were concealed by a super-injunction, which a High Court judge has now lifted. Defence Secretary John Healey apologized for the "serious departmental error," which exposed names and contact details of people at potential risk. The government revealed that hundreds of Afghan soldiers on the leaked list are believed to still be in Afghanistan, and the now-closed scheme has cost £400 million so far.</p>

          <p>An upcoming independent report in the U.K. is expected to recommend tighter regulations and an expensive modernization of the nation's water infrastructure to address years of illegal sewage pollution. Environmental groups have long criticized private water companies, like the notorious Thames Water, for frequent, untreated sewage discharges into rivers while paying out large dividends. The crisis is blamed on a lack of investment in aging Victorian-era systems. The report, commissioned by the government, may lead to comprehensive reforms in regulation and strategic planning to finally tackle the systemic pollution plaguing Britain's cherished waterways.</p>

          <p>Staunch Trump ally Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has publicly criticized the president's new policy to send billions of dollars in weapons to Ukraine, arguing it breaks a key campaign promise. Greene stated on social media that MAGA supporters voted for an end to U.S. involvement in foreign wars, not for more arms shipments. Her criticism highlights a potential crack in Trump's political coalition, coming shortly after his announcement of a major arms deal with NATO allies to support Ukraine. The policy represents a significant pivot from Trump's previous rhetoric and the Republican position of blocking Ukraine aid under the prior administration.</p>

          <p>In a move to improve relations with the European Parliament, Beijing has lifted the sanctions it imposed in 2021 on Reinhard Buetikofer, a prominent former German lawmaker. The removal of these restrictions is expected to pave the way for the resumption of official meetings between the EU Parliament and China's National People's Congress for the first time since 2018. The sanctions were originally part of a series of retaliatory measures by China against the EU. European parliamentary groups had demanded the lifting of sanctions on Buetikofer, who was a dominant voice on China policy, as a precondition for normalizing diplomatic ties.</p>

The figures from June show that of the nearly eight million claimants, 83.6% were British and Irish nationals, while over a million were born overseas, including 700,000 EU citizens with the right to live and work in the UK. The publication follows pressure from some conservative politicians who argue the figures show a loss of control over the welfare system.

To combat this, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has launched a new fraud-detection war room using AI.

Critics argue that the policy, championed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party, amounts to an imposition that undermines the country's rich linguistic diversity and federal structure. While proponents frame it as a move away from a colonial legacy, opponents see it as a threat to their regional identity. Despite the official push, English remains vital for economic mobility, creating a complex linguistic landscape across the nation.</p>
