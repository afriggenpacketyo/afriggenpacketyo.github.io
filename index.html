          <p>RTX and GE Aerospace estimate that tariffs imposed by President Trump will cost them over $1 billion combined, signaling the rising costs for U.S. manufacturers relying on global supply chains. RTX anticipates an $850 million hit from tariffs this year, while GE Aerospace plans to cut costs and raise prices to save about $500 million. GE Aerospace CEO Larry Culp discussed the U.S. aerospace sector's trade surplus with Trump, highlighting the challenges posed by the tariffs. The imposition of tariffs creates some instability, but the market is still functioning.</p>

          <p>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde voiced her hope that President Trump would not remove Jerome Powell from his position as Federal Reserve Chair, acknowledging the political pressures both she and Powell face in their roles. Lagarde refrained from commenting on the potential market implications of such an event, emphasizing her respect for Powell's dedication to his mandate and his ability to remain disciplined despite political pressure. She highlighted the importance of adhering to their respective mandates as their guiding compass. Optimism remains reasonably high due to the stability of central banking leadership, but there is still some concern about potential political interference.</p>

          <p>Margaret Sullivan argues that Donald Trump's attacks on public media, such as NPR and PBS, are part of a broader strategy to control the political narrative and undermine the reality-based press. She highlights the importance of public media in providing fact-based news, especially in communities lacking other sources of information. Sullivan contends that Congress should continue to fund public media to maintain a critical part of the news ecosystem necessary for democratic self-governance. The attacks are a sign of instability.</p>

          <p>China is implementing a plan to promote the use of the yuan and its own payment system, CIPS, in international trade, seeking to reduce dependence on the U.S. dollar amid trade tensions. The initiative, led by Shanghai's municipal government, aims to leverage the city's role as a global financial hub to expand the CIPS network and support Chinese enterprises in global markets. Settling more transactions in yuan would strengthen China's position in global trade and mitigate potential impacts from U.S. financial restrictions. The effort is a sign of stability.</p>

          <p>During the sentencing of a tour company owner, a court heard how a paddleboarder was "guided to her death" in an incident that resulted in the deaths of four people on the River Cleddau in Pembrokeshire. The owner, Nerys Bethan Lloyd, pleaded guilty to manslaughter after it was revealed she lacked the qualifications to run the tour. Family members of the victims delivered emotional statements, describing the devastating impact of the tragedy and accusing Lloyd of negligence. The court also heard that the river was in flood conditions with a strong current, making it extremely hazardous for paddleboarding. The incident is a tragedy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Climate change is increasingly threatening the American fishing industry, which generates nearly $100 billion annually, as warming rivers reduce oxygen levels and harm fish populations. A recent study found that 87% of rivers studied across the U.S. and Europe are warming, with 70% losing oxygen. Fly fishing guides, like Brian Sheppard on the Beaver Kill River, are finding it harder to make a living due to rising water temperatures that make it difficult for trout to survive. Nonprofits are working to restore river flow and protect the fishing tourism economy. The climate change is a sign of environmental instability.</p>
