          <p>The tech industry has invested over $717 billion into large language model (LLM) AI and its infrastructure in three years, with comparable investment anticipated next year. A veteran investor warns that despite the widespread belief in AI's transformative potential, most current players are likely to fail, leading to catastrophic knock-on effects for equity investors. The huge gap between infrastructure investment and end-user license revenue is unsustainable, and while Big Tech companies seek global AI monopolies to sustain their market value, not all will achieve this, potentially leading to significant write-offs. This article suggests a significant market correction is imminent for AI-related investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan has strongly refuted Donald Trump's claims that London is moving towards Sharia law, labeling the former president's remarks as "racist, sexist, misogynistic, and Islamophobic." Trump, speaking at the UN General Assembly, criticized Khan's leadership and London's perceived changes. Khan emphasized London's success as a liberal, multicultural city and highlighted record American tourism. British cabinet ministers also defended the mayor, clarifying that Sharia law holds no legal standing in the UK, despite the presence of voluntary religious councils. This ongoing feud between the two figures has a history of public exchanges.</p>

          <p>Lithium Americas stock surged nearly 80% following reports that the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the Canadian mining company. This development occurs as Lithium Americas renegotiates a $2.2 billion Department of Energy loan for its Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, a vital future source of lithium for electric vehicle batteries. The administration's proposal for a small equity stake aims to create a cash buffer and mitigate taxpayer risk, representing a novel approach to securing critical mineral supply chains. This initiative underscores the government's focus on domestic resource security and strategic investments in key industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans relying on SNAP benefits are confronting significant cuts or potential removal from the program, stemming from new restrictions within a Republican tax and spending law. Projections indicate that 2.4 million individuals could lose access, while millions more will experience reduced monthly benefits due to stricter work requirements and revised calculation methods. These changes, which extend work requirements to older adults and exclude internet expenses from deductions, are implemented amid persistent rises in grocery costs and increasing poverty rates. Anti-hunger advocates express deep concern that these measures will worsen food insecurity and weaken a crucial social safety net.</p>

Although refinance applications saw a modest 1% increase last week, they are still 42% higher than the same period last year, now constituting over 60% of all application activity, primarily fueled by government-backed loans. Conversely, mortgage applications for home purchases remained flat, signaling a persistent cooling in homebuyer interest despite the more attractive rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Six-time Grand Slam champion Boris Becker has expressed regret over his Wimbledon victory at just 17 years old, attributing it to the immense and enduring pressure it imposed on his life and career. Becker, who became the youngest men's singles champion in 1985, went on to secure five more Grand Slam titles but also contended with a turbulent private life and significant financial struggles, including a prison sentence. He explained that this early, global success made it exceptionally difficult to mature and pursue a second career, as all subsequent achievements were constantly compared to his unprecedented teenage triumph, leading him to believe 17 was "too young" for such fame.</p>

Strzok was dismissed during President Donald Trump's first term after sending anti-Trump text messages while overseeing the Crossfire Hurricane investigation into Trump's campaign and Russia. The court determined that Strzok's interest in expressing political opinions on his FBI phone was outweighed by the FBI's paramount interest in avoiding the appearance of bias in its ongoing investigations and protecting its law enforcement operations. The judge also dismissed his due process claim, finding no evidence of a contractual property interest in his tenure or insufficient notice prior to his termination.</p>

Key areas include healthcare and long-term care, with out-of-pocket costs for Medicare, prescriptions, and potential nursing home care being substantial. Housing costs, even for those without mortgages, require budgeting for insurance, property taxes, and maintenance, all of which are increasing. Unexpected taxes on Social Security benefits, retirement withdrawals, and capital gains from home sales also pose a challenge.

          <p>To ensure trustworthy financial advice, individuals should ask prospective advisors if they operate as a fiduciary. A fiduciary is legally obligated to act in the client's best interest, unlike those adhering only to a "suitability" standard, which merely requires recommendations to be appropriate. Failing to work with a fiduciary can lead to higher fees and misaligned advice, potentially costing clients tens of thousands of dollars over time. Fiduciaries must disclose all conflicts of interest, including compensation structures. Experts recommend verifying an advisor's fiduciary status through resources like the SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure site and seeking written confirmation of 100% fiduciary commitment.

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae-Myung is championing a constitutional reform to enable future presidents to serve two consecutive four-year terms, replacing the existing single five-year limit. This ambitious initiative seeks to synchronize presidential and National Assembly elections, aiming to foster policy continuity and enhance governmental accountability. Despite public polls indicating over 60% support, the ruling party currently lacks the two-thirds parliamentary majority required for the legislation's passage, and significant opposition is anticipated, particularly regarding other proposed changes concerning sexual minorities' rights and North Korea. Analysts observe that similar reform attempts have historically floundered, underscoring the profound ideological divisions within Korean politics.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has initiated an urgent review into the substantial costs of taxi services used to transport asylum seekers to appointments from their hotels. This follows a BBC investigation revealing instances of long journeys costing hundreds of pounds, with one asylum seeker reporting a £600 taxi ride for a 250-mile trip to a GP. The Home Office currently lacks figures on these expenses, as an automated system books taxis without presenting public transport options. The investigation also exposed concerns about cramped living conditions, illegal working, and safety issues in asylum seeker hotels, prompting calls for greater accountability and reform.</p>

Trump subsequently posted on social media that Ukraine, with EU and NATO support, could "fight and WIN all of Ukraine back," calling Russia a "paper tiger." This marked a dramatic departure from his previous skepticism about Ukraine's ability to reclaim occupied territory. While Kyiv expressed cautious optimism, the Kremlin quickly dismissed Trump's assessment of Russia's economy and military, reiterating its commitment to the "special military operation."</p>

This decision follows criticism from some families regarding the camp's safety measures and preparedness during the disaster. New state laws, enacted in response to the tragedy, now prohibit cabins in dangerous flood zones and mandate detailed emergency plans and warning systems for camps.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the European Union's increasingly aggressive stance towards China is counterproductive, likening it to "tilting at windmills" and causing self-inflicted economic and social damage. The author criticizes the EU for complaining about its trade deficit while refusing to ratify the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI), which would expand exports. The CAI's suspension, triggered by sanctions related to human rights allegations in Xinjiang, is seen as hindering economic cooperation and slowing the EU's energy transition by obstructing the adoption of cost-effective Chinese clean energy technologies.

          <p>The Trump administration is actively challenging race-neutral admissions policies if their intent is to achieve racial diversity, potentially ending class-based affirmative action efforts. This interpretation, outlined in Education Department and Attorney General memos, argues that using proxies like socioeconomic status or geography to boost diversity is "legally problematic." The College Board's recent shutdown of its Landscape tool, which provided socioeconomic data, is seen as a direct consequence. While courts have so far resisted this interpretation, the administration's willingness to wield government power against universities may compel them to reduce Black student enrollment to avoid retribution, effectively undermining diversity initiatives.</p>

This rapid evolution in large language models' "chain-of-thought prompting" showcases their burgeoning capacity for specialized, high-stakes analytical reasoning crucial for professional financial decision-making.

By evening, major cities within the Pearl River Delta began lifting restrictions and downgrading storm alerts. Although some localized power and water outages were reported in Yangjiang, the Shenzhen city government confirmed no injuries and smooth city operations.

          <p>A report by lawyer Angus McCullough KC revealed that the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) utilized journalists' phone data to detect internal staff leaks, a practice he deemed "not necessary or proportionate." The investigation uncovered 21 unlawful instances of covert powers employed to identify reporters' sources, double the previously admitted figure, all occurring prior to 2015. Furthermore, between 2011 and 2023, the PSNI systematically processed 383 journalists' phone numbers through police systems to monitor unauthorized contact with officers, a controversial practice formally ceased only last year. This raises profound concerns regarding freedom of expression and data protection, leading to calls for a public inquiry.</p>
