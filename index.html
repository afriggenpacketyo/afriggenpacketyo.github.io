          <p>President Trump stated that any protesters attending the military parade in Washington would be met with significant force, coinciding with the Army's 250th anniversary and his birthday. He emphasized the celebration of military victories from World War I and World War II, highlighting the presence of tanks and aircraft. The U.S. Secret Service and Washington officials are monitoring nine planned protests but do not anticipate violence, while the National Guard will be activated but unarmed. Outside of Washington, progressive groups are planning protests against the Trump administration, including a flagship protest in Philadelphia. The article indicates a tense atmosphere surrounding the parade amidst ongoing protests. Optimism is not a factor in this event.</p>

          <p>President Trump claimed that Los Angeles would be engulfed in flames if the National Guard had not been deployed to address protests against federal immigration operations.

Trump claimed to have called Governor Newsom to tell him to improve the situation, but Newsom denied any such call occurred. The article underscores the ongoing tensions and differing accounts surrounding the protests and federal response in Los Angeles. This situation is likely to create more unrest.</p>

          <p>Concerns are rising in China about a potential financial crisis in the electric vehicle (EV) industry due to an intense price war led by companies like BYD. The price cuts, some as steep as 34%, are squeezing profits and raising alarms about the sustainability of the industry. An official Communist Party paper warned that the "race to the bottom" is impacting the entire ecosystem and risking income declines for workers. One auto executive likened the situation to an "Evergrande-like" crisis, while a government-backed industry group criticized companies for "dumping" vehicles below production costs. The EV industry is facing some challenges.</p>

          <p>This article compares the interest-earning potential of a $10,000 certificate of deposit (CD) versus a $10,000 high-yield savings account in June 2025. While both options offer FDIC insurance, CDs generally provide slightly higher and fixed interest rates for a specific term, while high-yield savings accounts offer variable rates that can change over time. The article concludes that a CD can earn slightly more interest in the short term, but a high-yield savings account may be preferable for those needing access to their funds without penalty. Savers should consider exploring both options and potentially splitting their funds to leverage the benefits of each. (not investment advice)</p>

UEFA regulations prevent an individual or entity from holding a majority of voting rights in two clubs participating in the same European competition.
