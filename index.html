            <h2>Puerto Rico Faces Island-Wide Blackout, Sparking Renewed Calls for Energy Contract Changes</h2>

            <p>Puerto Rico experienced a complete island-wide blackout, leaving 1.4 million customers without electricity and 328,000 without water, impacting essential services like the main international airport, hospitals, and hotels during the Easter holiday period. Governor Jenniffer González has promised to address the growing outrage over the ongoing outages and consider cancelling contracts with Luma Energy and Genera PR, the companies overseeing power transmission/distribution and generation, respectively. The blackout, estimated to cause a $230 million daily revenue loss, has raised concerns about potential investor confidence and the well-being of the island's elderly population, already struggling with a poverty rate exceeding 40% and the inability to afford generators or solar panels. The island's grid has been deteriorating due to a lack of maintenance and investment since Hurricane Maria in 2017, and experts worry about the future of renewable energy initiatives under the Trump administration.</p>

            <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) will pursue the NHS if it does not update its gender policies to reflect the UK Supreme Court's ruling that defines 'woman' as biological sex under equalities law. The ruling means that a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC) does not change a person's legal sex for Equality Act purposes, potentially impacting access to single-sex spaces like hospital wards and changing rooms. The EHRC expects to issue updated guidance by the summer, and Baroness Kishwer Falkner emphasizes the need to respect the rights of trans people, suggesting the creation of 'third spaces' for facilities like toilets. The ruling may also affect women's sports, where stricter rules around transgender athletes are already being implemented.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The Trump administration is proposing a rule change to the Endangered Species Act that would limit the definition of 'harm' to only include actions that directly hurt or kill endangered species, excluding habitat destruction. Conservation experts fear this change would reverse conservation gains and lead to losses for endangered species, as habitat loss is a major cause of extinction. The proposed rule cites Justice Scalia's dissenting opinion, arguing that 'take' should be interpreted literally, as an affirmative act against a particular animal. The public has 30 days to comment on the proposed rule change, which is likely to face legal challenges.</p>

Lee, who launched her acting career in 2017, emphasizes the importance of empathy in both professions and enjoys the flexibility her ER department offers, allowing her to manage her acting gigs and nursing shifts. She also recalls using her ER nursing skills on set to assist an injured actor, and sees parallels between her two vocations, noting that they both require "empathy". In "Zero Day", Lee portrays Special Agent Angela Kim, who joins the Zero Day Commission, which is led by Mullen, as they work to uncover the culprits and motives behind the deadly cyberattack.</p>

            <p>Goldman Sachs reports that US retail investors hold approximately $370 billion in American depositary receipts (ADRs) of Chinese companies, making them more likely to sell if the Trump administration pursues a decoupling of US and Chinese stock markets. Companies with high retail exposure, like Alibaba Group Holding, could face significant sell-offs if forced to delist. This delisting risk is growing amidst escalating trade tensions between the US and China, with a potential financial decoupling possibly triggering a $2.5 trillion sell-off in both markets. The report suggests some US retail investors might be unwilling or unable to convert their ADRs into Hong Kong-listed shares. (not investment advice)</p>

Williams claimed she was previously subjected to discriminatory drug testing practices, citing an incident in 2018 where she was tested more than twice as many times as other top American players.

The last FMD outbreak in the UK in 2001 resulted in the slaughter of over six million animals.

            <h2>British Disability Increasingly Affects Young Women, Demanding Greater Representation</h2>

            <p>The face of British disability is increasingly young and female, as evidenced by rising numbers of women and young people with disabilities amidst NHS backlogs, mental health issues, and economic crises. These women are often reduced to statistics or stereotypes, with their voices and experiences overlooked in political and media narratives. The author emphasizes the need to hear directly from disabled women about their lives, challenges, and contributions, advocating for representation that acknowledges their full humanity beyond their disabilities. It is argued that shifting the narrative can foster greater understanding and support for disabled people within society.</p>

            <p>US stocks experienced a significant drop after Nvidia warned of potential losses due to export restrictions to China, and companies expressed concerns about the impact of President Trump's trade war. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq composite all declined, with losses accelerating after the Federal Reserve chair reiterated that tariffs could slow the economy and raise inflation. The World Trade Organization also projected a decline in world merchandise trade due to tariffs. The uncertainty surrounding the trade war is impacting company plans and investor sentiment, leading to increased expectations of a possible recession. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss trade relations between the EU and the United States, as she is the first European leader to have a face-to-face with Trump since he announced, and then suspended, 20% tariffs on European exports. Meloni, in close contact with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, is expected to seek clarity on Trump's goals in the trade war. As the leader of a far-right party, Meloni is ideologically aligned with Trump on some issues, but differences exist in her unwavering support for Ukraine. The meeting occurs amid growing concerns over global uncertainty caused by escalating tariff wars.</p>

Glavprodukt was seized from Los Angeles-based Leonid Smirnov and is now under the control of Russia’s federal property management agency. Smirnov denies Russian prosecutors accusations of moving funds out of Russia. The letter reviewed by Reuters said that Rosimushchestvo appointed Glavprodukt’s new director general at the request of food producer Druzhba Narodov. The seizure is seen as a move to secure tighter control of strategic assets amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>

The dental experts went in through the bottom of Rico's tooth, unlike a typical root canal. Rico has been regularly monitored since the surgery, and the abscesses have not returned, indicating the treatment was successful.</p>
