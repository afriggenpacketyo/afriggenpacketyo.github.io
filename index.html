          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dropped its lawsuit against the cryptocurrency exchange Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao.  The lawsuit, filed in June 2023, accused Binance of various violations, including illegally serving U.S. users and commingling customer funds. This dismissal marks a significant shift in the U.S.'s approach to cryptocurrency regulation, particularly under the Trump administration, which is showing signs of becoming more crypto-friendly.  The case's resolution has implications for the broader cryptocurrency market.</p>

          <p>Despite sanctions, Russia continues to generate billions in revenue from fossil fuel exports to Western nations, financing its war in Ukraine.  The BBC's analysis shows that Western aid to Ukraine has been less than Russia's earnings from these exports. Campaigners argue for stronger measures to curb this revenue stream, but many Western governments hesitate due to concerns about energy price increases. This highlights the complex geopolitical challenges in balancing economic interests with support for Ukraine.</p>
