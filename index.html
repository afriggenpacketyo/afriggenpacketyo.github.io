          <p>Nintendo has projected sales of 15 million units for its Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, marking the first sales forecast since announcing the successor to the successful Switch device, which is slated for a June release. The company's fourth-quarter results showed a revenue decrease of 24.7% and a profit plunge of nearly 50% due to anticipated consumer hesitation ahead of the new console's launch. Nintendo also addressed concerns about potential tariffs, stating that adjustments to pricing might be necessary if tariffs are imposed, potentially impacting demand in the U.S. market. The company's stock rallied following the announcement of the Switch 2 sales forecast.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. anticipates a 34.9% decrease in net profit for the fiscal year ending next March, projecting 3.1 trillion yen due to concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, which are creating global uncertainty. The company's operating profit is projected to fall by 20.8% to 3.8 trillion yen, despite estimated record sales of 48.5 trillion yen. Toyota President Koji Sato acknowledged the difficulty in forecasting the outlook, given the fluid nature of the tariffs, but CFO Yoichi Miyazaki stated that the company has no immediate plans to pass the levies onto customers. The automaker group plans to sell 11.2 million units worldwide, a 1.7% increase, following a certification scandal that briefly suspended production of several models.</p>

          <p>The UK has reportedly secured a trade agreement with the U.S., marking a significant achievement for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government after previous Conservative administrations failed to reach a comprehensive deal. While the specifics of the agreement are still emerging, it is expected to reduce tariffs on specific goods, such as British steel and cars, while the U.S. aims to gain concessions on pharmaceuticals and technology. This agreement follows a recent free trade agreement between the UK and India, estimated to bring a substantial boost to bilateral trade and UK GDP. Opposition parties are calling for parliamentary scrutiny of the deal, particularly regarding potential concessions that could affect the NHS or farmers.</p>

Adkins alleged that sex in exchange for favorable treatment was common in Letcher County.

The missiles, fired from the Wonsan area, traveled approximately 800 km before falling into the sea, with no reported damage to ships or planes. This marks the first missile launch by North Korea in nearly two months, prompting stern protests from Japan, whose officials deemed the missile development a threat to peace.</p>

          <p>Adam Bandt, the leader of the Australian Greens, conceded defeat in his parliamentary seat, attributing the loss to voters shifting to the Labor Party to prevent a right-leaning opposition leader from gaining power. Bandt acknowledged that while the Greens may secure a significant portion of the vote in the Senate, their overall performance in the election fell short of expectations. He urged the government to address the climate crisis and inequality, warning of a potential backlash in future elections if these issues are not adequately tackled.</p>

          <p>A rapid analysis by climate scientists has found that the severe storms in early April, which caused significant death and destruction across the central Mississippi valley, were made more likely and intense by burning fossil fuels. The study found that the record rainfall was made about 9% more intense and 40% more likely by human-caused climate change. Warm ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, exacerbated by the climate crisis, fueled the storm's moisture, making such ocean conditions 14 times more likely than in a pre-industrial world.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates that climate change significantly worsened the deadly storms that struck eight U.S. states in early April, increasing the intensity of the record-breaking downpours by about 9%. The storms, which swept across the Midwest and South, were fueled by unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, making such events 14 times more likely. Researchers expressed concern about the impact of ongoing staff shortages at the National Weather Service, which issues real-time warnings to keep communities safe, and warned that without a rapid shift away from fossil fuels, extreme weather events will become more common and intense.</p>
