          <p>In response to falling beef prices and strong competition from imports, China has introduced a new plan to strengthen its domestic cattle industry and encourage consumption. The policy, announced by several government departments, aims to increase high-quality beef production and implement a new quality-grading system for local meat. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to enhance the appeal of domestic agricultural products and address a national dietary imbalance with insufficient high-quality protein intake.

          <p>India's foreign ministry has responded to tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump by defending its increased importation of Russian oil, stating the practice began after traditional supplies were diverted to Europe.

New Delhi emphasized that its oil purchases were a matter of national necessity to ensure energy affordability and were previously encouraged by the U.S. to stabilize global markets.

In a show of solidarity, California Governor Gavin Newsom has pledged to "fight fire with fire," suggesting California could redraw its own maps in retaliation if the Texas plan proceeds. This escalating political conflict, which has drawn support from Illinois Democrats, highlights the national implications of state-level gerrymandering and partisan battles over representation.</p>

          <p>A significant wildfire, named the Gifford fire, is burning through Los Padres National Forest in central California, having scorched over 72,000 acres. The blaze threatens more than 450 structures and has resulted in at least three injuries, prompting evacuation orders in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. Firefighters are facing challenging terrain and erratic conditions, with containment at only 5% as of Monday evening and a forecast of hotter, drier weather expected to fuel further growth.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The court ruled that while the government can pause access to the asylum system, it cannot ignore laws protecting migrants from being returned to places where they face torture or persecution. This decision effectively reopens pathways for humanitarian claims, halting a policy credited by the administration for a significant drop in illegal border crossings and forcing a return to previous immigration processing protocols.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied Sean “Diddy” Combs’ motion for release on bail, ordering that he remain in custody at a Brooklyn detention center until his sentencing on October 3. The judge was unswayed by arguments that Combs is not a flight risk and faces threats of violence in the facility. Combs was convicted on two prostitution-related charges, though he was cleared of racketeering and sex trafficking, and now faces up to 10 years in prison for each count.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has enacted tighter controls on firearms licensing, a change championed by Emma Ambler, whose twin sister and two nieces were murdered with a legally held gun in 2020. The new rules, which came into law on August 5, require two character references for shotgun certificate applications and mandate that police investigate applicants for signs of domestic abuse or dishonesty. Ambler expressed hope that these strengthened regulations will prevent similar tragedies by ensuring only suitable individuals can access firearms.</p>

          <p>A company that recently appointed Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump as advisers hastily revised a public filing after it stated an intention to benefit from federal government incentives. The firm, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) focused on domestic manufacturing, initially said it would seek targets positioned to tap into government grants and tax credits. After an inquiry from the Associated Press about the potential conflict of interest, the sentence was removed from the document, with a law firm calling it a clerical error.</p>

The show follows Hemsworth as he learns a musical instrument and climbs an Alpine dam, pushing his physical and mental boundaries. This journey was partly motivated by a genetic test in the first season that revealed his heightened risk for Alzheimer's disease, which he says was a warning sign that encouraged him to prioritize his well-being.</p>
