        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Right-wing activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot while speaking at Utah Valley University, prompting an investigation into the incident. Kirk was answering a question from the audience when a shot, believed to be fired from the roof of a nearby building, struck him in the neck. Authorities are searching for a "college age" suspect and have released a photo of a person of interest wearing distinctive clothing, and the FBI has found a high-powered rifle wrapped in a towel in a wooded area. Kirk, known for founding Turning Point USA and his close ties to Donald Trump, was a controversial figure, sparking shock, grief, and anger across the political spectrum following his death. The article notes that the investigation is ongoing, with thousands of tips pouring in, reminiscent of the response to the Boston Marathon bombing. Optimism score is calculated based on the tragic nature of the event and the community's response to violence.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has cautioned Mexico to reconsider its plan to increase tariffs on Asia-made cars to 50%, threatening countermeasures. The ministry emphasized the importance of trade relations between China and Mexico and expressed concern over potential impacts on economic cooperation. Mexico's proposed tariff increase is part of a broader budget proposal affecting $52 billion in imports. This development occurs amidst ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, where China has previously implemented export restrictions on minerals crucial for car production. The article contextualizes the situation within the USMCA trade agreement and Mexico's auto industry, highlighting concerns about excess Chinese capacity. (not investment advice)</p>

Rubio criticized the Brazilian Supreme Court's decision as a "political witch hunt." Brazil's Foreign Ministry retorted that Rubio's comments were a threat to Brazilian authority. The article details the conviction of Bolsonaro and the U.S. reaction, including potential sanctions under the Magnitsky Act, while contextualizing the situation within the close relationship between Bolsonaro and Trump.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's newest aircraft carrier, the Fujian, sailed through the Taiwan Strait and into the South China Sea for exercises, according to the Chinese navy. The Fujian is undergoing sea trials and has yet to formally join the service, while China already has two carriers in operation, the Liaoning and the Shandong. China claims the Taiwan Strait as its own territory, but Taiwan's government rejects this claim. This transit highlights China's ongoing expansion of its naval power and its ambition to broaden its reach in the Pacific region. The optimism score is based on the potential for increased tensions in the region due to China's military activities.</p>
