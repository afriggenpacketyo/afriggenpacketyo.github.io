          <p>Salesforce reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with revenue growing 10% year-over-year. However, the company's stock fell in after-hours trading due to a disappointing revenue forecast for the upcoming third quarter. Despite touting strong sales for its new AI products like Agentforce, the enterprise software giant is facing challenges with slower growth in some product areas. Management maintained its full-year revenue outlook but the weaker short-term guidance has fueled investor concerns about its growth trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of gang affiliations. The court ruled that the current situation does not constitute an "invasion or predatory incursion," which is the legal standard required to invoke the wartime statute. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's strategy of using obscure laws for rapid deportations without extensive due process. The ruling provides a preliminary injunction for the plaintiffs involved, though they can still be removed under other legal authorities.</p>

          <p>Florida is preparing to become the first U.S. state to eliminate all vaccine requirements for children attending public schools, a move announced by Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo. This would repeal long-standing mandates for immunizations against diseases like polio, measles, and mumps. The plan has drawn immediate and harsh criticism from medical experts, public health officials, and teacher unions, who warn it could lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases and create a public health disaster. The timeline for implementing these changes remains unclear, as some repeals require legislative action.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has characterized the ongoing Jeffrey Epstein scandal as a "Democrat hoax," suggesting that calls for further transparency are a political distraction. His comments came as victims held a news conference on Capitol Hill and lawmakers continued to push for the public release of all investigation files. Trump stated that his administration has already released thousands of documents and that continued focus on the issue is unwarranted. This dismissal contrasts with bipartisan efforts in Congress to compel the Department of Justice to provide more information.</p>

          <p>At an emotional press conference on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring called for the full release of investigation files. One survivor, Lisa Phillips, announced that the group has started compiling a confidential list of Epstein's associates who they allege were involved in the abuse. The event was organized by lawmakers pushing for greater transparency from the Department of Justice. Survivors shared harrowing accounts of their experiences, emphasizing that their fear of repercussions prevents them from publicly naming individuals themselves.</p>

          <p>In an effort to stimulate its local economy, the Chinese city of Shaoxing is offering financial incentives for hosting large banquets. The municipal government will provide subsidies of up to 5,000 yuan (US$700) to individuals who host events with five or more tables and spend over 10,000 yuan. This policy is part of a broader push to encourage consumer spending in sectors like catering, cars, and housing. The measure highlights the balance local officials are trying to strike between boosting economic growth and adhering to national anti-corruption campaigns that discourage extravagance.</p>

The article describes tactics such as purchasing day passes for exclusive resorts to take hundreds of photos, or splitting the cost of a high-end rental for one night to make it appear like a week-long vacation. This online facade is often funded by debt, with a recent survey indicating that 31% of Gen Z travelers plan to borrow money for their summer trips.

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has ruled that the Trump administration acted unlawfully when it froze over $2.2 billion in research funding for Harvard University. The administration had justified the freeze by citing allegations of campus antisemitism, but Judge Allison D. Burroughs found this was used as a "smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault." The ruling stated the administration failed to follow the proper legal process before cutting off the funds, which support over 900 vital research projects in medicine and science. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>In Montana's Blackfoot Valley, ranchers are creating an alternative to the industrial food system through the Old Salt Co-op. By partnering with other local ranches, they are processing a significant portion of their own livestock and selling beef directly to consumers via their restaurants and butcher shop. This model emphasizes regenerative ranching, a practice that uses livestock to improve ecosystem health and allows land to rest for extended periods, making it more resilient to extreme weather. The initiative aims to provide food security and build a replicable model that supports local producers.</p>

          <h2>Poll Reveals Most Americans View the U.S. Economy as "Uncertain" and "Struggling"</h2>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov survey indicates that Americans continue to hold a negative view of the national economy, with ratings dipping slightly over the past month. The most commonly chosen words to describe the economy were "uncertain" and "struggling," while only a third selected positive terms like "rebounding." The primary driver of this sentiment remains the perception of rising prices, with two-thirds of respondents stating that prices are still increasing and expecting them to continue to do so. Overall, a majority believe the economy is getting worse rather than better. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The public affairs network C-SPAN has reached agreements to be carried by two major streaming services, YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV. This move comes two months after the nonprofit organization made a public appeal for wider distribution to address financial shortfalls caused by the decline in traditional cable television subscriptions. The deals will expand access to C-SPAN's unfiltered coverage of government proceedings for millions of new viewers. The U.S. Senate had previously passed a resolution urging streaming companies to carry the network to ensure public access.</p>

          <p>The UK government has acknowledged that more than 30,000 homes were fitted with substandard insulation under its ECO4 and Great British Insulation schemes since 2022. An energy minister described the situation as a "systemic failure" after an audit revealed widespread issues that could put homes at risk of damp and mould. The government has pledged to ensure that all faulty installations are identified and fixed at no cost to the homeowners. This admission follows media reports highlighting cases where botched work led to severe property damage and health concerns.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has systematically undermined the CDC, culminating in a recent victory lap that misrepresents his handling of a major measles outbreak. The author contends that Kennedy promoted unproven alternative remedies like vitamin A, downplayed the outbreak's severity, and has now ousted senior scientific leaders from the agency. Kennedy's recent op-ed, which praised the CDC's response as effective and free from ideology, is described as misleading and contrary to the facts of the prolonged and widespread outbreak.</p>

Benioff emphasized that the company's results were "absolutely fantastic" and highlighted the success of its AI agent products, which he claims are fundamentally transforming customers' businesses.

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma plunged 14% in extended trading after it released its first quarterly results since its July initial public offering.

For its third-quarter forecast, Figma projected revenue growth of about 33%, which was slightly ahead of consensus estimates.

Stines has pleaded not guilty to killing District Judge Kevin Mullins in his chambers, an act that was captured on security camera footage.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece explores the potential impact of a proposed development bank for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). The author argues that such an institution could create an alternative financial framework, making member states like Iran less vulnerable to U.S.-led sanctions and economic pressure. China's recent pledge of $1.4 billion in loans to SCO states is presented as a signal of this shift. For Iran, which faces the potential restoration of UN sanctions, integration into this framework is viewed as essential for economic survival and a strategic victory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge's ruling in the Justice Department's antitrust case against Google sent parent company Alphabet's stock up 9%. While the decision places some restrictions on Google's search business, it crucially rejected the government's call to force a divestiture of the Chrome web browser, which the judge deemed "incredibly messy and highly risky." The ruling is widely seen as a victory for the tech giant, sparing it from the most severe potential penalty. However, the judge did order Google to share some of its search data with rivals to help restore competition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis argues that the Trump administration is actively reframing the January 6 Capitol attack as a moment of triumph rather than an insurrection. The author points to the Air Force granting military funeral honors for Ashli Babbitt, the mass pardons of rioters, and discussions of a compensation fund for those prosecuted as evidence. This effort, the article contends, inverts reality by casting the perpetrators as victims and represents a justification of the event by force. It suggests that the cause of the insurrectionists, far from being lost, is now being validated by the executive branch.</p>
