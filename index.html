          <h2>George Kittle Becomes Highest-Paid Tight End After Signing Extension with 49ers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 12:53:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>George Kittle and the San Francisco 49ers have agreed to a four-year contract extension, securing his position as the highest-paid tight end in NFL history. The deal, valued at $76.4 million with $35 million guaranteed at signing, ensures Kittle remains with the team through the 2029 season. General Manager John Lynch praised Kittle's leadership and unique enthusiasm for the game, noting his contributions both on and off the field. This quick agreement contrasts with past contract negotiations that extended into the summer, and the 49ers still aim to finalize an extension with quarterback Brock Purdy, expected to exceed $50 million annually.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece criticizes President Trump's economic philosophy, particularly his approach to tariffs and trade, arguing that it aligns more with left-wing economic thought than traditional American conservatism. The article contends that Trump's view of America as a 'department store' where he sets prices reflects a belief that he, and experts he relies on, can better direct the economy than a free market. This perspective is contrasted with the arguments of classical economists like Adam Smith and Friedrich Hayek, who emphasized the complexity and informational challenges of central economic planning. The author suggests that many Republicans are abandoning core conservative economic principles by supporting Trump's approach.</p>

The project's creators aim to reshape the government in line with conservative principles, influencing policy and personnel decisions in a potential second Trump administration. Graham's new book, 'The Project,' explores the details and implications of this ambitious plan. The plan is very partisan and has little cross-aisle support.</p>

          <p>Boomer Esiason reports that Shedeur Sanders' slide in the 2025 NFL Draft was due to NFL owners' concerns about his attitude and perceived entitlement. Esiason claims that several owners instructed their personnel to remove Sanders from their draft boards, citing negative impressions from combine meetings. This aligns with reports of Sanders having a poor formal interview, with one coach describing it as the worst they'd ever experienced. Sanders was eventually drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round, after they had already selected another quarterback earlier in the draft.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's push for increased oil and gas production, oilfield service companies are facing challenges due to falling crude oil prices. U.S. crude oil prices have fallen below $65 per barrel, making increased production unprofitable for many companies, according to a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Executives in the shale oil industry have expressed concerns about 'uncertainty' related to Trump's policies. Baker Hughes, Halliburton, and SLB have warned of slowing investment in exploration and production due to these factors.</p>

          <p>Pfizer has announced an expansion of its cost-cutting measures, projecting additional savings of $1.2 billion by the end of 2027, primarily through automation and AI.

Pfizer maintained its full-year outlook but noted that the guidance does reflect $150 million in costs from Trump's existing tariffs.
