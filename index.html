          <p>The Daily Mail and other newspapers report that the US and the UK have reached a new trade agreement aimed at saving the British car industry from American tariffs. The Financial Times notes this is the first US trade deal since the start of Trump's trade war, with the UK securing concessions on car and steel exports, though a 10% levy remains on most goods. The Daily Telegraph reports the deal allows the US to object to Chinese firms investing in the UK, a claim disputed by the government. The Times highlights that both Sir Keir Starmer and President Trump described the agreement as 'historic'.</p>

          <p>Kent E. Calder, writing for KYODO NEWS, analyzes the renewed U.S. interest in acquiring Greenland, highlighting its strategic geographic location relative to Russia and Europe. He notes that Greenland lies across the most direct routes from Russia to the U.S. East Coast and discusses historical precedents, including the U.S. occupation during World War II and Truman's attempt to buy Greenland in 1946. Calder also emphasizes the impact of climate change, the opening of the Arctic Sea, and Russia's increasing assertiveness in the region. The article suggests the U.S. should consider a 'Compact of Free Association' agreement similar to those with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau to address sovereignty concerns while ensuring NATO security interests.</p>

The parade, attended by leaders from China, Brazil, and other countries, is seen as an effort by the Kremlin to showcase a counterweight to the West. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has rejected Putin's proposed cease-fire, calling it a theatrical show. The article also discusses the parade's symbolic meaning for Russia, the historical perspective of Victory Day, and disruptions in Moscow due to Ukrainian drone attacks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article examines how the Trump administration's skepticism towards offshore wind power is impacting the industry, particularly in Europe. The indefinite halt to the Empire Wind project off Long Island has shocked companies like Welcon in Denmark, which was contracted to build turbine towers. While the European wind industry is counting on Europe to compensate for a pullback in the U.S., rising prices and uncertainty have led to project cancellations, such as Orsted's decision to halt the Hornsea 4 wind facility in Britain. Despite these challenges, offshore wind has seen success in Northern Europe, with costs falling significantly between 2015 and 2020, though they have since risen again.</p>

          <p>A Massachusetts State Police sergeant testified that he initially suspected John O'Keefe was struck in the face with a bar glass, contradicting the prosecution's theory that Karen Read struck him with her car.

Read maintains she saw O'Keefe enter the house, while a witness testified she saw Read's vehicle outside but did not see either of them enter. Investigators recovered a broken glass and O'Keefe's missing sneaker from the scene, supporting their theory he was struck by a vehicle.</p>

          <p>BBC News reports that President Trump hinted at a possible reduction in US tariffs on goods from China as top trade officials prepare for talks. Trump stated that tariffs 'can't get any higher' and noted that the upcoming meeting in Switzerland is a positive sign for de-escalating the trade war. While China also expressed confidence, analysts caution that the negotiations will be lengthy and that any initial tariff cuts are likely to be minor. Experts suggest that even if new tariffs are lifted, significant issues between the two countries will remain unresolved.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC reports that China's exports surged in April, despite a significant drop in shipments to the U.S. due to prohibitive tariffs. Overall exports rose by 8.1%, while imports saw a slight decline of 0.2%. Shipments to the U.S. specifically plunged by over 21% year-on-year. Analysts suggest the surge in overall exports may be due to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced. The Chinese government has been encouraging exporters to shift sales to the domestic market, which could potentially exacerbate deflationary pressures.</p>

The 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports remains in place, but the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers each year are subject to that 10% rate, and additional vehicles will face 25% rates.</p>

China's April exports grew by 8.1 per cent year on year, beating market expectations. Analysts suggest that the damage from US tariffs has not yet appeared in trade data, possibly due to transshipment through other countries or contracts signed before the tariffs were announced. Trump has imposed tariffs of up to 145 per cent on a wide range of Chinese imports, leading to retaliatory duties by China.</p>

          <p>CNBC reports that China's latest stimulus measures have failed to boost its stock market as investors remain concerned about the economic impact of the trade war with the U.S. The stimulus package, including interest rate cuts and liquidity injections, was largely priced in by the markets. Unlike previous measures, this round of stimulus is more targeted at industrial and social needs rather than direct market support. Investors are awaiting more targeted fiscal measures to boost consumer sentiment and support the real estate sector.</p>

The use of A.I. in legal proceedings has sparked debate, with critics raising concerns about manipulation and deception. The judge, however, praised the inclusion of the A.I., describing its message as genuine. This case represents uncharted territory for the use of A.I. in the courtroom.</p>

          <p>BBC News reports that President Trump has appointed Fox News host and former New York prosecutor Jeanine Pirro as interim US attorney for Washington DC. The announcement follows the withdrawal of Trump's first pick for the job. Pirro, a long-time ally of Trump, replaces Ed Martin, who will become director of the 'weaponization working group'. Pirro's appointment raises concerns due to her past false statements about the 2020 election and Trump's pattern of pardoning and ending prosecutions against those involved in the January 6th riots.</p>

          <p>The Guardian reports that the Trump administration will immediately remove transgender troops from the military following a Supreme Court decision. The Pentagon will identify and involuntarily force trans people out of service using medical records. The move affects approximately 1,000 openly transgender members, with an additional 30 days given to those who have not yet openly identified. The policy is coupled with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's views that women are not suited for combat roles and reflects broader efforts to restrict LGBTQ+ rights.</p>

The film follows David, a character who returns to Buenos Aires from Italy after a family tragedy, grappling with his emotions and sexuality. Said wanted to portray realistic characters, including those who might not immediately evoke empathy.</p>

          <p>BBC News analyzes the US-UK trade deal, noting that the 10% import tax on most UK goods will remain intact. The agreement primarily involves the US walking back some import taxes on strategic sectors like cars and steel. In exchange, the White House anticipates expanded opportunities for American beef, ethanol, and agricultural products in the UK. Analysts suggest that the deal may have limited substantive benefits for the US, with some describing it as marginal changes labeled as a 'breakthrough'. American carmakers have voiced concerns about the deal making UK-made cars less expensive than those made in Mexico and Canada.</p>
