          <p>Thousands of Bulgarians gathered in Sofia and other cities to protest the country's plan to adopt the euro, reflecting fears about economic impact and mistrust of institutions. Demonstrators, including members of the pro-Russian Vazrazhdane party, carried flags and banners opposing the currency change and calling for a referendum. Bulgarian President Rumen Radev also opposes euro adoption, citing concerns about inflation, but parliament rejected his referendum proposal. The article highlights that disinformation campaigns have contributed to public anxiety about the economic transition, particularly among those in rural areas unfamiliar with international transactions.</p>

          <p>Hamas has responded to the latest U.S. ceasefire proposal, reiterating demands for a permanent ceasefire, complete withdrawal from Gaza, and continuous humanitarian aid. The group proposed a hostage exchange involving the release of 10 living hostages and the bodies of 18 dead hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff described Hamas's response as "completely unacceptable," insisting they agree to the U.S. framework before talks can proceed. Israel's defense minister warned Hamas to accept the deal or face destruction, as the IDF continues operations in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The Independent reports that obese patients in England and Wales are being denied hip and knee replacements to reduce NHS costs, despite NICE guidelines stating BMI shouldn't restrict access to surgery. Patients are required to lose weight, but NHS weight loss programs have long waiting lists, leading some to pay privately for surgery. The Royal College of Surgeons criticizes the policy, warning it could worsen patients' health and mobility, while experts highlight the postcode lottery and inequalities created by BMI thresholds. Former health minister James Bethell calls for a focus on preventing obesity through weight-loss interventions.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee is grappling with a lead poisoning crisis, leading to school closures and rigorous inspections, but faces challenges due to federal support cuts. After lead was detected in schools, the city sought help from the CDC, but the Trump administration denied the request due to staff layoffs. The city is proceeding with its own inspections and lead water service line replacements, but lacks the federal expertise to guide epidemiological investigations. This situation highlights the potential consequences of reduced federal involvement in public health emergencies.</p>

          <p>Popular Mexican band Grupo Firme canceled a California music festival performance after the U.S. government suspended their visas. The suspension follows a series of moves by the Trump administration targeting Mexican artists who glorify cartel violence in their music. Grupo Firme announced that the visas of the band and their team were under "administrative review" by the U.S. Embassy, preventing them from performing. The band had recently taken steps to distance themselves from music glorifying criminal groups.</p>

          <p>The World Food Programme (WFP) reports that crowds of civilians have rushed aid trucks in Gaza, creating chaotic scenes due to hunger and desperation. Despite the delivery of 77 trucks loaded with flour, all trucks were stopped and looted by hungry people seeking food for their families. The WFP cites the near-total blockade of Gaza for nearly 80 days as the reason for the desperation. The UN says the amount of aid sent recently covers just over 10% of people's needs, while Israeli air strikes continue in the region.</p>

          <p>This article explores the use of corporate buzzwords, questioning whether they foster inclusion or impede trust. Studies suggest that jargon can undermine trust, particularly among younger employees who may cling to buzzwords as a means of navigating workplace culture. The piece argues that buzzwords are often used to distract from the primary goal of making money, and suggests that clear, human language is more effective. It encourages readers to avoid jargon and embrace genuine communication.</p>
