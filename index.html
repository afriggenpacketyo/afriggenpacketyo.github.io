          <p>Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that Tehran reserves all options to defend itself following U.S. attacks on its nuclear enrichment facilities. The U.S. strikes targeted the Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan nuclear sites, which Araghchi described as having "everlasting consequences." He accused the U.S. and Israel of undermining recent diplomatic efforts, noting that negotiations were underway when the strikes occurred. President Trump claimed the strikes were a "spectacular military success" that obliterated Iran's key enrichment facilities, though this claim has not been independently verified. The International Atomic Energy Agency reported no radiation or contamination at the nuclear centers after the attacks.</p>

          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey indicates that most people in Japan are worried about the potential impact of the ongoing war in the Middle East on their daily lives, especially considering Japan's reliance on the region for oil.

          <p>David 'Syd' Lawrence, a former England and Gloucestershire fast bowler, has died at the age of 61 after being diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND) last year. Lawrence was the first British-born black cricketer to represent England, achieving this milestone in his career. He was appointed MBE in the King's Birthday Honours earlier this month in recognition of his efforts to raise money and awareness for MND. Throughout his 16-year career at Gloucestershire, Lawrence took 625 wickets in 280 matches and played five Test matches for England.</p>

          <p>An NPR report explores the increasing acceptance of self-managed medication abortion, a method involving abortion pills without direct doctor supervision, driven by factors like the COVID-19 pandemic and the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The FDA's decision to ease restrictions on mifepristone has expanded access through telehealth, though some states still maintain barriers. Clinicians initially expressed concerns about safety but were swayed by research demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of self-managed abortion. Despite increasing restrictions in some states, self-managed abortion is becoming more widespread, with the World Health Organization recognizing it as a safe method in the first trimester.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called on Iran to resume negotiations following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Starmer emphasized the importance of regional stability and described Iran's nuclear program as a significant threat to international security. He stated that Iran must not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons and that the U.S. intervention was to mitigate that threat. Iran's ambassador to the UK indicated that Iran is considering its response, while the UN Secretary-General labeled the strikes a "dangerous escalation."</p>

Maryam Rajavi, president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, called for Khamenei's removal and advocated for a free, democratic, and non-nuclear Iran.

          <p>An article from DW examines the potential consequences of regime change in Iran, particularly in light of the recent conflict. It highlights the historical failures of foreign-imposed regime change in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, noting that such interventions often lead to instability and violence. Experts caution against the possibility of achieving regime change in Iran from the outside, emphasizing the need for a strong internal rebel movement. The article concludes that regime change typically requires a ground invasion and support from local populations, which is unlikely to occur through aerial bombardment alone.</p>

The San Diego County District Attorney's Office recommended her conviction be overturned due to the new evidence, but initially decided to retry her.

          <p>Two Chinese studies suggest that advances in cell transplantation into the spleen could transform the organ into a hub for treating diabetes. Researchers at Nanjing University found that "shielding" islet cells could improve their survival after being transplanted into the spleen to treat type 1 diabetes. They also found that the spleen could be engineered into a transplant hub with the help of nanoparticles, offering a more promising long-term survival site than the liver. The research suggests that the spleen could become an ideal organ for islet transplantation if safety and effectiveness are demonstrated through clinical studies.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. air strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, President Trump claimed the sites have been "obliterated," while Israel stated they were in full coordination with the U.S. Iranian officials confirmed the strikes but denied major damage. The U.S. targeted Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with reports suggesting the use of GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators against Fordo. The Iranian Atomic Energy Organization condemned the strikes as a violation of international law, and the IAEA reported no increase in radiation levels. Experts and world leaders have reacted to the strikes, warning of potential escalation and calling for de-escalation and diplomatic solutions.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is gambling that the Iranian nuclear sites struck by the US have been "completely and totally obliterated" and that Iran will not retaliate against US bases or disrupt international shipping. The article notes that Trump's Middle East envoy previously warned that an Israeli strike on Iran would prompt a massive Iranian retaliation. If Iran does not retaliate effectively, it could be a game-changing moment, but if Iran manages to hit a US base and kill Americans, the situation could escalate. The article also points out that Trump is gambling that his supporters will support his decision to involve the US in a new war.</p>

          <p>The coming week will focus on the fallout from U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and related global market reactions.

President Trump's claim that the strikes "completely obliterated" Iran's enrichment facilities is unconfirmed, and Iran has vowed to defend its sovereignty.</p>
