          <p>A report supported by the UN indicates that over 14,000 migrants, primarily from Venezuela, have abandoned their journey to the U.S. and are heading south. This "reverse flow" is a direct result of stricter immigration policies under the Trump administration, which ended the asylum app used under President Biden. Many of these individuals, who previously braved the dangerous Darién Gap, are now returning to uncertain futures in South American countries or Venezuela itself. The report highlights their increased vulnerability, as they return with depleted funds and face exploitation by criminal groups.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has announced the cancellation of $679 million in federal funding for a dozen offshore wind projects. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated the funds were wasteful and would be repurposed for upgrading ports and other maritime infrastructure. This action is part of a broader campaign against renewable energy by the Trump administration, which recently ordered a halt to the nearly completed Revolution Wind project. Renewable energy executives have warned that these policies could lead to increased power prices for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the finalization of their divorce, Josh Hall, the ex-husband of HGTV star Christina Haack, posted a critical message on social media. Hall expressed relief at being legally divorced and a "free man," while cautioning against marrying someone who seeks constant public validation. The divorce settlement details indicate neither party will receive spousal support, with Haack retaining her properties and Hall keeping several vehicles. This marks the end of Haack's third marriage, which began in 2021.</p>

          <p>A growing number of large, historic "trophy" ranches in the American West are being put on the market for the first time in generations. High-end real estate brokers report that as families expand and heirs become geographically scattered or disagree on the properties' future, many are choosing to sell. The demand for these sprawling estates remains high, partly due to the "Yellowstone" effect, with wealthy buyers seeking privacy and a rural lifestyle. While sellers gain a financial windfall, the trend marks the end of long-held family legacies on these unique properties.</p>

          <p>The American Gaming Association estimates that a record $30 billion will be legally wagered on the upcoming NFL season, an 8.5% increase from the previous year. Major sportsbooks like FanDuel and DraftKings are preparing for their busiest period, facing increased competition from rivals and new market entrants. A significant challenge for the legal market remains the prevalence of unlicensed offshore sportsbooks. In response, state and city prosecutors are increasing enforcement actions against these illegal operations to reclaim lost tax revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to cancel nearly $5 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid using a rare "pocket rescission" maneuver not seen in almost 50 years. The move allows the president to withhold funds late in the fiscal year, causing them to expire before Congress can act. The proposed cuts target the State Department and USAID, drawing immediate and strong bipartisan pushback from Capitol Hill.

          <p>Crystal Palace is reportedly working to sign two new central defenders before the transfer deadline, a move that could facilitate defender Marc Guehi's potential transfer to Liverpool. The Premier League champions have been in talks for a £35 million deal for the England international, who has indicated he will not sign a new contract with Palace. While Palace manager Oliver Glasner publicly insists Guehi must stay, the club is reluctant to lose him on a free transfer next summer. Palace is reportedly in advanced talks for Toulouse's Jaydee Canvot and is also seeking an experienced defender.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of chipmaker Marvell Technology dropped sharply after the company's data center revenue for the fiscal second quarter fell short of analyst estimates. The company also issued a lackluster revenue forecast for the current quarter, projecting sales to be flat sequentially, which disappointed investors. While overall revenue grew 58% year-over-year, fueled by strong AI demand, the weaker-than-expected performance in the key data center segment and cautious guidance raised concerns about the company's near-term growth prospects, leading to a stock downgrade from Bank of America.

While it is far too early to determine if the system will strengthen into a named storm or what its eventual path might be, it is the only system currently being monitored for potential development.

His lawyers describe the constant moves as retribution for speaking out about the harsh conditions in detention, which he called a "living hell."

The administration claims the change is necessary for better monitoring and oversight.

          <p>This article argues that the Trump administration's AI Action Plan could have severe long-term consequences for health equity. By pushing for AI development free from "ideological bias" and slashing funding for research on marginalized communities, the administration incentivizes the use of incomplete or skewed data sets for medical AI. This risks encoding the biases of the current political moment into the clinical tools of the future, which could perpetuate and automate existing health disparities. History shows that once such biases are built into medical software and guidelines, the resulting harms can be difficult to undo.</p>
