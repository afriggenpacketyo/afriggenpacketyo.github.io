        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans, which will remove deportation protections and work permits for over 8,000 Afghans. The Department of Homeland Security justified the decision by stating that Afghanistan has an improved security situation and a stabilizing economy, making it safe for Afghans to return. This decision reverses the Biden administration's extension of TPS for Afghanistan, which cited a humanitarian crisis following the Taliban takeover. Advocates have criticized the move, calling it unconscionable and warning of long-lasting ripple effects, especially for those who worked with the U.S. military.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams reportedly used at least seven different cellphone numbers during a federal corruption investigation, a detail revealed in newly released documents. Adams explained that he used multiple phones for different purposes, including office, personal, and campaign use, noting that many New Yorkers have several phones. The F.B.I. tracked Adams's location using cellphone data and even sought permission to use a ‚Äúcell site simulator‚Äù to identify other devices he might be using. Adams bristled at the tactics used by federal authorities, attributing his inability to remember his primary phone's password to dyslexia and suggesting the timing of device seizures was intended to humiliate him.</p>

The reinstatements include staff in the respiratory health division, division of safety research, division of compensation and analysis support, and the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory. This reversal comes ahead of a congressional hearing with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., where he was expected to face questions about the layoffs. The reinstatements mean that programs such as the approval of N95 respirators and protective gear for firefighters can resume, though many workers at NIOSH and other CDC departments remain laid off.</p>

          <p>Lower tariffs on Chinese goods may reduce the incentive for Chinese auto-parts makers to establish production facilities in the U.S. Following trade talks, the U.S. agreed to reduce tariffs on most Chinese imports from 145% to 30% for 90 days, providing some relief to mainland-based producers. Despite the reduced tariffs, uncertainty remains, as businesses are wary of potential future tariff increases. Chinese-made EV batteries now face a 58.4% US tariff, a decrease from the previous 173.4%.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration can use the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to deport criminal illegal immigrant members of the Venezuelan Tren De Aragua gang, pending adequate prior notice. The judge stated that the ruling was confined to Venezuelan aliens who are not naturalized or lawful permanent residents, 14 years or older, and have been specifically designated as part of a Foreign Terrorist Organization, specifically Tren de Aragua. This decision contrasts with other rulings challenging the administration's deportation efforts. The judge emphasized that it is up to the political branches of the government to decide whether the laws and those executing them continue to reflect the will of the people.</p>

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to American special envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman. The proposal involves Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with oversight from representatives from various nations. This plan aims to offer a permanent solution, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, and could be seen as a significant achievement by President Trump.</p>

Despite higher-than-expected personal income and corporate tax receipts, the Newsom administration anticipates lower overall revenues due to the economic impact of the tariffs. Newsom is expected to project a deficit for California in the upcoming year, citing rising Medi-Cal costs and the expansion of healthcare coverage to undocumented immigrants.

          <p>Researchers in China are cautioning against the rapid adoption of DeepSeek's AI in hospitals, citing clinical safety and privacy risks. At least 300 hospitals in China have started using DeepSeek‚Äôs large language models (LLMs) in clinical diagnostics and medical decision support. The researchers warned that DeepSeek‚Äôs tendency to generate ‚Äúplausible but factually incorrect outputs‚Äù could lead to ‚Äúsubstantial clinical risk‚Äù. They suggest that healthcare professionals could become overreliant on the AI, leading to diagnostic errors or treatment biases, while more cautious clinicians could face the burden of verifying AI output in time-sensitive clinical settings.</p>

          <p>Brazilian microbiologist Mariangela Hungria has been awarded the World Food Prize for her decades-long research on soil bacteria that can act as fertilizer and boost crop harvests. Hungria's work at the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA) has contributed to Brazil becoming a major agricultural superpower. She identified useful strains of bacteria called rhizobia, which capture nitrogen from the air and convert it into a form that feeds plants. This discovery has allowed farmers to reduce their reliance on chemical fertilizers, saving money and reducing environmental impact.</p>

          <p>Under the leadership of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Food and Drug Administration is seeking to remove prescription fluoride supplements for children from the market. The FDA claims that ingested fluoride changes the human microbiome in a concerning way, even though the research it cites is inconclusive. The agency plans to conduct a safety review and remove these products by October 31, despite recommendations from the CDC and medical associations that support low doses of fluoride supplements for children in areas without fluoridated water. Critics argue this move contradicts years of research and best practices, removing a key tool for dentists in preventing cavities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has repeatedly vowed not to cut Medicaid, but House Republicans' bill to fund his agenda proposes significant cuts to the program. The bill aims to slash Medicaid spending by imposing work requirements, making more frequent eligibility checks, and penalizing states that offer Medicaid to illegal immigrants. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the proposal would save $715 billion over the next decade, but also result in 8.6 million more Americans becoming uninsured.

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in April rose 2.3% on an annual basis, slightly less than economists expected but still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

Grocery prices dropped slightly, with egg prices declining for the first time since October 2024. Economists are closely watching for signs that President Trump's tariffs are impacting consumer prices. The Federal Reserve is taking a wait-and-see approach on the tariffs, which could boost inflation and blunt economic growth.</p>

Sulzberger highlighted that the anti-press playbook, including sowing distrust, exploiting civil courts, abusing legal authority, amplifying attacks, and replacing independent media with government-friendly outlets, is being used in the U.S. The author concludes that democracy requires the press to arm everyone with the information and context they need to understand and meet the moment.</p>
