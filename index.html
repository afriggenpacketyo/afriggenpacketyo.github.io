          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has significantly increased its 2025 financial outlook after reporting second-quarter results that surpassed analyst expectations. The strong performance is driven by soaring demand for its popular diabetes drug, Mounjaro, and weight loss treatment, Zepbound, which generated a combined revenue of over $8.5 billion. The company raised its full-year sales guidance to between $60 billion and $62 billion. This optimistic forecast already accounts for existing U.S. tariffs but does not include potential new levies on imported pharmaceuticals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its experimental daily obesity pill, orforglipron, helped patients achieve nearly 12% weight loss in a late-stage clinical trial, a result that fell slightly below Wall Street's expectations. Following the news, the company's shares dropped, while rival Novo Nordisk's stock rose. Despite the market reaction, some medical experts praised the result as a significant and clinically meaningful outcome for an oral medication, which could expand access for patients averse to injections. The company plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval by the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

In a social media post, he stated the "new and highly accurate CENSUS" would be based on information from the 2024 presidential election. This move represents a renewed effort to alter the decennial count, which determines congressional representation and federal funding distribution. The announcement comes as the administration supports efforts in Texas to redraw congressional maps, which they claim could grant the state more seats.</p>

The call follows a letter from Senator Tom Cotton to Intel's chairman, which raised concerns about Tan's alleged financial ties to Chinese companies, including some reportedly linked to the Chinese military. Tan, a veteran of the semiconductor industry, was appointed as Intel's CEO in March.</p>

          <p>Despite significant economic headwinds like a pandemic, high inflation, and rising interest rates, the U.S. stock market has continued to surge, confounding traditional explanations. The article explores the shortcomings of various theories, from economic fundamentals to Federal Reserve liquidity, which have failed to fully account for the market's resilience. A prevailing new theory credits the boom to a speculative bubble around Artificial Intelligence, concentrated in a few tech giants. An alternative view suggests the structural shift toward passive investing, where funds automatically buy stocks regardless of market conditions, is creating a self-perpetuating upward trend.

          <p>In an economy with persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a way for savers to earn a return that can outpace the loss of buying power. This article explains that while national average CD yields are modest, top rates from online banks are significantly higher, with some one-year CDs offering APYs around 4.40%. It suggests that savers consider online banks, which have lower overhead, and short-term CDs, as the current inverted yield curve means they often have higher rates than long-term options. Laddering CDs is also proposed as a strategy to balance high short-term rates with long-term savings goals. (not investment advice)</p>

To secure the best possible rates in the current high-rate environment, it is recommended that borrowers strengthen their credit profiles, with scores in the mid-to-high 700s being ideal.

The journey is perilous due to overloaded and unseaworthy fishing boats, smugglers who force people overboard, and the lack of any official sea rescue operations.

          <h2>Explaining Semiconductors and the Rationale Behind Trump's Proposed 100% Tariffs</h2>

          <p>This article provides an overview of semiconductors, the essential microchips that power modern technology, and examines President Trump's plan to impose 100% tariffs on foreign-made imports. The policy is part of a broader strategy to incentivize manufacturing within the U.S. and address national security concerns over reliance on foreign supply chains, particularly from Taiwan and South Korea. However, the tariffs may be avoidable for companies that invest in U.S. production facilities, a caveat that could spare major players like TSMC and Samsung. The move could still impact the broader tech industry and potentially raise consumer prices for electronics. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Restaurant Brands International, parent company of Burger King, Tim Hortons, and Popeyes, reported mixed second-quarter financial results. While overall revenue surpassed expectations at $2.41 billion, adjusted earnings per share of 94 cents fell short of analysts' forecasts. The company's performance was bolstered by strong same-store sales growth internationally and at Tim Hortons. However, Popeyes was a weak spot, reporting a 1.4% decline in same-store sales, though this was an improvement from the previous quarter. Burger King's U.S. turnaround showed modest progress with a 1.5% increase in same-store sales.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a planned meeting between Presidents Trump and Putin, a rapid resolution to the war in Ukraine appears unlikely due to the vast differences in the two sides' positions. This analysis highlights that Russia's core demands, including sovereignty over occupied Ukrainian territories and Kyiv's demilitarization, effectively amount to a surrender. While the Kremlin may be engaging in dialogue to fend off further U.S. sanctions, there is little indication it is prepared to alter its fundamental goals. Concerns exist in Ukraine that Trump could be swayed by Putin, making Kyiv's involvement in any negotiations critical to protecting its interests.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee voted by a narrow 5-4 margin to cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points, from 4.25% to 4%. The decision reflects a difficult balancing act for policymakers, who are weighing persistent inflation against a cooling labor market and stagnant economic growth. The close vote, which required two rounds to reach a majority, highlights the uncertainty surrounding the UK's economic path. While the bank described its approach as "gradual and careful," the move was welcomed by the UK government as relief for mortgage and loan costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's government and markets have shown a calm response to the U.S. announcement of a 50% tariff on its goods, suggesting a belief that the move is a pressure tactic for trade negotiations. The action has united Indian political parties, strengthening the government's resolve, particularly on issues affecting farmers. While the tariffs pose a significant economic cost, analysis suggests it is not debilitating, as over 60% of India's GDP is from domestic consumption. India has made some concessions but is holding firm on key issues while pursuing diplomatic channels with Russia and China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan's critical semiconductor industry is facing significant pressure from the Trump administration's threat to impose a 100% tariff on imported chips. The policy is designed to compel foreign companies to establish manufacturing operations in the United States to avoid the levy. While industry giant TSMC may be exempt due to its existing investment in Arizona, the threat is rattling the broader Taiwanese tech sector. This new pressure comes as a separate 20% U.S. tariff on a range of other Taiwanese goods has just taken effect, increasing economic uncertainty for the export-reliant island.

          <p>Toyota, the world's largest automaker, has lowered its annual operating profit forecast by over $4 billion, attributing the revision to the impact of U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles. While its June-quarter results exceeded estimates, operating profit fell 11% year-on-year, with the company stating that U.S. tariffs were responsible for 450 billion yen in losses. The 25% tariff has pressured Japanese carmakers to cut prices to remain competitive in the U.S. market. A recent U.S.-Japan trade deal is expected to lower tariffs, which may offer some future relief. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order that will direct the Department of Labor to review guidance on including alternative assets in 401(k) plans. This move would open the door for investments like private equity, real estate, and cryptocurrencies to be included in defined-contribution retirement accounts. The alternative asset industry has long advocated for this change, which could unlock a significant pool of capital from the trillions held in American 401(k)s. While proponents see it as a way to boost returns, these assets typically carry higher risks, fees, and less transparency than traditional investments. (not investment advice)</p>
