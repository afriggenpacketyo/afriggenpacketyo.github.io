          <p>The fatal shooting of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk at a university event in Utah has drawn widespread condemnation from across the American political spectrum. President Trump, a close associate of Kirk, announced his death and ordered flags to be flown at half-staff, while also blaming radical rhetoric for the violence. Figures such as former presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama, along with numerous Republican and Democratic lawmakers, universally decried the act, emphasizing that political violence has no place in a democracy. The unified response highlights the shocking nature of the event in a deeply polarized nation.</p>

          <p>China has opened the Changtai Yangtze River Bridge, now the world's longest cable-stayed bridge, in Jiangsu province. The massive 10.3km structure connects the cities of Changzhou and Taizhou, dramatically reducing travel time from over an hour to just 20 minutes. This engineering feat is the first crossing on the river to integrate an expressway, a regular road, and an intercity railway on a single structure. Its innovative design features an asymmetrical lower deck to balance the weight of the different transport modes, showcasing a significant advancement in bridge construction.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 benchmark index surged to a new record high, reflecting overnight gains on Wall Street fueled by hopes for a Federal Reserve rate cut and positive inflation data. A significant driver of the rally was tech investment giant SoftBank Group, whose shares jumped nearly 10%. While the Nikkei led gains in Asia, other regional markets showed mixed results, with South Korea's Kospi advancing while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index and mainland China's CSI 300 saw declines. The market movement underscores investor sensitivity to U.S. economic indicators and monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is appealing a federal judge's order that temporarily blocks him from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The judge had ruled that Cook demonstrated a strong likelihood of winning her lawsuit, which argues her removal would violate the Federal Reserve Act's requirement for legal "cause." The ruling emphasized that maintaining the Federal Reserve's independence is in the public interest. This legal battle is part of a broader context where President Trump is attempting to exert greater influence over the central bank's board and its interest rate policies.</p>

          <p>A recent Goldman Sachs report indicates that massive spending on AI data centers by the "Magnificent Seven" tech companies, such as Nvidia and Microsoft, is constraining share buybacks across the S&P 500. The report notes that significant capital expenditures on AI infrastructure appear to be "crowding out" funds that would typically be used for repurchasing stock. While S&P 500 buybacks are projected to rise next year, Goldman Sachs warns that this growth may be limited if the intense investment in AI technology continues at its current high rate.

          <p>Senior cancer specialists in England are warning that excessive bureaucracy is creating a "postcode lottery," denying some patients access to the latest life-saving cancer treatments. According to the Royal College of Radiologists, the process for securing funding for innovative therapies is often cumbersome, leading to significant disparities in care across the country. As a result, cutting-edge treatments are often only available at larger, better-funded hospitals, creating an inequitable system that is incompatible with the principles of the National Health Service. The government is expected to release a new cancer strategy to address these issues.</p>

Harris also claims that Biden's inner circle failed to defend her from political attacks and sometimes added to negative narratives.

          <p>Dr. Xand van Tulleken outlines five practical, science-supported methods for managing stress, noting that while the stress hormone cortisol is often viewed negatively, it is essential for daily function. The key is to maintain balance rather than eliminate it entirely. His advice includes accepting stress as a normal part of life without panicking, using exercise to train the body to handle cortisol spikes, and prioritizing a consistent sleep schedule. He also recommends focusing on self-care through proper nutrition and carving out dedicated time for relaxation and mindfulness.</p>

For consumers, this would mean extending an existing surcharge of about $3 on their monthly bills for an additional ten years beyond its 2035 expiration.

Cramer highlighted Klarna's solid credit quality and automated underwriting standards as positive signs, suggesting the company is well-positioned for future growth even as it remains unprofitable for now.

          <p>In an effort to stimulate housing construction, California lawmakers have introduced a bill to reform Los Angeles's Measure ULA, commonly known as the "mansion tax." The legislation aims to address criticisms that the tax has deterred the development of new apartment buildings and commercial properties by significantly reducing the tax rate for such projects built within the last 15 years. This move is also part of a broader political strategy to undermine a potential statewide ballot measure that threatens to nullify Measure ULA and other local taxes completely.</p>

          <p>Traditional television cooking shows are facing a steep decline, with commissions for new food-related programs having dropped by 44% in the past year. This downturn is occurring as audiences shift their attention to food content on social media platforms like YouTube and TikTok. Online creators offer a sense of authenticity and can respond to culinary trends almost instantly, a nimbleness that the structured and regulated world of broadcast television cannot match. The trend reflects a wider cultural shift in media consumption, where viewers increasingly favor the raw, direct engagement of influencers over polished television productions.</p>

          <p>A joint investigation has uncovered that the prominent international charity SOS Children's Villages was involved in the forced separation of children from their families under Syria's Assad regime. The report alleges that the charity's Syrian branch took in children of political detainees, complied with intelligence agency orders to deny relatives access, and in some cases, changed children's identities, making them nearly impossible to trace. Whistleblowers claim the charity's leadership in Syria had close ties to the Assad family, raising profound questions about the organization's complicity in human rights abuses during the country's civil war.</p>

          <p>On the 30th anniversary of CNBC's "Squawk Box," host Jim Cramer reflected on the evolution of market sentiment, noting that the optimism of the 1990s feels similar to today's environment. He stated that after the dotcom bubble burst, many investors became risk-averse and favored index funds, but now there is a renewed excitement for the potential rewards of owning individual stocks. Cramer believes the show played a key role in democratizing financial information and sees the current interest in high-performing single stocks like Oracle and Nvidia as a welcome return to form.

Speaking to a Senate subcommittee, Michael Kratsios stated that the U.S. competitive gap has closed significantly and is in danger of being lost. He advocated for exporting cohesive "AI tech stacks"—which integrate chips, algorithms, and applications—to allied nations. This approach is intended to prevent China from capturing global market share and to strengthen the U.S. ecosystem by coordinating with allies on export controls and supply chain security.</p>

Brook expressed frustration with the chaotic conditions, stating that no meaningful conclusions could be drawn from the contest.

MPs expressed continued concern that the savings product's dual purpose—for both a first home and retirement—is confusing and can lead consumers to make poor investment choices. The committee also questioned the value of the LISA to taxpayers, as it is projected to cost £3 billion over five years, with research suggesting most recipients could have purchased a home without it.</p>

          <p>Researchers are studying the remarkable diversity of Australia's peacock spiders, which comprise over 100 different species, to unlock the secrets of evolution. Scientists believe the key may be found in the spiders' "dark DNA"—the vast sections of the genetic code that do not contain genes. These spiders have three times more dark DNA than humans, and it is hypothesized that this material enables them to adapt and evolve into new species with unique colors and mating dances very rapidly. This research could provide broader insights into how variation arises across the natural world.</p>
