          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from enforcing a provision in a new law that would halt Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood. The lawsuit, filed by the reproductive health organization, argues the provision unconstitutionally targets them for providing legal abortion services, which are not funded by federal dollars. The order protects funding for non-abortion-related health services for 14 days, with a court hearing scheduled to determine the next steps in the legal battle. Pro-life groups have condemned the lawsuit, viewing the original provision as a significant victory.</p>

          <p>Federal and state authorities have arrested ten people for their alleged involvement in a "planned ambush" on an ICE detention center in Alvarado, Texas. The suspects, dressed in military-style gear, reportedly used fireworks to lure officers out before vandalizing the facility and opening fire, injuring one police officer. U.S. Attorney Nancy Larson described the event as an attempt to kill federal officers. Searches uncovered body armor, weapons, and flags associated with anti-fascist and anti-oligarchy movements, pointing to a politically motivated attack.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting in Philadelphia's Grays Ferry neighborhood has resulted in three fatalities and nine injuries, prompting a search for three suspects captured on surveillance video. The incident occurred early Monday morning, adding to a violent holiday weekend in the city. Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel stated that nearly 140 pieces of ballistic evidence were recovered, suggesting an automatic weapon was used. Among the injured are several juveniles, while one victim remains in critical condition. Officials believe there was an exchange of gunfire at a gathering of around 40 people.</p>

          <p>Officials have confirmed the recovery of remains belonging to all seven workers who were missing after a massive explosion at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The facility, operated by Devastating Pyrotechnics, was reportedly not permitted to store fireworks at that location. The property owner is identified as a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant. The incident, which also sparked an 80-acre grass fire, is now transitioning into a law enforcement investigation involving state and federal agencies, including the ATF.</p>

Authorities cited public uncertainty over the event's legal status, which was fueled by Budapest's mayor declaring it an official municipal event. This decision comes amid a broader anti-LGBTQ+ agenda from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. Despite the ban and threat of fines, the march attracted a record crowd of over 200,000 people.</p>

          <p>Nearly 600 tech founders and professionals have signed an open letter demanding that venture capital firm Sequoia Capital denounce controversial comments made by one of its partners, Shaun Maguire. Maguire posted on social media that New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani "comes from a culture that lies about everything" and is advancing an "Islamist agenda." The letter calls for a public apology, an independent investigation into Maguire's behavior, and a zero-tolerance policy on hate speech.

          <p>A report from the chief inspector of prisons in England and Wales has warned that an overwhelming flow of smuggled drugs is destabilizing the prison system. Criminal gangs are using methods like drones to supply contraband to inmates, fueling criminality that inexperienced and short-staffed prison personnel cannot contain. The report found that overcrowding and a lack of rehabilitative activities contribute to drug use. The watchdog, Charlie Taylor, stated that the failure to control this issue presents a significant challenge and a potential threat to national security.</p>

          <p>The deadly flash flood in Texas serves as a stark warning for California, which faces similar dangers from extreme weather. Experts note that California's hilly topography and river systems create a high potential for flash flooding, as seen in past events like the 2018 Montecito debris flows. While California's storms are typically different, climate change is increasing the risk of intense "atmospheric river" events that could overwhelm watersheds. The article highlights that many communities and homeless populations in California live in flood-prone areas, underscoring the state's vulnerability to a similar catastrophe.</p>

          <p>Market analyst Jim Cramer has advised investors not to overreact to President Trump's latest tariff announcements, suggesting the threatened rates are not "meaningful" and likely represent a starting point for negotiations. He argued that the administration has a history of postponing or reducing tariffs and that the ultimate goal may be to boost U.S. exports rather than to implement the steep levies as announced. While acknowledging the market's negative reaction, Cramer believes the tariffs may not significantly impact inflation or Federal Reserve policy if they are indeed part of a broader negotiating strategy.
