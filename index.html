          <p>Officials in Pennsylvania have confirmed intermittent, statewide outages affecting the Next Generation 911 network. The issue, which began Friday afternoon, is not a complete failure but is causing some calls to lack crucial data like location and callback numbers. The state's Emergency Management Agency has activated emergency protocols and alerted the public, advising residents to use local seven-digit emergency numbers if they cannot reach 911. Authorities do not suspect a cyberattack and are urging the public to avoid making non-emergency test calls to the system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A preliminary report from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau reveals that the fuel switches for both engines on the crashed Air India flight were moved to the "cutoff" position just seconds after takeoff. This action caused the engines to lose thrust, leading to the crash that killed 270 people. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why they cut the fuel, with the other denying the action. Investigators have not yet determined if the act was intentional or inadvertent but have found no significant faults with the Boeing 787-8 aircraft or its engines.</p>

          <h2>John Goodman Reveals He and Former Co-Star Roseanne Barr Have Not Spoken in Years</h2>

          <p>Actor John Goodman has disclosed that he and his former "Roseanne" co-star, Roseanne Barr, have been estranged for approximately seven or eight years. This follows Barr's 2018 dismissal from the show's revival over a racist tweet, which led to the series being rebranded as "The Conners." Goodman reminisced about their previously strong working relationship, while Barr recently stated she no longer speaks to any of her former co-stars from the show. "The Conners" concluded its run in April, and Goodman has since moved on to other projects like HBO's "The Righteous Gemstones."</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened its new Wonsan Kalma beach resort, recently welcoming its first group of Russian tourists in a move to boost its economy and strengthen ties with Moscow. A BBC Verify investigation, using satellite imagery and insider accounts, highlights concerns over the project's construction, which allegedly involved forced labor from "shock brigades" working under brutal conditions. The resort, inspired by a fact-finding mission to Benidorm, Spain, features numerous hotels and amenities, but experts question its ability to attract significant numbers of foreign tourists due to the country's restrictive environment.</p>

This recalibration comes as his government navigates the complexities of the AUKUS security pact and rising geopolitical tensions in the Asia-Pacific.

Lula stated that if negotiations fail, Brazil will invoke its reciprocity law, escalating the risk of a trade war between the two major economies.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has confirmed that the United States has resumed sending military supplies, after a brief pause in some critical arms shipments last week. The renewal of aid follows a deal announced by President Trump where NATO will purchase U.S. Patriot air defense systems and distribute them to Ukraine. This comes as Russia has intensified its aerial attacks, causing record civilian casualties and prompting urgent requests from Kyiv for more robust air defenses. The move signals a renewed effort by the U.S. and its allies to bolster Ukraine's defenses against relentless Russian bombardment.</p>

          <p>A significant clash has erupted within the Department of Justice between Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino over the public handling of a review into the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. The conflict, which reportedly led to Bongino not showing up for work on Friday, follows the release of a memo concluding Epstein died by suicide and that no "client list" was found. This finding was unconvincing to some of President Trump's supporters. The internal dispute has created an atmosphere of uncertainty and recrimination at the highest levels of U.S. law enforcement.</p>

          <p>A satirical opinion piece in The Atlantic questions the current state and future of America's space program, suggesting that perhaps "we don't need to go to space anymore." The article highlights recent NASA workforce reductions, deep budget cuts proposed by the Trump administration, and the appointment of a former reality TV star as the agency's interim head. It sarcastically argues that these developments are fitting for an administration focused on undoing past achievements. The piece concludes that ambitious national endeavors like space travel are now seemingly being left to billionaires rather than being a collective public goal.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has thrown out a plea agreement for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the accused mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, and two of his co-defendants. The deal would have allowed the men to plead guilty in exchange for life sentences, sparing them the death penalty. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had moved to revoke the agreement, arguing that the victims' families and the public deserve to see a full trial. The court ruled that Austin acted within his legal authority, reversing a lower military court's decision and likely sending the long-stalled case back toward a full military commission trial.</p>

This occurred even as the chatbot acknowledged the premise was flawed. The article suggests that Musk's focus on creating a "non-woke" AI may have resulted in fewer safeguards against bias.</p>
