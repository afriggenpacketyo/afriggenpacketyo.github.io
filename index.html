          <p>Authorities have constructed a timeline of the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The suspect reportedly arrived near campus shortly before noon, with the shooting occurring around 12:23 p.m. MT. Video evidence and dispatch audio indicate the shot was fired from the roof of a nearby campus building, after which a person in tactical gear was seen fleeing the scene. The timeline, which will be updated as the investigation continues, consolidates information from official statements, video metadata, and emergency dispatch communications to provide a clearer picture of the tragic event as it unfolded.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has confirmed that goalkeeper Andre Onana is joining Turkish club Trabzonspor on a loan deal for the remainder of the 2025-26 season. The move was completed just before the Turkish transfer window closed. Onana, who was signed from Inter Milan for £47.2m in 2023 by former manager Erik ten Hag, has not featured in the team's first three Premier League games this season under new coach Ruben Amorim. His only appearance came during a surprising Carabao Cup defeat, prompting the temporary transfer to secure more playing time.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that the recently merged Paramount Skydance is actively preparing an all-cash offer to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, causing shares of both companies to rise significantly. While no formal bid has been received, one could be presented as soon as next week. A merger would create a media titan, combining major film studios, numerous pay TV networks like CBS and CNN, and extensive sports rights portfolios under a single entity. This potential consolidation comes as the media industry continues to adapt to the disruptive shift from traditional pay TV to streaming services. (not investment advice)</p>

These reforms include gradually reducing the Fed's large bond portfolio and diminishing its overall economic footprint.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Average interest rates for 30-year mortgages have fallen to 6.35%, their lowest level in almost a year, creating a potential opportunity for homebuyers and those considering refinancing. This decline is attributed to expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut and a cooling 10-year Treasury yield. While waiting for rates to drop further is a gamble, the current climate may justify taking action for those with higher existing mortgage rates. Experts advise that a rate reduction of at least one percentage point typically makes refinancing financially beneficial, though individual circumstances vary. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FBI has released images of a person of interest and is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The investigation has seen rapid developments, including the recovery of a high-powered rifle believed to be the weapon used in the attack. Authorities have been able to track the suspect's movements, indicating the individual arrived on the Utah Valley University campus, fired from a roof, and fled into a nearby neighborhood.

          <p>A proposed California bill to ban PFAS, or "forever chemicals," in products like nonstick cookware has created a conflict between environmental advocates and a group of celebrity chefs. Actor Mark Ruffalo and health organizations support the ban, citing risks from the chemicals accumulating in the body and environment. Conversely, chefs like Rachael Ray and Thomas Keller, backed by the cookware industry, argue that nonstick coatings like Teflon are safe when used correctly and that a ban could make home cooking more difficult. The legislation, which has passed the state Senate, highlights the ongoing debate over regulating widely used but potentially harmful chemicals.</p>

          <p>Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has declared that offshore wind energy has no future in the United States under the Trump administration, citing high costs and unreliability. This statement represents the administration's clearest stance against the renewable energy source to date. On his first day in office, President Trump had already barred new offshore wind leases, and Burgum confirmed that five projects already under construction are now under intense review. The administration's position creates significant uncertainty for the nascent U.S. offshore wind industry and multi-billion dollar investments already made in ongoing projects.</p>

          <p>The assassination of Charlie Kirk is examined in this article as a symptom of a deepening cycle of political violence in the United States. The author reflects on how extreme rhetoric and acts of violence are amplified by social media, creating a dangerous feedback loop. While acknowledging the severity of the current climate, the article also posits that the majority of Americans do not desire a civil war and are attached to the stability of daily life. It concludes by urging leaders to unequivocally condemn all political violence and for citizens to recognize that de-escalation is essential for preserving democracy.</p>

          <p>Belarus has freed 52 political prisoners, including prominent activists and journalists, as part of an agreement with the Trump administration to secure an easing of U.S. sanctions. In exchange, the U.S. will allow the Belarusian national airline, Belavia, to purchase aircraft parts. The release was framed as a humanitarian gesture by authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko, who met with a U.S. special envoy to discuss rebuilding trade relations. While the move is a significant development, human rights groups note that over 1,000 political prisoners still remain incarcerated in the country.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are moving forward with a controversial rules change, known as the "nuclear option," to speed up the confirmation process for President Trump's sub-cabinet level nominees. The move aims to overcome a procedural blockade by Democrats, who have slowed confirmations in protest of the administration's policies. Majority Leader John Thune argues the change is necessary to allow the president to staff his administration effectively. Democrats have warned that altering long-standing Senate rules will lead to further partisan escalation and could be a decision Republicans will later regret.</p>

          <p>A recent government inflation report indicates that President Trump's tariffs are contributing to rising prices for a range of consumer goods, including apparel, electronics, and groceries. The data shows that prices for tariff-sensitive items are climbing at a time when the labor market is also showing signs of weakness, creating concern for both consumers and Federal Reserve policymakers. While the administration has insisted tariffs would not drive inflation, economists note that the price hikes on basic necessities are creating a squeeze on middle-class households.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Based on recent inflation data, new estimates project that the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 could be between 2.7% and 2.8%. This would provide a modest increase to the monthly checks received by millions of beneficiaries, with the average retirement benefit potentially rising by about $54 per month. While this is slightly higher than the 2.5% adjustment for 2025, it remains well below the record-high increases seen during the peak of post-pandemic inflation. The official COLA will be announced in October after the final month of third-quarter inflation data is calculated. (not investment advice)</p>
