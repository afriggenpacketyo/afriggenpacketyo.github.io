          <p>A recent report details unusual requests and management practices within the Department of Interior under Secretary Doug Burgum. Allegations include instructing staff to bake cookies for Burgum and his guests using department facilities, using a U.S. Park Police helicopter for personal transportation, and assigning political appointees to serve food at meetings. While some officials defend these actions as part of standard hospitality or necessary for security, others have raised concerns with senior White House officials, describing Burgum's behavior as diva-like and reporting resignations and tears among staff. The Interior Department has dismissed these claims as smears intended to undermine President Trump's energy agenda.</p>

          <p>The United States has revoked all visas for South Sudanese passport holders and halted the issuance of new visas due to South Sudan's failure to comply with US repatriation efforts. The State Department cited South Sudan's lack of cooperation in accepting the return of its citizens as the reason for the drastic measure. This action, impacting all South Sudanese visa holders, marks a significant escalation in immigration enforcement under the Trump administration. The US government has indicated a willingness to review these actions if South Sudan demonstrates full cooperation in the future.</p>

          <p>Recent events, including wildfires and geopolitical conflicts, are highlighting the risks associated with self-custody of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. While many prefer self-custody for its decentralization and control, it presents unique security challenges, such as loss of private keys due to natural disasters or inheritance complications upon the owner's death. Experts recommend multi-signature setups and diversification of storage approaches to mitigate these risks. Companies are developing solutions that merge convenience with enhanced security, but the tension between the two remains a significant barrier to wider crypto adoption.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's new tariff regime, enacted through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, faces significant implementation challenges due to the federal government's lack of resources and preparedness. The policy's goals, including correcting global imbalances and restoring manufacturing, surpass the current capacity of agencies like Customs and Border Protection. The absence of a formal rulemaking process and interagency coordination further exacerbate the issue. Importers and consumers are likely to be impacted by delays and increased prices, while global exporters may seek workarounds, potentially undermining the policy's revenue projections.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a significant downturn due to concerns about the economic impact of new U.S. tariffs and the potential for a global trade war. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted, and the Nasdaq Composite entered a bear market. Economists have downgraded their outlook for U.S. economic growth, citing the tariffs' potential to increase inflation and reduce consumer spending. China has retaliated with tariffs on U.S. products, further escalating trade tensions. The market decline has erased trillions of dollars in investor wealth, highlighting the economic uncertainty surrounding the administration's trade policies. (<br><i>not investment advice</i>)</p>

          <p>Quantum computing is advancing, with companies like Google, IBM, and D-Wave exploring different approaches and applications. While universal gate-based models are still under development, annealing quantum technology is already delivering commercial value in optimization. Potential applications range from medical insights and drug discovery to last-mile delivery optimization and port logistics. The technology has the potential to revolutionize industries by solving complex problems beyond the capabilities of classical computers and AI. However, the timeline for widespread commercial viability remains uncertain. (<br><i>not investment advice</i>)</p>

          <p>A second child with measles has reportedly died in Texas amid a growing outbreak, raising concerns about vaccine hesitancy and public health. The Trump administration health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, is expected to attend the funeral, despite his history of spreading misinformation about vaccines. The outbreak has infected nearly 500 people in Texas, with the majority of cases concentrated in an undervaccinated Mennonite community. The US has surpassed 600 measles cases this year, exceeding the total number recorded in 2024.</p>

          <p>A growing number of millennials are taking on multiple jobs, a trend known as "polyworking," to cope with inflation and stagnant wages. More than half of millennials are working more than one job, with many holding three or more income-earning opportunities. While this provides financial stability and opportunities for skill development, it also raises concerns about work-life balance and the potential for burnout. Some view polyworking as a form of entrepreneurship, while others see it as a necessary response to economic pressures and limited wage growth.</p>

          <p>National security adviser Mike Waltz mistakenly added a journalist to a Signal group chat discussing US strikes in Yemen. This occurred due to an error where Waltz's phone saved the journalist's number under the contact information of a Trump spokesperson, Brian Hughes. The internal investigation revealed that this happened after Hughes forwarded an email from the journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg, to Waltz. Trump initially considered firing Waltz, but ultimately decided against it. The White House authorized the use of Signal because there is no alternative platform to text in real time across different agencies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is challenging a federal judge's order to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Government lawyers argue that the judge lacks the authority to compel the executive branch to engage with a foreign power. Abrego Garcia, who had been granted protection from deportation, was mistakenly sent to El Salvador, where he is being held in a prison known for human rights abuses. The government's actions have sparked outrage and concerns about the deportation of noncitizens with legal permission to be in the U.S.</p>
