          <p>Campbell's CEO Mick Beekhuizen reports that consumers are cooking at home at the highest levels since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, signaling a tightening of wallets amid economic uncertainty. This trend is observed across all income brackets within the meals and beverages category. The increase in home cooking may indicate a decrease in dining out, which could negatively impact consumer spending and, consequently, the gross domestic product. Campbell's made these observations after exceeding Wall Street's expectations in its fiscal third quarter, despite a slight dip in shares. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new international study has found that colon cancer patients who participated in a three-year exercise program saw improved survival rates. The research, presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting, showed that the exercise program rivaled the benefits of some drugs in keeping the disease at bay. Patients in the exercise group not only became more active but also experienced 28% fewer cancers and 37% fewer deaths from any cause, though some experienced muscle strains. Experts suggest that cancer centers and insurance plans should consider making exercise coaching a standard of care for colon cancer survivors.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning a major overhaul of the country's flight paths, potentially leading to shorter flight times, fewer delays, and increased capacity. The UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) will redesign routes, many of which were established 70 years ago, with initial focus on the airspace around London. While the changes are not expected to take effect for several years, the government hopes they will also reduce aviation's climate impact and enable new technologies like flying taxis. However, environmental groups fear the redesign could expose more communities to noise and air pollution.</p>

This suggests that the Court's approach to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) may stem from skepticism toward environmental regulation in general.

          <p>Melissa Febos's memoir, *The Dry Season*, explores her year-long celibacy as a means to break free from a dependence on romance. Febos, who had been in relationships for 20 consecutive years, sought to find balance and personal identity outside of partnerships.
