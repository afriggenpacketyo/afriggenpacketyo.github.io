        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shohei Ohtani went 1-for-3 with an RBI, helping the Los Angeles Dodgers secure a 6-5 win against the Washington Nationals. Ohtani's single in the fourth inning extended the Dodgers' lead, while Miguel Rojas contributed a two-run homer. Manager Dave Roberts confirmed that Ohtani would still pitch against Washington on Sunday, despite being hit by a fastball in the previous game. Tomoyuki Sugano and Yusei Kikuchi also featured in other MLB games, with varying degrees of success, as Sugano was pulled early and Kikuchi pitched well but did not factor in the decision. The Dodgers' victory highlighted Ohtani's continued impact on the team's performance. The final score was a testament to the Dodgers' ability to capitalize on key opportunities throughout the game.</p>

          <p>Following the shooting of two Minnesota lawmakers by a suspect posing as a police officer, authorities are advising the public on how to verify law enforcement personnel. Police Chief Mark Bruley recommends calling 911 to confirm an officer's identity, and former Chief Brian Higgins suggests not opening the door to unverified individuals. Higgins also advises citizens to be aware of police uniforms and vehicles, and to pull over in public places during traffic stops. The suspect in the shooting, Vance Boelter, allegedly wore a mask and tactical vest, and drove a vehicle with fake police lights. The article serves as a guide for the public to protect themselves in situations involving potential police impersonation.</p>

          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen is urging the House of Lords not to block the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which would allow assisted dying for terminally ill adults in England and Wales. The bill, already passed by the House of Commons, faces potential opposition and amendments in the Lords. Rantzen, who joined Dignitas after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, argues that the Lords should scrutinize the bill but not oppose it. Critics express concerns about potential coercion of vulnerable individuals, while proponents emphasize the bill's rigorous safeguards, including multiple declarations, independent medical assessments, and a multi-disciplinary panel review. Rantzen believes the bill provides a pain-free option for those with six months or less to live, while ensuring protections for vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England plans to DNA test all newborn babies to assess their risk of hundreds of diseases as part of a government initiative to predict and prevent illness. This scheme, involving sequencing complete DNA from umbilical cord blood samples, aims to provide personalized healthcare and faster diagnoses. The government will invest Â£650 million in DNA research for all patients by 2030. The initiative builds on a study tracking the genetic code of up to 100,000 newborns and seeks to ease pressure on NHS services by proactively addressing potential health issues. The NHS aims to transition from treating illness to preventing it, utilizing genomics and AI for early disease detection.</p>

Xiaomi, for example, is planning to open 500 new retail stores outside China this year, particularly in developed markets, with a goal of 10,000 stores overseas in the next five years. The company's previous decision to close stores in France was part of an adjustment to its retail strategy to better align with consumer behavior. These efforts reflect a broader trend of Chinese brands seeking to enhance their image and market share in the European market.

          <p>China's real estate sector is facing a prolonged downturn, exacerbated by a shrinking population. Goldman Sachs estimates that demand for new homes in urban cities will remain suppressed, falling to under 5 million units per year. The country's population is projected to decline, further reducing demographic demand for housing. Efforts to incentivize child-bearing have had limited effect, due to stagnant incomes and job instability. The combination of demographic shifts and economic challenges poses significant hurdles for the Chinese property market. These conditions suggest that decreasing demographic demand will continue to suppress the market in the coming years.</p>

          <p>Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil was released from immigration detention in the US after 104 days, following a judge's ruling. Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student, had been detained by ICE and became a symbol of crackdowns on pro-Palestinian protests. Despite being a legal US resident and not accused of breaking laws, the Trump administration sought to deport him over his protest involvement. Judge Michael Farbiarz deemed the government's detention standards unmet and ordered Khalil's release, although the government is appealing the decision. Civil rights groups argue that the administration conflates antisemitism with criticism of Israel to silence dissent. Khalil will reunite with his family and continue to fight the deportation order.</p>

          <p>Chinese religious groups have been warned by the United Front Work Department to guard against foreign infiltration. Li Ganjie, the head of the department, visited religious organizations to deliver the warning, following similar calls from President Xi Jinping. The warnings come ahead of the Dalai Lama's 90th birthday on July 6. These actions reflect the government's continued efforts to promote the "Sinicisation of religion" and maintain control over religious practices. The focus on preventing foreign influence underscores concerns about potential challenges to the Communist Party's authority.</p>

          <p>The front pages of various newspapers focus on the recent Commons vote supporting assisted dying in England and Wales, with differing perspectives on its future. Some papers highlight the "victory" for campaigners and the "societal shift" it represents, while others emphasize the "uphill battle" the bill faces in the House of Lords. Other top stories include the government's plan to map the DNA of every baby under an "NHS revolution," and the vandalism committed by pro-Palestinian activists at RAF Brize Norton. The coverage reflects a range of opinions and concerns surrounding the assisted dying bill and other pressing issues. It is expected that the NHS will play a key role in deciding how the process will work.</p>

          <p>Chinese coast guard ships have been spotted near the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea for the 215th consecutive day, matching the longest streak since Japan put the islets under state control in 2012. The Japan Coast Guard confirmed that four Chinese ships equipped with autocannons sailed in the contiguous zone just outside Japan's territorial waters. The Japan Coast Guard warned the ships not to approach Japanese territorial waters. The uninhabited islets, claimed by China and called Diaoyu, have long been a source of friction between the two countries. The previous 215-day streak ended in July 2024, likely due to a typhoon.</p>

          <p>Benjamin Netanyahu has long portrayed Iran as the gravest threat to Israel, using this narrative to shape his political legacy. Israel launched a military operation against Iran, targeting nuclear facilities and military leaders, leading to ongoing exchanges of attacks. The decision to attack Iran has garnered significant support within Israel, where Iran is seen as a major enemy. Despite the support, concerns remain about the long-term consequences of the conflict and Netanyahu's political motives. The conflict has provided Netanyahu with a temporary respite from his domestic political troubles. The war has created a sense of unity among Israelis.</p>

This decision has prompted words of caution in Taiwan, highlighting the need to balance operational needs in the Middle East with strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific. The USS Nimitz halted operations in the South China Sea to support the USS Carl Vinson carrier strike group in the Middle East. The redeployment comes amid heightened tensions between Israel and Iran.

          <p>A judge has dismissed all charges against Barry Morphew, without prejudice, in the case of his wife Suzanne's disappearance. Prosecutors cited the need to investigate further and the belief that they are close to discovering Suzanne's body. Morphew's attorneys had repeatedly requested the dismissal, citing the prosecution's failure to turn over potentially exculpatory evidence. Morphew filed a $15 million federal civil rights lawsuit against prosecutors and law enforcement officials stating he was wrongfully arrested, jailed and prosecuted. The civil suit underscores the complex and contentious nature of the case.</p>
