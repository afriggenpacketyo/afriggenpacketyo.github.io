        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has released its annual inflation adjustments for federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for the 2026 tax year. These changes are designed to prevent "bracket creep," where inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets even if their real income has not increased. The adjustments mean Americans will need to earn more to reach a higher tax rate, and standard deductions for all filing statuses have also been raised. The article also notes a temporary deduction for seniors and explains the mechanics of the U.S. progressive tax system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has reportedly narrowed the list of potential candidates for the next Federal Reserve chair down to five individuals after a series of interviews. The finalists include current Fed officials Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, as well as Kevin Hassett, Kevin Warsh, and Rick Rieder. The selection process will continue with another round of interviews, with a final decision from President Trump expected after Thanksgiving. The strategy may involve nominating the chosen candidate to a governor's seat first to ensure a full 14-year term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major 7.4 magnitude earthquake followed by a powerful 6.9 magnitude aftershock struck the southern Philippines, resulting in at least five deaths and significant damage. The seismic events, originating from the Philippine Trench, prompted tsunami warnings and evacuations in coastal areas, though the initial alert was later lifted before being reissued after the aftershock. The quakes caused landslides, damaged infrastructure including hospitals and schools, and disrupted daily life in the region. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has mobilized rescue and relief operations in response to the disaster.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted New York Attorney General Letitia James on charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. The indictment, presented by a U.S. Attorney installed after President Trump expressed frustration with the pace of investigations into his rivals, alleges James committed mortgage fraud related to a property in Virginia. James has called the charges baseless and a form of political retribution, a sentiment echoed by many Democratic officials. This action is viewed as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to use the Justice Department to target political opponents.</p>

          <p>The Norwegian Nobel Committee has awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado for her persistent efforts to promote democracy in her country. The committee highlighted her "brave and committed" struggle against Venezuela's authoritarian regime and her steadfast support for a peaceful transition of power. In their announcement, the committee also spoke broadly about the global retreat of democracy and the rise of authoritarianism. Machado's work was recognized for embodying the hope for a future where citizens' fundamental rights are protected.</p>

          <p>A scientific debate is unfolding over the creation of "mirror life," a synthetic form of life with biomolecules that are mirror images of those found in nature. Proponents argue it could lead to revolutionary therapeutics that last longer in the body, while some scientists warn of catastrophic risks, such as mirror bacteria evading immune systems and disrupting ecosystems. A recent paper in *Science* called for a halt to creating mirror organisms, citing the potential for an uncontrollable spread. However, other researchers believe the risks are theoretical and that research into mirror biomolecules, which are non-replicating, should continue.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is threatening to permanently lay off federal workers if the current government shutdown continues, a departure from previous shutdowns where employees were furloughed. President Trump has signaled intentions to cut "Democrat Agencies," and the Office of Management and Budget had already instructed agencies to consider layoffs before the funding lapse. This aligns with conservative proposals like "Project 2025," which advocates for a drastic reduction in the federal workforce. Labor unions have filed a lawsuit alleging the threats are illegal, while morale among government employees is reportedly at an all-time low.</p>

          <p>Postal services across Canada have been halted after unionized postal workers initiated a nationwide strike, which has since shifted to a rotating strike model. The walkout is a protest against widespread reforms authorized by the government, which include ending door-to-door delivery for millions and closing some post offices. The Canadian Union of Postal Workers argues these changes are a direct assault on the public postal service and will lead to major job losses. This industrial action compounds an ongoing dispute over pay and benefits, while Canada Post warns the strike will worsen its already precarious financial situation.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that a concerted effort is underway by certain right-of-center commentators to use antisemitism as a wedge issue to divide President Trump's MAGA coalition. The author contends that figures like Candace Owens and Tucker Carlson are promoting anti-Jewish and anti-Israel narratives to alienate the movement's core base of evangelical Christians, who are traditionally strong supporters of Israel. The ultimate goal, according to the author, is not just to debase American Jews but to supplant the MAGA movement with a new, conspiracy-driven political entity. The writer contrasts this divisive rhetoric with President Trump's own pro-Jewish and pro-Israel record.</p>

In a CNBC interview, Waller noted the contrast between a weakening labor market and strong GDP growth, suggesting that policy should not be aggressive until the economic direction is clearer. He expressed comfort with the Fed's current projection of two more quarter-point cuts this year but pushed back against calls for faster, larger reductions. Waller, a finalist for the Fed Chair position, also described his recent interview as a serious, non-political economic discussion. (not investment advice)</p>

He argues that young people should be fully invested in the stock market rather than holding cash or bonds, as they have a long time horizon to recover from market volatility and benefit from compounding. Historically, stocks have significantly outperformed other asset classes over the long term, making them essential for building wealth.

          <p>Costco has quietly grown into a nearly $10 billion apparel retailer, with its clothing sales increasing by almost 40% between 2019 and 2024. This growth, driven by offering popular brands alongside its private Kirkland Signature label, means its apparel revenue now surpasses that of established retailers like Old Navy. The company's success is partly attributed to a "treasure hunt" shopping experience, where opportunistic purchases create a rotating and unpredictable selection. This strategy has proven so effective that it has drawn legal challenges from brands like Lululemon, signaling that major clothing retailers now view Costco as a serious competitor.</p>

In an article for a Communist Party newspaper, he emphasized the need to develop advanced domestic equipment to increase China's competitiveness. The world's seabeds are rich in critical minerals essential for green technologies.</p>

          <p>The NBA is marking a significant return to China with two preseason games in Macao, signaling a renewed effort to grow its second-largest market after a six-year hiatus. The relationship soured in 2019, but the league is now rebuilding ties, evidenced by a renewed partnership with Alibaba and high demand for game tickets. With a massive fan base of over 400 million followers on Chinese social media, the NBA sees significant growth potential in the country as U.S. television viewership declines. The league and its teams are investing in local content and retail to re-engage this crucial audience.</p>

          <p>The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has officially designated Google with "strategic market status" for its search and search advertising services, activating new regulatory powers. The designation follows an investigation that concluded Google has "substantial and entrenched market power," with over 90% of U.K. searches on its platform. While not a finding of wrongdoing, this status means the CMA can now impose conduct requirements on Google to improve competition. Potential interventions could include fairer search rankings and greater publisher control over content, including its use in AI-generated results.</p>

          <p>Japan's long-standing ruling coalition has collapsed after the junior partner, Komeito, withdrew its support for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The move jeopardizes the confirmation of newly elected LDP leader Sanae Takaichi as the country's next prime minister, as she no longer has a guaranteed majority in parliament. Komeito cited the LDP's failure to adequately address a persistent political slush-fund scandal as the reason for its withdrawal. The sudden political instability has caused market nervousness and comes at a critical time for Japan, ahead of major diplomatic engagements.</p>

          <p>Following anti-government protests in Tbilisi after recent elections, Georgia's Interior Ministry has arrested 13 people, accusing rally organizers of attempting to overthrow the government. The ruling Georgian Dream party has framed the unrest, which saw some demonstrators try to enter the presidential palace, as a coup attempt and promised a "zero sympathy" policy toward the movement. Opposition figures and civil society groups express concern that the government is using the events as a pretext for a broader crackdown on dissent. This has heightened fears of further repression in the country's tense political climate.</p>

          <p>Singaporean and U.S. authorities are investigating AI computing firm Megaspeed, a customer of Nvidia, over allegations that it helped Chinese companies circumvent U.S. restrictions on advanced AI chip exports. The probe focuses on whether Megaspeed, which reportedly purchased nearly $2 billion of Nvidia's top-tier products via a Malaysian subsidiary, illegally diverted them to China. Nvidia stated it has engaged with the U.S. government and its own inquiry found no evidence of diversion. The case highlights the ongoing challenges in enforcing U.S. export controls designed to limit China's access to critical technology.</p>

          <p>A significant change to 401(k) plans, enacted by the Secure 2.0 Act, will soon affect a popular tax break for high earners. Starting in 2026, workers who earned more than $145,000 in the previous year will be required to make their "catch-up" contributions on a post-tax Roth basis. Currently, these extra contributions for workers aged 50 and over can be made as either pretax or Roth, depending on the plan. This change eliminates the upfront tax deduction on catch-up savings for this group, prompting financial advisors to recommend that affected individuals review their tax strategies now.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis suggests that the Nobel Committee's decision to award the Peace Prize to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado indirectly benefits President Trump's foreign policy goals. The Trump administration has been a staunch supporter of Machado and has actively worked to pressure the regime of Nicolás Maduro, whom it views as an enemy. By elevating Machado's international stature, the Nobel Prize provides her with a layer of protection and legitimacy, making it harder for Maduro to suppress her. The article posits that this could embolden her efforts and bring the U.S. goal of regime change in Venezuela a step closer.</p>

          <p>The U.K. government has confirmed it will consult on whether its planned national digital ID scheme should be available to children as young as 13. The announcement came in response to a petition opposing the scheme, which will be mandatory for anyone seeking to work in the U.K. but optional for others. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper defended the idea, noting many teens already have forms of digital ID. However, the proposal has drawn sharp criticism from civil liberties groups like Big Brother Watch, which labeled the plan "sinister" and a step toward state overreach.</p>

          <p>The latest update to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species reveals that Arctic seals are being pushed closer to extinction by the loss of sea ice due to climate change. The assessment also found that populations of more than half of the world's bird species are declining, primarily due to deforestation and agricultural expansion. This annual report highlights the deepening biodiversity crisis facing the planet. However, it also offers a note of hope, citing the substantial recovery of green sea turtles as evidence that dedicated conservation efforts can successfully bring species back from the brink.</p>
