        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of families are choosing to sell large, historic ranches that have been held for generations, often due to disagreements among heirs about the properties' future. High-end ranch brokers report a surge in listings for these legacy properties, driven by wealthy buyers seeking privacy and a rural lifestyle, a trend amplified by the 'Yellowstone' effect. While these sales provide a financial windfall, they also mark the end of a unique family heritage, as the sprawling landscapes transition to new ownership. The market is also seeing a rise in sales from owners who bought ranches 20-30 years ago, as their children show little interest in taking over.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing scrutiny for several recent actions, including the revocation of the extended Secret Service detail for former Vice President Kamala Harris, which had been authorized by the previous administration. Concurrently, President Trump has increased pressure on the Smithsonian Institution, criticizing its exhibitions for focusing on negative aspects of American history and demanding White House review of its content. These moves are part of a series of politically charged decisions, including legal actions against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, that highlight ongoing tensions between the current administration and established institutions. An ad campaign has also launched in Washington D.C. calling for federal officers to remove their masks.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa has informed confidantes that she does not plan to seek reelection for a third term in 2026, with a formal announcement expected next week. Having served in the Senate since 2015 and risen to a leadership position in the Republican conference, Ernst reportedly intends to enter the private sector, fulfilling a personal plan to serve only two terms. Her departure opens up a key Senate seat, and several Iowa Democrats have already announced their candidacies for the race. The decision adds to a growing list of GOP senators who are not running for reelection, a development being closely watched by both parties.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 11:13:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is attempting to cancel nearly $5 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid funds using a rare maneuver known as a pocket rescission. This move allows the administration to withhold the funds without legislative approval by proposing the cuts late in the fiscal year, effectively letting the funding expire. The action has drawn immediate and strong bipartisan pushback from Capitol Hill, with key Republicans like Senator Susan Collins calling it an unlawful violation of Congress's constitutional power of the purse.

          <p>Former New York Yankees first baseman Mark Teixeira has announced his campaign for a U.S. House seat in Texas as a Republican, sparking a polarized response. The World Series champion and self-described "lifelong conservative" stated he is running to defend President Trump's "America First" agenda, which has drawn praise from conservative supporters. However, the announcement has also been met with backlash from liberal critics and some former fans on social media, who expressed disappointment with his political alignment. Teixeira is running for the seat being vacated by Rep. Chip Roy, who is now running for Texas Attorney General.</p>

          <p>A federal court has begun hearing arguments regarding President Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, who is seeking a temporary restraining order to block her removal. Trump's legal team asserts that the president has the authority to remove her for cause, citing allegations of mortgage misrepresentation, and that his judgment is not subject to judicial review. Cook's attorney argues the allegations are a baseless smear campaign and irrelevant to her role at the Fed. The Federal Reserve has taken no position on the matter but has requested a prompt ruling to resolve the dispute over presidential power and the central bank's independence.

          <p>Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has clarified his recent post-match comments that fueled speculation about his future, stating they were a product of his emotional reaction to a stunning EFL Cup defeat to Grimsby Town. After the loss, Amorim said his team was "completely lost" and that "something has to change," leading some to believe he was considering quitting. He has since explained that such passionate outbursts are part of his personality, admitting he sometimes wants to quit but at other times wants to stay for 20 years. The clarification comes as United remains winless this season, increasing pressure on the Portuguese manager.</p>

          <p>A Venezuelan man, Luis Manuel Rivas Velásquez, who was believed by his family to have died in a Florida immigration detention facility known as 'Alligator Alcatraz' after receiving delayed medical care, has been found alive. However, he was secretly transferred by ICE, first to a detention camp at Fort Bliss, Texas, and then to another processing center, all without informing his lawyers or family. His attorneys have described the treatment as an "enforced disappearance" and retribution for his speaking out about the harsh conditions in detention. Rivas Velásquez had already signed an agreement for deportation, desperate to be released from what he called a "living hell."</p>

This update is designed to guide government investment, streamline permitting decisions, and reduce the nation's reliance on foreign sources, particularly China, for materials essential to key industries like semiconductors, automotive manufacturing, and solar energy. The selection of minerals was based on identifying which supply chain disruptions would most significantly impact the U.S. economy and national security.

          <p>Israel has intensified its military offensive in Gaza City, declaring it a "dangerous combat zone" and suspending humanitarian pauses, a move condemned in a joint statement by six European nations. The ministers denounced the forced displacement of Palestinians and the destruction of civilian infrastructure, calling for an immediate end to the violence. Amid the escalating conflict, the Israeli Prime Minister's office announced that the bodies of two hostages had been recovered from the Gaza Strip. The ongoing war, which began after the October 7 Hamas attacks, has led to a dire humanitarian crisis, with a UN-backed monitor recently confirming a famine in Gaza City.</p>

The court ruled that she violated ethics rules in a leaked phone call with former Cambodian leader Hun Sen, in which she criticized her own military commanders amid a border conflict. Paetongtarn, who is the daughter of former PM Thaksin Shinawatra, accepted the verdict but maintained her actions were intended to de-escalate the conflict.

          <p>The Trump administration has issued a proposed regulation to tighten visa rules for international students, cultural exchange visitors, and foreign journalists. The new rule would eliminate the current "duration of status" system and instead assign a fixed time period for these visas, generally no longer than four years for students and 240 days for journalists. Individuals would then need to apply for extensions to prolong their stay in the U.S. The administration stated the change is necessary for better monitoring and oversight, but it is seen by critics as part of a broader effort to impose new hurdles on legal immigration.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's firing of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Susan Monarez after just one month on the job has prompted rare bipartisan condemnation from Congress. Monarez was reportedly dismissed by the health secretary for refusing to remove other agency officials and for her commitment to established vaccine protocols. The move, along with the resignation of four other top CDC leaders and a staff walkout in protest, has created extraordinary turmoil at the nation's leading public health agency. Lawmakers from both parties have expressed deep concern over the political interference and the potential damage to the CDC's scientific integrity and public trust.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's AI Action Plan could automate and deepen existing health inequities, according to a critical analysis of the policy. The plan's push for AI free from "ideological dogmas" and its simultaneous rollback of data collection on marginalized communities may lead to biased medical algorithms. This article argues that by shaping what data is considered legitimate, the administration incentivizes the creation of AI tools trained on incomplete or skewed information. This could encode the biases of the current political moment into the future standards of medical care, disproportionately harming women and minority groups for decades to come.</p>

This international setback compounds a difficult start to his move to Real Madrid, where he has been relegated to the bench and faces stiff competition from club legend Dani Carvajal. Tuchel has previously expressed reservations about Alexander-Arnold's defensive capabilities, and his exclusion from the squad suggests he has a significant battle ahead to secure a place for the next World Cup.

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD reported a nearly 30% drop in its second-quarter profits, as an intense price war in its home market eroded margins. The decline in earnings occurred despite a massive 145% surge in the company's overseas sales during the same period, highlighting the challenging competitive landscape in China. The Shenzhen-based automaker, a dominant player in the global EV market, attributed the adverse impact to increased competition and aggressive marketing tactics within China. The results fell short of analyst expectations, showing how even surging international demand could not fully compensate for the fierce domestic rivalry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While the median sale price for condominiums in the U.S. has recently declined, real estate experts caution that they may not be the bargain they appear to be. A national oversupply has driven prices down, particularly in states like Florida and Texas. However, buyers must also factor in rapidly rising hidden costs, such as higher HOA dues, surging insurance premiums, and new reserve requirements for building repairs. These additional monthly expenses can quickly offset the lower purchase price, sometimes making the long-term cost of a condo comparable to that of a single-family home. Agents advise buyers to thoroughly investigate a building's financials before making a purchase.</p>
