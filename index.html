          <p>Israel launched airstrikes targeting locations in Iran allegedly connected to its nuclear program, prompting Defense Minister Israel Katz to declare a state of emergency, warning of potential missile and drone attacks. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the operation would persist until the threat is eliminated, while Iranian state media reported fatalities in Tehran. The United States clarified it was not involved but was informed beforehand, emphasizing the protection of American forces in the region. Social media videos showed explosions in eastern Tehran, with sounds of jets and anti-aircraft missiles heard in the north. The situation remains tense as the operation continues.</p>

          <p>The owner of a Dominican Republic nightclub, Antonio Espaillat, and his sister, Maribel Espaillat, were arrested following a roof collapse that resulted in 236 deaths. Authorities accused them of negligence for failing to prevent the collapse and attempting to manipulate employees who could serve as witnesses. The Attorney General's Office stated the defendants displayed immense irresponsibility. The government-appointed committee continues to investigate the cause of the collapse, which also claimed the lives of several notable figures, including singer Rubby PÃ©rez and former MLB pitcher Octavio Dotel.</p>

          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo asserted that he deterred President Donald Trump from deploying the National Guard to New York City during the George Floyd riots in 2020. Cuomo stated he warned Trump that sending troops would be a hostile act and unnecessary, contrasting this with Trump's actions in Los Angeles, where he deployed troops and Marines to address immigration enforcement protests. Cuomo also affirmed his commitment to defending New York City's sanctuary city laws as mayor.

          <p>An Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed shortly after takeoff in Ahmedabad, India, resulting in 241 fatalities, with only one survivor reported.

India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau is leading the investigation, with assistance from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration. Initial data suggests the plane experienced a steep dive shortly after takeoff, and investigators are examining flight data and voice recorders to determine the cause of the crash.</p>

          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary ruling against the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles, siding with California's challenge to the president's decision. Judge Charles Breyer stated that the president's actions exceeded his statutory authority and violated the Tenth Amendment, ordering the return of the National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom's control. The ruling is on hold pending appeal, with Newsom urging Trump to end the militarization of Los Angeles. The case centers on the interpretation of Title 10, which outlines the circumstances under which the National Guard can be called into federal service.</p>

          <p>Research indicates that pigs were domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago, challenging the conventional view that domestication first occurred in the Near East. Archaeologists analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region, finding evidence that pigs consumed humans' cooked foods and waste. This suggests that the domestication of Sus scrofa, the wild boar, coincided with the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles in ancient Chinese society. The study offers new insights into the origins of animal domestication and early agricultural practices.</p>

          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are continuing their overseas expansion to ensure survival in the face of US tariffs. Production abroad is considered key to their long-term viability, with firms diversifying their production bases in response to trade tensions. While a 90-day truce was reached, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the US remain subject to high tariffs. Chinese firms are increasingly focusing on the Middle East and Africa for planned capacity expansion.</p>

          <p>Approximately 45,000 grocery workers at Ralphs, Albertsons, Vons, and Pavilions stores in Southern California have authorized a strike to protest what they deem unfair labor practices. The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) locals representing the workers announced the vote, granting their leaders the authority to call a strike. Negotiations between the union and the grocery chain companies have been ongoing for months, with key sticking points including staffing levels and alleged union-busting tactics by the companies. Negotiations are scheduled to resume later in June.</p>

          <h2>Trump Orders Consolidation of Wildland Firefighting Forces</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has directed the US government to consolidate its wildland firefighting force into a single program, despite warnings of potential disruptions and increased risks of catastrophic fires. The order aims to centralize efforts currently split among multiple agencies, proposing a new Federal Wildland Fire Service under the Interior Department. Critics argue the restructuring could be costly and disruptive, particularly during peak fire season. The order follows devastating wildfires in Los Angeles and emphasizes the need for quicker responses, while also prioritizing the sale of excess aircraft for wildfire mitigation.</p>

          <p>Douglas McCarthy, the singer of the influential electronic industrial band Nitzer Ebb, has passed away at the age of 58. McCarthy co-founded Nitzer Ebb in Essex, releasing their first single in 1985 and gaining recognition for their harsh, antagonistic style that blended electronic music with punk. The band's debut LP, "That Total Age," played a formative role in the industrial wave, influencing acts like Nine Inch Nails and Rammstein. McCarthy also worked on side projects and revived Nitzer Ebb in 2007, but faced health issues later in life.</p>

The holiday park sector is described as unregulated, leaving buyers vulnerable to unfavorable contract terms and fee hikes.

          <p>A new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) indicates that President Donald Trump's megabill would disproportionately benefit wealthy households while reducing resources for the poorest. According to the CBO, the lowest-earning 10% of households would see a 3.9% income cut, whereas households in the top 10% would experience gains of approximately $12,000 per year. The analysis highlights the potential for the bill to exacerbate income inequality.

This move comes as the public faces rising living costs and the LDP prepares for upcoming elections. Koizumi's actions, including releasing government stockpiled rice at reduced prices, aim to capture public imagination and address agricultural sector issues.

          <p>A discrepancy has emerged between President Trump's claim to restore Confederate names to military bases and the Pentagon's official announcement. Trump stated he would reinstate names like Fort Robert E. Lee, while the Pentagon indicated the forts would be renamed for other veterans with the same surnames. This apparent wink-and-a-nod trolling reveals the administration's intent to honor Confederate figures while attempting to skirt criticism. The move has been criticized as an insult to those whose names were added and then removed, and a superficial search for veterans with matching surnames.</p>
