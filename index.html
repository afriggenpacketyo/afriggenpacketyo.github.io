            <p>President Trump underwent his annual physical exam at Walter Reed Hospital, marking the first physical of his second term. The examination included a battery of tests and imaging, with a summary of the visit to be released later. The President's last comprehensive examination was in September 2023, and while limited details were released from that visit, his doctor stated that his overall health is excellent and cognitive exams were exceptional. Presidential physicals are considered curated medical PR events intended to reassure the public of the president's ability to perform his duties.</p>

            <p>Lawyers for Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, have filed a motion to prevent the Justice Department from pursuing the death penalty. They argue the federal case is politically motivated and that public statements by the Attorney General prejudiced the grand jury process. The defense also challenges the consideration of the victim's status as a CEO in seeking capital punishment. Mangione's lawyers are requesting the court to remove the death penalty option and screen grand jurors for potential bias.</p>

            <p>A judge has ruled that the Trump administration can deport Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate detained for his role in pro-Palestinian protests. The government cited a Cold War-era law, claiming Khalil's presence is adverse to American foreign policy interests. Khalil's lawyers argue his arrest is a consequence of speaking out for Palestinian rights, while the ACLU described the decision as pre-written. The Trump administration also alleges immigration fraud, claiming Khalil failed to disclose information on his green card application.</p>

            <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved significant increases in trash fees for residents to address a billion-dollar budget deficit. Fees for single-family homes and duplexes will more than double, reaching $55.95, with similar increases for smaller apartment buildings. The fees will continue to rise annually through 2029, potentially tripling for some residents. A program to help low-income residents is planned, but concerns remain about the regressive nature of the fee increase and its disproportionate impact on lower-income households.</p>
