          <p>The funeral of Pope Francis is drawing numerous world leaders, creating an unexpected opportunity for diplomatic interactions. While formal meetings are unlikely out of respect for the solemn occasion, diplomats anticipate "brush-by" conversations among leaders. All eyes are on whether Presidents Trump and Zelenskyy will use this chance to discuss a ceasefire in Ukraine, and there are potential risks, such as leaders encountering adversaries due to Vatican City's neutral status. The event could lead to unpredictable moments, like the sign of peace during the funeral mass, where leaders might shake hands with those they would rather avoid.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's ongoing attacks on the media, including banning reporters and attempting to defund public broadcasters, are testing the limits of press freedom in the United States. Despite constitutional protections, free speech advocates caution that these freedoms require active defense, especially with the administration targeting law firms willing to challenge its actions. Critics argue that Trump's moves align with a broader strategy of controlling the public narrative, undermining independent reporting. The situation raises concerns about the rise of misinformation and the erosion of democratic stability, particularly as the administration signals further actions against publicly funded media outlets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has released interim guidance on single-sex spaces following a UK Supreme Court ruling that defines 'woman' and 'sex' as biological sex in law. The guidance specifies that transgender women should not be permitted to use women's facilities in places like hospitals, shops, and restaurants, while also stating that trans people should not be left without any facilities to use. In schools, the guidance suggests separate toilet and changing facilities for pupils who identify as trans, and women-only associations should not admit trans women. The EHRC plans to launch a consultation to seek views from affected stakeholders and provide an updated code of practice by the end of June.</p>

          <p>An approaching mini-heatwave in the UK is expected to provide a temporary boost to nature, with migratory birds arriving and butterflies emerging. The British Trust for Ornithology notes that milder winters and wetter springs are contributing to changes in the natural world. While the warm spell won't significantly alter the overall environment, it will offer nature lovers a chance to enjoy the spring. However, wildlife charities caution against the risk of accidental fires due to dry conditions, which could harm vulnerable heathland ecosystems and wildlife.</p>

          <p>Luigi Mangione pleaded not guilty to federal murder and stalking charges in the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Supporters gathered at the New York City courthouse, some viewing Mangione as a political prisoner. Former Army analyst Chelsea Manning expressed concerns about the speed and fairness of the legal proceedings. The case has drawn attention due to the alleged motive related to healthcare denials, and the defense is raising constitutional issues. The trial is expected to take place in 2026.</p>

The event aims to attract over 28 million visitors during its six-month duration on Yumeshima, an artificial island in Osaka Bay.

          <p>Iran and the United States are scheduled to hold a third round of talks regarding Tehran's nuclear activities, raising hopes for a new agreement that could prevent further conflict in the Middle East. President Trump expressed optimism about reaching a deal with Iran, despite abandoning a previous nuclear agreement in 2018. The talks have the potential to reshape regional and global security by reducing the risk of military action against Iranian nuclear facilities and preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. An agreement could also lead to the easing of American sanctions and the opening of Iran to foreign investment.</p>

          <p>In Alberta, Canada, calls for separation from the rest of Canada are growing, fueled by frustration with federal policies and President Trump's remarks about Canada becoming the 51st US state. Some western Canadians feel alienated and overlooked by politicians in the capital. While a referendum on independence remains unlikely, the issue poses a challenge to Canada's next prime minister, particularly if the Liberal Party wins the upcoming election. The sentiment has even pushed Alberta's Premier to pursue independent trade talks with the US.</p>

          <p>Google's browser chief, Parisa Tabriz, testified that only Google can run Chrome due to its deep interdependencies with other Google services. This statement was made as part of the Justice Department's antitrust case, where Google is accused of illegally monopolizing the search market. Tabriz argued that features like safe browsing rely on shared Google infrastructure, making it impossible for another company to recreate Chrome's functionality. However, a computer science expert argued that divesting Chrome is technically feasible and wouldn't necessarily break its functionality.</p>

          <p>Joseph Koenig was found guilty of first-degree murder for throwing a rock that killed Alexa Bartell. The jury also returned guilty verdicts on multiple other charges related to rock-throwing attacks on other vehicles. Two co-defendants, Nicholas Karol-Chik and Zachary Kwak, testified against Koenig as part of their plea agreements. Koenig's defense argued that his actions constituted manslaughter, not murder, but the jury ultimately sided with the prosecution. Sentencing is scheduled for June 3.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles city attorney's office will not file criminal charges against most of the protesters arrested at UCLA and USC during last year's demonstrations over the war in Gaza. City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto cited evidentiary reasons and a lack of assistance from the universities as reasons for declining to prosecute the majority of cases. Only two people will be charged with criminal offenses, while three others will be referred to informal prosecutorial proceedings. The decision comes a year after the protests sparked tense debates over the conflict.</p>
