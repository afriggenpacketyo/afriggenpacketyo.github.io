          <h2>UK Government Borrowing Exceeds Forecasts Due to Increased Spending</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 03:13:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official figures reveal that the UK government's borrowing in the year leading up to March surpassed expectations, reaching £151.9bn due to increased spending on pay and benefits. This figure exceeds the official forecast of £137.3bn and marks the third-highest borrowing on record. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) attributes the rise to inflation-related costs, including higher pay and benefit increases, with debt levels nearing the annual output of the economy. The IMF has also downgraded the UK's growth forecast, leading economists to suggest potential spending cuts and tax rises to meet fiscal rules. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that coral bleaching is affecting 84% of the world's coral reefs, marking the highest level ever recorded. This widespread event, the fourth global bleaching since 1998, is attributed to rising ocean temperatures caused by human-induced climate change. Scientists warn that the magnitude of heat stress is alarming, with the potential to drastically alter marine ecosystems and impact human livelihoods. Addressing the root cause of climate change, primarily through reducing fossil fuel emissions, is deemed essential to protect coral reefs.</p>

Wang emphasized China's commitment to openness and mutually beneficial cooperation, echoing President Xi Jinping's call for countries to resist protectionism.

          <p>More travelers are opting for 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) plans to finance their trips, splitting costs for flights, hotels, and cruises into installments. While some find it convenient, others have faced issues like late fees and debt accumulation. BNPL usage is growing, especially among younger travelers, with a significant percentage using it for events like music festivals. Experts advise using BNPL responsibly, noting that defaults can occur if loans are not managed carefully. It is not just for luxury vacations anymore, it is also for basic travel expenses such as family visits.</p>

The increase appears largely attributable to Hispanic and Asian mothers, while births declined for Black and American Indian women. Despite this, economic challenges and the cost of childcare continue to affect families, and the impact of abortion bans on birth rates remains a significant factor.</p>
