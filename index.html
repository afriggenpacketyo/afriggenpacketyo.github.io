          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-10 05:12:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stephen Miller, a top aide to President Trump, indicated that the administration is exploring the possibility of suspending immigrants' right to challenge their detention in court before deportation, citing the Constitution's provision for such suspensions during times of invasion. Legal experts, however, question the legality of this move, suggesting it would be a dramatic escalation in the administration's battle with the courts and a sweeping assertion of executive authority. The article notes that habeas corpus has been suspended only four times in US history, usually with congressional authorization, and that courts have rejected the administration's claim that current immigration levels constitute an invasion. Optimism score should be based on the stability of the legal system.</p>

          <p>The article explores the challenges of maintaining friendships after having children, noting that assumptions about availability and shared interests can lead to distance between parents and non-parents. Experts emphasize the importance of open communication, compassion, and flexibility in bridging the gap. Parents are encouraged to invite child-free friends to family events, while non-parents should be understanding of the logistical hurdles parents face. Ultimately, the article suggests that evolving friendships can still provide valuable balance and support, even if they look different than before.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his nomination of Dr. Casey Means, a wellness influencer known for her "Make America Healthy Again" movement, as the next US Surgeon General. Means, who has a medical degree from Stanford but is not board-certified in a medical specialty, has been vocal about her views on nutrition, vaccines, and the healthcare system. Her perspectives often align with those of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., focusing on tackling chronic disease and promoting a healthier food supply. Her appointment has sparked controversy due to her skepticism about vaccine safety and criticism of conventional medical practices.</p>

          <p>The Mexican government, under President Claudia Sheinbaum, is suing Google for complying with a decree issued by former US President Donald Trump to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. Mexico asserts that Google should only apply the name "Gulf of America" to the portion of the gulf within US territory and retain "Gulf of Mexico" for the areas bordering Mexico and Cuba. Google's decision aligns with its policy of following official US government geographic designations, but Mexico argues this disregards the historical and territorial significance of the Gulf's name.</p>

          <p>Rand Laycock, a music conductor diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, has experienced significant improvement in his symptoms through deep brain stimulation (DBS). After medications became less effective, Laycock opted for DBS, a procedure involving an implanted device that delivers electrical currents to specific areas of the brain. He later transitioned to adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS), a more advanced form of therapy that fine-tunes stimulation in real-time based on brain activity. As a result, Laycock's tremors are now minimal, allowing him to continue his career as a conductor.</p>

          <p>A deadly terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir has heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, leading to escalating military actions and raising concerns of a potential war. Both countries have accused each other of launching airstrikes and missile attacks on military facilities, with each vowing to respond to any escalatory moves. The conflict stems from a decades-old dispute over the Kashmir region, a Himalayan territory claimed by both nations. The international community is closely monitoring the situation, urging de-escalation to prevent a major conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating military tensions over the Kashmir region, the Indian government has ordered the blocking of thousands of social media accounts and imposed restrictions on news portals, raising concerns about freedom of speech. The government claims the measures are necessary to combat misinformation and maintain national security, while press freedom activists condemn the move as censorship. Critics argue that such restrictions limit access to reliable information and create an environment conducive to false narratives, especially during times of conflict.

The episode is also significant because it features a cast and crew that can authentically portray African stories and cultures, addressing the show's historical lack of representation of the continent.

          <p>Xi Jinping has been strategically working to make the world reliant on China's exports and technological expertise, but this approach has consequences for China itself. By increasing exports and solidifying China's position as a manufacturing hub, Xi aims to gain leverage over adversaries. However, this strategy has strained relationships with trading partners and comes at a cost to many Chinese households. The trade war with the United States has validated Xi's concerns about Western containment and has led to a more assertive stance.</p>

The spacecraft was designed to survive atmospheric entry, so it's possible parts of it will remain intact when it hits the surface. If any pieces are recovered, they legally belong to Russia.</p>
