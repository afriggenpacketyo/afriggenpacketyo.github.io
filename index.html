          <p>Actress Kate Hudson and retired NFL star Tom Brady were spotted enjoying a sunny day on a yacht off the coast of Ibiza. They were accompanied by actress Dakota Johnson and other friends as part of a gathering to celebrate the birthday of Mohammed Al Turki, who is Naomi Campbell's partner. Hudson has been documenting her family's summer vacation across Europe on social media, recently sharing photos from a trip to Greece. The gathering highlights a relaxed, star-studded holiday in the Mediterranean.</p>

          <p>The United States has issued an ultimatum to its trading partners, demanding new trade agreements be finalized by August 1 or face the reinstatement of higher tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that countries without a deal will see import duties revert to the elevated levels proposed in April, with rates potentially reaching up to 50% on goods from the European Union. This "maximum pressure" strategy is part of President Trump's push for what he terms "reciprocal" trade, and the administration indicates it is close to finalizing several agreements ahead of the deadline.

          <p>Daniel Park, a man accused of conspiring in the deadly bombing of a California fertility clinic, has died in federal custody in what is being investigated as a suicide. His death at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles effectively closes the only prosecution related to the bombing, which killed the alleged bomber and injured four others. This event has intensified scrutiny of the L.A. detention facility, as attorneys and a recent Inspector General report have raised serious concerns about inmate safety and inadequate medical care.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country have led to a significant loss of life, with the death toll rising to at least 79 people and more than 40 individuals still unaccounted for. The disaster was particularly tragic at Camp Mystic, a children's summer camp, where numerous campers and a counselor are among the missing after the Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed. In response, President Trump has signed a major disaster declaration for Kerr County, enabling federal resources to aid in the extensive, round-the-clock search and rescue operations involving state and local emergency responders.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the deadly Texas floods, a dispute has surfaced between state officials and the National Weather Service regarding the adequacy of the weather forecast. Some Texas officials, including Kerr County's top elected leader, claimed the catastrophic scale of the flood was unexpected. However, the NWS defended its performance, stating it had issued appropriate flood watches and flash flood emergency warnings in a timely manner. This debate highlights the inherent difficulties in predicting the exact location and intensity of extreme rainfall, a challenge potentially compounded by recent staffing shortages within the NWS.</p>

          <p>A Domino's Pizza restaurant in Herriman, Utah, was completely destroyed by a powerful explosion after an SUV crashed into the building and ruptured a gas line. In a remarkable turn of events, two courageous bystanders rescued the driver and a passenger from the vehicle just minutes before it was engulfed in flames and the subsequent blast occurred. No one was inside the Domino's or adjacent businesses at the time of the crash, and no injuries were reported from the explosion itself.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Spending Bill Contains Major Provision Defunding Planned Parenthood</h2>

          <p>A significant and controversial provision within President Trump's new spending bill is set to bar Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid reimbursements for any health services it provides. Experts warn this measure represents a major blow to reproductive healthcare access, as it will defund not just abortions but also basic services like vaccinations, prenatal care, and cancer screenings. Reproductive rights activists and health policy experts argue that in many communities, Planned Parenthood is the only accessible provider, and its defunding will create a devastating healthcare vacuum for vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>An FBI report reveals a surge in quit claim deed fraud in New Hampshire, where scammers known as "title pirates" have stolen over $4 million from homeowners since 2019. These criminals forge documents to illicitly transfer property ownership, primarily targeting vacant lots, vacation homes, and properties owned by the elderly or those living out of state. Authorities are warning the public about this sophisticated scam and advising homeowners to take proactive steps, such as obtaining title insurance and signing up for county property alerts, to protect their assets.

          <p>Following a public split with President Trump over the new tax and spending bill, Elon Musk announced the formation of a new political party called the "America Party." Musk, a former White House adviser, has been a vocal critic of the legislation, labeling it fiscally irresponsible for increasing the national deficit. The move signals a renewed feud between the two influential figures, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent publicly suggesting that Musk should focus on his business activities rather than political ones, reflecting the administration's disapproval.</p>

          <p>India's cricket team achieved a commanding 336-run victory over England in the second Test at Edgbaston, leveling the five-match series at 1-1.
