          <p>A Minnesota nurse, Alex Pennig, was found dead from a gunshot wound in her bathroom, with her ex-boyfriend Matthew Ecker claiming it was a suicide. However, investigators grew suspicious due to inconsistencies in his story, such as the position of the body, a dry sink where he claimed to have washed his hands, and the fact that the right-handed victim was shot on her left side. Key evidence, including a piece of a broken door lock found under the victim, ultimately led to Ecker's arrest, trial, and conviction for second-degree murder, for which he was sentenced to 30 years in prison.</p>

          <p>Legendary New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera sustained a torn Achilles tendon during the team's annual Old-Timers' Day game. The 55-year-old Hall of Famer was injured while moving to field a fly ball in shallow center field and will require surgery. Rivera, baseball's all-time saves leader, had previously suffered a major knee injury in 2012 while shagging fly balls but returned to play a final season. The event, which commemorated the 2000 championship team, was marked by the unfortunate injury to one of the sport's most revered figures.</p>

          <p>The fashion industry is experiencing a shift away from the understated "quiet luxury" trend towards more visible and bold "loud luxury" styles, characterized by large logos and distinctive designs. This change is driven by luxury brands like Gucci, Burberry, and Moncler attempting to reignite consumer interest and rebound from a period of softer sales. Analysts suggest this sartorial shake-up, spurred by new creative directors and management, is a cyclical move to inject novelty into the market. The trend also reflects a divide where ultra-luxe brands maintain high prices while others use more accessible pricing and bold branding to attract a wider audience. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alibaba's world-renowned AI research lab, the Damo Academy, is becoming a significant target for talent poaching by domestic rivals like JD.com and Tencent.

This trend highlights the intense competition within China's technology sector for top-tier AI expertise as companies race to develop their own advanced AI models.

          <p>Following a deadly shooting at the CDC's Atlanta headquarters, some agency employees expressed that the attack, while terrifying, was not entirely surprising given the escalating hostility toward public health workers. The gunman, who killed a police officer before being found dead, was reportedly motivated by anti-vaccine beliefs. In the aftermath, some CDC staff have pointed to the combative rhetoric from political figures, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as a contributing factor to the climate of mistrust and violence. The incident has left many public health professionals feeling abandoned and unsafe in their own workplace.</p>

          <p>After a prolonged boom period, the Kentucky bourbon industry is facing a significant slowdown due to a combination of economic factors. Post-pandemic inflation, changing consumer habits among younger generations, and the looming threat of retaliatory trade tariffs have all contributed to declining sales. This downturn follows a renaissance for the spirit, which saw sales grow significantly over the last decade. Now, with an oversupply in the market and economic pressures mounting, several distilleries have faced financial hardship, including bankruptcy, signaling a potential bust cycle for the iconic American whiskey.

Experts are skeptical that the small amounts of supplements like Lion's Mane mushroom, L-theanine, and Ashwagandha in these drinks can produce their advertised effects. A recent ruling by the UK's Advertising Standards Agency banned an ad from a leading brand, Trip, for making unsubstantiated health claims. While some consumers find the drinks to be a good non-alcoholic alternative for unwinding, psychologists suggest the perceived calming effect may be more of a placebo, created by the ritual of taking a moment for oneself.</p>

          <p>Six months after its release, the Chinese AI app DeepSeek continues to impact the tech industry, despite falling from the headlines. Its launch challenged the American-led assumption that bigger and more expensive models were always better, demonstrating that efficient engineering could yield powerful results at a fraction of the cost. While concerns over data privacy and links to the Chinese government persist, some US startups continue to use the model to save money. The event also served as a "Sputnik moment," intensifying the US-China AI rivalry and prompting American firms like OpenAI to release their own smaller, open models.</p>

          <p>A man identified as Patrick Joseph White opened fire on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) campus in Atlanta, killing police officer David Rose before being found dead himself. According to law enforcement, the gunman was reportedly fixated on the belief that a COVID-19 vaccine had made him depressed and suicidal. The attack has drawn renewed attention to the hostility faced by public health workers, with some former CDC employees blaming the political rhetoric of figures like Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for fueling such violence. Kennedy, a noted vaccine skeptic, expressed sympathy, which was rejected by a former employees' group.</p>

          <p>US fashion designer Willy Chavarria and Adidas have expressed regret after facing accusations of cultural appropriation from authorities in Oaxaca, Mexico. The controversy surrounds a new sandal design that Mexican officials claim improperly reinterprets and names a traditional huarache sandal unique to the region. Mexico's government is seeking compensation, and local authorities have demanded the product be withdrawn. Chavarria acknowledged the design should have been developed in partnership with the Oaxacan community, while Adidas stated it is seeking to meet with officials to "repair the damage."</p>

The surge followed CEO Tim Cook's appearance at the White House, where he announced plans to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts over the next four years. In response, President Trump indicated that Apple would be exempt from potential future tariffs on imported chips, alleviating investor concerns about a significant financial hit to the company. The successful meeting, combined with strong quarterly earnings, has bolstered investor confidence in the tech giant. (not investment advice)</p>

Lindsey's lawyer claims the player was unaware his friends were wanted for murder.

          <p>Rangers head coach Russell Martin has admitted there is "no quick fix" for the team's recurring issues after a disappointing draw against Dundee in the Scottish Premiership. The result came just days after a lauded 3-0 victory in a Champions League qualifier, highlighting a familiar pattern of inconsistency that has plagued the club under previous managers. Despite a team of new players and new ownership, Rangers have drawn both of their opening league matches.

          <p>British police arrested 365 people in central London during a demonstration in support of Palestine Action, a pro-Palestinian group recently banned by the government. Supporters gathered outside the Houses of Parliament, intentionally violating the new law that makes it a crime to publicly support the organization. The protest was a deliberate effort to challenge the ban, which activists argue illegally restricts freedom of expression, and to strain the criminal justice system. The government banned Palestine Action after its members broke into a Royal Air Force base to protest UK support for Israel's military actions.</p>

          <p>The UK's justice secretary has announced new plans that would allow for the immediate deportation of foreign criminals upon receiving a custodial sentence. Under the proposal, offenders with fixed-term sentences could be deported right away and barred from re-entering the country, with their home country deciding whether they serve out their sentences. The government claims this would save taxpayer money, as foreign offenders constitute about 12% of the prison population. Critics, however, warn that some countries may refuse to accept the deported individuals, questioning the plan's feasibility.</p>
