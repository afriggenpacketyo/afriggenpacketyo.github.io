          <p>Members of the European Parliament rejected a request to hold a minute of silence for assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk, sparking protests from right-wing lawmakers. The Parliament's president, Roberta Metsola, stated the denial was based on procedural rules requiring such tributes to be submitted at the start of the session. When the requesting MEP attempted to use his speaking time for silence, he was cut off, leading to accusations of hypocrisy from some who noted a previous tribute for George Floyd.</p>

Kruglov was found dead in what is being investigated as a homicide, but his father expressed frustration with the pace of the local sheriff's investigation. The appeal highlights the family's desire for federal resources to solve the mysterious killing that occurred amidst tens of thousands of festival attendees.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years and three months in prison after finding him guilty of orchestrating a military coup plot. The court ruled he led a conspiracy to remain in power following his 2022 election defeat to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. In addition to the prison sentence, the 70-year-old politician has been barred from running for public office until 2033, effectively ending his political career for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <p>Teaching unions in the UK have raised concerns that an increasing number of children are starting primary school lacking fundamental skills like being toilet-trained or speaking in full sentences. A survey of over 1,000 teachers revealed that a third have at least five children in their reception class who need help with using the toilet. This trend, partly attributed to social isolation and increased screen time, places additional burdens on schools to address developmental gaps before academic learning can begin.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has publicly predicted the failure of Spirit Airlines, stating that the discount carrier's business model is unsustainable and that customers "hate" it. Kirby argued that the model of offering low base fares while charging fees for all other services is no longer viable, especially as larger airlines successfully compete with their own basic economy options. Spirit Airlines has recently filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in a year amid financial struggles.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that President Trump's immediate blaming of the "radical left" for Charlie Kirk's assassination is a strategic misrepresentation of political violence in America. The piece contends that while extremism exists on both sides, data from recent decades indicates that far-right actors have been responsible for a significantly larger share of domestic terrorist attacks and plots. The article suggests Trump's rhetoric deliberately ignores this context to create a politically advantageous but factually inaccurate narrative of fear.</p>
