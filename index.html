          <p>China's leading on-demand delivery service, Meituan, has announced that its daily orders have surged to a new record of 150 million. This milestone, covering both food and retail goods, indicates the company is successfully defending its market share against intense competition from rivals like JD.com and Alibaba. Meituan's founder and CEO, Wang Xing, has pledged to do "whatever it takes to win" in the instant delivery market, committing to a 100 billion yuan investment to support merchants and stimulate consumer demand. The growth comes as competitors are increasingly investing in the food delivery sector.</p>

          <p>The upcoming week is set to be critical for global markets, with major U.S. banks kicking off a new earnings season under the shadow of ongoing trade tensions. Analysts predict that President Trump's tariff policies will begin to negatively impact corporate earnings, with S&P 500 growth expected to decelerate significantly. Meanwhile, finance ministers and central bankers are preparing for a G20 meeting in South Africa, a country recently targeted by new U.S. tariffs. The U.S. Treasury Secretary's decision to skip the meeting signals continued diplomatic friction, casting uncertainty over future international cooperation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 2018 murder of Aileen Seiden in Florida's Franklin County led investigators down a path involving a volatile three-person romantic relationship, or 'throuple'. Seiden was found brutally beaten, and the investigation soon focused on her partners, Zachary Abell and Christina Araujo, with whom she shared a motel room. The case, which took nearly six years to go to trial, revealed a history of jealousy, alcohol-fueled violence, and manipulation. Ultimately, Araujo took a plea deal and testified against Abell, who was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.</p>

          <p>As Barcelona's football prodigy Lamine Yamal turns 18, he stands at the center of immense attention and speculation, having already played over 100 first-team games. Despite constant comparisons to Lionel Messi, Yamal insists on creating his own legacy, supported by a grounded family life that helps him manage the pressures of fame. His on-pitch maturity and remarkable statistics have led to a contract renewal until 2031 with a reported 1 billion euro buyout clause. While still a work in progress, his combination of immense talent, humility, and on-field freedom positions him as a generational star for both his club and the Spanish national team.</p>

          <p>Kindergartens across China are struggling with the economic consequences of the country's rapidly declining birth rate, forcing many to change their enrollment strategies or close down entirely. In northeastern China, a kindergarten once reserved for officials' children now recruits from the general public to fill its classrooms. National data shows a significant drop in both the number of kindergartens and student enrollment since 2020, with nearly 40,000 schools closing and the number of enrolled children falling by over 25%. This demographic shift is creating significant operational and financial challenges for the early education sector.</p>

          <p>In the murder trial of Melissa Turner, accused of killing her boyfriend Matthew Trussler, audio from a neighbor's security camera played a pivotal role. The footage captured sounds of a loud argument, including a woman's voice yelling phrases like "Get up now" and "So f****** die." Turner claimed she acted in self-defense after Trussler strangled her, but prosecutors used the audio, along with video from a camera inside the couple's home, to argue she was the aggressor. A jury ultimately found Turner guilty of second-degree murder, and she was sentenced to 20.5 years in prison for the 2019 killing.</p>

          <p>Malaysia is currently experiencing a significant shift in its political dynamics, marked by the growing influence of conservative Islamic parties. The opposition Perikatan Nasional coalition, which includes the Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), has made substantial electoral gains, challenging the more liberal agenda of Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's government. This "green wave" reflects increasing support for conservative policies, particularly among younger Malay voters, and is creating a long-term challenge to the nation's multi-ethnic and multi-religious identity. Observers note this trend could lead to a more conservative society and greater bureaucratization of Islam in the coming years.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has fired at least 20 Justice Department employees, including prosecutors and support staff, who were involved in former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigations into Donald Trump. According to sources, the dismissals were identified through the department's "weaponization working group" and included individuals in various roles, some not directly involved in driving the prosecutions. This move follows the earlier ousting of most senior prosecutors associated with the probes and has reportedly created a sense of unease among the department's career workforce, echoing earlier purges during the Trump presidency.</p>

          <p>Irvine police have arrested three women for their alleged involvement in an organized retail theft operation that targeted multiple stores in Orange County. The suspects, all 18 or 19 years old, were apprehended after a license plate reader identified their van, which had been linked to a previous theft. After a brief foot pursuit, officers took the women into custody and discovered over $12,500 worth of stolen merchandise inside their vehicle. The goods were reportedly taken from stores in Irvine, Santa Ana, and Costa Mesa. The three women now face multiple charges, including organized retail theft, grand theft, and burglary.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has declared its intention to impose a 30% tariff on all imports from the European Union and Mexico, starting August 1. In letters to both trading partners, President Trump warned that any retaliatory tariffs would be met with further increases. He criticized the EU for persistent trade deficits and accused Mexico of failing to adequately address drug trafficking. The announcement has drawn criticism from both the EU and Mexico, who have threatened countermeasures while also expressing a desire to continue negotiations to avert a full-scale trade war.

          <p>UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting is scheduled to meet with the British Medical Association (BMA) next week in an attempt to prevent a planned five-day strike by resident doctors in England. The BMA has announced the walkout, set to begin on July 25, over an ongoing pay dispute, arguing that a proposed 5.4% increase is insufficient to restore real-terms pay from 2008 levels. While the government insists it cannot improve the pay offer, the health department has indicated a willingness to discuss improving working conditions. The BMA maintains that the strike will only be called off if a credible new offer is presented.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated a significant reorganization, laying off 1,353 civil and foreign service employees as part of a plan to reduce its domestic workforce by 15%. The cuts are part of a broader Trump administration effort to streamline what it calls a "bloated bureaucracy" by eliminating or merging offices. Many of the affected departments focus on human rights, refugee admissions, and foreign assistance, drawing sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers who warn the move will weaken U.S. diplomacy. The layoffs have caused alarm among staff, with the American Foreign Service Association calling the reductions "untethered from merit or mission."</p>
