          <p>TeraWulf's stock experienced a significant rally, jumping over 10%, after Google increased its ownership stake in the bitcoin mining and datacenter company to 14%. This investment is part of a larger deal that provides up to $3.2 billion in total backstop funding to support the expansion of TeraWulf's facility in Lake Mariner, New York. The agreement, which strengthens the strategic alignment between the two companies for building advanced AI infrastructure, follows recent computing deals that have caused the company's shares to rise approximately 90% in the last week.

He expressed his desire to stop the killing but acknowledged strategic reasons why a ceasefire might not be wanted by either side. Trump also reiterated his call for a trilateral meeting with the U.S., Russia, and Ukraine, a proposal Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was prepared for. The discussions also touched upon security guarantees for Ukraine, with Trump indicating that details might be revealed later in the day.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that nearly a third of individuals using the over-the-counter birth control pill, Opill, were previously using no contraceptive method at all. The research, published in JAMA Network Open, surveyed users across 44 states and found the pill is successfully reaching populations with significant barriers to healthcare, including the uninsured, younger people, and those in rural areas. The most common reason for choosing the OTC option was the convenience of not needing a doctor's appointment. Experts believe this increased access is a powerful tool for reproductive autonomy, especially for marginalized communities.</p>

          <p>Actress Sophie Turner revealed that kissing her 'Game of Thrones' co-star Kit Harington for their new horror film, "The Dreadful," was a deeply uncomfortable experience. Having portrayed siblings for years on the HBO series, the two actors share a close, brother-sister-like bond in real life, which made filming romantic scenes awkward. Turner explained on "Late Night with Seth Meyers" that both she and Harington were "retching" during their first kissing scene on set, describing the moment as "vile." Despite the awkwardness, they proceeded with the film because they felt the script was too good to refuse.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 13:31:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trend dubbed "job hugging" is replacing the "great resignation," as American workers increasingly cling to their current roles amid economic uncertainty. The rate at which employees voluntarily quit their jobs has fallen to its lowest consistent level since early 2016, reflecting growing anxiety about finding new employment in a cooling labor market. This stagnation is driven by a slower hiring rate and reduced job openings compared to previous years. While providing stability, experts warn that job hugging can lead to wage stagnation and may hinder career growth by reducing opportunities to learn new skills. (not investment advice)</p>

This passive approach ensures that money is consistently put to work in an investment an individual already favors. While not suitable for those who rely on dividend income for expenses, historical data shows this method can significantly boost long-term returns; for example, the SPY S&P 500 ETF saw a much higher total return with dividends reinvested over a decade.

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal mediated by Egypt and Qatar. The framework reportedly involves a 60-day truce during which Hamas would release approximately half of the remaining 50 Israeli hostages in exchange for negotiations on a permanent ceasefire. Israel's official response remains uncertain, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has recently stated it would only accept a deal that releases all hostages at once. This development comes amid intense Israeli strikes on Gaza City and large-scale protests in Tel Aviv demanding the government secure the hostages' return.</p>

          <p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has predicted that the U.S. Supreme Court will overturn its 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision, which established a national right to same-sex marriage. In an interview, Clinton warned that the court would likely send the issue back to the states, mirroring its reversal of Roe v. Wade. She noted that while the federal Respect for Marriage Act protects existing unions, it does not compel states to issue new marriage licenses if the national precedent is removed. Citing Justice Clarence Thomas's previous calls to reconsider such rulings, Clinton urged LGBTQ+ couples to consider getting married now to secure their legal status.</p>

          <p>In a satirical column, The Atlantic imagines a specialized police unit dedicated to preventing "sandwich-based crimes" in Washington, D.C. The piece humorously critiques heavy-handed law enforcement tactics by contrasting them with the fictional unit's community-focused, de-escalation methods developed over 25 years of sandwich-crime-free peace. The narrative centers on the unit's dismay after federal marshals conduct a dramatic raid on a Justice Department worker accused of throwing a Subway sandwich. The satire uses the absurd premise to comment on disproportionate police responses and the importance of understanding the root causes of crime, rather than employing overwhelming force for minor infractions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts suggest that the best age to take out a reverse mortgage is typically in one's late 60s to early 70s, though the decision depends heavily on individual circumstances. A reverse mortgage allows seniors aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash without monthly repayments, but the loan balance grows over time. Waiting until an older age generally allows borrowers to access a larger portion of their home's equity, as lenders factor in a shorter life expectancy. Homeowners should consider their long-term financial goals, health, and other retirement income sources before deciding, as taking the loan too early could deplete equity needed for future expenses or inheritances.

This new assault on U.S. election integrity follows a March executive order in which Trump directed federal agencies to take actions against mail-in ballots and impose new voter registration requirements, though key parts of that order have been blocked by courts.

The Department of Education aims to halt loan forgiveness for individuals working at organizations deemed to be "undermining national security and American values through illegal means." Critics and advocates worry the vague language could be used to exclude employees of any nonprofit the administration disapproves of, creating a political litmus test for the popular program.

          <p>Germany's Foreign Ministry has confirmed that 211 Afghans who had been approved for resettlement in Germany were deported from Pakistan back to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. These individuals, including human rights defenders and former local staff for German institutions, had fled to Pakistan after the 2021 withdrawal of Western forces. The German government is now in contact with Pakistani authorities to facilitate their return to Pakistan and has arranged temporary accommodation for them in Afghanistan. This incident is part of a broader deportation campaign by Pakistan, affecting thousands of Afghans awaiting relocation to Western countries.</p>

          <p>Conservative media network Newsmax has agreed to a $67 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems to resolve a defamation lawsuit over false claims made about the 2020 presidential election. The settlement was reached before the case could go to trial, where a judge had already ruled that Newsmax did defame the voting equipment company. Internal communications revealed during the case showed that Newsmax officials and hosts knew the election fraud allegations were baseless but saw a business opportunity in catering to viewers who believed them. This follows a similar, larger settlement paid by Fox News to Dominion in 2023.</p>

          <p>The cable news channel MSNBC is set to change its name to MS NOW and will drop the iconic NBC peacock logo as part of its spinoff from parent company Comcast's NBC Universal. The new name, standing for My Source News Opinion World, is intended to underscore the brand's focus on breaking news and opinion journalism. The rebranding is part of the creation of a new, independent media company called Versant, which will also include CNBC and entertainment networks like USA and SYFY. The move aims to establish a separate identity for the news organization as it hires new journalists and charts its own course.</p>

          <p>Several European heads of state have traveled to Washington for talks with President Trump, aiming to prevent what they fear could be a capitulation to Russia in the war in Ukraine. Their concern was sparked by Trump's recent shift in strategy after meeting with President Putin, where he dropped demands for a ceasefire as a precondition for peace talks. European leaders, including France's Emmanuel Macron, are worried that the U.S. might push Ukraine to cede territory without securing meaningful, long-term security guarantees for the entire European continent. The visit is a high-stakes effort to ensure Western unity and avoid a deal that could undermine Europe's security architecture.</p>

          <p>The Canada Industrial Relations Board has declared the ongoing strike by 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants illegal, ordering them to immediately return to work. The strike, now in its third day, has disrupted travel for an estimated 130,000 passengers daily during the peak summer season. The union defied an initial back-to-work order and has been instructed by the board to notify all members that they must resume their duties. The labor dispute centers on pay and compensation for unpaid work, with the union and airline remaining far apart in negotiations, raising questions about how the government will enforce the board's ruling if defiance continues.</p>

          <p>Germany's Football Federation (DFB) has opened an investigation into two separate incidents of racist abuse directed at players during German Cup matches over the weekend. In one match, Schalke's Christopher Antwi-Adjei reported being racially insulted by fans, leading to a temporary suspension of the game. In another fixture, a Kaiserslautern player was allegedly insulted by a spectator who was quickly identified and removed.

          <p>As talks on the Ukraine war continue, this article examines the financial contributions made by the United States and Europe since Russia's 2022 invasion. According to the Kiel Institute, the U.S. has committed $130.6 billion, while European nations combined have provided more, at $165.7 billion. This contradicts some claims that the U.S. has shouldered a disproportionately larger share of the financial burden. The aid from both sides consists of a mix of grants and loans, though the U.S. has provided a higher proportion of grants, while the EU has offered more loans, some with generous repayment terms tied to frozen Russian assets.</p>

          <p>Amid growing political pressure to lower drug prices, Novo Nordisk has announced it will offer its popular diabetes drug Ozempic for $499 per month to cash-paying U.S. patients. This price is less than half of the medication's monthly list price of nearly $1,350. The discount will be available through various platforms, including the company's direct-to-consumer pharmacy and savings company GoodRx, expanding access for patients without insurance coverage. The move follows a similar price cut for its weight-loss drug Wegovy and is seen as an effort to make the branded medication more accessible and compete with cheaper, unapproved compounded versions.</p>

With large swaths of the country controlled by opposition forces and Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party banned from participating, the credibility of the vote is in serious doubt.
