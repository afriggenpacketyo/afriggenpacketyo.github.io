          <p>The family of Louise Gleadell, a mother who died from cervical cancer, has been awarded damages after the NHS admitted to misreporting her cervical screening results. Two tests, in 2008 and 2012, were wrongly reported as negative, and a 2017 internal review found the samples were inadequate but Ms Gleadell was not informed. Her sisters, Laura and Clare Gleadell, are encouraging all women to get cervical screenings, and will be meeting with the NHS to find out exactly how and why was Louise given false information after her smears.</p>

          <p>Experts say that men are more likely to die prematurely than women, and that the government in England is launching a consultation for its men's health strategy. Men are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol, use drugs and have high cholesterol and blood pressure. Machismo is also a factor, and it is important to pay particular attention to the impact of deprivation. NHS health checks are considered a crucial intervention when it comes to many of the diseases which are claiming the lives of men early, but fewer than four in 10 men take up the offer.</p>
