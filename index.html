          <p>Public defiance against Hamas is increasing in Gaza, with Palestinians expressing open dissent against the group that has ruled the strip for nearly two decades. Many Gazans hold Hamas responsible for the territory's dire crisis, criticizing their leadership and demanding change. However, speaking out against Hamas remains dangerous, as the group has a history of suppressing dissent, punishing critics, and targeting activists, but recent protests suggest that civilians are losing their fear.</p>

          <p>An economist assesses the likelihood of a U.S. recession in light of recent economic indicators and President Trump's tariff policies, noting that recession predictors are emerging. Consumer and business confidence have declined, and prediction markets have increased the odds of a recession, with potential indicators being the Sahm rule, purchasing managers' indices, and retail sales data. While the official arbiter of recessions is the National Bureau of Economic Research, current information suggests a high probability of a U.S. recession in the coming years.

          <p>Uvalde city leaders have approved a $2 million settlement for families of the victims of the 2022 Robb Elementary School shooting, marking the first financial compensation related to the tragedy. The settlement will be distributed among the families of the victims and includes enhanced training for city police officers and expanded mental health services. The agreement also establishes May 24 as an annual day of remembrance and a permanent memorial in the city plaza, but families have other lawsuits pending in federal and state courts.</p>

          <p>Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg stated that China has stopped taking deliveries of its aircraft due to the ongoing trade war with the United States. Some 737 Max planes destined for Chinese airlines have been flown back to the U.S., and the company is considering reallocating aircraft intended for China to other customers. Despite the disruption, Ortberg expressed confidence that Boeing would not be derailed by the situation, highlighting the strong demand for Max aircraft.</p>

          <p>Chinese robot makers are largely unfazed by US tariffs, citing a lack of international competition and rigid demand from US customers. At China’s largest trade expo, an automated cafe made by Dolphin Robot Technology has garnered significant orders, despite the escalating US-China trade war. The firm's founder noted that their robotic cafe faces little competition and that US customers are willing to pay the higher prices due to the absence of similar products.</p>
