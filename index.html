          <p>Following a weaker-than-expected August jobs report, which saw only 22,000 nonfarm jobs added, financial commentator Jim Cramer has identified Home Depot as a key stock to purchase. He argues that the disappointing labor market data will lead to lower interest rates, including mortgage rates, which in turn will stimulate the housing market. Cramer believes this economic environment will create a significant surge for housing-related stocks, with Home Depot poised to be a primary beneficiary due to its strong position in the home improvement sector.

Alford, who denied the charges and claimed he was the victim of an extortion plot, is expected to receive a custodial sentence in December following the jury's majority verdict.</p>

          <p>A long-standing dispute over the ownership of Paula Modersohn-Becker's expressionist painting, "A Young Girl," is set to be resolved by Germany's Advisory Commission. The artwork, currently in Hamburg's Kunsthalle museum, was donated in 1958 by the widow of a Nazi party art collector. Heirs of Jewish businessman Robert Graetz, who was deported and killed by the Nazis, filed a restitution claim in 2020, asserting he was the original owner. The case highlights ongoing criticism of Germany's inefficient process for handling Nazi-looted art claims, as the commission is soon to be replaced by new arbitration tribunals.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has fined Google €2.95 billion ($3.47 billion) for engaging in abusive practices related to its online advertising technology. The regulatory body concluded that the tech giant violated antitrust laws, though specific details of the infractions were not immediately released in the breaking news report. Google has responded to the penalty by stating that the fine is "unjustified" and has confirmed its intention to appeal the European Commission's decision. This action represents another significant regulatory challenge for the company in Europe.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Angela Rayner has resigned from her positions as UK Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary after admitting she underpaid taxes on a property she purchased. The resignation, which also includes stepping down as deputy Labour leader, followed a finding by the prime minister's ethics adviser that she had breached the ministerial code. While the adviser noted she "acted with integrity," he concluded she failed to seek sufficient expert tax advice, leading to an error for which she has taken full responsibility. Her departure has prompted a major cabinet reshuffle.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board is asking shareholders to approve a new, long-term compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could be worth up to $975 billion if all milestones are met. The plan consists of 12 tranches tied to massive increases in the company's market capitalization, starting at $2 trillion and reaching up to $8.5 trillion, along with ambitious operational goals for vehicle and robot deliveries. This proposal comes after Musk's previous $56 billion pay package from 2018 was voided by a Delaware court, and it aims to keep him motivated and focused on the company's future growth.</p>

          <p>The NFL is reviewing an on-field incident involving Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter, who was ejected just six seconds into the season opener against the Dallas Cowboys. Carter appeared to spit on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, resulting in an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty and his removal from the game. Prescott later clarified that he had spat first out of habit, not at Carter, but that Carter took offense and retaliated. Carter has since apologized for his actions, calling it a mistake, but may face additional discipline from the league pending the outcome of the review.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed legislation increasing the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year. This change modifies the $10,000 limit that was imposed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which had for the first time capped a deduction that was previously unlimited. The move is expected to primarily benefit taxpayers in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California, who itemize their deductions. However, estimates from the Joint Committee on Taxation suggest the higher cap will add over $142 billion to the national debt over the next decade.</p>

          <p>Peace organizations in Germany are reporting a significant increase in inquiries from young people seeking advice on how to avoid military service. This surge in interest follows a new law requiring young men to register their willingness to serve, which many see as a step toward reintroducing conscription. Germany suspended mandatory service in 2011 but faces pressure to expand its armed forces to meet NATO obligations. While German law protects the right to conscientious objection, individuals must formally apply and provide personal reasons, creating uncertainty and concern among those who may soon be required to serve.</p>

          <p>A new United Nations report has detailed horrific atrocities in the Democratic Republic of Congo, concluding that serious rights violations committed by both M23 rebels and Congolese government forces may amount to war crimes. The fact-finding mission found evidence of summary executions, torture, and systematic sexual violence by M23, allegedly with support from Rwanda. The report also documents grave abuses by Congolese forces and allied militias, including gang sexual assault and the killing of civilians. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights described the findings as horrific, emphasizing the widespread nature of the violations.</p>

          <p>Private market investment platform Yieldstreet has informed customers to expect significant losses on a series of marine loan deals totaling $89 million. The company reached a $5 million settlement with the borrowers who defaulted, but stated this amount will not cover its own extensive legal recovery costs, leaving nothing for investors. The loans, backed by ships intended for scrap metal, soured after Yieldstreet lost track of the collateral vessels and accused the borrower of fraud. This outcome adds to other recent investor losses on the platform, which has since shifted its business model.</p>

          <p>Recent satellite images analyzed by BBC Verify show extensive destruction of buildings in several neighborhoods of Gaza City, including Sheikh Radwan and Zeitoun. The damage is a result of intensified Israeli military operations over the past month, which the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) state are aimed at dismantling "terror infrastructures." The new offensive follows the breakdown of ceasefire talks, and the images also reveal the disappearance of tent encampments for displaced Palestinians, highlighting the severe humanitarian impact of the escalating conflict.

          <p>A decade after the landmark detention of the "Feminist Five" activists, China's feminist movement is grappling with an intensified government crackdown. While public awareness of gender issues has grown, the space for activism has shrunk dramatically, with authorities systematically silencing feminist voices on social media platforms like Weibo and WeChat. Accounts are frequently banned for "inciting gender confrontation," and keywords related to the #MeToo movement are censored. The state frames feminism as a subversive Western ideology, creating a hostile environment where activists are isolated and victims of harassment often face counter-suits.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is expected to attend the men's singles final at the US Open tennis tournament in New York on Sunday. This will mark his first visit to the Grand Slam event since 2015, before he was first elected president. A White House official confirmed the planned attendance for the match, which is held in the Queens borough where Trump was born. The finalists will be determined by Friday's semifinal matches between Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz, and Jannik Sinner and Felix Auger-Aliassime, with no American players remaining in contention.</p>

          <p>Four Democratic senators have sent a letter to the Smithsonian Institution's secretary, urging him to resist what they call attempts by the White House to "bully the institution." The letter follows President Trump's criticism of the Smithsonian's exhibits as "WOKE" and a White House memo targeting specific displays for allegedly presenting a negative narrative of American history. The senators assert that the Smithsonian is an independent federal trust under congressional, not executive, oversight. They have asked to be kept updated on the institution's response to a planned White House audit of its museums.</p>

          <p>Despite a massive military parade in Beijing designed to project strength, acts of public dissent are capturing attention in China. One activist, Qi Hong, projected anti-communist slogans onto a high-rise building in Chongqing before fleeing the country, an act inspired by similar protests against government policies. Such defiance is rare in China's tightly controlled environment, where criticism of the state is swiftly punished and censored from social media. The contrast between the orchestrated patriotism of the parade and these bold, isolated protests highlights a simmering public frustration with the ruling Communist Party.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Margaret Sullivan critiques major news organizations for their muted coverage of President Trump's recent absence from public view and visible health issues. The author contrasts this with the intense media scrutiny of Joe Biden's age and health during his presidency, suggesting a double standard. The article argues that while rampant speculation is unhelpful, the White House's lack of transparency about Trump's condition, such as swollen ankles and verbal confusion, warrants persistent, evidence-based journalistic inquiry. The author calls for dogged reporting rather than unquestioning acceptance of official statements.</p>

          <p>Following a recent legislative victory that removed the $200 tax on items like silencers and short-barreled rifles, gun rights groups are now launching a legal assault to overturn the National Firearms Act (NFA) of 1934 entirely. Led by organizations like Gun Owners of America, the movement argues that the NFA's remaining registration and background check requirements are unconstitutional. This push reflects a shift from a fringe idea to a mainstream conservative position, supported by multiple Republican-led states. The effort aims to deregulate a booming market for these items, which gun control advocates view as a significant public safety risk.</p>

This demonstration of advanced capabilities, including propellant transfer, has raised concerns among former officials that China could potentially beat the U.S. in returning to the moon.

          <p>A review of "Snowy Day and Other Stories," the first English-translated collection by acclaimed South Korean writer and director Lee Chang-dong, praises his masterful use of imagery to evoke emotion and political atmosphere. The stories, written early in his career during the repressive 1980s Chun Doo-hwan dictatorship, explore themes of masculinity, state violence, and paranoia. The reviewer notes that Lee's literary style foreshadows his cinematic work, like the film "Burning," by communicating meaning through feeling and intuition rather than direct explanation. The collection is celebrated for its ability to transport readers into its tense, historical setting.</p>

Along the coast south of Mumbai, activists collect turtle eggs from the seashore to protect them from predators and incubate them in safe hatcheries. Once the baby turtles hatch, they are carefully released onto the sand to make their way to the Arabian Sea. During this critical journey, conservationists and sometimes tourists watch over them, shooing away threats like crabs and dogs, and cheering as the tiny hatchlings finally reach the waves.</p>
