          <p>Kansas City, Missouri, is grappling with a significant increase in its homeless population, prompting the city to implement a new strategy aimed at achieving "functional zero," where individuals experiencing homelessness are back on their feet within 30 days. The plan involves coordinating resources from churches, aid organizations, and shelters to provide comprehensive support, including housing and addressing addiction and mental health issues. Outreach coordinators are working to build trust with the unsheltered, and the city hopes to align resources to get people a place to stay while supporting their needs. One couple, previously living in an encampment, is now moving into a new home through a federal voucher program, highlighting the potential for positive change.</p>

          <p>During a state visit to Saudi Arabia, President Trump announced the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria, a move intended to provide economic relief to the war-torn country and foster stability in the Middle East. Trump stated the decision was influenced by discussions with the Saudi crown prince and Turkey's president. The announcement was met with cheers at a business forum in Riyadh, and Syrians celebrated in major cities, expressing hope for economic recovery and reintegration into the global financial system. The Syrian foreign minister praised Saudi Arabia's role in the decision, signaling a potential shift in regional dynamics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A forthcoming book, "Original Sin," details how former President Biden's aides allegedly suppressed concerns about his age and cognitive decline during his time in the White House. The book recounts instances of Biden forgetting names of longtime aides and allies, as well as appearing frail in meetings. Despite these observations, few Biden allies spoke openly about his decline, even after he withdrew from the presidential race. The book relies heavily on anonymous sources, making it difficult to verify the accuracy of many claims, but it paints a picture of an inner circle that avoided addressing the president's diminishing abilities.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, were resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, opening the door for their potential release after more than three decades. The decision came after family members testified about the brothers' rehabilitation in prison, and both brothers apologized for their crimes. The case has sparked renewed interest and sympathy, particularly among younger generations who view the brothers as victims of a flawed criminal justice system and societal attitudes toward sexual assault. The state parole board is scheduled to conduct separate hearings for Erik and Lyle Menendez on June 13.</p>

The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office opposes their release, arguing they have not taken full responsibility for their crimes. A parole board will conduct hearings and submit reports to the governor for a clemency determination.</p>

Rose was banned for betting on baseball, while Jackson was involved in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. The decision has sparked debate about whether their achievements outweigh their transgressions, as Hall of Fame voters are instructed to consider a player's integrity and character. The Hall of Fame stated that anyone removed from Baseball's permanently ineligible list will become eligible for Hall of Fame consideration.</p>

          <p>Federal judges across the nation are being targeted by "pizza doxxings," where unsolicited pizza deliveries are sent to their homes, often with the recipient listed as Daniel Anderl, the deceased son of a judge whose son was killed in 2020. This tactic is seen as a form of psychological warfare designed to intimidate judges. The U.S. Marshals Service is investigating the incidents, which are part of a broader trend of rising threats against public officials.</p>

          <p>During his first major foreign trip, President Trump pledged to lift sanctions against Syria and touted the U.S.-Saudi relationship as strong.

          <p>A team of researchers in China has questioned hospitals’ rapid adoption of DeepSeek , warning that it creates clinical safety and privacy risks, raising red flags over the rush to use the artificial intelligence (AI) start-up’s cost-efficient open-source models. As of early March, at least 300 hospitals in China have started using DeepSeek’s large language models (LLMs) in clinical diagnostics and medical decision support.</p>

          <p>Judge Hannah C. Dugan of the Milwaukee County Circuit Court was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of concealing a person from arrest and obstruction of proceedings. The indictment stems from allegations that she helped an undocumented immigrant elude federal agents who were waiting to arrest him outside her courtroom. Judge Dugan, who has been temporarily removed from the bench by the Wisconsin Supreme Court while the case against her advances, has indicated through a lawyer that she intends to fight the charges.</p>

          <p>Under the leadership of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Food and Drug Administration is seeking to remove prescription fluoride supplements for kids from the market. FDA claims that ingested fluoride changes the human microbiome in a concerning way, even though the research it cites is inconclusive. This contradicts years of research and best practices established by professional medical groups.</p>
