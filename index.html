The student, Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, was an unintended victim in a shooting that also injured two others. Amid a rising homicide count in the nation's capital, the FBI has joined the investigation to apprehend the suspects who remain at large.</p>

          <p>Severe rainfall across South Korea has resulted in at least 14 fatalities and left 12 people missing, with southern regions experiencing devastating landslides and flash floods. The relentless downpours, which began mid-week, forced thousands to evacuate and caused widespread disruption, including flight cancellations. Authorities note that this year's monsoon season has brought some of the heaviest rainfall on record, a phenomenon scientists attribute to climate change.</p>

          <h2>U.S. to Implement New $250 'Visa Integrity Fee' for International Visitors</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government is introducing a new "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for most nonimmigrant visa applicants, effective from the 2025 fiscal year. This charge is in addition to all other existing visa application costs and will apply to tourists, business travelers, and international students. While the provision includes a mechanism for reimbursement if visitors comply with all visa conditions, officials and experts express uncertainty about the implementation process and expect refunds to be rare.
