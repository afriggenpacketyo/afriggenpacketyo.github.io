        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite shared trade tensions with the U.S. under President Trump, Prime Minister Mark Carney's win in Canada's federal election is unlikely to immediately thaw relations between Ottawa and Beijing. Analysts cite Canada's deep-seated doubts about China's security threat as a major obstacle. Jeremy Paltiel from Carleton University suggests that while any Canadian government would prefer stable relations with China, significant breakthroughs are unlikely given the existing reservations. The election drew international attention due to Trump's tariff attacks against Canada, but analysts believe a quick resolution is improbable due to Canada's concerns about China. </p>

          <p>The White House has condemned Amazon's plan to display the cost of President Trump's tariffs next to product prices as a 'hostile and political act.' Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt questioned why Amazon didn't do the same during the Biden administration's high inflation. Amazon's move follows similar surcharges by Shein and Temu, highlighting the impact of tariffs on consumer prices. This action could signal a growing rift between Trump and Jeff Bezos, despite Bezos's earlier optimism about Trump's second term and Amazon's donation to Trump's inaugural fund.</p>

          <p>Wildlife officials have confirmed the presence of the highly invasive Chinese mitten crab in the Pacific Northwest after a commercial fisherman caught one in the Lower Columbia River. This marks the first confirmed sighting in the region, raising concerns due to the crab's history of causing infrastructure and ecological damage, as seen in the San Francisco Bay in the 1990s. The crab, known for its climbing abilities and burrowing habits, poses a threat to fishing gear, power plants, and riverbanks. Oregon and Washington wildlife agencies are collaborating to assess the extent of the infestation and are urging the public to report any sightings.</p>

          <p>After 100 days in office, Elon Musk's sweeping role in the Trump administration, particularly leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is under scrutiny. Musk's efforts to cut government agencies and slash the federal workforce have faced lawsuits and criticism, despite support from Republican voters and President Trump. While Musk promised $2 trillion in cuts, DOGE's savings have fallen far short, with many claims of cost savings being questioned. The White House defends DOGE's goals, but concerns persist regarding the impact of workforce cuts and Musk's influence on federal data and agency operations.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's earlier distancing himself from Project 2025, many of his policies implemented in the first 100 days of his second term closely mirror the initiative's proposals. These include abolishing the Department of Education, ending diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices, and shifting FEMA costs to the states. Project 2025, overseen by the Heritage Foundation, provides a roadmap for overhauling the executive branch.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the 50th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War approaches, the role of American protest culture, particularly music, in ending the conflict is being re-examined. Over 700 English-language protest songs were released during the war years, addressing the conflict, politics, and individual complicity. Artists like Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, and John Lennon used their music to criticize the war, and these songs became anthems for anti-war demonstrations and public events. The shared experience of protest culture, facilitated by accessible music technology, helped galvanize opposition to the war, although the Vietnamese perspective was largely absent from mainstream American protest music at the time.</p>

          <p>Spain and Portugal are recovering from a massive power outage that left millions without electricity for nearly a day, prompting investigations into the cause and measures to prevent recurrence. The blackout, triggered by connection problems and a disconnection from the French network, resulted in the sudden loss of 15 gigawatts of electricity. Initial recovery efforts focused on restoring power generation in the northern and southern regions, with hydroelectric and combined-cycle gas plants playing key roles. Neighboring countries like France and Morocco provided assistance, and power was gradually restored to substations across the peninsula, though questions remain about the stability and future of Spain's energy infrastructure.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to visit Michigan to announce tariff relief for U.S. automakers, aiming to reward domestic manufacturing and encourage further investment in America. The administration will maintain the 25% tariff on finished foreign-made cars and parts but prevent tariffs from stacking on top of each other. Automakers will be reimbursed for tariffs already paid, and a phased reimbursement plan will be implemented for tariffs on foreign auto parts. This move is intended to give automakers time to shift their supply chains back to the U.S., fostering a stronger partnership between the administration, domestic automakers, and American workers.</p>

Despite benefiting from an estimated $38 billion in public support for companies like Tesla and SpaceX, Musk has used his position in the Trump administration to slash renewable energy incentives and federal climate investments. Critics argue that Musk's actions are hypocritical, as his companies continue to profit from government contracts while he advocates for policies built on climate denial.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that individual investors are maintaining their positions during recent market volatility due to their confidence in President Trump's tariff policy. Bessent contrasted this with institutional investors, who he claimed have panicked. Despite concerns from institutions about the potential economic impact of tariffs, Bessent cited data indicating that the majority of Americans have not engaged in trading activity. However, economists and financial leaders have expressed concerns that tariffs could lead to economic slowdown or recession, highlighting a divergence in sentiment between individual and institutional investors.</p>

          <p>Pfizer has announced an expansion of its cost-cutting program, aiming to save an additional $1.2 billion by the end of 2027, primarily through enhanced digital enablement and streamlining business processes. The pharmaceutical giant reported first-quarter profit that exceeded expectations, despite a decline in sales largely due to decreasing revenue from its COVID-19 antiviral pill, Paxlovid. The expanded cuts include research and development reorganization cost savings of around $500 million by the end of 2026, which will be reinvested into Pfizer's product pipeline. These measures are part of Pfizer's efforts to recover from the decline in its COVID business and boost its stock price.</p>
