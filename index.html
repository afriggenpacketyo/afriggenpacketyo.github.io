          <p>Conservative youth activist Charlie Kirk was shot and injured during a speaking event at Utah Valley University. Law enforcement officials confirmed a suspect is in custody after a single shot was fired on campus. Kirk was immediately taken from the scene by his security team, and his condition was not immediately released. The incident drew widespread condemnation and calls for prayer from prominent political figures, including President Donald Trump and Utah Governor Spencer Cox, who vowed that those responsible would be held accountable.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve projected to cut interest rates, savers are evaluating the best placement for their money between CDs and high-yield savings accounts. CDs offer a fixed interest rate, which allows savers to lock in current high returns before rates fall, protecting their earnings from future cuts. In contrast, high-yield savings accounts have variable rates that will likely decrease following the Fed's decision. The choice depends on an individual's need for liquidity versus the desire for predictable, guaranteed returns over a set term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comprehensive study by the China-Brazil Business Council found that Chinese imports supported 5.2 million jobs in Brazil, more than twice the number linked to exports to China. The report highlights the deep economic integration between the two nations, with bilateral commerce growing nearly fivefold in two decades. However, it also raises concerns about Brazil's economic dependency, as 80% of its exports to China consist of just three commodities: soybeans, iron ore, and oil, exposing the country to significant market risks.</p>

          <p>The mortality rate in the United States fell by 3.8% in 2024, reaching its lowest level since 2020, according to a provisional CDC report. For the first time since the pandemic began, COVID-19 is no longer among the ten leading causes of death. Heart disease and cancer remained the top two causes, with both seeing a rise in total deaths despite the overall decline in the mortality rate. The data provides an early indication of shifting mortality trends in the post-pandemic era.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration has appealed a federal judge's order that blocked the firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The judge had previously ruled that maintaining the central bank's independence was in the public interest and that Cook had shown a strong case that her removal would violate federal law. Cook’s attorneys argue the dismissal is part of a broader pressure campaign by the president to influence interest rate policy, while the administration has cited unrelated allegations of mortgage fraud.</p>

          <p>With a funding deadline just three weeks away, Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress are still far from reaching an agreement to prevent a government shutdown. Key disagreements persist over the duration of a short-term funding measure and the inclusion of other policy items, such as an extension for Affordable Care Act subsidies. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stated that the current Republican proposal is insufficient to gain Democratic support, indicating that difficult negotiations lie ahead to keep the government open.</p>

          <p>The leader of the RMT union, which represents thousands of striking London Underground workers, has called for a summit with London Mayor Sadiq Khan to resolve the ongoing labor dispute. The strike, centered on demands for a 32-hour work week and better pay, has caused widespread travel chaos across the capital since Sunday. Transport for London (TfL) has called the union's demand for a shorter week "unaffordable" and has offered a 3.4% pay increase, but talks to avert the strike broke down.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has announced a new initiative to improve financial literacy by proactively informing students and their families about the benefits and risks of federal student loans. This effort comes as national student debt approaches $1.7 trillion and default rates remain at record highs. However, some experts are skeptical about the program's potential effectiveness, citing recent major staff cuts at the department that have already created a massive backlog in processing existing student loan repayment applications.</p>

          <p>An analysis of England's national football team under new manager Thomas Tuchel highlights a shift towards a more aggressive and direct tactical style. After six games, including a dominant 5-0 victory over Serbia, Tuchel's principles of front-footed buildup and encouraging off-the-ball runs are becoming clear. The manager has also prioritized selecting players who fit his system, fostering better on-field chemistry and balance. While the team's defense against top-tier opponents remains untested, the foundation for a more dynamic attacking side appears strong.</p>
