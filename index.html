          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders was cited for speeding early Tuesday morning after being clocked driving 101 mph in a 60 mph zone in Strongsville, Ohio. The police records, obtained by ESPN, indicate that Sanders was driving a Dodge TRX truck northbound on Interstate 71 near Cleveland. Sanders, son of Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, faces the options of paying a fine for the fourth-degree misdemeanor or contesting the ticket in court next month. Sanders is currently competing for a starting role within the Browns' crowded quarterback room during the team's mandatory minicamp. </p>

          <p>Many Californians are struggling with high transportation costs, making car ownership unattainable. Franchescoli Andrade, a South Los Angeles resident, spends 90 minutes each way commuting to work via bike, train, and bus after being unable to afford repairs to his car. A United Way study reveals that 35% of California households cannot afford basic living costs like rent, groceries, and gas. AAA estimates the average American household spends over $12,000 annually on new car ownership, including payments, insurance, maintenance, and fuel, which is a significant burden for many families. </p>

          <p>A New Yorker known as "Streeter" earns over six figures annually by reporting idling vehicles through the city's Citizens Air Complaint Program. Streeter spends hours each day biking around the city, looking for trucks and buses that violate the city's idling law, which prohibits non-city buses and trucks from idling for more than three minutes. Reporters can keep 25% of the fines, which typically range from $350 to $600. Truck drivers, however, feel "abused" by the program, arguing that it's difficult to avoid idling due to the demands of driving in New York City. </p>

The law prohibits medical treatments like puberty blockers or hormone therapy for transgender adolescents under 18.

Last year was the first on record when global average air temperatures were more than 1.5C above those of the late 1800s.

          <p>Two breakthrough Alzheimer's drugs, donanemab and lecanemab, have been deemed too expensive for the NHS due to their limited benefits. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) concluded they were a poor use of taxpayers' money. The drugs slow the disease but do not stop it, with potential benefits debated. The official price in the US is £20,000-£25,000 per patient per year, and the benefit of the drugs is debated. </p>

The issue, tinged with concerns about imminent threats to America and regional stability, has created an apparent break between the president and one of his top advisers. It also mirrors arguments made dozens of years ago by another Republican White House during another Middle East crisis. Aboard Air Force One on his surprise early return from the Canadian G7 summit, Trump was asked whether he agreed with March testimony by his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, that Iran was not building a nuclear bomb.</p>
