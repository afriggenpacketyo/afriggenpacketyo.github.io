          <p>Nvidia will sell over 18,000 of its advanced artificial intelligence chips to Saudi Arabian company Humain, according to CEO Jensen Huang.

The Blackwell chips will be used in a 500 megawatt data center in Saudi Arabia, with the first deployment using GB300 Blackwell chips.

          <p>House Republicans have introduced legislation that would require many Medicaid recipients to prove they are working, volunteering, or in school for at least 80 hours a month to receive coverage. This proposal aims to find $880 billion in savings over the next decade to help pay for President Trump's tax bill. Exceptions to the work requirement include those under 19 and women who are pregnant or under postpartum medical care. Policy experts and Democrats warn that these cuts would hurt vulnerable Americans, with millions likely to lose coverage.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that the de minimis tariff rate on low-value parcels from China will be reduced to 54% from 120%, following an agreement with Beijing. This reverses a previous move to eliminate the low-value parcel exemption, which had allowed Chinese e-commerce firms to ship goods to the U.S. duty-free. The U.S. will also lower its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30% for a 90-day period. This change impacts companies like Shein and Temu, with Temu already transitioning to a local fulfillment model to avoid tariffs.</p>

          <p>Pandora, the world's largest jewelry company, faces potential financial strain due to President Trump's proposed tariffs on goods from Thailand and Vietnam, where the company manufactures its products. CEO Alexander Lacik is considering raising prices globally or solely in the U.S. to offset potential costs, which could reach $135 million annually. The company is also streamlining its supply chain by rerouting shipments to Canada and Latin America. Despite the challenges, Pandora is not panicking and is prepared to adapt to the uncertain trade landscape, having previously mitigated risks by ceasing sourcing from China after earlier tariff increases.</p>

          <p>Peter Sullivan is the victim of the longest miscarriage of justice experienced by a living inmate in the UK, having served over 38 years for the murder of Diane Sindall. The Crown Prosecution Service did not contest the appeal, and the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) ordered DNA tests that led to the quashing of the conviction. In 2008, Sullivan had applied to the CCRC for help, asking if it would look for DNA evidence that could exonerate him, but the application was rejected at the time due to limited testing capabilities.</p>

          <p>Kim Kardashian testified in a Paris court about the 2016 robbery, describing the terror she experienced when thieves held her at gunpoint. She recalled being gagged and bound with tape and zip ties, fearing she would be sexually assaulted and killed. The ordeal shattered her sense of safety and led her to drastically upgrade her private security. One of the defendants, Yunice Abbas, has expressed regret for his involvement in the heist.</p>

          <p>A $1 million annuity can provide monthly payments ranging from $5,800 to over $10,600, depending on factors like age, gender, and annuity structure. The older you are when you start collecting payments, the higher the monthly income due to a shorter expected payout period. Other considerations include the type of annuity, contract structure, and whether it includes inflation protection. It is important to carefully compare options and consider the trade-offs of each feature to ensure it aligns with long-term financial goals (not investment advice).</p>
