          <p>Austin police have identified Robert Eugene Brashers, who died in 1999, as a suspect in the notorious 1991 quadruple murder at a Texas yogurt shop. The breakthrough came from advanced DNA testing, bringing a new development to a case that has remained unsolved for over three decades. The murders of Amy Ayers, Eliza Thomas, and sisters Jennifer and Sarah Harbison shocked the nation and led to wrongful convictions that were later overturned. The investigation remains ongoing as authorities continue to seek justice for the four young victims.</p>

          <p>A group of women in Minneapolis are advocating for stronger laws against AI-generated deepfake pornography after discovering a local man used their social media photos to create explicit content. The incident, involving a "nudify" site called DeepSwap, exposed a legal gray area, as creating such images for personal use without distribution is not explicitly illegal in many places. Their activism has led to proposed legislation in Minnesota that would hold AI companies accountable, highlighting the growing personal and psychological harm caused by the accessible technology.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new 100% tariff on branded or patented pharmaceutical products imported into the U.S., set to begin on October 1, 2025. The policy exempts generic drugs and companies that are actively building manufacturing plants in America, aiming to onshore production. This move has caused concern among European and other international drugmakers about disrupted supply chains and increased costs for consumers. Analysts are debating the full impact, noting that many large pharmaceutical companies already have or are planning U.S. operations, potentially mitigating the effects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Robert Cary McNair Jr., son of the late Houston Texans co-founder, is suing the NFL for over $60 million, alleging "tortious interference." The lawsuit claims the NFL conspired with his brother, Cal McNair, to restructure the family's business and trust to silence him and remove him from influential roles. McNair Jr. alleges this was done after he raised questions about player scandals that could have implicated the league. The suit argues the NFL wrongfully interfered in the family's business relationships to control team operations.</p>

He specifically targeted Reform's proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain for legal migrants, calling it one of the most "shocking" things the party has suggested. Starmer positioned his Labour party as the alternative to the "toxic divide and decline" offered by Reform. The comments come as Labour faces pressure from Reform UK in recent opinion polls.</p>

          <p>The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has voted to lift all sanctions against Russia and Belarus that were imposed following the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The decision means athletes from both countries can now regain full membership rights and could potentially compete under their national flags at future events. Ukraine's Sports Minister strongly condemned the move, stating those who voted for it betrayed Paralympic values. The decision contrasts with the International Olympic Committee's stricter rules, which only allow neutral athlete participation.</p>

          <p>This article fact-checks several recent economic claims made by President Trump, such as assertions that grocery prices, energy costs, and inflation are down. The analysis finds that while gasoline prices and mortgage rates have decreased slightly, grocery prices and electricity costs have continued to rise. The overall inflation rate remains above the Federal Reserve's target, contradicting the claim that it has been "defeated." While the stock market has reached record highs, the broader economic picture for consumers is more mixed than the administration's portrayal. (not investment advice)</p>

Critics quickly condemned the comments as a dangerous and thinly veiled threat, suggesting they could be interpreted as an incitement to violence.

The author argues that this advice is not only medically irresponsible but also misogynistic, reflecting a broader history of dismissing women's pain and shaming mothers. The piece points out that there is no scientific evidence for a causative link, and untreated fevers during pregnancy can pose risks. The author frames the president's "tough it out" remark as another attempt to control women's bodies and choices.</p>

          <p>Major dating apps, including Bumble and those under Match Group, are increasingly incorporating AI to act as "emotionally intelligent matchmakers" in an effort to combat user swipe fatigue. The new systems aim to match users based on deeper values and goals rather than superficial profile details, with some apps using AI chatbots to facilitate introductions. However, this article questions whether this is truly a breakthrough, citing past experiments where compatibility algorithms proved less influential than simply telling users they were compatible. The unpredictability of human chemistry remains a challenge for any matchmaking technology.</p>
