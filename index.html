            <h2>Trump Defends Hegseth Amid Second Signal Chat Controversy</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-21 11:54:04 EDT</div>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>President Trump is publicly supporting Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth after reports surfaced of a second Signal chat leak involving sensitive military information. The controversy arises from Hegseth allegedly sharing details about an imminent attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen with individuals including his wife, who holds no official position. Trump's spokesperson dismissed the reports as internal dissent, while Hegseth himself labeled the media as "hoaxsters" and claimed to be on the same page as the President. The use of Signal for such communications raises concerns about security protocols and potential risks to military operations.</p>

The controversy stems from Hegseth sharing information about a forthcoming attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen via Signal, including individuals outside the Defense Department.

Sosnik argues that Trump has failed to understand the difference between campaigning and governing, leading to policy missteps and declining approval ratings. He points to the chaotic rollout of immigration and tariff policies as examples of this failure, which has created uncertainty for businesses and investors.

            <p>The canonization of Carlo Acutis, set to be the first millennial saint, has been postponed by one week following the death of Pope Francis. The canonization is now scheduled for next Sunday in St. Peter's Square. Acutis, who died of leukemia in 2006 at the age of 15, was known for his use of technology to spread his faith, earning him the moniker "God's Influencer". He was beatified in 2020 after a miracle was attributed to him, and a second miracle was recognized in 2024.</p>

            <p>The death of Pope Francis has triggered a series of rituals and traditions, culminating in a conclave to elect the next pontiff. The Cardinal Camerlengo formally pronounces the Pope's death, seals the papal apartment, and destroys the Pope's Fisherman's ring. A nine-day mourning period follows, with cardinals gathering in Rome to discuss the future of the Church. Between 15 and 20 days after the Pope's death, the Cardinal Electors will isolate themselves in the Sistine Chapel to elect a new Pope.</p>
