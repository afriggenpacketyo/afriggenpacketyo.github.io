        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>FEMA has denied North Carolina's request for 100% federal cost-sharing for Hurricane Helene cleanup, reverting to the traditional 75/25 split, a decision Governor Stein says will cost the state millions and impact funding for small businesses and infrastructure. The denial comes as the Department of Homeland Security considers eliminating FEMA, with Secretary Noem criticizing the agency's effectiveness and advocating for state control over emergency management. An internal FEMA review also indicated the agency is unprepared for the upcoming hurricane season due to staffing and coordination issues. This decision follows a similar denial for Arkansas and occurs amidst predictions of above-average hurricane activity on the Atlantic coast, creating concerns about disaster preparedness and financial burdens on affected states.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported a 69% jump in revenue to $44.1 billion, exceeding Wall Street's expectations, despite U.S. government restrictions on A.I. chip sales to China, however the net income rose 26 percent to $18.78 billion, falling short of predictions. CEO Jensen Huang criticized these restrictions, arguing they hinder U.S. competitiveness and empower Chinese chipmakers. Nvidia is expanding its customer base, targeting governments and securing deals like the one with the United Arab Emirates to build an A.I. data center hub. The company projects continued growth, driven by its new Blackwell chip, and is managing a busy supply chain to meet high demand. (not investment advice)</p>

He questioned whether maintaining high tariff levels would be preferable, asserting that his tactics prompt negotiations.

Veterinarians argue keeping infected birds alive poses a public health risk, referencing a U.S. outbreak that killed millions of birds.

          <p>President Donald Trump has commuted the sentence of Larry Hoover, a former Chicago gang leader, who had been serving multiple life sentences for more than five decades. Hoover, co-founder of the Gangster Disciples, was convicted in 1973 for ordering a murder and in 1997 for federal drug conspiracy and other charges. Hoover has renounced his criminal past and repeatedly requested a shortened sentence, including under the First Step Act. In 2024, Hoover stated he was a different person than he was in 1997.</p>

Federal authorities are investigating the killings as a hate crime and a crime of terrorism, as well as rising militancy tied to the Israeli-Palestinian War. Experts note that while the most lethal domestic terrorism threat has come from white supremacists, there has been a radicalization effect in the U.S., particularly of the political left, since the start of the conflict in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch slashed its profit outlook due to tariffs, expecting a $50 million hit, but the stock closed more than 14% higher after reporting better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results and issuing revenue guidance that topped forecasts. The company now expects full-year earnings per share to be between $9.50 and $10.50, down from a previous range. Sales rose to $1.10 billion, up about 8% from a year earlier. Abercrombie sourced about 30% of its products from China before the pandemic, but that number is now in the low single digits.</p>
