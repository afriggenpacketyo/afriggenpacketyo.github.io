          <p>Goldman Sachs reported second-quarter financial results that exceeded analyst expectations, with profit rising 22% to $3.72 billion. The strong performance was largely driven by its trading divisions, which generated $840 million more in revenue than anticipated, particularly in equities trading. This success reflects a broader trend on Wall Street, where market volatility from policies like tariffs has boosted trading activity. The bank's investment banking fees also saw a significant 26% jump, though its asset and wealth management division experienced a slight revenue decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Westinghouse's interim CEO, Dan Sumner, revealed a plan to build ten large-scale AP1000 nuclear reactors in the United States, with construction slated to begin by 2030. The announcement, made during a roundtable with President Donald Trump, aligns with the administration's goal to quadruple U.S. nuclear power by 2050. Each reactor can power over 750,000 homes, and the project is projected to generate $75 billion in economic value. To improve efficiency and avoid past project delays, Westinghouse is partnering with Google to utilize AI in the construction process.</p>

          <p>Weekly mortgage application volume fell by 10% as rising interest rates and economic uncertainty deterred potential homebuyers. The average contract rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased, pushing purchase applications down by 12% for the week to their slowest pace since May. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, renewed concerns over the economic impact of tariffs have contributed to the rate hike. Refinance applications also saw a 7% drop, indicating that higher borrowing costs are affecting multiple segments of the housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market saw a recovery as investor optimism grew for the potential passage of key stablecoin legislation by the U.S. House this week. Prices for Bitcoin and Ether rose after briefly dipping when the bills, known as the GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act, failed to advance on Tuesday. The rebound was bolstered by a social media post from President Donald Trump suggesting that several Republicans had reversed their opposition following a White House meeting. Passage of the legislation is seen as a crucial step for providing regulatory clarity and stability to the digital asset industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the market navigates potential economic slowing, some analysts suggest it may be strategic to shift away from this year's Big Tech leaders. Bob Elliott of Unlimited Funds advises building portfolios designed to withstand vulnerabilities, favoring assets like long bonds and gold while shorting the U.S. dollar. Meanwhile, Todd Sohn of Strategas Securities sees potential upside in underperforming defensive sectors like healthcare, where the bar for earnings is low. Sohn also highlights cryptocurrency as an attractive play, noting that investors are latching onto its recent moves and realizing it is an asset class that is here to stay.

          <h2>Analysis Questions Economic Rationale of Trump Administration's Deportation Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 07:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the economic consequences of the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, arguing they are based on a misunderstanding of the U.S. labor market. While officials suggest that deported undocumented workers can be replaced by American citizens, industries like agriculture and hospitality warn of severe labor shortages. Economic studies show that native-born workers are often unwilling to fill these demanding, low-paid jobs. The analysis concludes that mass deportations could slash domestic production, raise consumer prices, and ultimately shrink the overall job supply, contradicting the administration's "America First" economic narrative.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian leaders have reacted cautiously to President Donald Trump's announcement of a new weapons deal for Kyiv combined with a 50-day deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire. While welcoming the potential for a "maximum pressure" campaign on Moscow, some Ukrainian officials expressed concern that the 50-day window could be seen by Russia as a green light to intensify its offensive. Russian officials have responded coldly to the ultimatum, calling the demands "unacceptable." Meanwhile, Russian long-range strikes on Ukraine have continued unabated, suggesting Moscow remains unmoved by the new U.S. stance.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has downplayed the significance of the inquiry into sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, calling it "boring" and suggesting only "bad people" are interested in it. His comments come amid growing pressure from his own supporters, who harbor conspiracy theories that the administration is hiding details to protect a powerful elite. Despite his dismissal, Trump stated he would support the release of any "credible" information. The remarks highlight a rare moment of friction with his base and conservative allies, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, who have called for greater transparency.</p>

          <p>For the first time in history, the Major League Baseball All-Star Game was decided by a home run swing-off after the American and National Leagues were tied 6-6. The National League secured the victory after Philadelphia's Kyle Schwarber hit three home runs on three swings, overcoming a two-homer deficit. The new tie-breaking rule, introduced in 2022 to avoid running out of pitchers, provided a dramatic conclusion to the game. Schwarber, who was named the game's MVP, described the high-pressure situation as the baseball equivalent of a penalty shootout.</p>

          <p>A police raid off the coast of northern Haiti resulted in the seizure of over 2,300 pounds of cocaine and the deaths of three suspected drug traffickers. According to officials, police approached a suspect vessel near Tortue Island and were met with gunfire. Officers returned fire, leading to the deaths of two suspects who jumped overboard and a third on shore; a fourth suspect from the Bahamas was arrested. The operation marks a rare, large-scale drug seizure in Haiti, a country the U.S. government has identified as a major transit hub for narcotics.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has voted to advance debate on a package of spending cuts requested by President Trump, which includes eliminating $1.1 billion in future funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). The measure, which targets funds for local public radio and TV stations like those that carry NPR, advanced on a close 51-50 vote broken by Vice President JD Vance. Republicans have pushed for the cuts, citing alleged political bias, a claim the networks deny. The move was opposed by all Democrats and three prominent Republicans, who expressed concern over the administration's lack of clarity.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has lifted its five-year-long ban on airlines from Pakistan, allowing them to apply to resume flights. The ban was originally imposed in 2020 after a scandal revealed that nearly a third of Pakistan's pilots had obtained their licenses fraudulently. The decision follows significant improvements in Pakistan's aviation safety standards, which also led the European Union to lift its own ban earlier this year. Pakistan's national carrier, PIA, which was heavily impacted by the suspension, is now planning to resume its profitable UK routes as soon as possible.</p>

          <p>Two senior Senate Democrats are introducing a bill to regulate fundraising for presidential libraries, citing concerns over President Trump's efforts to direct millions of dollars to his future library while still in office. The proposed legislation would cap individual donations at $10,000 during a president's term, require quarterly disclosure of donors, and bar donations from foreign nationals for a "cooling-off" period. The move is spurred by large, opaque donations to the Trump library fund, which critics argue create the potential for bribery and conflicts of interest in a currently unregulated system.</p>

Egypt now joins other African nations like Nigeria and South Africa in establishing yuan-based financial arrangements with Beijing. This push aims to create an alternative to the US dollar-dominated global financial system, with Africa serving as a crucial testing ground for China's ambitions.</p>

Acknowledging that the party has lost touch with some voters, he is spearheading an "organizing summer" to build relationships well ahead of the midterm elections. The strategy involves listening to voters' concerns and highlighting the negative impacts of the Trump administration's policies. Martin aims to unify the party's disparate factions around the common goal of winning elections, despite recent public clashes over party strategy.</p>
