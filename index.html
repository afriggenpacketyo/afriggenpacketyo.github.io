          <p>Huawei has unveiled new AI computing systems powered by its Ascend chips, intensifying competition with Nvidia as US sanctions limit China's access to advanced semiconductors. The company plans to launch the "Atlas 950 SuperCluster" next year, utilizing numerous homegrown chips to achieve AI capabilities. Huawei claims its new supernodes will be the world's most powerful, supporting thousands of Ascend chips per node, with an even more advanced version slated for 2027. This move aligns with the Chinese government's increasing emphasis on self-reliance in chip technologies, though some caution that Huawei's technical capabilities may be exaggerated. The article underscores China's ambition to become a world AI leader. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Novo Nordisk announced positive late-stage trial results for its once-daily oral obesity pill, showing significant weight reduction comparable to its Wegovy injection. The Oasis 4 trial demonstrated an average weight reduction of 16.6% after 64 weeks in patients with obesity or overweight and at least one comorbidity. The oral treatment, relying on the same semaglutide medication as Wegovy and Ozempic, offers patients an alternative to injections and is currently under FDA review. The company anticipates a decision in the fourth quarter of this year, with plans to manufacture the pill fully in the U.S. if approved. This development intensifies competition in the obesity drug market, with firms seeking to make treatments more accessible. </p>

          <p>The Home Secretary has pledged to combat "vexatious, last-minute claims" after the deportation of an Eritrean man under the UK-France migrants returns deal was temporarily halted. The High Court granted the man interim relief based on his claim of being a modern slavery victim, made hours before his scheduled deportation. Shabana Mahmood criticized such attempts to frustrate removals, asserting they undermine the law and the country's generosity. The Home Office is appealing the decision and reviewing the Modern Slavery Act to prevent misuse, while reaffirming its commitment to securing the border and implementing the deal with France to curb small boat crossings. </p>

          <p>A federal immigration judge has ordered Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student linked to pro-Palestinian protests, to be deported to Algeria or Syria. The ruling, based on alleged misrepresentations on his green card paperwork, has been contested by Khalil's lawyers, who accuse the Trump administration of retaliating against him for his activism. Khalil, who holds a green card, denies making misrepresentations and alleges the claims are pretextual. This development follows previous attempts by the government to deport him on foreign policy grounds. </p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. Forecasters expect Gabrielle to remain over open waters for the next several days but may intensify into a low-grade hurricane as it strengthens over the weekend. The storm's current forecast predicts a track north of the Caribbean, potentially reaching Bermuda next week. Gabrielle developed after an unusual nearly three-week stretch with no storms during the peak of hurricane season. </p>

          <p>A suspect, Donald Henson, is in custody after allegedly ramming his car into the entrance gate of the FBI's Pittsburgh Field office in what authorities are calling a "targeted attack". After crashing into the gate, Henson allegedly grabbed an American flag and threw it over the gate before fleeing on foot. The FBI says Henson had visited the Pittsburgh office recently to make a complaint that lacked a federal nexus. He is believed to have a history of mental health issues and is a former member of the military. </p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have signed a strategic defense pact, deepening their decades-long security partnership. Both countries announced that an attack on one would be considered "an aggression against both." The enhanced agreement follows growing wariness among Gulf Arab states about the reliability of the United States as their security guarantor. The pact comes after a tense conflict between Pakistan and India, with Saudi Arabia reportedly playing a role in de-escalating tensions. </p>

          <p>ABC has suspended Jimmy Kimmel indefinitely over comments he made about the shooting of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk, with Nexstar Media and Sinclair following suit. Kimmel stated that the "Maga gang" was trying to score political points off Kirk's killing.
