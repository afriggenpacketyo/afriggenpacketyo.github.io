          <p>Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank Group experienced a 13% share price surge, reaching a new record and marking its most successful day in five years. This followed a fiscal first-quarter profit announcement of 421.8 billion yen, significantly surpassing analyst estimates and reversing a loss from the same period last year. The growth was primarily fueled by a $4.8 billion gain in its Vision Funds, attributed to successful investments in both private and public companies. Investor optimism is also supported by the anticipated initial public offerings of several portfolio companies, such as Lenskart and Klarna. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Israeli security cabinet has officially approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal to occupy Gaza City, signaling a significant expansion of military operations. The plan is based on five principles, including the disarmament of Hamas, the return of all hostages, and establishing Israeli security control over the Gaza Strip. The decision has drawn condemnation from Hamas, which accused Netanyahu of sabotaging ceasefire negotiations for personal and ideological reasons. The move comes amid growing international concern over the humanitarian crisis in the region and distress from hostage families fearing for their relatives' safety.</p>

          <p>China's foreign ministry has accused the Philippines of "playing with fire" following comments from President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. regarding a potential conflict over Taiwan. Marcos stated that the Philippines' geographical proximity to Taiwan and its large expatriate community there would necessitate its involvement in any war between China and the United States. Beijing rebuked this position, asserting that such factors are not a valid reason to interfere in another country's internal affairs. The exchange intensifies existing tensions between the two nations, which are already strained by territorial disputes in the South China Sea.</p>

          <p>Two Pennsylvania State Police troopers are in stable condition after being shot in what authorities described as an ambush in Susquehanna County. The incident began when a 61-year-old man, Carmine Faino, fatally shot his 57-year-old neighbor, Lori Wasko. When troopers Joseph Perechinsky and William Jenkins arrived, Faino opened fire with a rifle from a superior tactical position, wounding both officers. Faino, who fired dozens of rounds and shot down a police drone, was later shot and killed by a special response team. An EMT was also injured after crashing his vehicle while under fire.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has increased the reward for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to $50 million. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the new figure, accusing Maduro of being a major narco-trafficker who collaborates with cartels to import fentanyl-laced cocaine into the U.S. Maduro was first indicted on narco-terrorism charges in 2020, with an initial bounty of $15 million. Venezuela's foreign minister dismissed the increased reward as "pathetic" political propaganda and a desperate distraction. The move escalates long-standing tensions between Washington and the leftist leader's government in Caracas.</p>

This action is part of the "Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force" established by an executive order earlier in the year. The White House stated that the move is intended to make the nation's capital safer for residents, lawmakers, and visitors by ensuring there is "no safe harbor for violent criminals."</p>

          <p>Shares of footwear company Crocs plummeted by nearly 30%, marking the stock's worst single-day drop in almost 15 years. The dramatic fall was triggered by a company warning that it anticipates a 10% drop in revenue for the upcoming quarter. Executives stated that American consumers are becoming increasingly cautious with their discretionary spending, with some no longer even visiting Crocs stores. The company also cautioned about a challenging second half of the year due to the high cost of living and the potential impact of tariffs, which could cost the firm an estimated $40 million.

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued a nationwide preliminary injunction, becoming the fourth court to block President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. The order sought to deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. if their parents are in the country illegally or on temporary visas. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman certified a class action on behalf of all affected children, ruling they were extremely likely to win their case based on the 14th Amendment. This decision follows a recent Supreme Court ruling that limited nationwide injunctions but left the door open for class-action approaches.</p>

The resignation came just hours before a scheduled vote to expel him from his position. Ward, who is in custody awaiting sentencing, had launched an unsuccessful legal challenge to prevent his removal, arguing it was an "affront to democracy." His resignation triggers a by-election for the seat he held and means he will no longer receive a parliamentary salary. The state's Premier, Chris Minns, stated that the resignation should have happened sooner, questioning how one could represent a community from prison.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Science Advances quantifies how human-caused climate change has significantly lengthened California's fire season since the 1990s. Researchers found that in regions like the Cascade Range, the season now begins approximately 46 days earlier than it used to. The primary drivers are not human-ignited fires, which have decreased, but climate-related factors such as earlier snowmelt and increased drying of vegetation due to rising temperatures. This confirms anecdotal observations that wildfire has become a near-constant, year-round threat in many parts of the state, particularly in Northern California, leading to more acres burned and higher economic damages.</p>

One incident allegedly left him in a coma for weeks.

          <p>President Trump's latest tariffs on semiconductors and chips could inadvertently strengthen China's influence in Southeast Asia, according to some analysts. The new duties, which exempt only companies with a U.S. manufacturing presence, add to the economic pressures the region already faces from Trump's "America first" policies. As Southeast Asian nations struggle to absorb these costs, the unpredictability of U.S. trade policy may create an opening for China to increase its economic and political sway. The full impact remains unclear, as details about the scope of the tariffs and potential exemptions are still emerging.</p>

However, under Nevada law, these temporary holds are not automatically reported to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).

          <p>Tonia Haddix, an exotic animal broker featured in the HBO docuseries "Chimp Crazy," has been sentenced to 46 months in federal prison. Haddix pleaded guilty to perjury and obstruction of justice after lying to a federal judge about the death of a celebrity chimpanzee named Tonka, whom she was hiding in her basement. The chimp was discovered locked in a small cage following an investigation prompted by PETA. The animal rights group praised the sentence, stating that Haddix is now getting a taste of the suffering she inflicted on animals by imprisoning them in cages.</p>

          <p>Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko has captured her first WTA Tour title, winning the National Bank Open in her home country. The 18-year-old, who started the year ranked 333rd, defeated former world number one Naomi Osaka in a three-set final, 2-6, 6-4, 6-1. Mboko's dream run in Montreal included victories over Grand Slam champions Sofia Kenin, Coco Gauff, and Elena Rybakina. The victory marks a major milestone for the rising star and denied Osaka her first tournament win in four years, though the final was Osaka's best performance since returning from maternity leave.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has detained several dozen migrants who crossed the English Channel as part of a new deportation agreement with France. Under the "one in, one out" pilot scheme, those detained can be returned to France within weeks. In exchange, the UK will accept an equal number of vetted asylum seekers directly from France through a safe and legal route. The government confirmed that transfers to immigration removal centers are underway but did not provide a specific number of detainees. The move is part of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's pledge to secure the nation's borders.</p>

          <p>Instagram's launch of a new map feature has triggered a backlash from users concerned about privacy and the sharing of their location data. The tool, similar to Snapchat's Snap Map, allows users to share their "last active location" with friends. Although Meta, Instagram's parent company, insists the feature is off by default and requires a double opt-in, many users expressed alarm, with some claiming their location was shared without their consent. Instagram head Adam Mosseri responded to the complaints, stating the company was investigating but believed the issue was largely due to user confusion.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced that its experimental oral weight-loss drug, orforglipron, successfully helped adults with obesity lose significant weight in a Phase 3 clinical trial. Participants lost an average of 27.3 pounds over 72 weeks, with a safety profile consistent with existing injectable GLP-1 therapies like Zepbound. Common side effects included nausea and constipation. The company plans to submit the daily pill for FDA approval later this year, potentially making it available by 2026. An oral medication is seen as a potential "game changer" for accessibility and convenience compared to current injectable treatments.</p>

          <p>The UK government is drafting legislation to impose new geographical restrictions on serious violent and sexual offenders after their release from prison. Unlike current exclusion zones that bar offenders from specific places, the new system would confine them to a designated area, policed by enhanced electronic tagging and monitoring. The Ministry of Justice says this approach, developed in consultation with victims, would provide greater peace of mind and allow victims to live without fear of accidental encounters. Critics, however, worry the plan will place additional strain on the already overburdened probation service.</p>

          <p>Democrats have strongly criticized a claim by U.S. Senator John Cornyn that the FBI would assist in locating Texas Democratic lawmakers who fled the state. The lawmakers left to break quorum and block a Republican-led effort to pass a gerrymandered congressional map. Democrats condemned the potential use of federal law enforcement to track political opposition as an authoritarian tactic. While the FBI declined to comment, an administration official stated there were no plans to use federal agents for this purpose.

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker is calling for legislative and regulatory action following State Farm's announcement of an average 27% rate increase for homeowners insurance in the state. The governor expressed deep concern, calling the hike "unfair and arbitrary." He suggested that the insurer is justifying the increase with catastrophe loss numbers that are inconsistent with the state's own analysis, implying that State Farm is shifting costs from other states onto Illinois homeowners. State Farm attributed the rate change to falling profits and an increase in severe weather events, such as hail damage.</p>

Revenue increased 12.8% to $1.51 billion, beating estimates, but earnings per share missed expectations. The company saw a 5.8% increase in same-store sales, driven primarily by higher customer traffic, a positive sign for the brand's popularity. However, persistent beef inflation remains a major headwind, and the company announced plans for a modest menu price increase to help offset some of the rising commodity costs.
