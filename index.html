          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military conducted strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, Fordo, Natanz, and Esfahan, asserting it as a "spectacular military success" aimed at eliminating Iran's nuclear enrichment capabilities. The strikes involved B-2 bombers and Tomahawk cruise missiles, targeting key nuclear assemblies in Iran. Lawmakers across the political spectrum have responded with mixed reactions, with some Republicans supporting the action while Democrats criticize the lack of congressional consultation. Iran has acknowledged the attacks and has pledged to retaliate, raising concerns about potential physical and cyber reprisals. Optimism surrounding the situation is low as the international community braces for potential escalation and further conflict in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of U.S. strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, lawmakers from both parties have expressed mixed reactions. Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham and House Speaker Mike Johnson voiced support, while Democrats such as House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the president for not consulting Congress before taking military action. Some lawmakers, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have even suggested the strikes are grounds for impeachment, citing a violation of the Constitution and Congressional War Powers. The debate centers on the extent of presidential authority to engage in foreign conflicts without congressional approval.</p>

          <p>President Trump, after months of insisting on a nuclear deal with Iran, bombed Iranian nuclear sites, despite suggesting a two-week negotiation window, which was a feint to keep Iran off guard.

The U.S. government had prepared for various scenarios, including evacuating citizens from Israel and dispersing assets in the Middle East, now bracing for Iranian retaliation targeting U.S. interests in the region. Trump coordinated the operation with Israel, believing U.S. intervention would ensure success after Israel's initial offensive, though the intelligence community has stated Iran is not building a nuclear weapon.</p>

The article anticipates Iranian retaliation, highlighting potential regional attacks, disruption of oil routes, strikes on U.S. allies, and asymmetric attacks abroad. It cautions that the strike could backfire politically inside Iran, unifying the regime and fueling nationalism, urging the U.S. to prepare for a shadow war with containment, deterrence, and resilience.</p>

          <p>A Japanese startup, Craif Inc., has developed a urine-based cancer risk screening kit that shows promise in detecting cancer at its earliest stages using non-invasive methods. The "miSignal" test kit can simultaneously assess the risk of up to seven types of cancer by detecting microRNA, a biomarker linked to early cancer biology. Trials in Hokkaido, Japan, detected changes in pre-malignant cells, leading to early treatment. The test is considered vital in areas with limited medical resources, potentially improving cancer detection rates and outcomes.</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis suggests that President Trump's decision to strike Iranian nuclear sites is a significant gamble that could lead to political blowback both domestically and internationally. Despite Trump's promise to be a "peacemaker," the strikes have inserted the U.S. into the conflict between Iran and Israel. The analysis questions whether the two-week negotiation deadline was a feint and notes that Iran may be unwilling to negotiate under attack. It warns of potential Iranian retaliation and the risk of escalating conflict, emphasizing the need for clear strategy and vigilance.</p>

          <p>Despite stating on Thursday that he would decide within two weeks whether to order a U.S. military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities to allow diplomacy a chance, President Trump ordered strikes just two days later. He dismissed talks between European diplomats and Iran, stating that Iran wanted to speak directly to the U.S. Trump's actions contradicted his intelligence community's assessment that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon, showcasing distrust for his own intelligence officials. The strikes underscore the volatility and unpredictability of U.S. foreign policy decisions under the Trump administration.</p>

Despite the overturned conviction, the case was dismissed without prejudice, meaning charges could be brought again if new evidence surfaces. Dorotik, now working to rebuild her life, advocates for incarcerated women and questions the systemic issues that led to her wrongful conviction.</p>
