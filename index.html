          <p>Following the Noto Peninsula earthquake in 2024, Japan is being urged to improve disaster preparedness regarding toilet access, as many public restrooms became unsanitary due to water and electricity outages. Experts emphasize the importance of maintaining sanitary toilets to prevent the spread of infectious diseases and urge people to stockpile portable toilets at home and in workplaces. Educational programs are being implemented to teach children how to use portable toilets, aiming to prevent "toilet panic" during future disasters. The government is also required to make efforts to prevent defecation in evacuation center toilets to avoid unhygienic conditions.</p>

          <p>European startup founders are pushing back against pressure to adopt China's "996" work culture, which involves working from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. While some venture capitalists argue that embracing overwork is necessary to compete globally, many European founders and VCs disagree. They emphasize the importance of sustainable innovation cultures, work-life balance, and employee well-being, noting that Europe's most successful companies achieved dominance through innovation rather than overwork. They also contend that Europe needs more funding and resources to compete effectively with the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials are working to comply with President Xi Jinping’s austerity orders, as inspectors conduct checks on spending and protocol. The campaign, running since 2012, aims to improve the ruling party’s image, stamp out corruption, and cut wasteful spending. It covers areas ranging from official events to buildings and travel. The campaign is also seen as a way to identify promising cadres who follow the rules and show political loyalty.</p>
