          <p>South Korean memory chipmaker SK Hynix has announced its readiness to mass-produce HBM4 chips, a critical next-generation high-bandwidth memory technology essential for advanced artificial intelligence computing, including Nvidia's upcoming Rubin architecture. This significant development places SK Hynix firmly ahead of its rivals, such as Samsung Electronics and Micron Technologies, in the competitive AI memory market. The news has propelled the company's stock, contributing to an $80 billion increase in its market capitalization this year, with shares hitting their highest since 2000. SK Hynix projects a doubling of its HBM sales for 2025, anticipating robust demand from the AI sector to continue its strong growth trajectory into 2026, underscoring its pivotal role in the global tech landscape.

          <p>Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander conveyed the "despondent" mood among Labour MPs following a turbulent week that saw Lord Mandelson dismissed as UK ambassador to the US and Angela Rayner's resignation. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is under intense pressure regarding his judgment, as new documents revealed the extent of Mandelson's friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, despite prior public knowledge of their association. This political fallout, occurring just before US President Donald Trump's state visit, has triggered calls for an urgent review of government vetting processes. The controversy has not only fueled anger among some Labour MPs but also significantly eroded public trust in the government's leadership and decision-making capabilities.</p>

          <p>Chinese robotics firm Yarbo is gaining significant attention for its innovative hybrid snow-blowing and lawn-mowing robots, specifically designed to operate effectively in extreme cold and heavy blizzards. The Shenzhen-based manufacturer has distinguished itself by successfully delivering a complex consumer-grade product at scale, leveraging mature supply chains and rapid product iteration cycles. In just two years, Yarbo has achieved a record-breaking $3.45 million on Kickstarter for consumer robots and has already shipped its first 1,000 units. With features like custom low-temperature and self-heating batteries, alongside wireless charging, the company secured over 6,000 presale orders last year, demonstrating its strong market presence and technological competitiveness.</p>

          <p>European equities showed mixed performance, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 remaining flat after data revealed the UK economy experienced zero growth in July, following a 0.4% expansion in June. This economic slowdown complicates the Bank of England's considerations ahead of its monetary policy update next week, while the European Central Bank recently kept its interest rates unchanged. In corporate developments, Vestas Wind shares dropped significantly after the US Interior Secretary stated that offshore wind would not be a future electricity source under President Donald Trump's leadership, citing high costs and unreliability. Additionally, Spanish lender Sabadell's board recommended rejecting a hostile takeover bid from BBVA, arguing it undervalues the bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>More than 300 South Korean workers, detained in a large-scale US immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia, have returned home, sparking outrage and diplomatic tensions. The incident, which saw workers taken in handcuffs, has shaken US-South Korea ties, with President Lee Jae Myung and Hyundai's CEO warning of negative impacts on future US investments. President Trump reportedly delayed their departure to assess their willingness to remain, while South Korea has called on the US Congress to support a new visa for Korean firms. The raid is expected to delay the factory's opening by at least two months, highlighting the complex interplay of immigration, trade, and international relations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy registered zero growth in July, primarily due to the largest contraction in manufacturing output seen in a year, according to the Office for National Statistics. This economic stagnation, following a 0.4% expansion in June, intensifies pressure on the government to deliver on its priority of boosting growth before the Autumn Budget on November 26. While the service sector showed some resilience, a significant fall in production output, particularly manufacturing, hampered overall expansion. Economists predict a slowdown in the second half of 2025, with uncertainties surrounding the budget potentially delaying business investment and further dragging on growth.</p>

          <p>The UK economy's growth flatlined in July, aligning with economists' expectations and adding to Chancellor Rachel Reeves' challenges before the Autumn Budget. Weakness was concentrated in production output, while services and construction saw slight increases. This performance follows a stronger second quarter, but experts now anticipate a slowdown in the latter half of 2025 due to various factors including trade corrections and public spending. The Bank of England faces a difficult balance between fiscal uncertainty and persistent inflation, with a rate cut still expected in November despite a hawkish August decision.

          <p>China has emerged as the leading foreign investor in Thailand's Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), committing $8.4 billion from 2019 to 2024. This substantial investment, which accounts for 16% of all foreign capital in the three-province cluster, includes pledges to develop a light-rail line, an "aerotropolis," and potential property projects. Chinese investors, notably China Railway Construction Corporation, are also part of a consortium building a high-speed railway through the corridor. This underscores China's strategic economic expansion into Southeast Asia, aiming to enhance infrastructure and foster industrial growth in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, proposing to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales for those with less than six months to live, is set for a two-day debate in the House of Lords. While supporters urge respect for the Commons' backing, opponents highlight "massive problems" and call for further scrutiny, with a Lords committee warning about the bill's underdeveloped nature and unspecified government powers. Approval would require two doctors and a panel, and significant amendments are expected later in the autumn. The bill's chances of passing are boosted by an extended parliamentary session.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Washington's attempts to reindustrialize and contain China are undermined by contradictions, using the recent US raid on a Hyundai-LG plant in Georgia as a key example. The raid, which detained hundreds of South Korean technicians for lacking proper work visas, exposed a conflict between the Trump administration's anti-immigrant crackdown and its industrial policy goals. The author contends that post-industrial America struggles to implement effective industrial policy due to a lack of skilled domestic labor, making efforts to reshore manufacturing futile and potentially disruptive to global trade.

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has issued a warning to Mexico, urging it to "think twice" before implementing plans to hike tariffs on Asia-made cars to 50%.

China, emphasizing its status as an important trade partner, threatened "necessary measures" to safeguard its interests and criticized the move as sacrificing third-party interests amid US tariff abuses.

The legislation, which allows for buildings up to nine stories near certain transit stops, is now one step away from becoming law. Supporters argue drastic measures are necessary to address the state's affordability crisis, while critics, including the Los Angeles City Council, condemn it as an overreach that strips local authorities of control and could alter single-family communities.
