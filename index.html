        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shopify's stock experienced a decline in early trading after the company announced its first-quarter results, which were a mix of meeting expectations and falling slightly short. The company's revenue was reported at $2.36 billion, exceeding the anticipated $2.33 billion, while projecting gross profit growth in the high-teens for the second quarter. Executives acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding potential impacts from tariffs on Chinese imports, particularly after the expiration of a duty-free trade loophole affecting online businesses. Despite these concerns, Shopify maintains a positive outlook, noting that its customer base is less price-sensitive due to higher incomes.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives passed a bill, introduced by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, to officially rename the Gulf of Mexico as the "Gulf of America," which codifies an executive order signed by President Trump. The measure passed with a vote of 211 to 206, with nearly all Republicans supporting it, and now moves to the Senate for consideration. While Greene and other Republicans argue the name change is a matter of national pride, Democrats criticize the effort as a wasteful use of taxpayer money and a distraction from more pressing issues. Even if codified into U.S. law, other countries are under no obligation to adopt the new name.</p>

          <p>GiveSendGo, a crowdfunding platform, is investigating a fundraising campaign for a Temple University student, Mo Khan, who is in a dispute with Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy over an antisemitic sign incident. Portnoy accused Khan of posting a video showing a waitress holding a sign with an offensive message, prompting Khan to raise money for legal defense. The campaign has drawn scrutiny after Portnoy disputed Khan's account, leading GiveSendGo to review the campaign's truthfulness and potentially remove it if misrepresentations are found.

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has classified the recent flu season as the first high-severity season in seven years, reporting at least 216 child deaths in the United States. This marks the highest pediatric death toll in 15 years, with hospitalization rates also reaching levels not seen since the 2010-2011 season. Health officials are attributing the high number of fatalities to declining vaccination rates and the spread of misinformation regarding vaccines.

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for maintaining steady interest rates at the Fed's recent meeting, labeling him a "fool" for not cutting rates sooner. This criticism comes as the Bank of England lowered its interest rate amidst concerns about the economic impact of Trump's tariff policies. Trump inaccurately claimed there is "virtually NO INFLATION," despite inflation rates being above the Fed's target. The Fed's independence is meant to insulate it from political pressure, allowing decisions based on economic data, but Trump's continued pressure could undermine confidence in U.S. policymaking.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Office for Students (OfS) indicates that over 40% of universities in England are projected to be in financial deficit by the summer. This is attributed mainly to a decline in international student enrollment, particularly following visa changes in January 2024. The OfS reports that universities are closing courses and selling buildings to cut costs, and suggests that “significant reform and efficiencies” are needed to reverse the trend. Universities are becoming increasingly reliant on higher fees from international students, as tuition fees from UK students have not kept up with inflation.</p>

However, the decision depends on individual circumstances, including the size of the debt, interest rates, and financial goals. If balances are low or on a 0% promotional rate, investing or saving the inheritance might be a better option. It's important to address the root cause of the debt to avoid accumulating balances again in the future.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing increasing opposition from Labour MPs regarding proposed welfare cuts, with some warning that they are "impossible to support" without a change in direction. A letter signed by 42 MPs expresses concerns that the cuts, aimed at saving £5 billion a year by 2030, will negatively impact disabled people and their families. The MPs are urging ministers to postpone any decisions until the potential impact on employment and health has been assessed, particularly following recent local election losses.</p>

It is a large molecule found in all of our cells, mRNA is used to make every protein that our DNA directs our bodies to build. It does so by carrying information from DNA in the nucleus out to a cell’s protein-making machinery.</p>
