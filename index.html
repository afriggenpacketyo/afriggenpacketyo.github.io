          <p>The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF experienced its sharpest decline since March 2020, falling 5.56% on Friday.  This significant drop is attributed to President Trump's new tariffs, sparking concerns about a global trade war and potential recession.  Emerging markets, heavily reliant on exports, are particularly vulnerable to these trade disruptions, with key ETF holdings concentrated in Taiwan, China, India, and South Korea, all facing substantial tariff increases. The situation underscores the interconnectedness of global economies and the potential for widespread economic fallout from protectionist trade policies.</p>
