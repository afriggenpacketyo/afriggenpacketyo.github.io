          <h2>Dueling Narratives Emerge in Trial of Colorado Dentist Accused of Poisoning Wife</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 00:00:15 EDT</div>

          <p>The murder trial of Colorado dentist Dr. James Toliver Craig has begun, with prosecutors portraying him as a calculated killer who poisoned his wife, Angela Craig, to start a new life with his mistress. Conversely, the defense is painting Angela as emotionally manipulative and mentally unstable, suggesting her death could have been a suicide. The case involves allegations of Craig researching undetectable poisons online and having multiple affairs, while the defense highlights a lack of direct physical evidence and claims investigators had "tunnel vision," creating reasonable doubt. The conflicting strategies aim to sway the jury by framing the context of the couple's troubled 23-year marriage.</p>

          <p>Adelita Grijalva has won the Democratic primary for Arizona's 7th Congressional District, a seat previously held for over two decades by her late father, Rep. Raúl Grijalva. She will face Republican nominee Daniel Butierez in a special general election in September for the deep-blue district. Grijalva, a progressive, ran on a platform of protecting democracy, immigrant rights, and social safety nets, securing high-profile endorsements from figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders. The outcome of this election will not shift control of the House but will fill one of three vacancies in heavily Democratic districts.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced over $90 billion in new private-sector investments for Pennsylvania during a summit at Carnegie Mellon University, aimed at developing a new artificial intelligence economy. The plan involves 20 leading companies and includes building energy-intensive data centers for AI and an energy innovation training center in Pittsburgh. The initiative, championed by Sen. Dave McCormick, seeks to leverage the state's natural gas and nuclear resources to power technological growth and create tens of thousands of jobs. The announcement was met with protests from activists concerned about the focus on fossil fuels and corporate interests.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order to create national standards for the Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) program, which allows college athletes to earn money. This move follows the rapid and often chaotic transformation of college athletics since the NCAA relaxed its compensation rules in 2021. The executive action would address the patchwork of state laws currently governing NIL and comes as a House subcommittee advanced a related bill, the "SCORE Act." The White House aims to bring federal oversight to an issue that has significantly commercialized college sports and generated debate over athlete protection and competitive balance.</p>

          <h2>China's Local Governments Encouraged to Use Legislative Powers to Drive Economic Growth</h2>

          <p>An article in the Communist Party's official newspaper, People's Daily, has urged China's local governments to use their legislative powers as a "propeller" for economic and social development. The piece argues that creating stable, open legal systems allows market entities to operate effectively and fosters long-term growth. This encouragement follows a 2015 change that expanded law-drafting authority to hundreds of Chinese cities. The commentary suggests a shift from relying on top-down directives to using localized legal frameworks to address economic challenges and adapt to local needs.</p>

          <p>The chancellors of UC Berkeley and CUNY, along with the interim president of Georgetown, testified before a House committee regarding antisemitism on their campuses. While condemning antisemitism, the leaders defended their institutions' commitment to protecting free speech, arguing that pro-Palestinian expression is not inherently antisemitic. They stated that disciplinary action has been taken when university rules were violated. Republicans on the committee accused the schools of failing to act decisively, while Democrats criticized the hearings as "political theater" and a "kangaroo court" that distracts from genuine efforts to protect students.</p>

          <p>It has been revealed that the UK government secretly relocated 4,500 Afghans to Britain under a program established after a massive data breach. In 2022, a Ministry of Defence official inadvertently leaked a spreadsheet with the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for relocation after the Taliban takeover. The existence of the leak and the subsequent £400 million resettlement scheme were concealed by a super-injunction, which a High Court judge has now lifted. The Defence Secretary has issued a "sincere apology" for the "serious departmental error," which potentially endangered thousands of individuals.</p>

One design, dubbed "Charger Power," features an all-gold jersey and pants combination, a first for the team in a game. The second is a "Super Chargers" navy blue set, a modern throwback to the uniforms worn during the team's 1990s era, including their only Super Bowl appearance.

          <p>Amid pressure from his political base, President Trump stated that Attorney General Pam Bondi should release "whatever she thinks is credible" regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. The comment follows a backlash against Bondi after she said there was no evidence of an Epstein "client list." While calling for the release of credible information, Trump also seemed to downplay the ongoing fascination with the case, calling it "sordid but boring" and urging people to move on. His remarks reflect a complex balancing act, addressing supporter demands for transparency while also trying to put the controversy to rest.</p>

An ICE official described the apps as dangerous, potentially impeding law enforcement and putting officers at risk of being ambushed.

          <p>Brazil's top prosecutor has formally recommended that the Supreme Federal Court find former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty of attempting a coup following his 2022 election loss to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. In a detailed filing, the prosecutor-general accused Bolsonaro and seven others of forming an "armed criminal association" to "violently overthrow the democratic order." The charges stem from Bolsonaro's unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud and the subsequent storming of government buildings by his supporters on January 8, 2023.

          <p>A growing number of central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are buying gold directly from domestic mines instead of on the international market. According to the World Gold Council, this strategy allows them to purchase the metal in local currency, preserving foreign exchange reserves like the U.S. dollar. It is also often cheaper and supports the local mining industry. This trend is driven by soaring gold prices and a desire among nations to bolster their reserves as a hedge against geopolitical and financial risks. (not investment advice)</p>

His conviction was vacated in 2021 after efforts from the California Innocence Project and the D.A.'s Conviction Integrity Unit, and he was declared factually innocent in 2022.

He noted that while President Trump cannot unilaterally shut down the department, significant staff cuts, especially in the Office for Civil Rights and the Financial Aid Office, will curtail its functions. Petrilli argued that most students and teachers won't feel a direct impact, as education is primarily managed at the state and local levels.

The project is necessary to repair the 175-year-old iron-and-glass structure, which has been damaged by the hot, humid conditions required for its indoor tropical rainforest. The renovation will involve replacing 16,000 panes of glass, repairing the ironwork, and moving 1,300 plants, including a 250-year-old cycad. A key goal of the project is to make the building net-zero by replacing its gas boilers with modern heat pumps.</p>
