          <p>President Trump's imposition of universal 10% tariffs on all countries has triggered a significant downturn in global financial markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted, and the S&P 500 experienced its largest one-day slump since March 2020, wiping out trillions in market value. China has retaliated with tariffs on American goods, and economists are warning of potential recessionary impacts if the tariffs are not eased. The tariffs are expected to increase inflation and slow economic growth, potentially costing U.S. households nearly $2,000 this year. (not investment advice)</p>

China has responded with retaliatory tariffs, escalating fears of a global trade war and potential recession.

          <p>President Trump's persistent interest in acquiring Greenland is raising serious legal and military concerns, as his administration explores the costs and logistics of controlling the Danish territory. Critics argue that such a move would likely violate American and international law, undermining the peace and stability of an allied nation. The potential use of military force against Denmark, a NATO ally, is not off the table and could precipitate a civil-military crisis. Experts suggest that senior military commanders would have a moral obligation to refuse any illegal orders to seize Greenland.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new hacking technique called "doubleclickjacking" is emerging, exploiting the common action of double-clicking on websites to gain unauthorized access to user accounts and devices. This method allows attackers to hide malicious commands beneath seemingly harmless buttons, enabling them to access webcams, microphones, and browser settings. Doubleclickjacking bypasses traditional security measures designed for single clicks, making it difficult for websites to defend against. Users are advised to be cautious when double-clicking on unfamiliar websites, keep their browsers updated, and use strong antivirus software to protect themselves.</p>

          <p>A new book, "In Covid's Wake: How Our Politics Failed Us," argues that liberals may have been wrong about certain pandemic policies, including lockdowns and school closures. The authors contend that public health authorities and the media often pushed measures without adequately weighing their costs and benefits, and that dissent was stifled. The book suggests that COVID-19 policies became overly politicized, with Democratic and Republican states diverging after initial modest differences. The authors point to the economic and social costs of shutdowns, including learning loss, inflation, and increased crime rates.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Investment experts suggest that "dead" investors, those who adopt a buy-and-hold strategy, often achieve better returns than active traders. This is attributed to the fact that active trading incurs higher costs and taxes and is often driven by emotional decision-making. Data shows that the average stock investor's return lagged the S&P 500 stock index in 2023, highlighting the detrimental impact of bad habits. Emotional impulses to sell during downturns or buy into peaking categories are rooted in human evolution, but can lead to major losses. (not investment advice)</p>

The Vatican report blamed Pope John Paul II for appointing McCarrick despite confirmed reports of him sleeping with seminarians.

Further research is needed to confirm the findings and explore the potential for antiviral treatments to slow cognitive decline.</p>
