        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has committed Â£14.2 billion to the Sizewell C nuclear power plant project, aiming to lower energy bills and enhance energy independence. The project, expected to take at least 10 years to complete, will generate enough power for six million homes and create 10,000 jobs during construction and 900 permanent positions. The investment is intended to attract further private funding and boost economic growth, with the plant expected to operate for 60 years. Critics, however, raise concerns about the project's cost and environmental impact, noting the history of delays and budget overruns with similar projects. Optimism surrounding this project is relatively high given the long-term energy security it promises. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>FanDuel is introducing a 50-cent surcharge on all wagers in Illinois to offset the impact of new state taxes, which disproportionately affect leading sportsbooks. The new tax applies to each wager, starting at 25 cents per bet for the first 20 million wagers and increasing to 50 cents thereafter. DraftKings anticipates taking similar action. The tax comes on top of a progressive tax passed last year, raising the tax rate for the most successful sportsbooks to 40%. Flutter Entertainment CEO Peter Jackson expressed disappointment, arguing the fee will motivate gamblers to use unregulated operators and disproportionately impact recreational customers.

Experts warn that this move undermines science, disrupts a trusted regulatory process, and could increase public distrust in vaccinations. Concerns have been raised that Kennedy may appoint members sympathetic to his anti-vaccine views, potentially leading to politicized recommendations. This action could erode already declining U.S. immunization rates and make the nation less equipped to handle outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Debt forgiveness and debt consolidation offer distinct approaches to managing debt, with varying consequences for savings and credit scores. Debt consolidation combines multiple debts into a single loan or payment plan, potentially lowering interest rates but not reducing the principal balance. Debt forgiveness involves negotiating with creditors to accept less than the full amount owed, typically resulting in a 30% to 50% reduction, but it requires ceasing payments, which damages credit. While debt forgiveness can save more money upfront, the resulting credit damage can lead to higher interest rates on future loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer denied that his government's reversal on winter fuel payments was due to political pressure, attributing it instead to an improved economy. The government will extend the payment, worth up to Â£300 a year, to more pensioners this coming winter, benefiting nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of Â£35,000 or less. Starmer defended last year's decision to withdraw the payments from most pensioners, citing the need to fix the UK's "broken" finances. Critics argue the economy has not improved and question how the government will pay for the change, which is expected to cost around Â£1.25 billion. </p>
