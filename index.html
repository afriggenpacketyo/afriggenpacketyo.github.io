          <p>The UK is experiencing unusually warm weather, with temperatures soaring to record highs for early May. Southeastern England saw temperatures reach 27C, marking the warmest April spell in seven years. Scotland recorded its highest April temperature since 2019, while Wales and Northern Ireland had their second-hottest April days on record. However, Scotland and Northern Ireland will experience cooler temperatures with cloud and showers, while parts of Wales, the Midlands, and eastern England face a risk of heavy and thundery showers as humidity increases.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump is attributing the recent contraction of the U.S. economy to his predecessor, Joe Biden, while defending his tariff policies. Trump claims that the tariffs will stimulate domestic production and lead to an economic boom once the 'Biden Overhang' is removed. However, the Commerce Department reports that the GDP decline reflects a surge in imports ahead of Trump's tariffs and a decrease in government spending. Experts also suggest that uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariff policies is contributing to weak hiring numbers and declining consumer confidence.</p>

          <p>Yostin Mosquera is on trial for the murder of a couple in their west London flat. The prosecution alleges that Mosquera killed Paul Longworth with a hammer and then murdered Albert Alfonso during a sexual encounter, filming the event. He is accused of decapitating and dismembering the victims, freezing some of their remains, and taking the rest in suitcases to the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol. Mosquera admits to the manslaughter of Mr. Alfonso due to loss of self-control, but denies murdering both men. The trial continues, revealing disturbing details about the couple's unconventional relationship and Mosquera's actions after the killings.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley stated that President Donald Trump's recent tariff reprieve on automotive parts is a positive step but insufficient to fully support the U.S. auto industry. While the new actions reimburse automakers for some U.S. parts and reduce tariff stacking, Farley emphasizes the need for a comprehensive policy approach. He advocates for policies that encourage exports and reward companies like Ford for their American production. Farley also highlights the importance of affordable parts to foster domestic growth and vehicle affordability, noting Ford's position as a net exporter of vehicles and parts.</p>

Despite these concerns, the annual meeting continues to attract thousands, offering a unique opportunity to hear from Warren Buffett and other key figures.

          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta issued a warning to immigration detention centers in the state, highlighting the need for 'significant improvements' to meet U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) standards.

Deficiencies were noted in medical recordkeeping, suicide prevention, and the use of force against detainees with mental health conditions. The warning comes as the Trump administration ramps up deportation efforts and reduces federal oversight of detention conditions, raising concerns about a potential humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Three more concerts by Irish rap group Kneecap have been cancelled in Germany after footage emerged of a band member allegedly calling for MPs to be killed. The cancellations follow earlier ones at Hurricane and Southside festivals, as well as a gig at the Eden Project in Cornwall. The band has faced criticism after a video appeared to show one of its members saying, 'The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.' Kneecap has described the backlash as a 'smear campaign' and apologized to the families of MPs who have been killed.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments on whether a Catholic school in Oklahoma can become the nation's first religious charter school funded directly by taxpayers. The case pits claims of religious freedom against the separation of church and state. The justices will consider whether Oklahoma's charter schools program, which is defined as 'public,' can include faith-based groups. A decision in favor of the school could have sweeping consequences nationwide, potentially affecting charter school programs and the education of millions of students.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans receiving Social Security saw an increase in their benefits due to the Social Security Fairness Act. However, experts warn against using these extra funds unwisely. Seann Malloy, founder and managing partner at Malloy Law Offices, advised against debt consolidation and risky investments, particularly for representative payees. Such actions could be a breach of fiduciary duty under SSA guidelines and lead to future hardship if unanticipated medical or housing costs surface. The Social Security Administration does not regulate how retirees spend their benefits, but mismanagement by a third party can lead to legal consequences.</p>

Israel banned UNRWA from operating on its territory after alleging that some of its staff participated in the Hamas attack, but provided no evidence to the United Nations.</p>
