          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is speeding up its production timeline for new U.S. facilities by several quarters due to robust interest from American customers. The CEO confirmed the move during an earnings call where the company reported a record-high profit, a nearly 61% year-over-year increase. This acceleration comes as TSMC proceeds with its $165 billion investment in six Arizona fabrication plants, an R&D center, and advanced packaging facilities, despite potential uncertainties from U.S. tariff policies.

          <p>Organizers of the Tomorrowland music festival in Belgium have confirmed the event will proceed, even after a major fire completely destroyed its main stage just days before opening. No one was injured in the blaze, and officials have declared the site safe for the 400,000 expected attendees. While the campsite has opened, attendees have noted a subdued and somber atmosphere as organizers work on contingency plans for the performances originally scheduled for the iconic, now-lost stage.</p>

          <p>Amid tense trade negotiations and a looming deadline for new U.S. tariffs on EU imports, this article examines presidential claims that Europe does not purchase American cars or agricultural goods. Trade data from 2024 shows these claims are inaccurate, as the EU was the fourth-largest buyer of U.S. agricultural products and imported about 165,000 American vehicles. The analysis provides context on the trade imbalance and existing tariff structures that have fueled the ongoing dispute.</p>

This economic pressure means homeowners with variable-rate home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are unlikely to see rate relief soon, and could even face higher rates if inflation persists. While HELOCs remain more affordable than credit cards, the current environment suggests borrowing costs will stay elevated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former chairs of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) have expressed alarm over the Trump administration's push to quadruple nuclear power and speed up plant approvals. They warn that executive orders aimed at overhauling the NRC and slashing regulations threaten the independent agency's ability to protect public health and safety. Citing the Fukushima disaster as a cautionary tale, they argue that compromising the regulator's independence increases the risk of a serious nuclear accident.</p>

          <p>James Clapper, the former Director of National Intelligence, was barred from attending a CIA graduation ceremony for a bomb-sniffing dog he had sponsored and named after his late wife. The decision to exclude Clapper, a frequent critic of the president, was reportedly based on a White House executive order stripping his security clearance. The incident is being viewed by critics as a petty and personal use of presidential power to target a perceived political adversary.</p>
