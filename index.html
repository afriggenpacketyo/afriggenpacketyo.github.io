          <h2>Taiwan's Ruling Party Faces Criticism for Removing "Han Chinese" Category from Official Website</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taiwanese authorities are facing backlash for removing the "Han" category from demographic groups on the Executive Yuan's website, a move perceived as distancing the island from mainland China. The change, made on March 24, categorizes Han Chinese, the majority on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, as "other population." Critics, including the KMT, slam the move as a "denial of history," while the ruling DPP intensifies efforts to promote Taiwan's indigenous identity and erode ties with the mainland. The revised web page now states that Taiwan's population is 2.6% indigenous, 1.2% foreign, and 96.2% "other population," omitting the previous mention of Han Chinese as the largest ethnic group. Relevant context is the complex relationship between Taiwan and China, with Taiwan seeking to assert its distinct identity while China claims the island as its own territory.</p>

          <p>Chinese economist Yao Yang discusses the ongoing trade war between the US and China, suggesting that both sides are realizing the unsustainable nature of the conflict. He believes a deal is highly likely, with a potential rollback to the original 34% tariff level as a first step. Yao Yang highlights the growing recognition in the US that tariffs are not a real solution, citing weak economic data and instability in the dollar. He also notes that China is ready to negotiate seriously if the US is willing to talk, emphasizing the mutual harm caused by the trade war.

          <p>Japan's health insurance system, globally praised for its affordability and support for a long-lived population, is facing strain from a shrinking workforce and an aging population. The system's future is becoming entangled in political maneuvering ahead of key elections, raising concerns about its stability and public trust. Analysts warn that turning the health insurance system into a political issue could undermine its effectiveness, emphasizing the need for measured debate rather than rushed reforms. The government's plan to secure funds for child-rearing by drawing from medical system savings has sparked backlash, highlighting the tensions between different age groups and political priorities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly in talks with Qatar about accepting a luxury Boeing 747 airplane that could temporarily serve as Air Force One. The offer comes ahead of Trump's visit to the Middle East, where he is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. While the White House confirms the offer, some Democrats question the legality and ethics of the deal, suggesting it could be a cash payment to Trump in exchange for favors. The White House spokeswoman stated that any gift given by a foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. officials have halted all imports of live cattle, horses, and bison from Mexico due to concerns over the spread of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins cited the detection of the screwworm in southern Mexico as the reason for the decision. The U.S. and Mexico had previously eradicated the pest in the 1960s and '70s, but cases have surged in parts of Central America and are now being detected closer to the U.S. border. The ban will continue on a month-by-month basis until containment is achieved.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced it will release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement with Israel, ahead of President Trump's visit to the Middle East.

A senior Hamas official stated that direct negotiations with a US administration official are underway in Qatar.

          <p>CVS Caremark's decision to exclude Zepbound in favor of Wegovy for weight loss coverage is disrupting treatments for many Americans, despite research showing Zepbound results in more weight loss.

Patients like Ellen Davis, who have experienced significant health improvements on Zepbound, are worried about being forced to switch to a less effective drug. While Caremark claims the decision aims to lower drug prices, doctors and patients express concerns about the lack of medical justification and the potential for stalled health progress.</p>

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen in October 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned to a Japanese temple, resolving a dispute that had contributed to bilateral friction. The statue of the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima, was handed over to representatives of the Japanese temple in South Korea. The statue is expected to be stored at a museum after a ceremony at the temple. South Korea's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership in 2023.</p>

While some leaders remain optimistic about California's ability to overcome these obstacles, others express concern about the state's future. The state's political leadership finds itself at a crossroads, with a new governor set to take office and a hard-fought race for Los Angeles mayor on the horizon.</p>

President Trump has hinted at lowering tariffs on China. The talks come amid heightened tensions, with the U.S. having imposed tariffs on China, prompting retaliatory measures.</p>
