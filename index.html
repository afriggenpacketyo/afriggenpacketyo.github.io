          <p>The Senate voted down a motion to block President Trump's unilateral strikes on vessels suspected of drug smuggling, with two Republicans siding with Democrats. The proposal aimed to require congressional authorization for military actions against organizations designated as terrorist groups involved in drug trafficking. Senator Fetterman was the sole Democrat who voted with Republicans against the motion, citing his support for confronting cartel drug trafficking. Senator Young expressed concerns about the legality of the strikes without congressional approval, emphasizing Congress's constitutional role in decisions of war and peace. The vote highlights the ongoing debate over executive power in military operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Google is implementing stricter limitations on its 'Work from Anywhere' (WFA) policy, which was introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Employees can now only work remotely outside of their main office for up to four weeks per year, and even a single day of remote work will count as a full week against their allowance. The company is not changing its hybrid schedule, which allows employees to work from home two days a week, but WFA days cannot be used for working from home. Google has also started offering voluntary buyouts to some U.S. employees and has warned remote workers that their jobs may be at risk if they do not return to the office on a hybrid schedule. These changes reflect a broader trend among tech companies to encourage employees to spend more time in the office.</p>

          <p>Macao is transforming into an entertainment hub, drawing parallels with Las Vegas by adding attractions like waterparks, spas, and sports events. Las Vegas Sands hosted NBA games in Macao, highlighting the city's entertainment capabilities. The government requires casino operators to invest in non-gaming amenities, and visitors are increasingly younger gamblers and families. Despite these efforts to diversify, gambling revenue remains a significant contributor to Macao's economy, driving profits and tax revenue, while the events are driving the gambling. </p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson is refusing to seat Adelita Grijalva, a newly elected Democratic representative from Arizona, sparking controversy and delaying representation for her district. Grijalva suspects Johnson is preventing her from being seated to stop her from signing a discharge petition that would force a vote on releasing confidential files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The petition requires 218 signatures, and Grijalva's support would finalize it. Johnson's actions are seen as a procedural abuse aimed at protecting his party from potential embarrassment related to President Trump's past association with Epstein, raising concerns about future transfers of power in Congress.</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian city of Kupiansk is under siege, with residents fleeing as Russian forces advance, and the city has been closed off since late September. Valentyna, a 75-year-old resident, recounted her escape after being threatened by a drunk Russian soldier, highlighting the dire conditions with no water, gas, electricity, or open stores. Evacuation requests have surged, but aid workers struggle to meet the demand due to drone attacks. Many internally displaced persons are elderly pensioners struggling to afford housing, relying on hostels and in need of social support to cope with trauma and navigate paperwork, underscoring the strain on resources and the longing for home. </p>

          <p>Ferrari's stock experienced its worst trading day after the company released its updated full-year and 2030 guidance, which analysts found disappointing. The luxury carmaker lowered its electric vehicle sales target for 2030, citing a client-centric approach and the current market environment. Despite unveiling the chassis and powertrain of its first electric vehicle, the "elettrica," Ferrari now aims for a 40% internal combustion engine, 40% hybrid, and 20% fully electric model lineup by 2030. Analysts suggest the guidance implies limited operating leverage, potentially impacting consensus earnings per share. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump described the Democrats’ approach to the government shutdown as a kamikaze attack. Democrats have repeatedly refused to back a short-term funding bill that would reopen the government until Republicans make concessions on funding tax credits that have expanded health-care coverage. Republicans are looking for new ways to cudgel them into caving. One weapon is Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</p>

          <p>For decades, New York sidewalks were awash in piled-up black plastic rubbish bags, some of which doubled as housing projects for the city’s other inhabitants. “I’ve kicked bags of garbage in New York as part of a rat safari and you just watch rats go flying,” says Kaylee Byers, an expert on urban rats at the University of British Columbia. A study conducted in 2023 by MMPC, a pest-control company, suggested there were 3m rats in the city, up from 2m a decade earlier.</p>

          <p>A Kazakh government official urged increased infrastructure investment, particularly along the Middle Corridor trade route, to facilitate Kazakhstan's role as a bridge between Asia and Europe. While Kazakhstan is cooperating with China on trade digitization, obstacles remain due to differing customs and logistics procedures. Trade volumes along the Middle Corridor are expected to triple by 2030, driven largely by Kazakhstan's exports. The official emphasized that achieving these projections requires significant infrastructure investment to realize the country's transit potential.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have identified the 'master sex-determining gene' in central bearded dragons, whose sex determination is influenced by both genetics and incubation temperature. If dragon eggs are incubated at 32 degrees Celsius or higher, some male embryos will emerge as female. The scientists sequenced longer DNA fragments to produce a near-complete genome of the lizard. The findings contribute to understanding sex determination mechanisms in reptiles.</p>

          <p>Billionaire Tom Steyer will spend $12 million to support California Democrats' efforts to redraw congressional districts, aiming to boost their party's representation in Congress. The ballot measure was proposed by Gov. Gavin Newsom and other California Democrats in response to President Trump's urging of Texas leaders to redraw their districts. Steyer's investment makes him the largest funder of pro-Proposition 50 efforts, surpassing George Soros, and he plans to launch an ad criticizing Trump's reaction to the ballot measure's success. The effort is part of a broader battle over redistricting and its impact on political power.</p>

          <p>China introduced new restrictions on exports of rare earths and related technology, potentially increasing its leverage in trade negotiations with the United States ahead of a meeting between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The Ministry of Commerce's actions target U.S. defense technology companies that rely on Chinese rare earths, expanding the list of controlled items and restricting recycling equipment exports. This move is seen as a strategic effort to strengthen China's bargaining position on issues like tariffs and technology trade, turning export control into a diplomatic tool.</p>

Chairman Eamonn McManus acknowledged the difficulty of the decision, with Wellens expressing disappointment but respecting the decision. During his time as head coach, Saints were dethroned by rivals Wigan Warriors, and struggled with injuries in 2024, and the team's form tailed off mid-season.</p>

His notable works include 'Satantango,' 'The Melancholy of Resistance,' and 'Herscht 07769', with his themes often drawing from experiences under communism and his travels, examined to the point of madness.</p>
