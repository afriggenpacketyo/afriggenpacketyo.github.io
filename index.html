          <p>A brutal heat wave is expected to impact the eastern United States, bringing several days of record-high temperatures starting this weekend and continuing into next week. The National Weather Service has termed it "the first significant heat wave this season," with major to extreme heat risk spreading into the Midwest and East Coast. Potential daily record highs are also forecast for parts of the Rockies and Plains, with temperatures well into the 90s reaching the mid-Atlantic and Northeast. The heat is expected to shift into the Midwest and Ohio Valley by the end of the weekend, arriving in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic on Sunday and lasting through the first half of next week. Officials are warning residents to stay indoors with air conditioning and to avoid strenuous outdoor activities. </p>

          <p>Former Indiana Pacers star Jalen Rose made a bold prediction that the Indiana Pacers will win Game 7 against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Rose praised Tyrese Haliburton and expressed his wish for Haliburton to be healthy for the game, claiming that Indiana is going to win if he is ready to go. The Pacers won Game 1 because of Haliburton, and even took a 2-1 series lead after winning the third game of the series. A win for the Pacers on Sunday would give them their first NBA championship since winning three ABA titles in the early 1970s.</p>

Iran reported that Israel struck multiple cities, including Isfahan, where a nuclear site was hit, although authorities claimed there was no leak of hazardous materials. Diplomatic meetings in Geneva, New York, and Istanbul have failed to produce any breakthroughs, even as President Trump considers joining Israel in launching an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi cautioned against active U.S. military involvement, stating it would be dangerous for everyone.

Boelter's wife told investigators they were "preppers" and that he gave her a "bailout plan" to go to her mother's home in Wisconsin, indicating they needed to leave the house due to potential armed individuals arriving. Law enforcement found empty rifle cases, gun-cleaning supplies, and a bike in a storage locker rented by Boelter. The Hoffmans recounted being awakened by someone impersonating an officer, leading to the senator and his wife being shot multiple times, and the family expressed concern about the risks associated with public service.</p>

          <p>Senior Israeli officials have suggested that their military campaign against Iran could lead to a regime change, which would significantly impact global oil prices. Despite the ongoing conflict, the oil market has shown remarkable restraint, with prices increasing by about 10% since the Israeli attack. However, analysts warn that the risk of a supply disruption and subsequent price spike is growing as the conflict continues. While Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denies that regime change is Israel's official goal, Defense Minister Israel Katz has ordered intensified strikes on Iran to destabilize the regime. Further political destabilization in Iran could lead to significantly higher oil prices sustained over extended periods.</p>

The firm has identified declining revenue, shrinking gross margins, and high management turnover as key issues contributing to the company's underperformance.

          <p>Air conditioning is not merely a luxury, but a necessity that saves lives, maintains productivity, and improves sleep quality. It is essential for mitigating the dangers of extreme heat, which kills more Americans annually than any other form of extreme weather. Air conditioning also supports economic activity by preventing productivity declines in schools and businesses during hot weather. Furthermore, cooling is crucial for a decent night’s sleep, as humans fall asleep fastest in cooler temperatures, and it has enabled the development of industries like film and microchip production.

The prosecution cites her actions following the shooting, including allegedly fleeing with her husband and hiding in Detroit to avoid prosecution, as evidence of her flight risk. The defense argues that the couple was never on the run but hiding out of fear due to death threats and had plans to surrender with their lawyers.</p>

Doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, proposed a combined heart-liver transplant to solve the antibody problem, a procedure never before performed on someone with an LVAD.

The piece discusses the financial strain on families, the low wages of caregivers, and the potential impact of Medicaid cuts.

          <p>The article discusses the UK's complex history with Iran and its current role in the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel. The UK's historical involvement in Iran's oil industry and political affairs, coupled with concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions and activities within the UK, contribute to the complexity. The focus is on diplomacy, with Foreign Secretary David Lammy engaging with US and European counterparts to de-escalate the situation. The UK government is wary of the potential consequences of military action and the legal justifications required for involvement, with domestic political considerations adding to the challenge.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the resurgence of thinness as a cultural ideal through the "SkinnyTok" trend on social media, where influencers promote restrictive eating habits. This trend is contrasted with the body-positivity movement and its perceived failures, as well as the influence of weight-loss drugs like Ozempic. The author explores the connection between SkinnyTok, traditional femininity, and right-wing ideologies, noting how algorithms can lead users to more extremist content. The piece also examines the motivations behind SkinnyTok influencers and the appeal of their message to women who feel societal pressure to be thin.</p>

The Cass County Sheriff's Office was dispatched to rural Enderlin, North Dakota, for tornado damage to a residence at approximately 11:40 p.m. on Friday night but once deputies arrived on the scene, the Enderlin Fire Department let them know that storm chasers had located two deceased people as a result of the tornado, according to a statement from the Cass County Sheriff’s Office. “Shortly after learning of this, the Enderlin Fire Department was dispatched to another location, and a third deceased person was found as a result of the tornado,” officials said. Deputies found extensive damage to the area and began conducting well-being checks on people with several partner agencies.

Experts argue that Trump's actions represent a new level of commercialization of politics, where there is no separation between power and profit.

          <p>This article reviews Pip Adam’s novel, Audition, which uses outer space to imagine alternative forms of human relation, and to escape the gravitational trap of Earth’s prejudices and hierarchies, its forms of ownership and exploitation. The story follows three giants on a spaceship, where they are compelled to speak constantly, and the narrative examines themes of exploitation, confinement, and the potential for transformation. The review contrasts the novel's vision with the utopian dreams of billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, and discusses how space exploration can reflect existing inequalities. The article concludes that true possibility lies beyond the hard borders that separate life on Earth today.</p>

While the fish's diet typically consists of fish and squid, the presence of plastic reinforces the invasive nature of plastic pollution. Microplastics can cause serious health problems for marine animals, including delayed development and reproductive issues, and can also harm human health.
