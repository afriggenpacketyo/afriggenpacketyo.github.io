            <p>Detective Bill Ford's offer of a cigarette to Russell Jones led to a confession and the location of Aaron Friar's body in Medford, Oregon. Jones, initially talkative and eager to negotiate, revealed he helped load the body after being promised a smoke. The case, featured on "48 Hours," involved the disappearance of Aaron and his daughter Ellie, with investigators finding blood at their home. Jones later confessed that Gavin MacFarlane killed Aaron in self-defense, though the investigation would reveal a much more sinister plot.</p>

Sierra recounted hearing a fight and seeing her sister Ellie's boyfriend, Gavin MacFarlane, outside their home on the morning of her father's disappearance.
