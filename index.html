          <p>The relationship between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has deteriorated, moving from allies to rivals due to policy disagreements. Musk publicly criticized Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," leading to a public dispute where Trump threatened to cut off subsidies to Musk's companies. Musk has also floated the idea of creating a new political party, potentially challenging Trump's influence. This feud highlights the complex interplay between business, politics, and power, potentially impacting Tesla's regulatory landscape and government support. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, has returned to the U.S. to face federal charges of conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawfully transporting undocumented people. The charges stem from allegations that Abrego Garcia played a role in an alien smuggling ring involving children and women over the last decade. Maryland leaders, including Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Congressman Glenn Ivey, have emphasized the importance of due process in the case, highlighting that it is about constitutional rights, not about the individual. Abrego Garcia's attorneys have denied allegations of gang ties, stating he has no criminal history in the U.S. or El Salvador.</p>

          <p>Arrests for illegal work in the UK have doubled in the past year, with immigration officers arresting over 6,400 people in raids at businesses. The government says it is focusing on "unscrupulous" employers who exploit undocumented migrants, subjecting them to poor conditions and low wages. Officers visited more than 9,000 businesses, including restaurants and construction sites, to check paperwork and working conditions. The government has also returned nearly 30,000 people who did not have the right to be in the UK, cracking down on illegal migration with tighter work visas.</p>

          <p>Faced with escalating public grievances over soaring rice prices and a looming national election, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is targeting the country's rice policy. Ishiba is signaling a willingness to overhaul Japan's decades-old production adjustment system to counter opposition parties proposing consumption tax cuts. Reforming rice policy has been a personal priority for Ishiba, who aims to boost rice production while addressing the risk of price plunges due to oversupply. He is pursuing a consumer-focused approach by releasing reserve rice to lower prices, but faces challenges from vested interests and market concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

New figures released quietly by ministers in recent days show the Home Office plans to spend £2.2bn of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year - that is only marginally less than the £2.3bn it spent in 2024/25. The money is largely used to cover the accommodation costs of thousands of asylum seekers who have recently arrived in the UK. The Home Office said it was committed to ending asylum hotels and was speeding up asylum decisions to save taxpayers' money.</p>
