          <p>In February 2022, a UK official accidentally leaked a spreadsheet with personal data of almost 19,000 Afghans seeking relocation, which became public knowledge this week. The breach was discovered in August 2023 when some names appeared on Facebook, prompting a secret government effort to relocate those affected, costing £400 million so far. The government obtained a super-injunction to suppress the news, which was just lifted. While an internal review deemed it "unlikely" the leak was the sole cause of any harm, those affected consider it a catastrophic failure that increased their risk from the Taliban.</p>

          <p>Shares of GrabAGun, an online firearms retailer with Donald Trump Jr. as a shareholder and advisor, fell over 20% during its debut on the New York Stock Exchange. The company went public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), raising $179 million in gross proceeds. Trump Jr., who rang the opening bell, framed the public offering as a "vindication" against "woke nonsense." The event highlights the trend of Trump family members and allies backing companies aligned with conservative political causes, similar to the SPAC deal for Trump Media. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nintendo and Sony have cast Bo Bragason as Princess Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link in the upcoming live-action "Legend of Zelda" movie. The announcement was made by the game's creator, Shigeru Miyamoto. The film, directed by Wes Ball of "Maze Runner" fame, is now scheduled for release on May 7, 2027, following production delays. Ball has expressed his desire to create a film with the "wonder and whimsy" of a live-action Hayao Miyazaki work, distinguishing it from typical fantasy epics like "Lord of the Rings."</p>

          <p>Columbia University has agreed to incorporate the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA) definition of antisemitism into its policies. This move is part of an effort to restore $400 million in federal grants frozen by the Trump administration over allegations the university failed to protect Jewish students during campus protests. Critics argue the IHRA definition can be used to stifle legitimate criticism of Israel by conflating anti-Zionism with antisemitism. The decision follows months of campus turmoil and criticism from pro-Israel groups and Republican lawmakers over the university's handling of pro-Palestinian demonstrations.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has suspended four Members of Parliament after they rebelled against the party's official stance on a government welfare bill. The MPs, including Rachael Maskell, joined a larger group of 47 Labour rebels who voted against proposed welfare cuts, forcing the government to amend its plans. The suspended MPs stated they were representing their constituents' interests and could not support measures that would make disabled people poorer. This rebellion has been seen as a challenge to the authority of party leader Keir Starmer, coming after other recent policy reversals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent uptick in the U.S. Consumer Price Index, which rose 2.7% annually in June, is raising concerns about the future of credit card interest rates. Since most credit card APRs are variable and tied to the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate, persistent inflation could lead the Fed to keep rates high, or even raise them. This would translate to higher interest costs for consumers carrying a balance, making it more difficult to pay down debt. The article suggests proactive strategies for consumers, such as balance transfers or negotiating with issuers, to mitigate the impact of potentially rising rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time in several years, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has resumed transferring inmates to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), despite local sanctuary policies. Records show 20 inmates were handed over to ICE in May and June, a significant shift from the near-zero transfers since early 2020. The department states the transfers are legal and comply with state and county laws because they were executed in response to federal judicial warrants, primarily for criminal offenses like illegal reentry.

Proponents argue that the current lack of rules creates opportunities for entities to curry favor with a sitting president.

          <p>New York state officials are demanding that Tesla reverse a new corporate bylaw that significantly restricts the ability of shareholders to file derivative lawsuits. The bylaw, adopted after Tesla reincorporated in Texas, requires an investor to own 3% of the company's stock—currently worth about $30 billion—to bring such a suit. The New York State Common Retirement Fund, a Tesla shareholder, accused the company of a "bait-and-switch," arguing Tesla had assured stakeholders their rights would be equivalent after the move from Delaware. Critics claim the change effectively insulates Tesla's directors and officers from accountability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block the termination of a multi-billion dollar FEMA grant program for pre-disaster mitigation. The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, which funds projects like flood walls and evacuation shelters, was canceled by the agency in April. The states argue that FEMA acted unlawfully and violated the separation of powers, as the program was approved and funded by Congress. The lawsuit, led by Washington and Massachusetts, highlights the administration's moves to shrink the agency, a concern amplified by the recent deadly floods in Texas.</p>

          <p>SBH Health System, a safety-net hospital in the Bronx, is anticipating a severe financial blow from the recently passed healthcare bill known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill." The hospital's president, Dr. David Perlstein, predicts a loss of $75 million, which constitutes 12% of its budget, as a result of an estimated 100,000 residents in its congressional district losing their insurance. Given that two-thirds of the local population relies on Medicaid, such a significant revenue loss would be unsustainable. Dr. Perlstein warns that the hospital has no "fat" to trim and that these cuts will inevitably lead to layoffs and the closure of essential services.</p>
