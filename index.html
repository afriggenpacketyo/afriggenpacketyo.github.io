          <h2>New Infrastructure Unlocks African Iron Ore for Chinese Market</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 02:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is poised to begin importing iron ore from Guinea and Algeria, a major development for global commodity markets made possible by new infrastructure. Chinese firms have successfully completed the construction of essential railway lines and port facilities, resolving logistical hurdles that had long stalled exports from the two African nations. The massive Simandou mine in Guinea, a joint project involving mining giant Rio Tinto, is now scheduled to commence shipments by November. This new trade route underscores China's strategy to secure vital industrial resources while simultaneously fostering economic growth in its African partner countries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Beijing has strongly condemned the European Union's decision to sanction two Chinese banks, demanding an immediate reversal of the policy. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce voiced resolute opposition and warned it would take necessary measures to protect the interests of its financial institutions. This sharp escalation in tensions comes just days before a high-stakes leaders' summit between China and the EU. According to sources, Beijing had engaged in intensive lobbying to prevent the sanctions and had previously warned the EU's top diplomat of a forthcoming response if the measures were enacted.</p>

          <p>Owen Farrell has been named captain for the British and Irish Lions' upcoming match against the First Nations and Pasifika XV in Melbourne. This marks Farrell's first start of the tour, where he will play at inside centre in a lineup completely different from the one that won the first Test against Australia. The team for the midweek game includes numerous players from the tour's wider squad, including nine Scots, as head coach Andy Farrell aims to rest his primary players ahead of the second Test. The match provides an opportunity for fringe players to contend for a spot in the upcoming crucial games.</p>

          <p>The Singapore dollar (SGD) is increasingly exhibiting characteristics of a safe-haven currency, particularly within Asia, as traditional options like the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen face uncertainty. Analysts point to Singapore's strong institutional framework, economic resilience, and prudent fiscal policy as key factors supporting the SGD's stability during financial stress. However, its path to becoming a global safe haven is constrained by the relatively small size of its market and the managed nature of its monetary policy, which limits liquidity. While it may not replace the top-tier safe havens, experts believe the SGD could increasingly be viewed as the 'Swiss franc of Asia'. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Armed Bedouin clans have announced their withdrawal from the Druze-majority city of Sweida in southern Syria after a week of deadly clashes that killed hundreds. The withdrawal follows a U.S.-brokered ceasefire, allowing humanitarian aid convoys to enter the battered region, which faces shortages of essential supplies. The conflict, sparked by kidnappings, escalated into sectarian violence and drew in Israeli airstrikes against government forces allied with the Bedouins. Despite the cautious calm, tensions persist as some fighters remain on the city's outskirts, demanding the surrender of a rival Druze leader they blame for the sedition.</p>

          <p>Two apartment blocks in Kirkby, Merseyside, are scheduled to be closed due to severe fire safety deficiencies, leaving residents homeless after years of financial and emotional distress. Flat owners in Beech Rise and Willow Rise reveal that approximately £1 million of tenant and taxpayer funds have been spent on failed repairs and safety measures. The buildings, once marketed as luxury apartments, have deteriorated under a series of management companies linked to offshore investors, while service charges have soared. This situation highlights what a local MP calls a "broken leasehold system," where residents bear the costs of neglect by landlords and management firms.</p>

His gang is blamed for transforming the nation into a major drug transit hub and is suspected in the assassination of a presidential candidate. This extradition marks a significant step in President Daniel Noboa's crackdown on organized crime, supported by a recent referendum allowing such measures.</p>

          <p>A growing body of evidence suggests that GLP-1 drugs, such as Ozempic and Wegovy, could be a breakthrough treatment for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), a common and underdiagnosed hormonal disorder. Women with PCOS who have used these drugs report significant improvements in symptoms like irregular periods, weight management, and hair loss. Researchers believe the drugs' effectiveness stems from improving insulin sensitivity, which in turn helps regulate hormone levels that are a root cause of many PCOS symptoms. While larger clinical trials are needed, this potential new application offers hope for millions of women seeking effective treatment options.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man, Keith McAllister, has died after being violently pulled into an MRI machine by a 9kg weight-training chain he was wearing around his neck. The incident occurred at a clinic in New York when he entered the scanning room to help his wife, who was undergoing a knee scan. The machine's powerful magnetic field immediately snatched the metal chain, pulling him into the apparatus and causing a fatal "medical episode." This tragic and rare accident highlights the extreme dangers posed by metallic objects near MRI machines, which exert incredibly strong magnetic forces.</p>

This contrast in policy reflects fundamentally different approaches to climate change and the future of energy.

In a series of social media posts, Trump claimed there is a large demand for the name change and that he might impose a restriction on the stadium project if the team does not comply. The team dropped the controversial name in 2020 after years of criticism that it was a racist slur against Indigenous people. It remains unclear how Trump could intervene in the project, which involves redeveloping a federally owned property in Washington, D.C.</p>

          <p>Canada is currently experiencing a significant measles outbreak, with over 3,800 cases reported in 2025, a number that far surpasses that of the more populous United States. The surge has made Canada the only Western nation in the top 10 countries for measles outbreaks, with Alberta being the hardest-hit province. Health officials link the rapid spread to declining MMR vaccination rates, fueled by vaccine hesitancy and misinformation that has grown since the COVID-19 pandemic. The outbreak, which began in late 2024, has primarily affected unvaccinated children and infants, highlighting a critical public health challenge for the country.</p>

These tailwinds include a strong second-quarter earnings season, significant consumer and business tax relief from new legislation, and massive investment in data centers and the electrical grid. Other positive drivers are the re-shoring of manufacturing, a resurgence in the U.S. energy sector, and a revitalized IPO market.

New analysis from the Department for Work and Pensions reveals that four in ten people are not saving enough, with a projected 8% decline in income for those retiring in 2050. The commission will investigate why nearly half of working-age adults, particularly low earners, the self-employed, and certain ethnic groups, are not contributing to private pensions. Its goal is to build a national consensus on a strategy to boost retirement savings. (not investment advice)</p>
