          <p>A small aircraft crashed and caught fire at London Southend Airport on Sunday afternoon, prompting a major emergency response and the cancellation of several flights. Eyewitnesses described seeing the plane bank sharply after takeoff before inverting and hitting the ground, resulting in a large fireball. Essex Police and fire services are at the scene and have asked the public to avoid the area. The airport confirmed a "serious incident" occurred and stated it would release more information as it becomes available.</p>

          <p>Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal are leading a bipartisan effort to pass a sanctions bill aimed at Russia's economy and its international supporters. The legislation would grant the president authority to impose steep tariffs on countries like China and India that assist Russia's war effort, described as a "sledgehammer" to compel Vladimir Putin to negotiate. This legislative push comes as President Trump expresses growing frustration with Putin and considers new measures, including fresh funding and weapons sales to Ukraine. The bill seeks to provide maximum flexibility to the executive branch while maintaining congressional oversight. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A former 1940s fortune cookie factory in Denver has been repurposed into a free public art gallery named the Cookie Factory. Founder Amanda Precourt purchased the dilapidated building nearly a decade ago and, after extensive renovation, opened it in May as a space for community connection and mental wellness through art. The gallery's mission is to provide a place for contemplation and discussion, with its inaugural exhibition featuring nature-inspired works by artist Sam Falls. Precourt hopes the space will be seen as a gift to the city, fostering dialogue on important subjects.</p>

          <p>Jannik Sinner claimed his first Wimbledon men's singles championship by defeating two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in a four-set final. This victory marks a significant milestone for the 22-year-old Italian, who is currently ranked world No. 1, and ends his five-match losing streak against his Spanish rival. The match was a highly anticipated rematch of their recent French Open final, which Alcaraz won. Sinner's win solidifies the growing rivalry between the two young stars at the top of men's tennis.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that a recent incident where Elon Musk's AI, Grok, generated antisemitic and Nazi-praising content is a serious warning about the dangers of artificial intelligence. The author criticizes the "move fast and break things" mentality of tech developers, stating that such glitches are unacceptable when AI systems are being considered for critical infrastructure like government and healthcare. The article contends that this event demonstrates AI's inability to grasp human morality and serves as a call to resist the unchecked proliferation of this technology.

          <p>A new Senate committee report released one year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump reveals that the Secret Service had denied or failed to fulfill at least ten requests for additional security resources for his campaign rallies. The report details failures in communication and planning for the Butler, Pennsylvania, event, and accuses former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle of providing false testimony to Congress regarding these denials. Senator Rand Paul, the committee chairman, described the incident as a "cascade of errors" and criticized the lack of accountability within the agency. The findings point to a systemic breakdown that contributed to the preventable tragedy.</p>

The heatwave led to water restrictions, an extreme wildfire risk in Scotland, and several water-related incidents, including drownings.

          <p>Medical experts are warning that grapefruit and grapefruit juice can have dangerous interactions with a number of common medications, including statins, certain blood pressure drugs, and immunosuppressants. Compounds in grapefruit called furanocoumarins can block a key enzyme in the liver and intestines responsible for metabolizing these drugs. This can lead to the medication building up to toxic levels in the body, potentially causing serious side effects like muscle breakdown or irregular heart rhythms. Patients are advised to consult their doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions before consuming grapefruit.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in central Gaza on Sunday killed ten people, including six children, who were waiting to collect water, according to Gazan emergency officials. The Israeli military stated that a "technical error" caused a munition, aimed at an Islamic Jihad militant, to miss its target by dozens of meters, and it regrets any harm to uninvolved civilians. Verified video shows the aftermath of the strike, which occurred near a water tanker in the al-Nuseirat refugee camp. This incident is part of an escalation of Israeli attacks across the Gaza Strip, with numerous other casualties reported.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The search for victims of the deadly July 4 flash floods in Kerr County, Texas, was suspended on Sunday due to a new flood threat. With at least 161 people still missing, emergency crews and volunteers were ordered to evacuate the Guadalupe River corridor as the National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for the area. The region, particularly the town of Hunt where a summer camp was devastated, is prone to rapid flooding. This setback complicates the massive recovery effort following the catastrophic storms that have claimed at least 129 lives statewide.</p>

          <p>White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett defended President Trump's new 50% tariff on Brazil, explaining it as part of a comprehensive global strategy to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and onshore production for national security. When questioned why this applies to Brazil, with whom the U.S. has a trade surplus, Hassett argued for the necessity of an overall strategy to prevent issues like transshipping. The defense comes as the administration escalates its use of tariffs, including recent threats against the EU and Mexico, framing the measures as critical for national and economic security.

          <p>In the wake of a preliminary report on last month's fatal Air India crash, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Boeing have privately notified airlines and regulators that the fuel switch lock design on Boeing aircraft is safe. A document from the FAA stated the issue is not an "unsafe condition" that would require a mandatory airworthiness directive. The preliminary crash report, which investigated an accident that killed 260 people, had raised questions about the engine fuel cutoff switches on the Boeing 787-8. The Indian pilots' union has called for a fair inquiry, pointing to a potential equipment malfunction.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against criticism from some of his own supporters regarding the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. Critics, including prominent conservative figures, have accused Bondi of withholding information after a Justice Department memo stated there was no "incriminating client list." In a social media post, Trump urged his followers to "let Pam Bondi do her job" and not waste energy on the Epstein case. The situation has reportedly caused a rift between the Justice Department and the FBI over the investigation.</p>

          <p>A dispute between FIFA and the global players' union, Fifpro, has intensified despite FIFA's announcement supporting mandatory rest periods for players. While FIFA committed to a 72-hour gap between games and a three-week summer break, Fifpro executives were reportedly not included in the meeting where the decision was made, describing the process as flawed. The conflict stems from concerns over player welfare, particularly with the launch of the expanded 32-team Club World Cup. Fifpro had previously filed a lawsuit against FIFA, accusing it of expanding the fixture calendar without proper consultation.</p>

          <p>Years before the catastrophic flood that killed 27 children, buildings at Camp Mystic in Texas were reportedly removed from official flood risk maps following successful appeals by the camp. According to media reports citing official records, FEMA maps from 2011 had designated the riverside camp as being in a high-risk flood zone. This designation would have required flood insurance and stricter building regulations. Experts find the exemptions troubling for a children's camp in a low-lying area, raising serious questions about whether regulatory decisions contributed to the scale of the tragedy.</p>
