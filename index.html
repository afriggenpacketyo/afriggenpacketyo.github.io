          <p>Top mathematician Liu Jun clarified that his decision to leave Harvard University for China's Tsinghua University was driven by personal and family reasons, not political protest. In an email to the South China Morning Post, Liu stated the move was unrelated to the Trump administration but was instead motivated by a deep, lifelong bond with the Tsinghua campus where he was born. His departure had sparked speculation amid rising academic and political tensions between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank announced it would hold interest rates steady, citing persistent economic uncertainty largely stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies. While inflation in the euro zone is currently hovering around the bank's 2% target, concerns remain about the impact of trade disputes on sluggish economic growth. The ECB stated it will maintain a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach, leaving the door open for potential rate cuts later in the year if economic conditions worsen.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. consumer price index rose 2.9% annually in August, an acceleration from the previous month that matched economists' expectations amid President Trump's intensified tariff policies. This inflation data complicates the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on whether to cut interest rates, as policymakers weigh the risks of rising prices against a slowing labor market. The report also arrives amidst controversy following Trump's recent firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note briefly fell to 4% before stabilizing, as investors analyzed conflicting economic signals. The August consumer price index indicated slightly higher inflation than anticipated, while weekly jobless claims also jumped unexpectedly, pointing to a potentially weakening labor market.

          <p>Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used to simplify how consumers plan and book trips, with new tools designed to save time and money by acting as personalized travel agents. These AI-powered apps can generate itineraries, compare fluctuating prices, and maximize loyalty points, disrupting the traditional travel planning process. While many travelers have started using AI for inspiration and booking, some experts note that the technology is currently more effective for on-the-ground assistance, like translating menus, than for comprehensive trip planning.</p>

          <h2>Essay Explores the Decline of Teenage Babysitting and Its Social Consequences</h2>

          <p>This Vox article examines the cultural shift away from teenage babysitters toward a more professionalized, adult child care workforce, and explores what has been lost in this change. The author suggests that babysitting offers teens crucial lessons in responsibility and problem-solving, while younger children benefit from the unique mentorship of an older peer. The decline of this practice is linked to broader societal trends, including intensive parenting, over-scheduled teen lives, and a weakening of community bonds.</p>

          <h2>Essay Argues for Radical Restrictions on AI in Higher Education</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 07:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece in The Atlantic argues that the pervasive, unauthorized use of AI chatbots is fundamentally undermining the liberal arts tradition in higher education. The author calls for universities to implement drastic measures to combat AI-driven cheating, including a campus-wide "de-teching" that would ban Wi-Fi, laptops, and smartphones. While extreme, these steps are presented as necessary to preserve academic integrity and foster a genuine intellectual environment where students learn to think for themselves.</p>

          <p>In a landmark victory for gender equality, South Africa's Constitutional Court has overturned a law that prevented men from taking their wives' surnames. The court ruled that the previous legislation was discriminatory and perpetuated harmful patriarchal stereotypes. The case was brought by two couples who had been denied the right. As a result of the ruling, South Africa's parliament must now amend the country's Births and Deaths Registration Act.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Nature directly links over 200 recent, severe heat waves to the greenhouse gas emissions of major fossil fuel and cement companies. Researchers found that pollution from specific corporations like ExxonMobil, Chevron, and BP significantly increased the likelihood and intensity of these deadly weather events. This field of attribution science is growing rapidly and could play a crucial role in future climate-related litigation seeking damages from these producers.</p>

          <p>China's leading economic planning agency has approved a massive new infrastructure project to expand the shipping capacity at the Three Gorges Dam, a vital link in the Yangtze Economic Belt. The project involves constructing a new double-line, five-stage lock system to alleviate significant traffic bottlenecks. With an estimated cost of $10.7 billion, it is set to be the largest integrated project on the Yangtze River since the original dam was built.</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic features a photo essay looking back at the monumental public health campaign to vaccinate Americans against polio during the 1950s. The disease reached its peak in the U.S. in 1952, causing thousands of deaths and paralyzing over 20,000 people, mostly children. The widespread introduction of the Salk vaccine in 1955 led to a dramatic and rapid decline in cases, marking one of the greatest triumphs of modern medicine.</p>

          <p>The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has highlighted a "worrying trend" of students hacking their own schools' IT systems, often as a prank or a dare. The agency reports that pupils are responsible for over half of all "insider" cyber breaches in educational settings, sometimes using downloaded hacking tools to access sensitive personal data of staff and other students. The ICO is urging schools to improve their cybersecurity protocols and better recognize the potential threat posed by students.</p>
