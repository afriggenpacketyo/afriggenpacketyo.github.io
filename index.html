        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tom Cruise shared fond memories of working with his ex-wife Nicole Kidman on Stanley Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut," noting that he suggested Kidman for the role. Cruise called the experience very unique, especially the constant rewriting and reshooting to find the film's tone. The article also touches on Cruise's more recent rumored romance with Ana de Armas, highlighting sightings of the two together in London. Despite speculation, a source indicated they were working on a project with director Doug Liman, and not romantically involved.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite agreeing to a U.S.-brokered ceasefire, India and Pakistan quickly accused each other of violations involving border intrusions and retaliatory actions. The agreement followed escalating clashes, including missile and drone strikes, sparked by a terrorist attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Explosions were heard in Srinagar and Jammu after the ceasefire announcement, leading to blackouts and raising concerns about the truce's viability. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that talks on a broad set of issues would commence at a neutral site between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed federal agencies to cease estimating the economic impact of climate change when developing policies and regulations. This directive effectively shelves the ‚Äúsocial cost of carbon,‚Äù a tool used for over two decades to weigh the costs and benefits of policies. Jeffrey B. Clark, acting administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, questioned the scientific consensus on anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists and environmental groups criticize this decision, arguing it ignores the reality and growing harms caused by climate change.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer highlighted the Kyiv ceasefire talks as a "significant moment" in the effort to secure a ceasefire in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Around 30 global leaders reasserted their demand for Russia to agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, threatening severe sanctions if Russia does not comply. The UK prime minister joined leaders including Emmanuel Macron and Volodymyr Zelensky for the meeting, with Donald Trump reportedly reaffirming his support for the ceasefire after a call with President Putin. The Kremlin responded cautiously, accusing European leaders of confrontational remarks and stating that weapons shipments to Ukraine must cease before any ceasefire.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's pursuit of personal profits through cryptocurrency is hindering the passage of crypto legislation, specifically the GENIUS Act, which aims to establish federal rules for stablecoins. Lawmakers rejected the bill due to concerns that Trump's personal cryptocurrency ventures create a conflict of interest, as individuals can enrich the president by purchasing his coins.

Economists suggest Powell is in a no-win situation due to volatile policy mixes and conflicting pressures on the Fed's mandate. Despite Trump's insistence on rate cuts, Powell has voiced confidence in the economy and dismissed pre-emptive cuts.

          <p>The new German government, a coalition between the CDU/CSU and SPD, faces significant challenges including a struggling economy and the rise of the far-right AfD. The government plans to strengthen the economy, limit illegal migration, and modernize the country through a special fund for investments. However, they also face the need for budget cuts and pension system reforms due to demographic shifts. In foreign policy, the government aims to redefine Germany's role in Europe and the world.</p>

The effort, coordinated with the White House, calls for a truce to begin on Monday. President Trump signaled support for the sanctions if Russia does not comply, but the Kremlin dismissed the threat.
