          <p>The New York Police Department is investigating an incident in Brooklyn where a woman claims she was verbally and physically abused by a pro-Israel crowd following a protest. The incident occurred after a pro-Palestinian demonstration outside Chabad Lubavitch World Headquarters, where Israeli security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir was scheduled to speak.

          <p>President Trump's administration has pursued policies aimed at reshaping the global economic order, including initiating trade wars and dismantling international agreements.

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is reportedly conducting operations to locate unaccompanied immigrant children with the intent of deporting them or pursuing criminal cases against them and their sponsors. These actions have raised concerns about potential family separation and the criminalization of immigrants. While DHS claims these are welfare checks, documents show ICE is gathering intelligence to determine if the children are a flight risk or a threat to public safety. Legal services for unaccompanied minors have been cut, and data sharing between agencies has increased, sparking fears of increased deportations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. agriculture sector is experiencing a crisis due to the impact of trade war tariffs, with exporters reporting significant financial losses and canceled orders. The global backlash to Trump's tariffs has led to a decline in Chinese buying of U.S. farm products, resulting in layoffs and economic instability. The Agriculture Transportation Coalition (AgTC) has described the situation as a "full-blown crisis," citing massive financial losses among its members. The Port of Oakland has warned that a tariff-induced downturn in cargo volume could jeopardize job stability and the region's economic health.</p>
