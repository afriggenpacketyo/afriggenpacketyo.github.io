Legal experts criticized Trump's remarks, emphasizing that the Fifth Amendment applies to all 'persons,' not just citizens, and that his stance is unprecedented in American history.

          <p>A new salmonella outbreak linked to backyard poultry has sickened at least seven people in six states, according to the CDC. The cases were identified in February and March, and all had the same strain of salmonella, which has been traced to hatcheries in the past. Chickens and other backyard poultry can carry salmonella bacteria even if they appear healthy and clean. Health officials are continuing to investigate the outbreak.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration is reducing its overpayment clawback rate from 100% to 50% following concerns that the previous policy caused financial hardship for beneficiaries. This change reverses an earlier decision to recover erroneous overpayments by taking the entirety of a beneficiary's monthly check. The move comes after the agency's inspector general found that many overpayments were due to errors in Social Security's own calculations. Advocates argue that even the 50% clawback rate will pose a significant burden for many disabled workers and low-income seniors.</p>

Critics have called the operation a waste of taxpayer funds, and Senators have requested a review for potential fraud and waste.
