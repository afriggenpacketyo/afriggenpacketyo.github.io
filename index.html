Stewart expressed his apologies to his fans for any inconvenience caused by the cancellations, which include four shows in Las Vegas and Stateline, Nevada, and two rescheduled dates in California. Despite these setbacks, Stewart affirmed his readiness to perform at Glastonbury, where he will be the first artist to have headlined the festival and played its legends slot. He also mentioned that he had requested an additional 15 minutes to his set, as he typically plays for over two hours each night.</p>

          <p>A report by the Norwegian Refugee Council highlights Cameroon as facing one of the world's most neglected displacement crises, marked by underfunding and a lack of media attention. More than 1.1 million people are internally displaced, with an additional 480,000 refugees from neighboring countries seeking refuge in Cameroon. The country is grappling with two major conflicts: a civil war in the western regions and destabilization in the Lake Chad region due to Islamist militants. The NRC criticizes reduced budgets for development and humanitarian aid from countries like the US, UK, France, and Germany, emphasizing that political will could resolve these neglected crises.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has approved a $2.8 billion settlement allowing colleges and universities to directly pay their athletes, marking a significant shift in college sports. The settlement permits each school to share up to $20.5 million with athletes over the next year, along with $2.7 billion paid over the next decade to former players previously barred from revenue. This agreement resolves three antitrust cases challenging NCAA compensation rules dating back to 2016, addressing claims that NCAA rules denied athletes the opportunity to earn money from their name, image, and likeness. The NCAA lifted its ban on athletes earning money through endorsements and sponsorships in 2021.</p>

          <p>Tehran has criticized the US travel ban on Iranians and citizens of other predominantly Middle Eastern and African countries, denouncing it as a sign of a racist mentality. The Iranian Foreign Ministry stated that the decision indicates deep hostility towards the Iranian and Muslim people. The US ban targets nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, with a partial ban on travelers from seven other countries. Iran views the policy as discriminatory and a violation of international law, potentially leading to international repercussions for the US government.</p>

          <p>A furniture fraud involving the Palace of Versailles has come to light, revealing that several ornate chairs believed to be from the 18th century were fakes. Antiques expert Georges "Bill" Pallot and cabinetmaker Bruno Desnoues were put on trial for fraud and money laundering after a nine-year investigation. The scheme involved replicating royal furniture, including chairs said to have belonged to Marie Antoinette and Madame du Barry, and selling them to collectors and institutions. Galerie Kraemer and its director were also accused of deception by gross negligence for selling some of the chairs, though they deny the charge.</p>

          <p>Devi Sridhar discusses the factors influencing longevity, arguing that individual optimization through diet and exercise is insufficient. While personal choices matter, public policy, infrastructure, and community play a crucial role in determining health outcomes. She emphasizes the need for collective responsibility, advocating for policies that promote nutritious food, active cities, clean air, preventive healthcare, and public provision of water. Sridhar suggests that creating environments where healthy living is normalized by government and culture is key to improving life expectancy.</p>
