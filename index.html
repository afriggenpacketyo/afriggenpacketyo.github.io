          <p>At least 24 people have been killed in what officials are calling a "mass casualty event" after sudden and catastrophic flash floods struck Texas Hill Country. The Guadalupe River reportedly rose an unprecedented 26 feet in just 45 minutes, catching communities and a local summer camp by surprise. As of the latest reports, between 23 and 25 people, many of them children from Camp Mystic, remain unaccounted for. Governor Greg Abbott has signed a disaster declaration, mobilizing a massive search and rescue operation involving hundreds of personnel, helicopters, and drones to locate the missing individuals and assist with evacuations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are not planning to alter their trade deadline strategy despite an injury to third baseman Max Muncy. Initially feared to be season-ending, Muncy's injury was diagnosed as a bone bruise, with an expected recovery time of about six weeks. This timeline would allow him to return for the final month of the regular season. The team's management expressed relief at the positive diagnosis and will rely on internal options like Tommy Edman to cover third base in the interim. The front office believes the team can weather his absence without making a desperate trade.</p>

          <p>Authorities in New York City temporarily closed a section of beach in Far Rockaway, Queens, on the Fourth of July after multiple shark sightings occurred dangerously close to swimmers. Drones operated by the city's emergency management agency confirmed the sharks' proximity, leading to a swift public safety response. The closure lasted for about an hour before the beach was reopened, with officials continuing to monitor the waters. The incident occurred just days after New York's governor announced enhanced shark surveillance measures for the holiday weekend to ensure beachgoer safety.</p>

          <p>A recent online discussion has highlighted numerous under-hyped professions that offer surprisingly good pay, benefits, and a positive work-life balance. Among the jobs praised were paralegals, who can earn six-figure salaries with experience, and trade positions like plumbers and electricians, which are in high demand. Other mentioned careers included compliance specialists at banks, garbage collectors, and power line technicians, who benefit from significant overtime during storms. The conversation suggests that rewarding careers can often be found outside of traditional, degree-focused paths, offering stability and high satisfaction.</p>

The government's new growth policy focuses on developing advanced, eco-friendly, and autonomous vessels through improved technology and better working conditions.

          <p>A controversial Connecticut law that allows towing companies to sell seized vehicles just 15 days after towing them is being criticized as predatory. Critics and affected residents argue that private operators are targeting working-class and low-income neighborhoods, where people may struggle to quickly pay the high fees to retrieve their cars. One company, MyHoopty.com LLC, has been accused of towing over a thousand cars from a single apartment complex in two years. The company owner defends his actions, stating he is simply enforcing the parking rules of the private properties he services.</p>

          <p>Contrary to some claims, President Trump's newly signed legislative package does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits. Instead, the bill introduces a new temporary "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals aged 65 and older, which applies to their total income, not just Social Security payments. Policy experts clarify that this measure offers some tax relief but falls short of a full repeal of the tax on benefits.

The men had been held at a U.S. naval base in Djibouti after a lower court judge initially blocked their removal over due process concerns. The high court's decision effectively overruled the lower court's injunction, with a dissenting opinion from Justice Sonia Sotomayor expressing grave concern for the migrants' safety in the war-torn nation.

The article explores different perspectives, noting that while women are often judged as 'too emotional,' men can be shamed for appearing vulnerable.

          <p>New research reveals that tiny, migrating zooplankton in the Southern Ocean play a crucial role in combating climate change by locking away vast amounts of carbon. These minuscule creatures gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface in the spring, grow fat, and then sink deep into the ocean for the winter, where they burn this fat. This process effectively transports and stores an estimated 65 million tonnes of carbon annually, equivalent to the emissions of 55 million cars. The discovery underscores the vital, and previously underestimated, climate-regulating service provided by these often-overlooked marine animals.</p>

          <p>A same-sex pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are successfully raising a chick at Chester Zoo in the UK. The chick is one of ten that hatched at the zoo this year, a significant event for the species, which is listed as vulnerable to extinction. Zoo experts distributed the eggs among different nesting pairs to increase the chances of survival, entrusting one to the first-time foster parents. The successful co-parenting highlights the zoo's vital role in the international breeding program for the at-risk penguin species and offers a heartwarming story of animal care.</p>

          <p>Oasis kicked off their highly anticipated reunion tour with a powerful performance in Cardiff, their first in 16 years, dispelling any doubts about their return. The band, led by brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher, tore through classic hits like 'Live Forever' and 'Wonderwall' for a fervent crowd of 70,000. Liam Gallagher's vocals were noted as being particularly strong and passionate, while the brothers' on-stage dynamic, though not overly interactive, culminated in a brief hug. The successful opening night suggests the band is rejuvenated and ready to recapture the energy that defined their 1990s peak.</p>

          <p>The search for children missing from Camp Mystic after flash floods in Texas is facing significant challenges, as names and photos of the unaccounted-for minors begin to surface. Communication has been difficult because the camp prohibits campers from having technology, making it hard to quickly ascertain who is safe. Despite the grim circumstances, there is a sliver of hope, with some reports indicating that successful helicopter rescues of campers have been occurring. The community remains on edge as families await news and extensive rescue operations continue in the flood-ravaged Kerr County area.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in downtown Los Angeles on the Fourth of July to protest the Trump administration's immigration raids and the newly approved federal budget that expands their funding. Protesters marched from City Hall to the Federal Building, expressing fear and anger over the aggressive enforcement actions that have created a climate of fear in immigrant communities. Speakers, including Assemblymember Isaac Bryan, condemned the new spending bill, which allocates billions to agencies like ICE. The rally highlighted ongoing tensions between local California leaders and the federal government over immigration policy.</p>

          <p>Germany started their Women's Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory over Poland, but the win was overshadowed by a potentially serious knee injury to captain Giulia Gwinn. The defender, who has a history of two prior ACL injuries, left the pitch in tears during the first half, casting doubt on her future in the tournament. Goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller in the second half secured the three points for the eight-time champions. While the performance was enough to defeat the tournament debutants, the loss of their captain is a significant blow for the German squad.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will alter policies at America's national parks, including charging higher entry fees for international tourists. The order also mandates that U.S. residents receive preferential treatment in any park lotteries or permitting systems. Revenue from the increased foreign tourist fees will be used for infrastructure improvements. Additionally, the order revokes a 2017 memorandum that promoted diversity and inclusion efforts in the management and storytelling within national parks, aligning with the administration's broader move to end government DEI programs.</p>

          <p>India is increasingly acting as a check on China's influence within Global South-focused alliances like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and BRICS. Because these organizations require consensus for decision-making, India can effectively block initiatives it opposes, highlighting a rivalry for leadership. A recent SCO meeting of defense ministers failed to produce a joint statement due to India's objections over language related to terrorism, a disagreement rooted in ongoing border tensions with China. This dynamic demonstrates India's strategic use of its position to counter Beijing's agenda on the international stage.</p>

          <h2>Investigation into Deadly Texas Floods Highlights Lack of Early Warning Systems</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 17:54:49 EDT</div>

          <p>In the aftermath of severe flooding that killed at least 13 people and left around 20 children missing in Texas, questions are being raised about the region's preparedness. Officials confirmed that the area, which includes numerous summer camps, lacks a modern early warning system for such events, stating that the intensity of the flood was not predicted. The disaster, which saw the Guadalupe River swell rapidly, has been compared to a tragic 1987 flood, with the current event being described as far worse. The focus remains on extensive search and rescue efforts, which are expected to continue through the night.</p>
