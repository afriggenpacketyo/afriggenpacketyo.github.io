          <p>A federal judge in Boston ruled that the Trump administration violated a previous order by deporting eight migrants to a third country without adequate notice or opportunity to object. Homeland Security officials disclosed that the immigrants had been deported on a flight, but refused to reveal their destination initially. Judge Murphy criticized the administration's actions as a clear violation of the court's order and suggested the possibility of criminal contempt charges.

          <p>California public school enrollment has declined for the seventh straight year, while the number of students from low-income and homeless families has increased.
