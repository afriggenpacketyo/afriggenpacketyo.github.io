          <p>Amanda and Nick are searching for other parents whose children have the same rare PPFIBP1 gene mutation as their 11-month-old son, Jack. Jack's condition causes blindness and frequent seizures, and doctors believe he is unlikely to walk or talk, estimating that he may not live past childhood. The couple hopes to connect with other families to better understand the condition and offer support, as there are only 16 known cases worldwide. They are also crowdfunding to renovate their home to make it more comfortable for Jack, as his diagnosis has put a standstill on construction. The family is finding strength in each other while trying to make Jack's life as comfortable as possible, knowing this could be his last Christmas. </p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been returned to the United States to face smuggling charges. The US Supreme Court ordered his return after the government admitted to an "administrative error" in his deportation. Abrego Garcia's lawyer calls the charges "fantastical" and politically motivated, claiming they are based on statements from individuals facing prosecution or already in prison. If convicted, Abrego Garcia will be deported to El Salvador after completing his sentence in the US, further fueling tensions between the Trump administration and the judiciary. </p>

          <p>South Korea's new progressive president, Lee Jae-myung, is expected to take a more cautious approach to Taiwan and prioritize economic ties with China.

Under Yoon, South Korea emphasized its commitment to the US alliance and trilateral cooperation with Washington and Tokyo.

          <p>Manchester United has reported a profit in the third quarter fiscal results of 2025, despite previous concerns about the club's financial stability. This turnaround is attributed to increased revenues across all streams, driven by strong performance in the UEFA Europa League and high demand for hospitality offerings.

Sridhar emphasizes the need for collective responsibility and government policies that prioritize the conditions for good health.

The Dodgers' pitching rotation continues to be affected by injuries, leading to frequent changes and a reliance on minor league players. The team's offense struggled, stranding nine runners and failing to deliver timely hits. The Dodgers' bullpen leads the majors in innings pitched due to the starters' limited appearances. </p>
