          <p>Police investigating the deadly school shooting in Graz, Austria, discovered abandoned plans for a bomb attack at the home of the 21-year-old suspect. Authorities also found a non-functional pipe bomb, a "farewell" letter, and a video during the search of the suspect's residence. The attack at Dreierschützengasse secondary school resulted in ten fatalities and eleven injuries, prompting a nationwide moment of silence and three days of mourning in Austria. The suspect, a former student at the school, committed suicide in a school bathroom after the incident, leaving authorities to investigate his possible motives.</p>

          <p>The annual inflation rate in the U.S. saw a slight increase in May, primarily due to rising grocery prices offsetting lower gasoline costs. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to 2.4% over the past 12 months, a marginal increase from April's 2.3%. Economists suggest that President Trump's tariff policies are expected to exert more noticeable upward pressure on consumer prices in the coming months. While gasoline prices decreased due to global economic concerns, grocery prices saw an uptick, causing some concern among economists (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is facing criticism from President Trump and his allies, but his recent address addressing the nation will likely improve his standing among Democrats. Newsom denounced Trump's deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles, positioning himself as a leader of the anti-Trump movement. His actions are seen as a strong response to the administration's policies on immigration and law enforcement, and he has dared the Trump administration to arrest him. The conflict may help Newsom enhance his position among party members and potential 2028 voters.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to phase out the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) after the current hurricane season, intending to shift disaster response responsibilities to the states. Critics worry that this move, coupled with staff reductions at FEMA, could leave states unprepared for major disasters. While some experts believe states should bear more financial responsibility for catastrophes, they caution that abruptly ending FEMA without adequate state support could create an uneven landscape of disaster preparedness. The decision raises concerns about the ability of poorer states to effectively respond to disasters and the potential for a slower, more chaotic recovery process.</p>

          <p>Meta has launched a new AI "world model" designed to enhance the understanding of 3D environments and physical object movements. The open-source AI model, V-JEPA 2, can understand, predict, and plan in the physical world, drawing inspiration from real-world logic to create an internal simulation of reality. This model can recognize that a ball rolling off a table will fall or that an object hidden from view still exists. This is part of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's broader strategy to focus on artificial intelligence amid competition from other tech giants.</p>

          <p>U.S. inflation saw a slight increase, with prices rising 2.4% in May compared to the previous year, but the impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumers remains muted. While prices for toys, car parts, and major appliances increased, declines in petrol, airfares, and clothing offset these rises. Economists anticipate that the tariffs will eventually lead to higher costs for companies and households, but the current report indicates a limited immediate impact. The consumer price report suggests that the tariff impact remains relatively limited for now (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Chinese analysts are closely monitoring the unrest in Los Angeles, viewing President Trump's response as a politically motivated gamble that jeopardizes public safety and stability. One commentator suggested that Trump's tactics could escalate into a constitutional crisis. The remarks follow protests in Los Angeles over immigration raids, which led to curfews and the deployment of National Guard troops and Marines. Shi Yinhong, a professor at Beijing’s Renmin University, stated that Trump's deployment of troops made his “despotic nature” much clearer to Americans and added nothing to his domestic prestige.</p>

          <p>ICE raids in Los Angeles sparked protests, prompting President Trump to deploy the National Guard and Marines, leading to clashes with local and state leaders. The decision has ignited a war of words between Trump and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Governor Gavin Newsom, who allege the president is abusing his power. The protests, centered in downtown L.A., have involved both peaceful marches and violent confrontations, with law enforcement using less-lethal projectiles and tear gas, and protesters responding with rocks and Molotov cocktails. The conflict has escalated as demonstrations spread to other cities and legal challenges are mounted against the Trump administration.</p>
