          <p>The English government is proposing a new law to ban the sale of energy drinks to anyone under 16, encompassing retail, online, and vending channels. This initiative responds to widespread concerns from parents and teachers regarding the adverse effects on children's health, concentration, and academic performance. Many popular energy drinks contain caffeine levels equivalent to multiple cups of coffee, linked to issues like headaches, sleep disturbances, and rapid heart rates, with rare cases of death. Sugary versions also contribute to obesity and dental damage, according to dieticians. A 12-week consultation period is underway to gather feedback from health experts, educators, the public, and industry stakeholders before the ban's implementation, aiming to significantly improve children's overall well-being.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump publicly accused Chinese President Xi Jinping of "conspiring against" the United States, following Xi's appearance alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at China's largest-ever military parade. The event commemorated the 80th anniversary of Japan's World War II surrender, where Xi emphasized China's national strength and independence. Trump also used his social media platform to call on Xi to acknowledge the substantial U.S. support and sacrifices made for China's freedom during the war. Putin's top aide swiftly dismissed Trump's conspiracy allegations, while the high-profile gathering has amplified Ukrainian and Western concerns regarding the three nations' increasing collaboration, particularly in bolstering Moscow's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.</p>

          <p>South Korea has selected German-born Jens Castrop for its national football team, signaling a new era for the country, which previously lacked naturalized players at the World Cup. Castrop, who represented Germany at youth levels and made his Bundesliga debut, is set to make his senior international debut against the United States. This move is widely supported by Korean fans and media, largely due to his undeniable talent and his Korean mother's strong emphasis on his heritage and passion for the country. His selection also brings the sensitive issue of South Korea's mandatory military service into focus, with Castrop expressing full awareness and a willingness to fulfill his obligations. This precedent could encourage more foreign-born players of Korean descent to join the national team, potentially boosting its global standing in various sports.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin publicly thanked North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for his country's support in the Ukraine war, specifically mentioning North Korean special forces fighting "courageously and heroically" with Russian forces in the Kursk region. This acknowledgment occurred during bilateral talks in Beijing, immediately following their attendance at a Chinese military parade. South Korea estimates that North Korea has sent approximately 15,000 troops and significant military equipment, including ballistic missiles and artillery, to aid Russia, with about 2,000 North Korean soldiers reportedly killed in action. Kim affirmed his commitment to assisting Russia as a "fraternal duty," underscoring the significantly strengthened strategic partnership between Pyongyang and Moscow since their pact last year.</p>

          <p>Watches of Switzerland Group saw its shares jump over 8% following a positive trading update and a stock upgrade by Deutsche Bank. The company confirmed it is on track to deliver first-half results in line with its expectations, successfully shrugging off the impact of new U.S. tariffs on Swiss imports. It reported consistently strong trading, particularly within the U.S. market, and anticipates no material impact from the 39% tariff in H1 FY26 due to brand partners having increased inventories. Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock to "buy," asserting that the downside risk to earnings from US import tariffs is much more contained than market sentiment reflects. This positive momentum for the company contrasted with broader European market declines driven by fiscal outlook concerns and rising bond yields. (not investment advice)</p>

Putin initiated the meeting by commending North Korean soldiers for their "bravery and heroism" in fighting alongside Russian troops in Ukraine, specifically mentioning their role in defending Russia's Kursk border region. South Korea estimates that North Korea has supplied Russia with 15,000 troops and military equipment, including ballistic missiles. Kim stated that cooperation with Russia has "significantly strengthened" since their strategic partnership was signed last June, pledging to provide further assistance as a "fraternal duty."</p>

          <p>In a landmark antitrust case, a U.S. judge ruled that Google is a monopolist in online search but opted against forcing a company breakup, a scenario that had loomed large. Judge Amit Mehta decided not to compel Google to spin off its Chrome browser or impose court oversight on its Android operating system, which were proposals from government lawyers. However, the ruling does mandate Google to share certain search index data with "qualified competitors" and prohibits exclusive contracts for preloading its search engine, giving partners more leverage.

The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with immigrant rights lawyers, stating the law was not intended for peacetime immigration enforcement against gangs. The Trump administration had argued courts couldn't second-guess the president's determination of danger. This 2-1 ruling, which can be appealed to the Supreme Court, found no "invasion or predatory incursion" to justify using a statute previously invoked only during declared wars, thus upholding a preliminary injunction sought by the plaintiffs.</p>

          <p>A Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives committee released tens of thousands of pages from the probe into disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, following a subpoena to the Justice Department. While the committee aimed for transparency, Democratic members noted that 97% of the 33,295 pages had already been made public, leading to criticism that the release offered little new information. The documents are being redacted to protect victim identities and remove child sexual abuse material. This partial disclosure has fueled ongoing conspiracy theories and calls for full transparency, particularly from victims and some Trump supporters who believe powerful figures are being shielded from accountability.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of security staff working at the Houses of Parliament in the UK have initiated strike action in a dispute over pay and working conditions. Members of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union are staging walkouts between 07:00 BST and 19:00 on each of the next two Wednesdays and Thursdays, along with an overtime ban and a work-to-rule until September 12. The union cites the employer's removal of six days' annual leave from members' contracts, persistent pay stagnation, and a widening ethnicity pay gap as key grievances, making them "particularly angry." A UK Parliament spokesperson expressed disappointment but affirmed robust contingency plans are in place to ensure safety and prevent disruption to parliamentary business, while committing to continued engagement to resolve the issues.</p>

          <p>Australia's Gross Domestic Product expanded by 1.8% year-over-year in the second quarter, surpassing Reuters' economist forecast of 1.6% and marking the fastest growth since September 2023. Quarter-over-quarter GDP grew 0.6%, also above expectations. Growth was primarily driven by domestic spending, particularly household and government consumption, despite public demand remaining flat. Oxford Economics suggests this might be a "high watermark" for 2025 due to cooling job markets and tapering cost-of-living support. The Reserve Bank of Australia recently cut rates to 3.6%, citing reduced global uncertainty regarding U.S. tariffs and a gradual recovery in private demand. (not investment advice)</p>

Xi's speech emphasized China's resilience against "bullies" and the choice between "peace and war," implicitly criticizing U.S. global policies. The parade featured advanced weaponry and a new cyberspace combat unit, signaling Beijing's intent to deter U.S. support for Taiwan and project an alternative world order.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic secured his spot in the US Open semi-finals, setting up a highly anticipated match against Carlos Alcaraz, after a hard-fought victory over American Taylor Fritz. Despite facing constant pressure, including five break points in the first set and a hostile crowd, Djokovic displayed remarkable resilience to win 6-3, 7-5, 3-6, 6-4. The 38-year-old, aiming for a record 25th Grand Slam title, acknowledged being "lucky" at times, noting Fritz was the better player for significant portions of the match. This win reinforces Djokovic's enduring top-tier performance, as he prepares to face the younger Alcaraz, who eased through his quarter-final.</p>

          <p>Anti-tourist protests are escalating in popular destinations like Mexico City and parts of Europe, driven by local residents' anger over overtourism and its impact on living costs. Demonstrations, such as those in Mexico City's Roma Norte and Barcelona, involve shouting slogans like "Gringos leave," damaging property, and blocking tourist access points. Researchers attribute the rise in protests to tourism returning to pre-pandemic levels and residents' frustration with perceived government inaction. While direct confrontations may temporarily deter some travelers, their long-term effectiveness in changing tourist behavior or policy is debated, often leading to symbolic rather than meaningful reforms.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced that U.S. military forces conducted a kinetic strike in the southern Caribbean against a drug-carrying vessel, resulting in the deaths of 11 "Narcoterrorists." Trump stated the operation targeted members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua in international waters, transporting illegal narcotics bound for the U.S. The strike was ordered by Trump, who has escalated pressure against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and designated several drug-trafficking organizations as terrorist groups. The incident, which Trump described as a warning, follows increased U.S. military deployments in the region and Maduro's vows to resist any U.S. intervention.</p>

Analysts note that her prominent role in diplomatic settings, including meeting the Russian Ambassador, indicates a deliberate grooming for leadership.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that former President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard soldiers and marines to Los Angeles was illegal, dealing a setback to his ambition to act as a "national police chief." The judge found that the administration used armed soldiers and military vehicles for crowd control and traffic blockades, effectively turning them into a "national police force," which violates a 1878 law prohibiting military involvement in civilian law enforcement. The deployment, which occurred amid protests against immigration raids, was condemned by LA Mayor Karen Bass as political theatre. This ruling, though subject to appeal, challenges the President's authority to federalize city policing.</p>

          <p>Fire crews swiftly contained a brush fire that ignited Tuesday evening in the Hollywood Hills, below several homes, preventing any structural damage. The blaze, which started north of West Sunset Boulevard, burned approximately a quarter of an acre of vegetation as it moved uphill, briefly threatening nearby residences. About 80 firefighting personnel, supported by helicopters making crucial water drops, were deployed to the scene, significantly slowing the fire's progress. Within an hour, all active flames were extinguished, and forward progress was stopped, though one car was burned. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass praised the "heroic" and rapid response of first responders, as a heat advisory remains in effect for the region, elevating fire danger compounded by late-summer thunderstorms.</p>
