            <p>Over 100 civilians, including at least 20 children and a medical team, have been killed in a series of attacks on famine-hit camps in Sudan's Darfur region. The attacks, blamed on the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), targeted el Fasher and nearby camps housing over 700,000 displaced people facing famine-like conditions. The UN's humanitarian coordinator expressed grave alarm, while Relief International reported the deaths of nine of its workers, alleging a targeted attack on health infrastructure. The ongoing war between the army and the RSF has created the world's largest humanitarian crisis, forcing millions from their homes. Optimism score: 5</p>

            <p>This article provides a timeline of the investigation into the Long Island serial killings, starting with the disappearance of Shannan Gilbert in May 2010. The search for Gilbert led to the discovery of the bodies of four other women, known as the Gilgo Four, in December 2010. The investigation stalled for years until a new task force was formed in February 2022, leading to the arrest of Rex Heuermann in July 2023, who has been charged with multiple counts of murder. The investigation has since expanded to include other potential victims and locations. Optimism score: 50</p>

            <p>Chinese scientists have created an innovative solution to tackle toxic oil spills by turning moss into an oil-absorbing material that repels water. This cost-effective and environmentally friendly absorbent outperforms conventional bio-based materials in oil absorption capacity. The modified sphagnum moss offers a cheap, efficient, and easily recoverable method for cleaning up dangerous oil spills, which often result from burst pipelines or damage to oil rigs, causing long-term environmental damage and health risks. This development represents a significant step towards sustainable oil spill management. Optimism score: 80</p>

            <p>President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies are causing panic buying and paralysis among US consumers, with many unsure how to react to potential price hikes and shortages. The announcement of fresh tariff policies led to a sharp drop in the S&P 500, while a subsequent pause on some tariffs caused a significant rebound. Despite these changes, many consumers remain worried about the uncertain economic environment, with some attempting to stock up on goods and others delaying purchases.

            <p>Rory McIlroy and Bryson DeChambeau are set for a final-round showdown at the Masters, with McIlroy leading by two strokes. Despite their shared ability to hit the ball prodigious distances, their approaches to winning the Masters are markedly different. McIlroy, focused on blocking out distractions, leads DeChambeau who is energized by the Augusta crowd. Other notable players are in contention, but the final round is being billed as a chance for McIlroy to avenge his US Open collapse from the previous year. Optimism score: 75</p>

            <p>A study suggests that the United States has a significant opportunity to become a key partner for Indonesia in emerging technology and digital infrastructure. Despite Indonesia's close economic ties with China, Washington can play a crucial role by adopting a more ambitious and strategic approach. The study emphasizes Indonesia's growing importance in the US-China rivalry, particularly in shaping critical digital infrastructure and ecosystems. The report notes that Indonesia's policy of strategic autonomy may become unsustainable as the US and China increasingly decouple their economies. Optimism score: 70</p>
