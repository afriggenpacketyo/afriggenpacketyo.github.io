          <p>Luigi Mangione pleaded not guilty in New York federal court to the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was fatally shot in Manhattan. The Justice Department is seeking the death penalty, arguing the killing was ideologically motivated by Mangione's anger toward the health insurance industry, and that the killing required substantial planning. Mangione's lawyers requested the judge to block prosecutors from seeking the death penalty, citing due process violations. The judge warned lawyers to refrain from public commentary that could impede Mangione's right to a fair trial.</p>

          <p>While Silicon Valley touts AI as a solution to curing diseases, experts suggest its role in cancer research is more nuanced. Generative AI can assist scientists by summarizing literature, generating hypotheses, and analyzing data, but it's unlikely to replace human researchers. AI models like AlphaFold are used for protein structure prediction, and some systems can even generate testable hypotheses, but they require high-quality data and human oversight to verify results. Ultimately, AI may improve scientific efficiency by reducing the search space for potential drug candidates, but human expertise remains essential.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk won a legal case to stop some compounding pharmacies from selling knockoff versions of Ozempic and Wegovy, but the ruling won't end all compounding offerings. The FDA can now take action against 503B pharmacies, but 503A pharmacies may exploit a loophole to create non-essential copies of semaglutide. The FDA warns that compounded drugs pose a higher risk to patients than FDA-approved drugs, despite their potential to address drug shortages and high costs.</p>

          <h2>Government Resumes Student Loan Collections; What Payments Can Be Garnished?</h2>

          <p>The U.S. government is resuming collections on defaulted federal student loans, with the power to seize borrowers' federal tax refunds, wages, and Social Security benefits. Social Security recipients can typically see up to 15% of their monthly benefit reduced, while the entire federal tax refund can be seized. The federal government can garnish up to 15% of disposable pay without a court order, and wages of federal workers may be easier to seize. Borrowers can avoid collection activity by taking steps to get out of default and enroll in income-driven repayment plans.</p>

          <p>A federal prosecutor in Washington has contacted The New England Journal of Medicine, questioning potential bias and external influences. The letter, described as “vaguely threatening,” suggests without evidence that the journal is biased against certain views. Similar letters have been sent to at least three other journals by the interim U.S. attorney, Edward Martin Jr., who has been criticized for targeting opponents of the administration.</p>
