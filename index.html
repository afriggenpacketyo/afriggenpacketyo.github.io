          <p>Brentford forward Yoane Wissa has publicly called on the club to honor its promise and allow him to join Newcastle United before the transfer deadline. In a statement, Wissa accused Brentford of changing its position after receiving a reasonable offer, which he claims was guaranteed in writing. The player is reportedly frustrated after two bids from Newcastle were rejected, with Brentford allegedly increasing their asking price from £40m to £65m. This public dispute adds pressure as the transfer window nears its close.</p>

          <p>Thousands of people have participated in "March for Australia" anti-immigration rallies in major cities, events the government condemned for having far-right links. The demonstrations, which saw some clashes with counter-protesters, were attended by opposition politicians and known neo-Nazi figures. The government has strongly criticized the rallies, stating that racism and ethnocentrism have no place in modern Australia and that such movements seek to undermine social cohesion. This comes amid a recent rise in right-wing extremism in the country.</p>

          <p>As Britain experiences hotter summers, the use of home air conditioning is rising, prompting a debate over its consequences. Experts highlight the environmental damage caused by hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants, which are potent greenhouse gases, and the financial burden of high electricity consumption. While air conditioning can improve health and productivity during heatwaves, concerns remain about its contribution to climate change and the potential for poorly maintained units to spread illnesses. The article explores whether more sustainable cooling solutions are needed.</p>

          <p>At the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, China's President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have signaled a move toward de-escalation, vowing to be partners rather than rivals. This meeting marks Modi's first visit to China in seven years, occurring in the context of ongoing border disputes and US trade pressures on both nations. As a sign of improving relations, Modi announced that direct flights between the two countries, suspended since deadly border clashes in 2020, would resume.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has confirmed the death of a baby from whooping cough, the first such fatality in the country this year. The infant's mother had not been vaccinated against the illness during pregnancy, a measure recommended to provide passive immunity to newborns. This tragic event underscores government warnings about declining vaccine uptake for childhood diseases and the rise of vaccine hesitancy. Health officials are urging pregnant women and parents to follow vaccination schedules to prevent further severe cases.</p>

          <p>Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has harshly criticized ongoing protests over economic inequality, labeling some actions as bordering on "treason and terrorism." The country has been shaken by demonstrations that have turned violent, resulting in at least three deaths and the ransacking of the finance minister's home. In response to the unrest, Prabowo announced that parliament would revoke some financial allowances for lawmakers but also ordered security forces to take the "strongest actions" against looters.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all six winning numbers in Saturday night's drawing. This grand prize now ranks as the fifth-largest in the game's history. The next drawing on Monday will give a potential single winner the option of an annuity paid over 30 years or a lump-sum cash value of approximately $498.4 million before taxes. The jackpot has been growing since the last winner was drawn on May 31.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers fell to the Arizona Diamondbacks in a 6-1 loss characterized by uncharacteristic mistakes and a lack of offensive support for pitcher Tyler Glasnow. Despite Glasnow taking a no-hitter into the sixth inning, the Dodgers' offense failed to score, and the team committed costly errors on the bases and in the field. Manager Dave Roberts expressed frustration with the team's lack of focus, calling the performance "unrecognizable" as the team's lead in the National League West was reduced to one game.</p>

          <p>Protesters in cities across Mexico marched to demand justice and government action for the more than 130,000 people who are officially registered as missing. The crisis of enforced disappearances has escalated dramatically since the country's "war on drugs" began in 2007, with both organized crime groups and state security forces implicated. Holding photos of their loved ones, demonstrators urged President Claudia Sheinbaum's government to address what the United Nations has called "a human tragedy of enormous proportions."</p>
