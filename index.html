        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Pfizer, compelling the pharmaceutical giant to lower prices on several prescription medications for Medicaid beneficiaries. This development is a key component of the White House's strategy to link U.S. drug costs to cheaper international rates, a policy President Trump advanced via executive order. Concurrently, the administration plans to introduce "TrumpRX," a new direct-to-consumer website designed to facilitate the purchase of prescription drugs at reduced prices for American citizens. This initiative aims to tackle high healthcare costs, with officials highlighting the president's commitment to leveraging federal power for significant savings. The long-term impact on drug affordability and market dynamics remains to be seen.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its campaign against Harvard University, initiating a debarment process that could render the institution ineligible for federal grant money and new federal contracts. This move, led by the Department of Health and Human Services, is ostensibly in response to allegations of antisemitism and Harvard's purported non-compliance with a federal task force's recommendations. This latest development follows a federal judge's recent decision to block the administration's earlier attempt to freeze over $2.2 billion in Harvard's research funds, ruling it an ideologically motivated attack. Harvard maintains that these actions constitute an unconstitutional "pressure campaign" aimed at influencing its academic autonomy. The ongoing legal and political battle could have substantial financial implications for the university.</p>

          <p>Canadian authorities have successfully identified human remains discovered in a Saskatoon well in 2006 as Alice Spence, a woman born in 1881 who had immigrated from Minnesota in 1913. Known as "The Woman in the Well," this nearly two-decade-old cold case was cracked through advanced investigative genetic genealogy, matching her DNA to descendants. Her remains, found partially dismembered in a barrel with period clothing, indicated suspicious circumstances. Investigators now believe her death occurred between 1916 and 1918, around the time her family's home was destroyed by fire. This breakthrough represents the oldest Canadian investigation resolved with genetic genealogy, underscoring the enduring power of forensic science and persistent police work in bringing closure to historical mysteries.</p>

The bank's proprietary "LLM Suite" integrates leading AI models, continually fed with vast internal data, to empower employees with AI agents, automate back-end processes, and curate client experiences. Chief Analytics Officer Derek Waldron demonstrated the platform's ability to generate an investment banking presentation in seconds, a task previously requiring hours. While the full realization of this potential will take years and significant investment, the bank anticipates enhanced productivity, reduced costs, and a substantial first-mover advantage in the global finance market.

The confrontation happened following Liverpool's 92nd-minute winning goal, when Simeone reacted to what he perceived as continuous insults from the home crowd. Despite regretting his actions and acknowledging that managers should not react in such a manner, he also emphasized the persistent verbal abuse they endure during games. The suspension will prevent Simeone from being on the touchline for his team's upcoming home fixture against Eintracht Frankfurt, while Liverpool was also fined for objects thrown by its fans.</p>

          <p>Scientists have announced a groundbreaking achievement, successfully creating human eggs from adult skin cells in a laboratory, a development poised to transform fertility science. Led by Shoukhrat Mitalipov, the team employed a technique similar to that used for cloning Dolly the sheep, replacing donor egg DNA with that from skin cells. They then induced an unconventional cell division process, producing 82 functional eggs that could be fertilized to form embryos. However, these embryos currently possess genetic abnormalities, preventing healthy development. This technology, known as in vitro gametogenesis (IVG), offers hope for infertile women and same-sex couples, yet it simultaneously ignites significant ethical debates regarding genetic manipulation and consent, requiring careful oversight as research progresses.</p>

          <p>With a potential U.S. government shutdown imminent, national park officials and conservationists are deeply concerned about the Trump administration's possible directive to keep parks open without sufficient staff. This echoes the damaging 2018-19 shutdown, which led to widespread vandalism, environmental degradation, and safety hazards in parks like Joshua Tree. Forty former superintendents have urged Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to close parks if funding lapses, emphasizing that unstaffed parks are unsafe and susceptible to irreversible harm. Given the ongoing wildfire risks in the American West and millions of visitors in the autumn months, leaving parks understaffed could prove disastrous. The situation underscores the significant threat political impasses pose to vital public lands and resources.</p>

A man in his 30s has been arrested in connection with what authorities have classified as a homicide, with no other suspects currently sought. The bodies were reportedly discovered by a day care worker arriving to transport Evan to his center. The O'Connor family was highly respected in their community, known for their advocacy for autistic individuals and their active involvement in establishing a special school and support services.

          <p>Nakia Porter, a California woman, has secured a $17 million settlement from Solano County after a 2020 incident where she was knocked unconscious and arrested by two sheriff’s deputies. The event unfolded when Porter, who is Black, pulled over to switch drivers with her father; deputies quickly arrived, drew their weapons, and forcibly subdued her, as captured by body camera footage. This footage contradicted the deputies' official reports, which allegedly misrepresented her actions and the duration of her unconsciousness. Porter, who was jailed overnight without charges, filed a federal lawsuit alleging unlawful seizure and excessive force. Her attorney emphasized the societal unacceptability of such treatment, noting the profound and lasting impact on Porter and her family.</p>

          <p>The recent Asia Cup finals between India and Pakistan became a stark illustration of escalating political tensions, overshadowing the spirit of cricket. The Indian team's refusal to shake hands with Pakistani players and their subsequent rejection of the winning trophy from Pakistan's interior minister, Mohsin Naqvi, led to a 90-minute delay in the post-match ceremony. Further exacerbating the situation, Indian Prime Minister Modi controversially linked the team's victory to a military operation against Pakistan. This marked a significant departure from historical "cricket diplomacy," where the sport once served as a bridge between the rival nations.

Despite past controversies regarding police access to footage and privacy concerns, Ring has reintroduced a community request tool via Axon Enterprise, allowing users to choose whether to share footage, while Siminoff clarifies Ring does not directly provide police access.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Energy has reportedly issued an internal directive, instructing employees within its Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy to refrain from using specific environmental terms such as "climate change," "decarbonization," "clean energy," and "energy transition." This prohibition, detailed in an email obtained by NPR, applies across all work products, including the department's website and public funding opportunities. Although the Energy Department denies the existence of such a directive, this action is consistent with the Trump administration's broader strategy to curtail information related to climate change and impede federal initiatives in clean energy research. Critics argue this represents a concerted effort to suppress scientific language and undermine environmental policies.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has presented a comprehensive 20-point Gaza peace plan, issuing an ultimatum to Hamas to accept its terms within "three or four days," or risk Israel receiving full U.S. backing for further military action. The proposal outlines a pathway to a Palestinian state, a ceasefire, hostage release, Hamas disarmament, and a transitional civilian administration for Gaza. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly rejected the notion of Palestinian statehood, calling it "national suicide" and vowing to "forcibly resist" any such effort, despite the plan's implicit allowance for it. While many international leaders have lauded Trump's efforts, Hamas is reviewing the proposal, and internal Israeli dissent, including from Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, highlights significant obstacles to its implementation.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 35 national, state, and local unions, including the Federal Unionists Network (FUN), has issued a letter urging Democratic congressional leadership to stand firm against Republican budget demands, even if it precipitates a government shutdown.

This collective stance presents a unique opportunity for Democrats to re-establish their commitment to economic justice and public welfare. The unions explicitly oppose budget cuts, executive overreach, and attacks on science, positioning themselves as advocates for a progressive American future and challenging Congress to support their cause.</p>

This new visa offers foreign graduates opportunities even without a pre-existing job offer, with eligibility criteria such as age and educational background still awaiting detailed release by diplomatic missions.

          <p>The U.S. federal government faces an imminent shutdown as lawmakers have failed to resolve budget differences by the midnight deadline. President Trump and congressional leaders were unable to reach an agreement, with the Vice President attributing the impasse to Democrats' refusal to concede on healthcare-related demands. Should the shutdown proceed, it would be the 21st since 1977, potentially leaving millions of federal employees, including military personnel, working without pay or furloughed. While essential services like air traffic control and Social Security payments would continue, many other government operations, national parks, and federal contractors would be severely impacted. Concerns also loom regarding potential mass firings of federal workers, a drastic escalation from previous shutdowns.</p>

Despite initial threats of a referendum and secession, Dodik's party, SNSD, ultimately conceded, paving the way for an early presidential election.

Childhood friends indicated his fixation on the Mormon faith stemmed from a distressed relationship with a church member during his time in Utah. This incident, one of six mass shootings over the weekend, underscores Michigan's recurring challenge with gun violence.

Netanyahu publicly attempted to mitigate domestic backlash by asserting he "absolutely not" agreed to Palestinian statehood and would "forcibly resist" it.
