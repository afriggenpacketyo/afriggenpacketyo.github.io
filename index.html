          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 08:00:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have developed electronic warfare technology that can create a 'ghost fleet' illusion on enemy radar. The system uses networked 1-bit jammers to mimic multiple warships, potentially deceiving incoming missiles and protecting real naval assets. Developed by the Beijing Research Institute of Telemetry, the technology was detailed in a peer-reviewed paper published in the Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics. This "unprecedented" technology aims to trick enemy missiles into pursuing phantom targets, allowing actual warships to evade radar detection entirely. The system utilizes signals that could deceive even advanced radar systems from a distance, offering a significant tactical advantage in naval warfare.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz has become Germany's new chancellor after a dramatic and unprecedented first-round vote failure, marking the weakest possible start to his leadership. Merz faces the daunting task of addressing economic woes, including stagnating GDP growth and divisions within the country over migration and defense spending. A key element of his plan is a 500 billion euro infrastructure and climate investment fund, but the turmoil surrounding his election has cast doubt on other fiscal policies. Overcoming distrust within the ruling coalition, comprised of the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party, will be crucial for implementing necessary economic reforms.</p>

          <p>Uber's first-quarter earnings exceeded expectations, but revenue fell slightly short, causing shares to drop. The ride-sharing company reported a 14% revenue increase and a net income of $1.78 billion, a significant improvement from the previous year's loss. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi highlighted the company's expansion in autonomous vehicles, noting an annual run-rate of 1.5 million autonomous vehicle trips. Despite a lawsuit from the FTC regarding deceptive billing practices for its Uber One subscription service, Khosrowshahi remains optimistic about the future of autonomous vehicle technology and its potential impact on Uber's business.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India launched airstrikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, claiming they targeted terrorist infrastructure. Pakistan condemned the strikes as an unprovoked act of war, asserting that its military shot down five Indian aircraft in retaliation. The strikes, named "Operation Sindoor" by India, come after weeks of rising tension between the nuclear-armed neighbors over the shootings in Pahalgam, a resort town in Kashmir. This action marks a significant escalation, with strikes reaching mainland Pakistan for the first time in over half a century, raising concerns about further conflict between the two nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arsene Wenger, former Arsenal manager, is proposing a change to the offside rule to favor attacking players. Wenger suggests that a player should only be considered offside if their entire body is beyond the last defender, drawing a parallel to a rule change implemented after the 1990 World Cup to encourage more goals. He argues that the precision of VAR has eliminated the benefit of the doubt for attackers, making the game less exciting. The proposed adjustment aims to restore the advantage to the striker in cases of marginal offside decisions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's escalating tariff threats have normalized significant tariffs, a phenomenon some are calling "10 percent is the new zero." By initially proposing tariffs ranging from 10 to 60 percent on numerous trading partners and later scaling back, Trump has seemingly made existing tariffs more acceptable. This strategy leverages the psychological effect of anchoring, where initial high numbers reset expectations. Despite the apparent acceptance, these tariffs still constitute a major tax increase and a significant change for global trade, potentially impacting small businesses and consumer prices.</p>

President Zelensky has rejected the proposal, citing past instances where Russia used ceasefires to regroup and re-equip. Many Ukrainians believe any ceasefire must include solid guarantees for Ukraine's safety and sovereignty, which are absent from Putin's plan. While some express a desire for even a temporary respite from the fighting, widespread distrust of Russia remains prevalent, with the proposal seen as another attempt by Russia to frame the agenda on its own terms.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing its worst measles outbreak this century, with cases surpassing 1,000 and three deaths reported. The outbreak, which began in a small religious community in West Texas, has spread across multiple states. Declining vaccination rates, fueled by anti-science sentiment and vaccine skepticism, have contributed to the surge in cases. Health officials are urging individuals to ensure they are vaccinated, highlighting the effectiveness of the measles vaccine and the importance of achieving herd immunity.</p>

          <p>Danish firm Orsted has decided to halt the development of its Hornsea 4 offshore wind farm project in the UK, citing rising supply chain costs and increased interest rates. This decision marks a setback for Britain's clean energy goals, as the project would have added 2,400 megawatts of capacity. Orsted plans to retain the project rights and seek to develop it later under more favorable conditions. The British government has expressed its commitment to working with Orsted to revive the project, acknowledging the challenges facing the industry due to global inflation and supply chain constraints.</p>

By removing this gene, HMGB1, from irrigated rice, they were able to develop longer roots and greater drought tolerance, similar to upland rice. This discovery could transform widely cultivated irrigated rice into drought-tolerant varieties, enabling it to thrive in water-scarce environments. The findings, published in Molecular Plant, represent a significant step towards enhancing food security.</p>
