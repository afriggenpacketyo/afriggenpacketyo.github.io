          <p>Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, announced a 53% year-over-year revenue increase to $658.1 million in its first quarterly report as a public company. This growth was driven by a 90% surge in USDC circulation, solidifying its position as the second-largest stablecoin. Despite the strong revenue, the company posted a net loss of $482.1 million, largely due to non-cash charges related to its IPO, including stock-based compensation. Following the announcement, the company's shares saw a significant increase in premarket trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany, often seen as laissez-faire, maintains a set of peculiar and strictly enforced regulations, particularly on Sundays and holidays. For instance, a "Tanzverbot," or dancing ban, is active on Good Friday in most states, with some regions also prohibiting screenings of certain films like "Life of Brian." Other quirky rules include bans on building large sandcastles on certain beaches to prevent erosion, prohibitions on mowing lawns on Sunday to ensure quiet time, and it being a finable offense to run out of fuel on the Autobahn.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared a "public safety emergency" in Washington D.C., deploying 800 National Guard troops and taking federal control of the city's police force. He cited "complete and total lawlessness," pointing to crime and homelessness as justification for the move. However, Mayor Muriel Bowser and crime statistics indicate that violent crime has actually fallen significantly and is at a 30-year low. The action, enabled by a clause in the D.C. Home Rule Act, has been criticized by Democrats as an unprecedented and unjustified power grab.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 25-year study from Northwestern University has explored why some individuals, termed "super agers," maintain exceptional memory performance well into their 80s. Researchers found that these individuals' brains resist the typical thinning of the cortex associated with aging. Some super agers showed a biological resistance to developing Alzheimer's-related proteins, while others showed resilience, maintaining cognitive health despite their presence. The study also noted that super agers tend to have strong social relationships, suggesting that cognitive decline is not an inevitable part of aging.</p>

          <p>Workers and labor advocates in Missouri are expressing devastation after the state's Republican-led legislature repealed a paid sick leave mandate that voters had approved with 58% support.

Workers who campaigned for the original initiative shared personal stories of financial hardship from working while ill or caring for sick family members without pay. The repeal is seen by critics as a move that prioritizes corporate interests over the will of the voters and the health of the workforce.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's decision to federalize the Washington D.C. police force is a political maneuver that deliberately ignores data showing a 30-year low in violent crime. The author contends that this action is a pretext for a show of force, creating a potential for increased police violence and harassment without addressing any real emergency. Civil rights groups are cited, expressing concern that this move undermines local governance and sets a dangerous precedent for federal overreach in other cities. The piece concludes that the move is an "invitation for abuse" and a "call for police lawlessness."</p>

Team management and the coach attribute the early struggles to the time needed for the team to gel, especially in the midfield, and view their recent success as more representative of their true potential.

          <p>India's consumer price index for July showed inflation slowing to 1.55%, marking the ninth straight month of decline and hitting its lowest level since June 2017. The drop was primarily driven by a decrease in food price growth, coming in below analysts' expectations. This easing inflation provides the Reserve Bank of India with potential room to loosen monetary policy and support the economy, especially as it faces trade tensions and tariffs from the United States. The central bank recently held its interest rate at 5.5%, noting a more benign inflation outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As Presidents Trump and Putin prepare to meet in Alaska, this article revisits the history of the territory's sale from Russia to the United States in 1867 for $7.2 million. Initially driven by the fur trade, Russia's presence in Alaska became a financial liability after its defeat in the Crimean War, prompting the sale. At the time, the deal was mocked in the U.S. as "Seward's Folly," a purchase of a frozen wasteland, while some in Russia saw it as a humiliation. The subsequent discoveries of gold and oil transformed Alaska into a resource-rich state, making the acquisition one of history's greatest bargains.</p>

Critics, including presidential candidate Peter Obi, contrasted her swift and severe punishment with the lack of consequences for a popular musician who recently disrupted a flight.

          <h2>Families of Fallen Soldiers in the Sahel Face Neglect and Silence from Military Juntas</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Families of soldiers killed in action in the Sahel region, particularly in Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso, report being left without official information, support, or counsel from their governments. Many learn of their loved ones' deaths through social media rather than official channels. Analysts suggest the ruling military juntas avoid publicizing losses to maintain an image of security and control, which was their justification for seizing power. This lack of transparency creates a "war of narratives" and leaves bereaved families feeling abandoned and struggling with both grief and financial hardship.</p>

          <h2>Mortgage Rates See an Uptick Ahead of Key Inflation Data Release</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 06:00:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Average mortgage rates have risen slightly after a week of decreases, with the 30-year fixed rate climbing to 6.57%. This movement comes as the market anticipates the release of the July Consumer Price Index (CPI), a key indicator of inflation trends. If the report shows an acceleration in inflation, interest rates are likely to remain elevated or continue to rise. Economists do not foresee significant drops in mortgage rates before the end of 2025, with future changes heavily dependent on the Federal Reserve's decisions regarding its benchmark interest rate.

The U.S. regulator had ruled that the terms were merely descriptive of the product's function, a common reason for trademark denial in both jurisdictions for generic-sounding technology terms.</p>

          <p>This opinion column argues against the idea of Democrats "fighting fire with fire" by using partisan gerrymandering to counter Republican efforts in states like Texas. The author asserts that this is a losing strategy, as electoral map engineering currently favors Republicans, and it violates the core democratic principle of voting equality. The piece draws historical parallels, suggesting that using "anti-democratic means" to defend democracy often backfires and does the work of authoritarians. Instead, the author urges Democrats to differentiate themselves by adhering to democratic norms and advancing more attractive policy platforms to win elections fairly.</p>

          <p>Maple, a nine-year-old springer spaniel, is assisting researchers at Michigan State University by sniffing out a deadly disease in honeybee colonies. After retiring from a career detecting human remains for law enforcement, Maple was trained to identify American foulbrood, a bacterial disease that kills bee larvae and can devastate hives. Wearing a custom-made protective bee suit, she can quickly screen hives, a crucial tool for beekeepers and scientists working to combat the decline of pollinators. The project not only aids bee conservation but also gives the high-energy, retired service dog a new sense of purpose.</p>

          <p>This commentary piece serves as a counterpoint to suggestions that Los Angeles should withdraw from hosting the 2028 Olympics, labeling it a "bad idea." The author defends LA28 Chairman Casey Wasserman's recent meeting with President Trump as a necessary act of diplomacy for the good of the city. The article praises Los Angeles's successful history of hosting the Games in 1932 and 1984, both of which were profitable and culturally significant. The author argues that this legacy is too precious to abandon over political disagreements, emphasizing that the focus should remain on the athletes and the celebration.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that California must respond to the Texas GOP's plan to redraw congressional maps for partisan gain by redrawing its own maps. The author contends that while Democrats may prefer to take the moral high ground, allowing Texas to secure more GOP seats uncontested would weaken democracy and render California powerless. The proposal by Governor Gavin Newsom to redraw lines only until the next census is presented as a prudent, "tit-for-tat" strategy necessary to check the Trump administration's power.

          <p>This commentary piece critiques actor Dean Cain, known for playing Superman in a 1990s TV series, for his recent announcement that he is joining U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in an honorary role to boost recruitment. The author argues that Cain is misusing the Superman mythos, which has historically been about protecting the downtrodden and welcoming immigrants, to support an agency engaged in controversial enforcement tactics. The column contrasts the fictional hero's values with the Trump administration's immigration policies, suggesting Cain's actions are a perversion of the character he once portrayed.</p>
