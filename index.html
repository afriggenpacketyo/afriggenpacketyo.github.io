          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle intensified into a Category 3 major hurricane, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic season. Its center is expected to pass east of Bermuda, with swells forecast to reach the East Coast of North Carolina to Atlantic Canada, potentially causing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Despite earlier predictions for a busier season, activity has been quieter than anticipated. The article highlights the storm's current trajectory and its implications for coastal areas.</p>

          <p>Reform UK announced plans to abolish Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) for migrants, requiring them to reapply for visas every five years with tougher criteria, if they win the next election. The party also aims to restrict welfare access to British citizens only, claiming £234bn in savings, a figure disputed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves. This controversial proposal, targeting migrants who arrived after Brexit, would retrospectively affect hundreds of thousands and faces legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Former England rugby international Tom Voyce died after his 4x4 was swept into a river during Storm Darragh, an inquest revealed. He was nearly three times over the drink-drive limit when attempting to cross a flooded ford in Northumberland. The coroner ruled the death accidental, noting that while alcohol impaired his judgment, the illusion of a flat road due to flooding was a significant factor. His family has suggested barriers for similar crossings.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz has urged President Trump to back international efforts to raise the mandatory pilot retirement age to 67, despite opposition from a pilots association citing increased travel risks. Cruz argues the current age of 65 forces experienced pilots into early retirement. The proposal will be considered at an upcoming UN aviation meeting, with support from several countries but strong resistance from the Air Line Pilots Association, which emphasizes safety concerns and cognitive decline with age.</p>

          <p>President Trump eulogized conservative activist Charlie Kirk as a 'great American hero' and 'martyr' at a memorial service attended by tens of thousands in Arizona. Trump's speech, however, diverged from Kirk's widow Erika's message of forgiveness for her husband's alleged killer, with Trump declaring he 'hates' his opponents. The event, filled with Christian music and prayer, underscored Kirk's significant influence in the MAGA movement and highlighted America's deep political divisions following his assassination.</p>
