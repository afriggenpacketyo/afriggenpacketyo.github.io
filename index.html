            <h2>Lina Khan Alleges Meta Used 'Buy-or-Bury' Strategy with Instagram and WhatsApp</h2>

            <p>Former FTC Chair Lina Khan stated that Facebook, now Meta, strategically acquired Instagram and WhatsApp to eliminate competition as smartphone usage surged. Khan argued that Meta resorted to a "buy-or-bury scheme," acquiring rivals it couldn't outcompete or cutting them off from its network. This statement comes as the FTC initiates a trial against Meta, alleging monopolization of the social networking market through the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. The trial could potentially lead to Meta being forced to divest these companies, while Meta maintains its belief that it does not hold a monopoly.</p>

            <p>Nvidia has revealed its intention to mass-produce AI supercomputers within the United States, marking a significant $500 billion investment in U.S. AI infrastructure over the next four years. CEO Jensen Huang emphasized that this move will bolster the company's supply chain resilience and address the increasing demand for AI chips and supercomputers. This decision follows President Trump's previous imposition of tariffs on goods from Taiwan and China, which could have negatively impacted tech companies like Nvidia, although chips were later exempted from these tariffs. The initiative aims to solidify Nvidia's position in the AI sector and strengthen American manufacturing capabilities.</p>

            <p>A growing trend of "coolcations" is emerging as travelers, particularly baby boomers and first-time travelers, are increasingly shunning traditional summer hotspots in Southern Europe in favor of cooler destinations like the Nordic and Baltic countries. Concerns about extreme heat, overcrowding, and high costs are driving this shift, with bookings to Iceland, Estonia, and Scandinavia seeing a significant increase. Travel agencies are also witnessing a shift in bookings to Southern Europe during the shoulder seasons (April-June and September-October) to avoid the intense summer heat. Experts anticipate this trend will continue as climate change intensifies and travel patterns adapt to more temperate climates.</p>

            <p>Antoni Gaudí, the renowned architect behind Barcelona's Sagrada Familia, has been recognized by the Vatican for his "heroic virtues," placing him on the path to sainthood. Pope Francis authorized a decree declaring Gaudí "venerable," a step before beatification, which requires a confirmed miracle attributed to him after his death. The Catholic Church began vetting Gaudí in 2003, recognizing his deep Catholic faith and his belief that the Sagrada Familia's construction was a means to atone for modern world sins. Construction of the basilica is expected to be completed in 2026, more than a century after Gaudí's death.</p>

            <p>President Trump hosted El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele at the White House, amidst ongoing controversy surrounding the deportation of migrants to El Salvador, including to the CECOT mega-prison. The meeting addressed the use of CECOT for housing migrants removed from the U.S. and a legal dispute regarding the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Trump praised Bukele's handling of "bad people" in the prison, while downplaying reported human rights abuses, and officials floated the idea of sending U.S. citizens convicted of violent crimes to the El Salvador prison, raising constitutional concerns.</p>

            <p>A bin strike in Birmingham is set to continue after workers overwhelmingly rejected the city council's latest pay offer, prolonging a month-long standoff. The Unite union deemed the offer "totally inadequate" as it failed to address potential pay cuts for 200 drivers. The dispute centers around the council's decision to remove Waste Recycling and Collection Officer (WRCO) roles, which the union argues will lead to significant annual losses for affected workers. The council declared a major incident due to the accumulation of approximately 17,000 tonnes of rubbish on the city's streets, prompting concerns about public health and an increase in vermin.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariffs are raising the cost of critical imported research supplies for scientific labs in both the United States and China. The tariffs impact a wide range of equipment and materials, including glassware, reagents, spectrometers, and DNA sequencers. Experts suggest that U.S. labs are likely to be hit harder initially, as the tariffs could significantly increase the cost of essential lab infrastructure. The situation raises concerns about the impact on scientific research and development in both countries.</p>

            <p>Military planners have been deployed to Birmingham to provide logistical support in addressing the ongoing bin strike, which has resulted in thousands of tonnes of uncollected rubbish accumulating on the city's streets. The city council has declared a major incident and sought assistance from neighboring authorities, while the government has appealed to the Army for support. Striking workers are voting on a "partial deal" to end the strike, but details of the offer remain unclear. The authority is facing criticism for proceeding with plans to switch to fortnightly collections amidst the unresolved strike.</p>

            <p>OPEC has reduced its oil demand forecast for 2025 and 2026, citing the impact of President Trump's tariffs on global economic growth. The cartel now anticipates a lower growth in crude demand and has also lowered its global economic growth forecasts. The trade-related dynamics introduced by Trump's tariffs have increased uncertainty in the short-term global economic outlook. Meanwhile, key members of the OPEC+ group have agreed to accelerate oil production, adding further pressure on prices. (not investment advice)</p>

The U.S. interest in Greenland dates back to the 1860s, with the country playing a crucial role during World War II. Trump's administration cites national security and access to untapped minerals as reasons for acquiring Greenland, but political scientists question the need for such an aggressive approach given the existing U.S. military presence.</p>

He urged Congress to reduce the federal deficit and called for the U.S. to discourage conflict and inefficient policy on the global stage.

            <p>In a volatile market where traditional "flight to safety" approaches are failing, experts suggest a bond ladder strategy to secure income from treasury bonds without worrying about short-term swings. The bond ladder involves investing in a wide range of treasury maturities, holding them until maturity, and receiving regular income through principal and interest. The LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) brings this approach into an ETF, investing in treasuries with a fixed monthly income distribution through 2035. This strategy offers exposure to treasury bonds while mitigating the impact of market fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

Embracing imperfection and seeking community support are valuable lessons learned through disability, enabling disabled parents to approach caregiving with flexibility and compassion. While all parents face challenges, disabled parents can draw on their experiences to create a more creative and supportive parenting approach.</p>

The government intervened after the Chinese owners, Jingye, intended to cancel orders and shut down primary steel making. While Jingye retains ownership, the government has emergency powers to order materials, direct the workforce, and secure assets, but long term public ownership is the likely outcome given current conditions.</p>
