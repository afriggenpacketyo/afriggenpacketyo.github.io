          <p>A new legislative proposal from the Trump administration would increase the investment tax credit for semiconductor manufacturers to 35% from the current 25%. This measure aims to incentivize companies like Intel and TSMC to expand advanced chip manufacturing within the United States, building on the 2022 CHIPS Act. The move reflects the administration's strategy of using financial incentives and the threat of tariffs to onshore critical technology supply chains and reduce reliance on Asia. This is part of a broader policy bill that still needs to pass the House. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A review has determined that the major power outage at London's Heathrow Airport in March was most likely caused by moisture entering an electrical component at a nearby substation. This led to a short circuit, which ignited oil and resulted in a fire, disrupting power for nearly 67,000 customers. The incident forced the airport to close for a day, causing widespread flight cancellations and affecting around 270,000 travelers. The report provides clarity on the technical failure behind the significant travel disruption.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing diplomatic engagements, the relationship between the European Union and China is fundamentally strained, according to a senior EU official. Key divisions persist over significant economic imbalances and China's continued support for Russia's war in Ukraine. The official noted that while Beijing attempts to portray the relationship as problem-free, Brussels is focused on rebalancing the dynamic to protect its own interests, suggesting that a true reset between the two powers has not occurred.</p>

The company's steady performance contrasts with mixed results from rivals like Nio and Li Auto, as an intense price war puts pressure on all automakers, including Tesla. The aggressive, low-price competition in China's EV sector has become so pronounced that it has drawn criticism from the government for being disorderly. (not investment advice)</p>
