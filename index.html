          <p>CBS has announced that "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" will end its run in May 2026, marking the conclusion of the current broadcast season. The network stated the decision is purely financial and not a reflection of the show's performance or content, also confirming the retirement of "The Late Show" franchise itself. Stephen Colbert, who broke the news to his audience during a taping, expressed his gratitude to CBS and the viewers who have supported the program. Paramount, the parent company of CBS, reiterated that the cancellation is a business move amid a challenging late-night television landscape.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed the Genius Act, a significant piece of bipartisan legislation aimed at regulating the $250 billion stablecoin market. The bill, which now heads to the President's desk, establishes a legal framework and consumer protections for these dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. Proponents argue this will foster innovation in digital payments, making transactions faster and cheaper, while also strengthening national security. Major financial institutions like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase are already exploring issuing their own stablecoins, anticipating the new regulatory clarity will open the market to wider adoption.

          <h2>Japan's Core Inflation Rate Eases in June, Aligning with Economic Forecasts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 19:38:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, decreased to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high and aligning with economists' expectations. The cooling inflation is attributed to easing food price increases, providing some relief amid concerns over economic growth due to potential U.S. tariffs. Despite the headline rate remaining above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months, analysts do not anticipate an interest rate hike soon. They believe the central bank is focused on underlying inflation expectations, which are still below the target threshold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several Democratic members of Congress are reported to have used thousands of dollars in campaign funds to travel to El Salvador, where they advocated for the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an alleged MS-13 gang member who had been deported.

The lawmakers traveled to pressure the Trump administration regarding Abrego Garcia, who has since returned to the U.S. and faces charges of human smuggling and conspiracy.</p>

The PCA cites research showing that 83% of players have concerns about their physical well-being under the current demanding schedule. The association supports a conference-based model or a traditional divisional structure, as long as the number of matches is reduced to address these player concerns.</p>

The controversy has been fueled by the administration's assertion that no "client list" exists and that Epstein's death was a suicide.

          <p>The White House has announced that President Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after noticing mild swelling in his legs. CVI is a common circulatory condition, especially in adults over 70, where damaged valves in leg veins hinder blood return to the heart, causing blood to pool. Symptoms can include varicose veins, leg swelling, and discomfort, though the president's physician described his condition as "benign." Treatment is typically non-surgical and focuses on managing symptoms through compression stockings, leg elevation, and exercise like walking to help muscles pump blood.</p>

          <p>The Florida Supreme Court has rejected a challenge to the state's congressional map, a decision that upholds a redistricting plan critics argue weakens the influence of Black voters. The legal battle centered on Governor Ron DeSantis's move to dismantle a North Florida district where Black voters consistently elected their candidate of choice. In its ruling, the court's majority stated that while the new map diminishes minority voting power, the challengers failed to prove a legally compliant, non-diminishing district could be drawn without race being the predominant factor. This outcome is a significant victory for Republicans.</p>

          <p>Nine-time NBA All-Star Damian Lillard is reportedly finalizing a three-year, $42 million contract to return to the Portland Trail Blazers, the team where he played his first 11 seasons.

Lillard, who was waived by the Milwaukee Bucks earlier this month, is expected to miss the upcoming season while recovering from Achilles tendon surgery. Despite interest from other teams, he chose to rejoin the Trail Blazers, where his family resides, solidifying a core that now includes several key players and assets.</p>

The controversy arose from a BBC interview where she reiterated views from a 2023 letter, for which she was previously suspended, distinguishing between racism based on skin color and other forms of prejudice. In a statement, Abbott claimed her comments were "factually correct" and that the Labour leadership wants her out of the party, while party officials condemned her remarks.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court's growing use of its emergency "shadow docket" is drawing criticism for a lack of transparency and reasoning in major rulings. This process allows the Court to make decisions on an accelerated basis without full briefings or oral arguments, often issuing orders with little to no explanation. The Trump administration has frequently and successfully used this channel to get its policies enacted while legal challenges are still pending in lower courts. Legal experts express concern that this practice undermines the judicial process and allows significant policy changes to occur before their legality has been fully determined.</p>

          <p>The issue of fentanyl is likely to be a significant part of the upcoming U.S.-China trade agenda after a long absence, according to analysts. Fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid, is a leading cause of death for young adults in the U.S., elevating it to a major national security and public health concern. Some experts believe that addressing the crisis could serve as a potential area for cooperation that might help ease broader economic tensions between the two nations. The topic's inclusion is seen as a possible "third stage" in negotiations, potentially leveraged in wider bilateral discussions.</p>

The former prison was closed in 1963 due to high operating costs and now generates significant tourism revenue for San Francisco and the National Park Service.

This move is a continuation of CEO Andy Jassy's multi-year cost-cutting initiative, which has seen over 27,000 jobs eliminated since 2022.

          <p>In the first half of 2025, Brazil's exports of rare earth minerals to China tripled compared to the same period last year, reaching $6.7 million. This significant increase coincides with a record high for China's overall rare earth imports and a narrowing trade surplus for Brazil with China. Analysts suggest this shift reflects China's strategy to diversify its access to strategic minerals and is also a ripple effect of the ongoing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. The trend indicates that global supply chains may be rerouting through emerging economies to navigate the trade barriers.</p>

Newsom's controversial proposal is framed as a hardball tactic necessary to compete with Republicans who he says are "playing by a different set of rules." However, the plan faces significant legal and political hurdles, as California voters gave redistricting power to an independent commission over a decade ago. The move has been criticized by good-government groups as an attack on democracy that undermines the fair process California is known for.</p>

This is the second quarter the streaming giant has not released subscriber data, instead emphasizing metrics like revenue and operating margin. Despite the positive results, the company's stock dipped slightly in after-hours trading, likely due to a warning of lower operating margins in the second half of the year.
