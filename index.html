        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FBI conducted searches at former National Security Adviser John Bolton's Maryland residence and his political action committee's office in Washington D.C., confirming these actions were part of a court-authorized classified documents investigation. This development follows a prior criminal inquiry by the Trump administration into Bolton's book, "The Room Where It Happened," which alleged he published classified information, an investigation later closed by the Biden administration. The searches occurred just after President Trump's second inauguration, which also saw Bolton's Secret Service protection revoked amidst threats from Iran. FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on social media, emphasizing that no one is above the law, hinting at the gravity of the ongoing probe.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced his intention to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook if she refuses to resign, citing allegations of mortgage fraud. These accusations, publicly raised by FHFA Director Bill Pulte, have prompted a Department of Justice investigation. Cook, a Biden appointee, has vehemently denied the claims, stating she will not be bullied into stepping down from her position. This potential removal could allow Trump to appoint a replacement, significantly altering the central bank's governing board and potentially aligning its monetary policy more closely with his preferences, as Cook has consistently supported Fed Chair Jerome Powell's decisions.

          <p>Troubled fashion brand Revolution Beauty is reinstating its co-founders, Adam Minto and Tom Allsworth, to "reset" the business after failing to secure a buyer. The cosmetics company announced it was no longer seeking a sale due to a lack of suitable offers, despite previous interest from Frasers Group. Minto and Allsworth had resigned earlier following accounting issues, with Minto settling claims by paying nearly £3 million to the company. Their return is part of a "new and refreshed strategy" to restore long-term profitability, including expected cost savings and staff reductions, following a significant 25.5% drop in sales and a pre-tax loss.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones publicly blamed two-time All-Pro defensive end Micah Parsons' agent, David Mulugheta, for the ongoing impasse in contract negotiations. Jones claimed the team had reached an agreement on terms, amount, and guarantees directly with Parsons, only for the agent to instruct them to "stick it up our a--." Parsons, entering the final season of his rookie contract, is reportedly seeking a new deal averaging $40 million, with Jones asserting his offer would have made him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL. Despite this public fallout and Parsons' prior trade request, first-year coach Brian Schottenheimer expressed optimism that Parsons would be on the field for the season opener.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah militia has rejected calls for disarmament, warning of a potential "civil war" if the government attempts to enforce a state monopoly on weapons. This stance comes despite an agreement between Palestinian factions and the Lebanese army to consolidate arms, and UN resolutions advocating for Hezbollah's disarmament. Hezbollah leader Naim Kassem stated that disarmament serves US and Israeli interests and would expose Lebanon to a serious crisis, prompting Prime Minister Nawaf Salam to condemn threats of civil war. The militia, which has lost influence since its conflict with Israel and the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, views its weapons as crucial for political survival and defense against Israeli threats.</p>

          <p>Lyle Menendez is set to appear before California's parole board, a day after his brother Erik was denied a recommendation for release. The brothers were convicted in 1995 for the 1989 murders of their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, and initially sentenced to life without parole, a sentence later reduced to 50 years to life. They consistently claim the killings were in self-defense, citing years of alleged parental sexual assault and abuse. However, Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman opposes their release, arguing they have not taken full responsibility. Erik's parole was denied primarily due to a history of prison policy violations, including inappropriate behavior and illicit phone use, rather than the original crime itself.</p>

The victim was identified as a shipbuilder by HII, the parent company. Police reported that a suspect is now in custody, with multiple agencies responding to secure the scene and urging the public to stay away. This tragic event prompted a "shelter in place" directive for all personnel at the shipyard, which is the largest manufacturing employer in Mississippi and has been building U.S. Navy and Coast Guard vessels for 85 years.

The Institute of Customer Service reported a significant 20% rise in customer hostility over the last six months, leading 37% of customer service professionals to consider leaving their jobs due to aggressive behavior. While the Crime and Policing Bill currently proposes a specific offense for retail workers, prominent CEOs from various sectors argue for broader legal protections to deter such incidents across all public-facing roles, including transport and hospitality. They emphasize that stronger legal measures are essential, as existing laws only consider these assaults an aggravating factor.</p>

The Trump administration's reversal of US sanctions on violent Israeli settlers and the Palestinian Authority's impending financial collapse further contribute to a volatile environment, raising fears of a broader conflict closer to Israeli population centers.</p>

          <p>In 2025, an unusual trend has emerged in wage growth, with "job stayers" experiencing faster annual increases than "job switchers" for six consecutive months. This reversal, where workers are opting to "job hug" rather than seek new employment for higher salaries, historically indicates an underlying weakness in the labor market, previously observed around the Great Recession and the dot-com bust. Economists attribute this to a decline in workers' bargaining power, fewer job openings, and a sharply reduced quits rate. While overall labor market data still appears robust, the rising long-term unemployment rate suggests a challenging environment for individuals seeking new opportunities or improved wages.

          <p>Actor Noel Clarke has lost his libel case against The Guardian, which had published a series of articles in 2021 detailing allegations of sexual misconduct against him. The High Court judge dismissed Clarke's claim, ruling that The Guardian successfully defended its stories on the grounds of truth and public interest. The judge explicitly found Clarke to be "not a credible or reliable witness" and rejected his assertion of an "unlawful conspiracy," noting that over 20 women provided testimony against him. The Guardian's editor welcomed the decision as a "deserved victory for those women who suffered" and a landmark for investigative journalism, hoping it empowers other victims to come forward.</p>

A significant concern is the insufficient nighttime cooling, which impedes the body's recovery from daytime highs and heightens wildfire risks.

In response to these market conditions, Deere announced 238 layoffs across its Illinois and Iowa factories, adding to thousands cut over the past year. Despite these immediate challenges, company executives express optimism for future growth, citing positive tailwinds from trade deals and tax policy, supported by a planned $20 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing over the next decade.

Venezuela possesses the world's largest proven crude oil reserves, estimated at 303 billion barrels, representing 17% of global reserves, primarily located in the Orinoco Belt. However, its oil production has been severely limited by US sanctions imposed since 2019 on Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), the state oil company. Despite these restrictions, Reuters reported a 15% year-on-year increase in PDVSA's crude oil and fuel exports in 2024. The geopolitical tensions, underscored by the US naval presence, could further impact global oil dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

Researchers found that approximately 70% of relocated birds survived, forming breeding pairs and producing offspring with stronger survival rates, significantly boosting the population's numbers and genetic diversity. This success demonstrates the potential of translocation combined with habitat management, offering hope for other imperiled species and contributing to the woodpecker's reclassification from endangered to threatened.</p>
