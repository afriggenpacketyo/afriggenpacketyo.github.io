        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's value soared to a new record, briefly exceeding $118,000, driven by the largest single-day inflow into bitcoin ETFs this year, totaling $1.18 billion. The rally was also supported by a broader tech stock surge and speculation about future dovish Federal Reserve policies. This price movement triggered over $550 million in short liquidations, further fueling the upward trend. Analysts suggest that while institutional interest remains strong, the market's short-term trajectory could be influenced by macroeconomic factors and the Fed's upcoming decisions.

          <p>Officials in Pennsylvania have confirmed that the state is experiencing intermittent outages of its 911 emergency call system. The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency acknowledged the issue on social media, advising residents to call 911 only for true emergencies and not for testing the system's functionality. The Philadelphia Police Department described the outage as "intermittent," noting that some calls are still connecting successfully. For instances where 911 is unreachable, residents are urged to contact their local police districts directly.</p>

          <h2>Former Superman Actor Dean Cain Criticizes New Film's Immigrant Analogy as 'Woke'</h2>

          <p>Dean Cain, who played Superman in the 1990s television series, has criticized the new "Superman" film for its portrayal of the hero's story as an immigrant experience. Responding to director James Gunn's comments, Cain questioned "how woke" the character would become, asserting that Superman has always stood for "truth, justice and the American way." While expressing support for legal immigration, Cain argued that linking the iconic character to current political debates on the topic was a mistake by Gunn. The actor believes this political framing might negatively impact the movie's box office performance.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has rejected TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, allowing the case to proceed. The lawsuit alleges that the social media platform intentionally uses manipulative and addictive design features that exploit its younger users for commercial gain. The state's Attorney General, John Formella, praised the decision as a crucial step toward holding TikTok accountable for practices that put children at risk. This case is part of a broader trend of legal actions by states targeting the design and safety policies of tech companies rather than user-generated content.</p>

          <p>Lord Ian Blair, who served as the commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police from 2005 to 2008, has passed away at the age of 72 after a short illness.

Current Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley remembered him as one of the most influential police leaders of recent decades, highlighting his contributions to improving policing and the handling of sexual assault cases. Lord Blair's career was cut short when he was effectively forced to resign by then-mayor Boris Johnson.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated a major reorganization, laying off 1,353 employees, including both civil service and foreign service staff. This move is part of a broader Trump administration plan to reduce the department's domestic workforce by about 15% and consolidate numerous offices. Critics, including Democratic senators, argue that these sweeping cuts could undermine U.S. national security and diplomatic efforts. The administration contends the changes are necessary to streamline a "bloated bureaucracy" and improve efficiency, though the American Foreign Service Association warned the layoffs are "untethered from merit or mission."</p>

Experts note that AI is currently best suited for the repetitive tasks often found in entry-level work, leading to a redefinition of these roles and increasing the demand for AI-related skills.

          <p>In an ongoing legal battle, attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia have asked a federal judge to require the government to provide at least 72 hours' notice before any attempt to deport him. Abrego Garcia, who denies allegations of gang membership, was previously deported to El Salvador in violation of a court order and was later returned to the U.S. to face separate charges. The judge expressed frustration with the government's lack of clarity regarding its plans for Abrego Garcia should he be released on bond. The case highlights the complex and contentious nature of his immigration proceedings.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 14:54:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government recorded an unexpected budget surplus of $27 billion in June, a rare occurrence largely fueled by a significant increase in tariff collections. Customs duties for the month were over 300% higher than the previous year, contributing to a 13% overall rise in government receipts compared to June 2024. Despite this monthly surplus, the fiscal year-to-date deficit stands at $1.34 trillion. Persistently high interest payments on the national debt remain a major fiscal challenge, totaling $84 billion for the month alone. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dozens of women from Syria's Alawite minority are reported to have been kidnapped, with some subjected to physical and psychological abuse. One woman, Nora, recounted being held captive for a month, beaten, and blackmailed for ransom after being abducted because of her Alawite identity. The UN has documented at least six such abductions this spring, and activists are tracking around 40 cases. These incidents are seen as part of a broader targeting of the Alawite community, which has faced persecution since the ousting of former dictator Bashar Assad, who was himself an Alawite.</p>

The article criticizes Gabbard's plan to use AI to scan agency communications for efforts to undermine the administration's agenda, calling it a dangerous overreach. It also condemns Patel's reported use of polygraph tests to identify FBI employees who have spoken negatively about him.

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is facing a grant backlog exceeding one billion dollars, prompting the agency to ask some laid-off staff to return temporarily. Officials attribute the delays to new bureaucratic hurdles implemented by the Trump administration, which have stalled the awarding of funds for critical programs, including services for unaccompanied migrant children and youth homelessness. The department is reportedly considering using contractors and shortening application periods to clear the backlog before the fiscal year ends, a move some officials fear could compromise the grant review process.</p>

          <p>Amid concerns about the future solvency of Social Security, seniors have several options to generate supplemental income. One method is a reverse mortgage, which allows homeowners aged 62 and older to receive monthly payments from their home equity without immediate repayment. Another option is purchasing an annuity, where a lump-sum payment to an insurer guarantees a reliable income stream for life. For more immediate needs, a personal loan can provide a financial buffer, though it involves taking on new debt and interest payments. (not investment advice)</p>

The author observes that contestants seem to be going through the motions of romance without forming deep connections, a phenomenon they term "Situationship Island." This behavior is linked to the generation's anxiety about vulnerability and direct communication, which may have been exacerbated by growing up online and during the pandemic. The popularity of contestants who do show genuine emotion suggests viewers are hungry for the very vulnerability the cast seems to avoid.</p>

Brazil's President Lula da Silva condemned the move as unacceptable interference in the country's sovereign affairs and independent judiciary, vowing a response based on economic reciprocity.
