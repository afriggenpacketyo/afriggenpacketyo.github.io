          <p>Comcast exceeded first-quarter expectations despite losing broadband customers due to increased competition from alternative home internet options. The company's mobile business remained a strong point, with revenue up 16% and the addition of 323,000 lines. Comcast is shifting its focus to growing its mobile business following continued losses in broadband. The company reported 427,000 cable TV customer losses as the traditional bundle continues to decline. Revenue was helped by growth in mobile, streaming platform Peacock, business services, residential broadband, studios, and theme parks.</p>

His decision to leave Japan comes amid a growing trend of scientists returning to China for research opportunities. This shift is partly driven by declining research funding in developed countries and China's growing prominence in fields like chemistry and materials science.</p>

          <p>Germany's economy faces significant challenges, with economists warning that it may grind to a halt due to Trump's tariffs and underlying structural problems. The new German government, expected to take power in May, plans to spur growth through increased spending on defense and infrastructure. However, addressing issues such as burdensome bureaucracy, high corporate tax rates, and soaring energy prices is crucial for long-term relief. The country also faces demographic challenges, including a shrinking workforce and anti-immigrant sentiment, hindering its competitiveness.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Automakers Temper Autonomous Driving Hype</h2>

          <p>At China's largest auto show, carmakers and supply-chain players are adjusting their rhetoric around autonomous driving, now emphasizing "driver assistance" and safety. This shift follows Beijing's promise of closer scrutiny after a fatal crash involving a Xiaomi electric vehicle (EV). Terms like "navigate on autopilot" and "advanced driver assistance" have largely replaced "autonomous driving" at the Shanghai auto show. Executives are also highlighting the importance of safety and responsible use of technology, particularly in the context of assisted-driving systems.</p>
