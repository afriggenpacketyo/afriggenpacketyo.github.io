          <p>Snap's stock experienced a significant drop after the company announced its first-quarter revenue exceeded expectations but refrained from providing guidance for the second quarter due to macroeconomic uncertainties, including potential impacts from President Trump's trade policies. The company reported a net loss of $140 million, an improvement from the previous year, and daily active users increased to 460 million. Snap lowered its full-year adjusted operating expenses and cost guidance for stock-based compensation, while its Snapchat+ subscription service reached 15 million subscribers. The company's CFO, Derek Andersen, noted that some advertisers reported impacts from changes to the de minimis exemption, set to end soon, which allows duty-free shipments under $800 into the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's second nonconsecutive term has been marked by significant policy changes and striking visual moments, as seen in a collection of photographs. Trump began his term with a promise to usher in a golden age for America, heavily relying on executive orders. Among his notable actions are the implementation of a sweeping tariff regime, which has disrupted global trade relationships, and the pursuit of a controversial mass deportation policy. Additionally, he has collaborated with Elon Musk to downsize the federal government, leading to departmental cuts and workforce reductions.</p>

          <p>General Motors is recalling approximately 600,000 full-size trucks and SUVs in the U.S. due to a manufacturing defect that can cause V8 engines to fail without warning, increasing the risk of a crash. The recall affects models including the Cadillac Escalade, Chevrolet Silverado 1500, and GMC Sierra 1500 from 2021 to 2024. Dealers will inspect and repair or replace the engine free of charge, with owner notification letters scheduled to be mailed in June.

          <p>The Mellon Foundation has announced $15 million in emergency funding for state humanities councils across the U.S., offering crucial support after the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) canceled most existing grants. This decision came after a review by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency and redirected funding toward "the President’s priorities," including the National Garden of American Heroes. The Mellon Foundation's funding aims to help preserve humanities programs, especially in rural states lacking robust private philanthropy, and will provide immediate operational support and challenge grants to humanities councils. The NEH also laid off nearly two-thirds of its staff and announced a new grant program called “Celebrate America!,” focusing on the 250th anniversary of American independence.</p>

          <p>Senate Democratic leaders voiced strong criticism of President Trump's first 100 days in office, with Senator Durbin comparing Republican cooperation to the "Silence of the Lambs," citing concerns over Trump's tariff agenda and its impact on commodity prices and the stock market. Senator Booker criticized Trump's involvement with a "meme coin," leading to ethics concerns and demands for investigation, while Senator Klobuchar expressed apprehension about the potential market disruption caused by Trump's tariffs. Democrats are concerned about the economic impact of tariffs and the perception of the U.S. as an unreliable partner.</p>

Other businesses are struggling to find affordable domestic suppliers for essential items and are facing delays as vendors determine how to cover the additional costs.

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order softening some of the automotive tariffs his administration put into place earlier this month. Tariffs of 25% on imported vehicles into the U.S. will continue, but the new measures aim to reduce the overall tariff level on vehicle imports that had resulted from separate levies — such as an additional 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum — "stacking" on top of one another. Under the order, additional 25% tariffs on auto parts that were set to start by May 3 will also still take effect, but vehicles that go through final assembly in the U.S. will be able to qualify for partial reimbursements on those levies for two years.</p>

          <p>Super Micro shares experienced a significant drop after the server maker announced preliminary results for the fiscal third quarter that were lower than analysts' projections. The company cited delayed customer platform decisions and higher inventory reserves for older generation products as reasons for the lowered ranges. The new revenue range implies expansion of 18% growth, down from the 200% growth Super Micro delivered a year ago. The company had previously called for revenue of $5 billion to $6 billion and earnings per share of 46 cents to 62 cents.</p>

          <p>Oddity Tech, a beauty and tech retailer, raised its earnings and profit guidance for fiscal 2025 despite concerns about potential tariff impacts, stating that it has mitigating initiatives and does not anticipate price increases. The company reported strong first-quarter results, exceeding Wall Street's expectations, and expects tariff headwinds to be manageable. Shares of Oddity Tech soared following the announcement, as the company's direct-to-consumer model and limited exposure to China provide advantages in navigating trade-related challenges. The company's finance chief, Lindsay Drucker Mann, stated that the biggest market where they buy from is Europe, and they don't have an outsized exposure to China.</p>

          <p>New York State has agreed to fully fund the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's (MTA) five-year capital plan with $68.4 billion, the largest in its history, to prevent the deterioration of the subway, bus system, and commuter railroads. However, the completion of all projects is uncertain due to potential funding cuts from the Trump administration, which has threatened to withhold funding unless the state ends its congestion pricing program in Manhattan. The plan includes purchasing new trains and buses, modernizing the subway signal system, and improving accessibility for riders with disabilities, aiming to reduce delays and enhance service reliability. The MTA is also planning to install modern fare gates to prevent fare evasion, which cost the agency nearly $800 million last year.</p>

          <p>Bret Stephens discusses the impact of President Trump's tariffs on small businesses through the story of Dane Chapin, a San Diego-area entrepreneur who runs USAopoly, a board game company. Chapin, who voted for Trump in the last election, expresses concern that the tariffs are forcing his company into survival mode, potentially affecting his 80 employees. He explains that manufacturing in China is more affordable due to a highly developed supply chain, and domestic production would significantly increase retail prices, making his games uncompetitive. Chapin also criticizes Trump for making tariff exceptions for big tech companies like Apple but not for smaller American businesses.</p>

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party secured victory in the federal election, marking a political shift attributed to President Trump's territorial threats and tariff policies. Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberals are projected to win more seats than the Conservatives, although it remains uncertain if they will secure an outright majority. The election saw a reversal of previous trends, with the Conservatives' popularity declining in response to Trump's actions. Carney emphasized the need for Canada to assert its sovereignty and diversify its partnerships in response to what he termed as America's betrayal.</p>

          <p>President Trump defended his controversial trade policies in an interview with ABC News, asserting that China "probably will eat those tariffs" and reassuring Americans about the economy. Despite polling suggesting economic anxiety over his trade policies, Trump claimed that prices have decreased since he took office and dismissed concerns about higher costs and stock market volatility. He stated that the tariffs are justified because China has been "ripping us off" and that they "deserve it." Trump's remarks come amid widespread concern among economists that Americans will bear the brunt of the tariffs on goods from China.</p>
