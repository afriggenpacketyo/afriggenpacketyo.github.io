            <p>A federal judge has rebuked Justice Department attorneys for their lack of action in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who is detained in an El Salvador mega-prison after being wrongly deported. The judge ordered government officials to testify under oath to determine if they are complying with court orders to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release. The judge expressed concern that every day Abrego Garcia spends in the prison causes irreparable harm, emphasizing the need for expedited discovery. The Trump administration maintains they are prepared to facilitate Abrego Garcia's presence in the U.S. if he presents himself at a port of entry, but claim they cannot forcibly extract him from El Salvador's custody.</p>

            <p>President Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday to rescind executive actions from Presidents Carter and Clinton that restricted federal office locations. The White House stated that this will allow federal agencies to select office space based on cost-effectiveness, mission suitability, and the needs of the American people. The administrator of the General Services Administration will be responsible for updating federal office space management regulations to conform with the order. The administration claims that by eliminating these previous restrictions, it will be easier to bring federal services to Americans.</p>

            <p>Katy Perry's brief trip to the edge of space aboard Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin rocket has drawn criticism and mockery, with some questioning the purpose and value of space tourism. The article defends Perry, arguing that her willingness to embrace the absurd and sincere, unlike more calculated celebrities, is refreshing. Perry's spaceflight is viewed as an extension of her persona, which has always been characterized by guilelessness and a lack of self-consciousness. The author suggests that Perry's actions, though seemingly frivolous, offer a unique contrast to the carefully managed images of many contemporary pop stars.</p>

            <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Department of Health to work with Congress on modifying a law allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, a change favored by pharmaceutical companies. The order seeks to delay the timeline for price negotiations for small molecule drugs, aligning it with the longer timeframe for biotech drugs. The executive order also aims to lower healthcare costs and follows a national security report on the pharmaceutical industry, potentially leading to sector-specific tariffs. While the order cannot directly change existing legislation, it signals the administration's intent to reshape Medicare's drug price negotiation process.</p>

The piece expresses concern that the escalating tariffs could lead to military conflict, but argues that China will not be the nation the US goes to war with.

The H20 chip was designed to comply with U.S. export restrictions, but the new regulations will affect its sale to China and other destinations.

            <p>Design software maker Figma has confidentially filed for an initial public offering with the SEC. This comes after the company abandoned a $20 billion acquisition deal with Adobe due to regulatory concerns. Figma's software is popular for collaborative design work and was valued at $12.5 billion in a recent tender offer. The IPO market for tech companies has been largely dormant since late 2021, making Figma's move a significant development.</p>

            <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in an antitrust trial, defending the company's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. The FTC alleges that Meta illegally monopolized the social media market by buying these companies to eliminate competition. Zuckerberg argued that the acquisitions were aimed at improving the products and benefiting consumers, not eliminating threats. He also disputed the government's narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, which excludes companies like TikTok and YouTube.</p>

The potential exodus comes as the tax deadline approaches. The Treasury Department claims the number of employees leaving under Trump is similar to the number added under Biden.</p>

            <p>Legal experts are questioning the constitutionality of President Trump's suggestion to send American citizens convicted of violent crimes to foreign prisons. Trump raised the idea during a meeting with El Salvador's president, stating he would have no problem sending "homegrown criminals" to prisons like the CECOT mega-prison. However, legal experts argue that doing so would violate numerous constitutional provisions, including the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. They suggest that any attempt to deport American citizens to foreign prisons would be unconstitutional.</p>

An extension provides an additional six months to file federal income tax returns, allowing taxpayers more time to gather forms and navigate complex situations. The IRS offers various ways to file for an extension, including online payment systems and Form 4868. Even with an extension, taxes owed must still be paid by the original deadline to avoid penalties.</p>

            <p>A proposed California law, named Wyland’s Law, aims to strengthen the process by which courts report restraining orders to the state. This comes after a 10-year-old boy was killed by his father, who was able to purchase a gun despite being under a domestic violence restraining order. The bill would require county courts to keep records proving they submitted the orders and to make those records accessible within one day. The goal is to prevent individuals subject to restraining orders from acquiring firearms before the paperwork is properly filed.</p>
