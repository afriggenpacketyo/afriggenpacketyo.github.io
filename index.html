          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder in the death of her estranged husband, Charles Vallow, in 2019. The prosecution argued that Vallow Daybell and her brother planned the murder to collect life insurance money and marry Chad Daybell, a religious author. Vallow Daybell, representing herself, claimed the death was a tragedy and not a crime, but the jury found her guilty, adding to her existing life sentences in Idaho for other murders. She faces another trial for conspiring to murder her niece's ex-husband. Optimism is low due to the violent nature of the case and the lack of remorse from the defendant.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Denver issued a temporary restraining order to prevent the removal of migrants from Colorado under the Alien Enemies Act. The ACLU argued that two Venezuelan men were at risk of being deported to a dangerous prison in El Salvador, where others have already been sent. The judge's order requires 21 days' notice, information about judicial review, and access to an attorney for those subject to deportation. This action follows President Trump's invocation of the Act to detain or deport noncitizens deemed "dangerous," raising concerns about due process.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the US food supply by the end of next year. The FDA aims to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and collaborate with food companies to eliminate six others commonly found in cereals, snacks, and more. While some industry groups express concerns about the timeline, the Consumer Brands Association indicates willingness to cooperate, citing the complexities of navigating differing state laws. The FDA claims the dyes have been linked to health conditions, but scientists caution the evidence is not fully conclusive.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk announced he will scale back his work at the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) starting in May, as Tesla's sales and stock price have declined. Tesla's vehicles have become a symbol of the Trump administration, alienating some consumers. Musk plans to allocate more time to Tesla, but analysts suggest that his political activities have already damaged the brand. Tesla faces increasing competition in the EV market and potential challenges from Chinese tariff retaliation.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk announced he will significantly reduce his time working for Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) starting in May, allocating more time to Tesla. This decision comes as Tesla's first-quarter profits sank, partly due to the impact of President Trump's tariffs. Musk's involvement in DOGE, which included government job cuts, has sparked controversy and a backlash against Tesla. The company's profits fell by 71%, and its share price has plummeted.</p>
