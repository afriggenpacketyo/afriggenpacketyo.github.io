Wipro's AI solutions help clients adjust supplier strategies and manage duty exposure, noting that AI enhances trade policy but isn't a complete solution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite Israel allowing limited humanitarian aid into Gaza after weeks of blockade, aid agencies warn of an impending famine due to insufficient supplies. While hundreds of trucks are ready with food and medicine, distribution is slow due to security clearances and logistical challenges. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency and World Food Programme are struggling to deliver essential supplies amid ongoing conflict and infrastructure damage. The situation is further complicated by fuel shortages and damaged roads, hindering access to the aid already within Gaza.</p>

          <p>The government has delayed the publication of its child poverty strategy, initially expected in the spring, with a spokesperson stating the strategy will be released later this year. The Child Poverty Taskforce, co-chaired by Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, is considering measures such as scrapping the two-child benefit cap. Critics have condemned the delay, while some charities suggest it is better to delay and have a more substantive strategy.

          <p>A growing number of young Japanese workers are 'quiet quitting,' prioritizing work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. A study shows that nearly half of Japanese workers are doing the bare minimum, with those in their 20s being the most likely to admit it. This shift is attributed to a desire for more 'me time,' disillusionment with traditional corporate sacrifices, and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Experts see this trend as a positive change, moving away from the 'karoshi' culture of death by overwork.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the New York Mets in 13 innings, winning 7-5, but faced pitching staff challenges during the game. A rain delay shortened Clayton Kershaw's start, and the bullpen was heavily taxed, with closer Tanner Scott blowing a three-run lead in the ninth inning. Teoscar Hernández's RBI double in the 13th inning ultimately secured the win for the Dodgers. This victory, however, could have future repercussions for an already stretched pitching staff during a tough stretch of the schedule.</p>

          <p>The use of facial recognition technology in the search for escaped inmates in New Orleans has sparked controversy. Authorities used cameras run by Project N.O.L.A., a private organization, to recapture one fugitive, despite a recent pause in automated alerts to officers. Critics argue the use of live facial recognition raises constitutional and privacy issues, calling for a halt to the program. Concerns have been raised about the lack of public awareness and the potential for racial bias.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter as it approached, causing two commercial jets to abort landings at a Washington airport. The incident, which occurred on May 1, raised concerns about air traffic control and coordination.

          <p>Satellite images revealed the mangled state of a North Korean naval destroyer after a failed launch ceremony. The ship appeared twisted and lying on its side, partly submerged in water. Kim Jong Un was reportedly furious over the botched launch, blaming military officials and shipyard operators for carelessness. The dictator has demanded that repairs be completed before the communist Working Party's meeting in June.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, faced a large-scale combined drone and missile attack. The attack occurred after Russia and Ukraine began a major prisoner exchange, swapping hundreds of soldiers and civilians in the first phase of an agreement. The agreement was a moment of cooperation in otherwise failed efforts to reach a ceasefire in the 3-year-old war. The debris of intercepted missiles and drones fell in at least four city districts of the Ukrainian capital early Saturday.</p>

          <p>Boeing will avoid prosecution in a US Justice Department deal over two fatal crashes of 737 Max aircraft that killed 346 people. As part of the deal, Boeing will admit to obstructing federal aviation officials and pay $1.1 billion in fines. Boeing will also have to continue making improvements to its anti-fraud compliance and ethics program. The government said it had conferred with families of crash victims, and said many either supported or did not oppose the deal.</p>

          <p>Investigators are examining whether foggy conditions and technical glitches at a San Diego airport may have played a role in a fatal plane crash. A Cessna 550 crashed into a residential neighborhood, burning cars and destroying at least one home. The airport was experiencing two separate issues at the time of the crash: The Automated Surface Observing Station, which provides weather data to pilots, was "inoperative at the time of the accident due to an unrelated power surge".</p>
