          <p>President Donald Trump announced a "Full and Complete" trade deal with South Korea, setting a 15% tariff on their exports to the U.S., down from a threatened 25%. South Korea will invest $350 billion in U.S. industries like shipbuilding and semiconductors, with $150 billion specifically for shipbuilding cooperation. Additionally, Seoul agreed to purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy products. This agreement, which ensures no U.S. goods are tariffed, follows a similar deal Japan struck with the Trump administration, aiming for mutually beneficial outcomes and strengthened alliance.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic members of Congress has sued the Trump administration, alleging that efforts to limit their access to ICE detention centers violate their oversight responsibilities. The lawsuit claims the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has blocked and delayed visits to facilities housing immigrants awaiting deportation. Lawmakers argue that DHS's new requirement of a week's prior notice for visits, citing presidential authority, impedes their ability to monitor conditions. This legal action comes amidst the administration's intensified crackdown on illegal immigration and increased detainee transfers.</p>

          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered tsunami warnings across the Pacific, including Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, and Japan. While initial alerts caused evacuations and minor flooding in Hawaii, the U.S. and Japan largely saw the risk pass with minimal damage. However, South American Pacific coastlines, including Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador, faced heightened warnings and evacuations due to lingering wave effects. The event underscored the global reach of tsunamis and the importance of rapid warning systems.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing elevated economic uncertainty and inflation remaining above its 2% target. Despite solid labor market conditions and moderate economic growth in the first half of the year, the Fed is cautious about the potential impact of Trump administration tariffs on consumer prices and growth. Two FOMC members dissented, favoring a rate cut, highlighting internal division. The Fed awaits further economic data before considering future rate adjustments, potentially in September.

          <p>The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3% in the second quarter, a notable turnaround from a 0.5% decline in the first quarter. This surge was largely driven by a substantial decrease in imports following the implementation of President Trump's tariffs, which economists note can skew GDP calculations. While the headline figure is strong, underlying demand indicators like "final sales to private domestic purchasers" suggest a weakening trend. Experts predict a slower growth rate for the rest of the year as inflationary pressures rise. (not investment advice)</p>

The Phillies sent top prospects Mick Abel and Eduardo Tait to the Twins for Duran, who has 16 saves this season and is under team control until 2028. This acquisition significantly bolsters Philadelphia's bullpen, aiming to enhance their chances for a World Series run after recent postseason disappointments. Duran's triple-digit fastball and splitter are expected to provide a crucial late-game advantage.</p>

          <p>Despite an 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, one of the strongest ever recorded, the resulting tsunami caused surprisingly little damage outside the immediate epicenter. Experts explain that the tsunami's energy was largely directed into the open Pacific Ocean, dissipating before reaching more populated areas like the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii. Factors like the lower tide during impact and improved deep ocean pressure sensors also contributed to the mitigated effects. This event highlights the importance of location, directionality, and advanced warning systems in tsunami impact.</p>

Although the outage lasted only 20 minutes, it led to a massive backlog, grounding thousands of planes and resulting in over 150 cancellations. Air traffic control firm NATS attributed the issue to a "radar-related" problem quickly resolved by a back-up system, denying cyber-related causes. This incident, the second major outage in two years for NATS, prompted apologies from airlines and calls for an investigation into the "utterly unacceptable" disruption.</p>

          <p>An article explores the debate surrounding the U.S. energy strategy, particularly its pivot towards fossil fuels and nuclear power, while China continues to dominate the renewable energy sector. Supporters of the U.S. approach argue it aims for energy independence and mitigates supply chain vulnerabilities, especially given China's control over critical minerals essential for clean technologies. Critics, however, contend that this strategy prioritizes short-term gains over long-term sustainability and global competitiveness, potentially ceding U.S. leadership in the clean energy transition and jeopardizing climate goals.</p>

          <p>Meta shares climbed over 10% after the company reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings, driven by a 22% year-over-year revenue growth. Advertising revenue surpassed projections, attributed to Meta's artificial intelligence technology improving ad system efficiency. The company also raised its third-quarter sales forecast and increased capital expenditure estimates for AI infrastructure. Despite a $4.53 billion operating loss in its Reality Labs unit, the overall financial performance and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's vision for "personal superintelligence" were well-received by investors.

          <p>Texas Republicans have unveiled a new congressional map designed to secure up to five additional House seats for the party, a move prompted by President Trump. The proposed map, which would give the GOP 30 of Texas's 38 seats based on 2024 election data, has drawn strong condemnation from Democrats who label it "racially discriminatory" and a "brazen power grab." Critics highlight that public hearings were held before the map's release, rendering them pro forma. Democrats anticipate fierce legal challenges, but federal judges in the conservative Fifth Circuit may not resolve the dispute before the 2026 election.</p>

This pressure is aimed at the criminal case against former President Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right ally of Trump, who is accused of planning a coup attempt. Trump's administration alleges a "political witch hunt" against Bolsonaro. Brazil has responded with defiance, with President Lula's support rising.
