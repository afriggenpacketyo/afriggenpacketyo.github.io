          <p>New York City's Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, hosted a lavish three-day wedding celebration at his family's private compound in Uganda, drawing criticism for its opulence and tight security. The event featured masked military guards and a phone-jamming system, which some observers found excessive. The party also coincided with a period of national mourning for a former Supreme Court judge who was the family's neighbor, leading to accusations of insensitivity. The article notes the contrast between Mamdani's socialist political platform and the extravagant nature of the celebration held in a country with a U.S. travel advisory.</p>

          <p>A suspect is in custody after a stabbing incident at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, left eleven people wounded. According to the Grand Traverse County Sheriff, the attack appeared to be random and occurred near the store's checkout area, with the suspect using a standard folding knife. Munson Healthcare confirmed it was treating all eleven victims, with five in serious condition and six in critical condition. Officials, including Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, have commented on the brutal act of violence, and the FBI is assisting local law enforcement with the ongoing investigation into the matter.</p>

          <p>Emma Raducanu was eliminated from the Washington Open after being defeated by Anna Kalinskaya in the semi-final with a score of 6-4, 6-3. Kalinskaya broke Raducanu's serve at a crucial moment to win the first set and maintained her momentum to secure the victory. This loss prevented a highly anticipated finals rematch between Raducanu and Leylah Fernandez, who had faced each other in the 2021 US Open final. Kalinskaya will now advance to face Fernandez in the final, aiming for her first WTA 500 title, after Fernandez won her own marathon semi-final match against Elena Rybakina.</p>

          <p>A new BBC documentary investigates the history of the Jesus Army, a disgraced evangelical movement in the UK formally known as the Jesus Fellowship, which disbanded five years ago amid widespread allegations of abuse. The article details the work of the filmmaker, who interviewed over 80 survivors, revealing a pattern of systemic trauma, including the sexual assault of children and a cover-up by senior leadership. The investigation found that children were often separated from parents, subjected to beatings, and lived in dangerous conditions. The group's founder, Noel Stanton, was accused of being a 'predatory paedophile' in a file containing disclosures of sexual assaults.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight at Denver International Airport was evacuated on the runway Saturday due to a landing gear incident during takeoff. The Boeing 737 MAX 8, bound for Miami, experienced a maintenance issue with a tire that resulted in a fire, which was subsequently extinguished by the fire department. All 173 passengers and six crew members were safely evacuated, some using emergency slides, with one person transported for a minor injury. The incident caused a temporary ground stop and dozens of flight delays, but airport operations have since returned to normal as the FAA investigates.</p>

          <p>A licensed psychologist outlines six recurring behaviors that could be signs of narcissism in an individual, making personal relationships challenging. These behaviors include consistently prioritizing their own needs, subtly pointing out others' flaws to feel superior, and offering criticism before any compliments to maintain control. Other indicators are one-upping others to mask their own insecurities, showing coldness or indifference to others' concerns due to a lack of empathy, and minimizing favors or gifts because of a sense of entitlement. The article suggests that while change is possible, the individual must be willing to seek help, such as therapy.</p>

          <p>A Guess advertisement in Vogue magazine featuring an AI-generated model has ignited controversy over its implications for beauty standards and the modeling industry. Critics argue that using a flawless, digitally created person reinforces unrealistic and narrow ideals of beauty, undermining years of progress toward greater diversity and inclusivity in fashion. While the company behind the AI model claims their work is supplementary, plus-size model Felicity Hayward described the move as "lazy and cheap." The debate raises concerns about the impact on the mental health of consumers and the job security of real models, photographers, and other industry professionals.</p>

Despite its historical significance, the device's existence has been debated by some scholars, and it was even removed from Chinese school curriculums in 2017.

Scientists believe the plastics, which break down from consumer products, enter the body through food, water, and air, potentially contributing to severe health problems. A recent study linked living near nanoplastic-polluted oceans to a higher risk of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Another long-term study is tracking the impact on children, so far connecting plastics to hormonal issues, premature birth, and cognitive abnormalities, prompting calls for stricter regulation.</p>

The show pioneered the "reality sitcom" format by focusing on the mundane and chaotic domestic life of Ozzy, his wife Sharon, and their children, predating shows like "Keeping Up With the Kardashians." Producers noted the show's appeal came from the contrast between the family's rock-star lifestyle and their relatable, everyday struggles.

          <p>As England fans prepare for the tense Euro 2025 final, psychologists explain the physiological reasons behind the intense emotions experienced during high-stakes football matches. The body's stress response, driven by hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, causes physical reactions like a racing heart and jitteriness, which is a normal sign of deep emotional investment. Experts advise fans to manage these feelings by getting adequate rest, having a clear match-day plan, and engaging in physical movement to release adrenaline. They also suggest reframing the anxiety as part of an enjoyable, collective experience that allows for a rare, open expression of emotion.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in several decades, with average temperatures in July running below normal and daytime highs struggling to surpass the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chill to a misplaced high-pressure system, which is sitting farther west than usual, allowing a low-pressure system to keep the region cool and cloudy. This has also increased coastal upwelling, where strong winds bring colder ocean water to the surface, further lowering land temperatures. While some residents are enjoying the temperate weather, experts caution that the Bay Area's hottest months, September and October, are still to come.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to protect pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, which have threatened the existence of several establishments. Under the proposed changes, developers building new properties near existing venues would be required to soundproof the new buildings. The reforms also aim to streamline the process for opening new bars in disused shops and promote outdoor dining and live performances to revitalize struggling town centers. While the government hopes to boost the hospitality industry, critics argue that other tax policies have been the primary cause of its struggles.</p>

          <p>An effort to recall 24 opposition lawmakers in Taiwan has failed, allowing the opposition parties to maintain their controlling majority in the legislature and prolonging the island's political gridlock. The recall campaign was initiated by groups who accused the lawmakers, primarily from the China-friendly KMT party, of undermining national security and obstructing President William Lai's agenda. The opposition has used its majority to block appointments and cut budgets, while China has increased military pressure on the self-governing island. The failure of the recall vote leaves President Lai facing an emboldened opposition for the remainder of his term.</p>

          <p>A BBC News investigation has revealed that a planned major music festival in Wales, named Monmouth Rising, was an elaborate fabrication created by a convicted fraudster named James Kenny. The event promised a lineup including The Killers and Pulp and claimed to be the world's first hydrogen-powered festival, attracting employees and suppliers with false promises of major investors and government backing. However, the investigation found that artist deposits were never paid, licenses were not applied for, and claimed investors had no knowledge of the event. Kenny, operating from his mother's kitchen, left employees unpaid and traders out of pocket.</p>

          <p>Joseph Czuba, the 73-year-old Illinois landlord sentenced to 53 years in prison for murdering a 6-year-old Palestinian-American boy, has died in custody. Czuba was convicted in February of murder, attempted murder, and hate crimes for the October 2023 attack on Wadee Alfayoumi and his mother, Hanan Shaheen. Prosecutors argued that Czuba targeted the family, who were his tenants, because of their Muslim faith and in response to the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war. The brutal attack, in which the boy was stabbed 26 times, drew international condemnation and heightened fears of anti-Muslim violence in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump's extensive use of tariffs and recent trade agreements are facing significant legal challenges that could dismantle his trade policies. A federal appeals court is set to hear arguments in a lawsuit challenging his authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a power he has used broadly. A lower court has already ruled that Trump exceeded his authority, though that decision is on hold pending the appeal. If the courts ultimately rule against him, it could invalidate numerous trade deals and tariffs implemented during his administration. (not investment advice)</p>

Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence for her role in helping Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse underage girls. The exchange occurred amid increasing pressure on Trump to release files related to the Epstein case, given his past association with the disgraced financier.</p>

The 2002 movie, starring Keira Knightley and Parminder Nagra, was a cultural phenomenon credited with inspiring a generation of female football players. Chadha stated that the success of England's Lionesses and the current high profile of women's football make it the right time to revisit the characters.
