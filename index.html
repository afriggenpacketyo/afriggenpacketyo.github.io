          <p>A U.S. Army sergeant allegedly shot and injured five of his co-workers at Fort Stewart, Georgia, using a personal handgun. The suspect, Sgt. Quornelius Radford, was quickly apprehended by fellow soldiers who intervened, an action that officials stated prevented further casualties. All five victims are reported to be in stable condition and are expected to recover from their injuries. The motive for the shooting is currently under investigation, and the suspect is in pretrial confinement.</p>

          <p>The runway at Birmingham Airport was closed for over six hours after a light aircraft experienced landing gear failure, causing its main undercarriage to collapse upon touchdown. The incident involved a Beechcraft plane with two crew members and one passenger, none of whom were seriously injured. The prolonged closure led to significant travel disruptions, with at least 10 flights canceled and over 20 diverted, affecting thousands of passengers. The runway has since reopened, but travelers were advised to check with their airlines for updated flight information.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the termination of approximately $500 million in federal funding for 22 mRNA vaccine development projects. The administration stated that it has determined mRNA technology poses more risks than benefits for certain respiratory viruses and will redirect funds to what it considers safer vaccine platforms. This decision has drawn sharp criticism from leading infectious disease experts, who argue the move is not based on scientific evidence and will leave the country vulnerable to future pandemics.</p>

After Mills was dismissed, last-man Reece Topley hit a four on his first delivery to clinch the victory.

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams, now 45, is continuing her professional comeback, competing in the Cincinnati Open after a recent victory at the Citi Open. Williams attributes her longevity in the sport to her deep love for the game. She has also recently opened up about her long-term health struggles with fibroids, which required major surgery and for which she says she was misdiagnosed for years. Williams is using her return to the spotlight to raise awareness about women's medical issues, emphasizing the importance of proper diagnosis and access to resources.</p>

          <p>The city council of Rancho Palos Verdes has unanimously voted to prohibit new construction across a 715-acre area affected by severe and ongoing landslides. This ban, which makes a previous moratorium permanent, will affect approximately 400 homes and 130 vacant lots, although it permits repairs and replacements of existing homes within their original footprint. City officials cited public safety as the primary reason for the decision, following two years of unprecedented land movement that has fractured homes and disrupted utilities.

          <p>The Library of Congress is facing scrutiny after portions of Article I of the U.S. Constitution were found to be missing from its official website, a change that occurred after President Trump replaced the longtime Librarian of Congress. The omitted sections included limitations on Congress's power, such as the suspension of habeas corpus and the granting of titles of nobility. The Library of Congress has since restored the text, attributing the deletion to a "coding error." However, the timing and the specific nature of the removed clauses have led to public suspicion.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Mexican musician Ricardo Hernández, known as "El Makabelico," for his alleged association with the Cartel del Noreste (CDN). The administration accuses the "narco-rapper" of laundering money for the cartel, which is designated as a foreign terrorist organization, through concerts and events, with a portion of his royalties allegedly going directly to the group. This action is part of a broader U.S. effort targeting Mexican artists whose music, known as "narco-corridos," often explores themes related to cartel life.</p>

          <p>The new series of the BBC's cooking show 'MasterChef' has premiered, featuring hosts Gregg Wallace and John Torode, who were both fired last month following a report that upheld misconduct allegations against them. The BBC decided to air the pre-filmed series to honor the contestants' work, but the move has faced backlash. The new episodes appear to have been edited to reduce the hosts' banter and jokes. Wallace was fired over multiple upheld complaints, including unwelcome physical contact, while Torode faced an upheld complaint for using a racist term.</p>

          <p>The recent resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler has created an important vacancy on the central bank's board, giving President Trump several strategic options for the appointment. The new appointee will serve the remaining few months of the unexpired term, raising the possibility that Trump could nominate a "shadow chair" to serve as an instigator until a permanent successor to Chair Jerome Powell is named. Alternatively, he could appoint his long-term choice for chair now. Trump has stated he has narrowed the choice to four finalists. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced an additional 25% tariff on imports from India, citing the country's continued purchase of Russian oil. This new levy, which brings the total tariff rate to 50%, is set to take effect in three weeks and comes just before a separate tariff was already due to be imposed. The move represents a significant escalation in trade pressure on India and other nations that continue to trade with Russia. New Delhi has condemned the tariffs as "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A litter of four rare Barbary lion cubs has made its public debut at a Czech zoo, representing a hopeful step in a plan to reintroduce the breed to the wild. The subspecies, which once roamed North Africa, has been extinct in the wild since the 1960s due to human activities. The cubs are part of an international endangered species program that coordinates captive breeding to maintain genetic diversity. While a full reintroduction into their native habitat is a distant goal, preliminary talks with Moroccan authorities are underway.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump described talks between his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow as "highly productive," stating that "great progress" was made toward ending the war in Ukraine. The meeting occurred just days before a Trump-imposed deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face significant new sanctions. Following the talks, the White House indicated that President Trump is open to meeting with both President Putin and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. Despite the positive tone, secondary sanctions against Russia's trading partners are still expected to be deployed.</p>
