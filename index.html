          <p>The rapid growth and investment in artificial intelligence have sparked debate about whether the industry is in a bubble. Some experts, like Anneka Treon, believe there is enough capital to fund AI initiatives, while others, such as Jared Bernstein, point to the divergence between investment levels and expected future profits as a sign of a bubble. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink sees the investment as necessary for the U.S. to remain a global leader in AI, and former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger believes the bubble has several years before it ends. The discussion centers on whether current valuations are justified by future earnings and the long-term potential of AI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Angels outfielder Mike Trout testified in a civil trial regarding the death of his teammate Tyler Skaggs, who died of an overdose in 2019. Trout stated that he loved Skaggs like a brother and never saw signs of drug use, and that Kay was good at his job getting players to give interviews. Trout also mentioned that he had seen Kay acting "wired" and sweating and "the first thing that came to mind was drugs." The trial is to determine if the Angels are responsible for Eric Kay, who provided Skaggs with the fentanyl-laced pill that caused his death, with the family seeking $118 million in damages. The testimony highlighted the close bond between teammates and the tragic circumstances surrounding Skaggs' death. The loss led MLB to begin testing for opioids. </p>

Riot police were deployed to prevent protesters from reaching the hotel, where several thousand people had gathered. Justice Minister Jim O'Callaghan condemned the violence, stating there was "no excuse" for the scenes and promising a forceful response from the police. The Irish Times reported that police deployed a water cannon at the scene, marking its first use on the streets in two years.

          <h2>Netflix Shares Decline After Earnings Miss Due to Brazilian Tax Dispute</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 17:07:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix shares fell after the company reported lower-than-expected third-quarter earnings, citing an ongoing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities. Revenue rose 17%, driven by membership gains, pricing adjustments, and increased ad revenue, with the company expecting similar growth in the fourth quarter. While Netflix had its best ad sales quarter ever, the company did not provide specific figures, leading analysts to believe subscription fees will continue to be the primary source of revenue. Netflix is also expanding the reach of "KPop Demon Hunters" with partnerships for consumer products. The company is looking into incremental opportunities related to live experiences, publishing, beauty and lifestyle as well as food and beverages related to the film. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The president-elect of the Oxford Union, George Abaraonye, was ousted after a no-confidence vote following criticism over social media posts that appeared to celebrate the death of Charlie Kirk. Abaraonye disputed the vote, alleging that those campaigning against him had "unsupervised access" to the email account collecting proxy ballots. A subsequent vote of no confidence was brought against the current president. The Oxford Union condemned Abaraonye's remarks after Kirk's death and said complaints filed against him had been forwarded for disciplinary proceedings. The controversy highlights the tension between free speech and the responsibility of holding a leadership position.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has demanded $230 million from the Department of Justice as compensation for criminal investigations conducted after his first term, according to The New York Times. The claims relate to the Russia investigation and the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case, which was dropped after Trump won the 2024 election. Trump suggested he would donate any settlement to the White House. A spokesman for Trump's legal team stated that Trump continues to fight back against Democrat-led witch hunts.

The color pink symbolizes femininity, care, and solidarity. Alfonse says each shoe represents a personality trait similar to her patients, and there's a serious side to her pink passion, a message of strength and survival. Alfonse reminds patients about the importance of mammograms for early detection, and patients look forward to her pink shoe show. Her mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother all had the disease.</p>

          <p>An Arizona boy was barred from trying out for his school's basketball team due to an error on his original birth certificate, which mistakenly identified him as female. Despite securing a corrected birth certificate and a doctor's note, district officials requested additional chromosome analysis. The case highlights the ongoing debate over school athletics and gender identity. The school district stated that it is committed to ensuring fairness and equal opportunity in all athletic programs. The situation underscores the challenges faced by families navigating bureaucratic processes related to gender identity and athletics.</p>

          <p>A 15-hour disruption to Amazon Web Services (AWS) exposed the fragility of a system heavily reliant on a few tech giants. The outage disrupted various online services and underscored the "concentration risk" of building on a handful of cloud providers. Experts say it could compel companies to diversify their cloud services to avoid relying on a single provider. The issue was partially tied to AWS' domain name system, which converts domain names to IP addresses. While the incident was significant, experts do not expect a mass exodus of AWS customers. The event serves as a reminder of the vulnerabilities in the internet's infrastructure.</p>

          <p>La Liga has canceled plans to stage the Villarreal-Barcelona match in Miami due to "uncertainty" caused by critical responses in Spain. The league expressed disappointment, stating that holding an official match abroad would have been a decisive step in its global growth. The decision followed protests from players and complaints from Real Madrid, citing concerns about distorting the competition. UEFA had reluctantly approved the match, along with a Serie A fixture in Australia. The cancellation highlights the challenges of expanding La Liga's reach internationally amid opposition from various stakeholders. </p>

          <p>A study by Schroders found that 90% of working Americans plan to claim Social Security benefits before age 70, despite the financial advantages of delaying. Many workers need the income immediately upon retiring and are concerned about the future of Social Security. A separate study by the Allianz Center for the Future of Retirement found that most Americans don't know much about Social Security or how it fits into their retirement plan. Social Security is facing a financial crunch, with its trust funds projected to become insolvent by 2034. The findings highlight the financial challenges facing retirees and the need for better retirement planning. (not investment advice)</p>
