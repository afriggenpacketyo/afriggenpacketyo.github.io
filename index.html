          <p>Donald Trump announced he will be speaking with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday to discuss ending the war in Ukraine, which he described as a 'bloodbath.' Trump stated he would also speak with NATO members. The Kremlin has confirmed the call between Trump and Putin. These calls follow the first direct peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in years, which resulted in a prisoner swap agreement but no cease-fire, and a recent Russian drone attack that killed nine civilians. </p>

          <p>Romania is holding a high-stakes presidential election between George Simion, a hard-right 'sovereignist' with pro-Russian leanings, and Nicusor Dan, a pro-EU liberal. Simion's victory could trigger a crisis in the European Union, given Romania's strategic importance as the sixth largest EU country and its role in NATO. Simion, who won the first round, has shifted his tone recently but remains anti-Ukrainian, while Dan stands for the rule of law and support for Ukraine. The outcome is difficult to predict, but the election is considered a historic decision for Romania.</p>

          <p>President Trump is seeking a nuclear deal with Iran, aiming to avoid war and potentially reshape regional dynamics, though significant gaps remain between the U.S. and Iranian positions. Trump insists Iran halt uranium enrichment, while Iran maintains its right to enrichment for civilian purposes. Despite these challenges, officials are exploring creative solutions, such as long-term freezes on enrichment under enhanced inspections. The potential deal faces opposition from hard-liners within the Republican Party and requires navigating complex political and economic factors.</p>
