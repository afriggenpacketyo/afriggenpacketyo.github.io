          <p>Residents in the Tokyo metropolitan area are increasingly opposing the construction of large data centers in residential zones due to concerns about electricity shortages, heat generation, and obstruction of natural light. Some projects have been scrapped because of this opposition, leading municipalities to take action, such as Koto Ward requiring earlier construction announcements and clear indications of heat-emitting units. The Japan Data Center Council emphasizes the importance of business owners disclosing information and building trust with affected communities as demand for data handling continues to grow, pushing facilities into residential areas. The clashes highlight the challenges of balancing technological advancement with community well-being and environmental concerns.</p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant surge following Israeli airstrikes against Iran, which heightened investor concerns about potential disruptions to Middle East oil supplies. The attack, described as a "targeted military operation" against Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile program, prompted a strong market reaction, with crude prices posting their largest gains since March 2022. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that Israel acted unilaterally without U.S. support, while former President Trump commented on Iran's failure to secure a nuclear deal, adding further uncertainty to the situation. The situation remains tense as the conflict continues to unfold, with potential implications for global energy markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's retail sales saw a substantial increase in May, marking the fastest growth since December 2023, fueled by trade-in programs and holiday spending. However, industrial output growth slowed slightly, and fixed-asset investment also underperformed expectations, with property investment continuing to decline. Despite these mixed signals, the urban unemployment rate fell to its lowest level since November of the previous year, while new home prices in major cities continued to drop. While consumer sentiment could be dampened by falling property prices, a tariff deal between Beijing and Washington offered temporary relief to exports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Santos, an Australian oil and gas producer, experienced a significant surge after receiving a non-binding takeover offer of $18.72 billion from a consortium led by Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company (ADNOC).

The proposed acquisition would provide the consortium with control over key Australian liquefied natural gas operations and stakes in other significant energy projects.

The government plans to further tighten regulations by prohibiting websites from directing traffic to casino sites, with an analysis revealing that many of these sites are licensed in Curacao and actively accessed from Japan.
