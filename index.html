        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FIFA Club World Cup began with significantly low attendance, raising concerns about the tournament's appeal and potential implications for the upcoming 2026 World Cup. Experts attribute the poor turnout to factors such as inconvenient weekday afternoon scheduling, a lack of marketing by FIFA, and high ticket prices. The empty seats have caused embarrassment for FIFA, suggesting that more realistic ticket pricing and better marketing strategies are necessary for future events in the United States. It is important for FIFA to learn from these early setbacks to ensure the success of the World Cup next year. The large number of empty seats is a bad look for a tournament that FIFA has placed so much importance on, and they will have to make adjustments accordingly. </p>

Kennedy had previously claimed the panel was plagued by conflicts of interest and served as a "rubber stamp" for vaccines, later appointing new members, some with vaccine-skeptical views.

          <p>California state senators Scott Wiener and Jesse Arreguin have introduced legislation to ban law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings during public interactions. The "No Secret Police Act" aims to ensure transparency and accountability, while also protecting officers and the public from impersonators. The bill would require officers to wear identifying information and includes exemptions for SWAT teams and officers wearing medical masks during natural disasters. The proposal comes amid protests in Los Angeles over immigration policies. </p>

          <p>The state and local tax (SALT) deduction remains a contentious issue as Senate Republicans unveil their tax plan for President Trump's spending package. The SALT deduction cap has been a key issue for lawmakers in high-tax states since 2017, with the current law limiting claims to $10,000. Raising the cap is controversial, as benefits would primarily go to higher-income households. Currently, the vast majority of filers use the standard deduction and do not benefit from itemized tax breaks. </p>
