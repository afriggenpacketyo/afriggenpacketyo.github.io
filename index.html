          <p>AMD reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, with overall sales surging by 36%, driven by strong performance in its data center segment, which includes Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs. The company's CEO, Lisa Su, highlighted the increasing demand for AI GPUs as a key growth driver, with AI GPU sales reaching $5 billion in fiscal 2024. While gaming sales declined due to lower console chip revenue, client revenue for laptop and PC chips saw substantial growth, fueled by the release of Zen 5 chips. AMD's forecast for the current quarter remains strong, despite facing $800 million in costs due to U.S. export restrictions on some AI chips.</p>

          <p>Rivian Automotive reported better-than-expected first-quarter results but adjusted its 2025 delivery targets downward and increased its capital spending forecast, citing concerns about the global trade environment and potential impacts from President Trump's tariffs. Despite producing vehicles in the U.S., Rivian acknowledged vulnerability to global economic uncertainties, particularly evolving trade regulations. The company reaffirmed its plan to achieve a modest positive gross profit this year, bolstered by a $1 billion investment from Volkswagen Group as part of their joint venture focused on EV technology.

          <p>Starting Wednesday, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will enforce Real ID requirements, meaning that standard state-issued driver's licenses may no longer be sufficient for boarding flights. While travelers without a Real ID may face additional screening, they will still be allowed to fly if they can provide alternative forms of identification, such as a U.S. passport or a Department of Homeland Security trusted traveler card. The TSA advises travelers without a compliant ID to arrive at least three hours before their domestic flight to allow time for identity verification and additional screening.

          <p>CBS News Confirmed has identified numerous AI-generated accounts across social media platforms impersonating individuals with Down syndrome, often using deepfakes or AI faceswaps to create fake profiles. These accounts exploit hashtags related to Down syndrome to gain followers and monetize content, sometimes directing users to adults-only sites or soliciting donations under false pretenses. Disability advocates express concern that these fake accounts steal their stories, undermine their advocacy efforts, and perpetuate a new form of discrimination. Social media platforms have removed some of the identified accounts but struggle to keep up with the rapid creation of new AI-generated content.</p>

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is facing criticism for awarding up to $500 million to an in-house vaccine research program led by Matthew J. Memoli and Jeffery Taubenberger. Critics argue that the award, dubbed Generation Gold Standard, deviates from the traditional NIH model of funding diverse research strategies and raises concerns about cronyism. The initiative focuses on developing universal vaccines against flu viruses and coronaviruses, using a whole, inactivated virus strategy, which some experts consider outdated. The allocation of such a large sum to a single research initiative has sparked controversy, particularly amid budget cuts and staff reductions at HHS.</p>

          <p>Tesla's sales in Germany and Britain have plummeted to their lowest levels in over two years, reflecting a broader trend of declining demand for the U.S. automaker across Europe. The drop in registrations coincides with growing competition from European and Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers, as well as backlash against President Trump's tariffs and anger toward Elon Musk's support for far-right parties. While deliveries of the newest Model Y have yet to fully roll out, analysts suggest that the decline is more than just a temporary blip and signals deeper issues for Tesla in the European market. Chinese-made EVs, particularly those from BYD, are gaining popularity despite tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration the ability to enforce its policy restricting transgender individuals from serving in the military while legal challenges continue. The decision pauses a lower court order that had previously blocked the ban nationwide, with Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissenting. The policy, stemming from an executive order targeting active-duty and prospective service members with gender dysphoria, cites concerns about military readiness and cohesion. LGBTQ+ advocacy groups have condemned the ruling, arguing that the policy is discriminatory and unrelated to military effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Ross Douthat reviews "Your Friends & Neighbors," a new Apple TV show starring Jon Hamm, which distinguishes itself by portraying the wealthy as unhappy and unfulfilled. The show challenges the typical aspirational or judgmental portrayals of the rich by stripping away the glamour and showcasing the anxieties and insecurities that persist even in hyper-affluent communities. Douthat questions whether this bleak depiction is an accurate reflection of contemporary wealth, suggesting that while money may not buy happiness, it does not automatically lead to misery either. He suggests that viewers should watch both the show as well as "Selling Sunset" to gain a more complete picture of how wealth is experienced in America.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has granted a legal injunction against the Trump administration, temporarily pausing proposed cuts to the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the primary source of federal funding for public libraries. The injunction, issued in response to a lawsuit from 21 states, argues that the administration's attempt to eliminate the IMLS violates the Administrative Procedure Act. The judge emphasized that Congress holds the power to make laws and appropriate funds, while the executive branch is responsible for implementing those laws. The IMLS provides crucial support to small and rural libraries, and the proposed cuts would have significantly impacted their ability to serve patrons.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences sheds light on the use of psychoactive drugs in ancient Peruvian rituals. Researchers analyzed artifacts from ChavÃ­n de HuÃ¡ntar, a prehistoric site in the Andes, and discovered traces of DMT and tobacco on bone tubes believed to be used for inhalation. The findings suggest that the ChavÃ­n people, a predecessor to the Inca civilization, engaged in exclusive, potentially secret gatherings where elite members consumed hallucinogenic substances. These rituals may have played a role in establishing social and political hierarchies within the ChavÃ­n society.</p>

The move, made after consulting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, signals a shift in U.S. policy towards the Palestinian territories and a consolidation of responsibilities within the embassy.
