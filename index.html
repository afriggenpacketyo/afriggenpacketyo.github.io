          <p>California officials denied Erik Menendez parole on Thursday after a nearly 10-hour hearing, mandating a three-year wait until his next review. Menendez, incarcerated since 1989 for the murders of his parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez, claimed the killings were in self-defense following years of alleged sexual assault, physical, and emotional abuse. However, the parole panel cited his "behavior in prison," including multiple policy violations since 2013, as the primary reason for the denial, despite statements of support from family members. Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman opposed parole, asserting that the brothers have never fully accepted responsibility for the horrific crimes. The decision maintains his imprisonment for the foreseeable future.</p>

(TSMC) during a visit to Taiwan, declaring it "one of the greatest companies in the history of humanity" and advising that investing in its stock would be "very smart" (not investment advice). His comments come as the U.S. administration shows interest in acquiring stakes in tech companies receiving CHIPS Act funding, with TSMC promised $6.6 billion for its Arizona fabrication plants. Huang highlighted TSMC's crucial role in producing six new products for Nvidia, including next-generation AI chip platforms, underscoring the deep strategic partnership.

          <p>India and Russia have affirmed their commitment to deepening bilateral trade ties, signaling that U.S. tariff pressure over India's significant Russian oil purchases will not derail their partnership. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar underscored the historical stability of their relationship, announcing plans to boost India's exports of pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and textiles to Russia. This initiative aims to reduce the current $59 billion trade deficit, alongside sending skilled Indian workers to address Russia's labor shortages. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reiterated cooperation in the hydrocarbon sector, emphasizing the strategic partnership's contribution to regional security despite challenging international circumstances and escalating U.S. criticism.</p>

          <p>Major Japanese automakers, including industry giants Toyota and Honda, have explicitly denied that recent price increases in the U.S. are a direct consequence of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Toyota clarified that its July price adjustments were routine annual increases, reflecting various operational cost escalations rather than tariff impacts, despite projecting a substantial 1.4 trillion yen tariff effect for the full year. Honda attributed its ability to avoid passing on tariff costs directly to its high proportion of American-made vehicles, asserting that any price changes are linked to added feature content and enhanced product value. This collective stance contradicts earlier reports suggesting otherwise.</p>

While the recent decline in cocoa futures won't immediately affect prices, analysts suggest a slightly brighter outlook by next Easter, as industrial demand softens and production ramps up, though prices are expected to remain historically elevated.</p>

          <p>Tensions between the U.S. and China are escalating in the space domain, with both nations aggressively pursuing lunar exploration, as China aims to land astronauts on the Moon by the end of the decade. Beijing has recently achieved significant milestones, including successful maiden tests of its Lanyue lunar lander and the Long March-10 carrier rocket, bolstering its ambitious space program. While NASA's Artemis program also targets a U.S. lunar return around 2027, it faces substantial delays, budget problems, and leadership issues. This has led some experts to believe China could potentially achieve a crewed Moon landing first, intensifying the global competition for space dominance.</p>

Field surveys conducted in four maize fields in Hainan, China, revealed that corn plants in densely planted inner rows experienced less herbivore damage, though they also exhibited reduced growth.

This resolution brings closure to a significant legal challenge.</p>

          <p>Thirteen-year-old Julian Her from Northern California made a remarkable catch, landing a 63.7-pound white sea bass in Tomales Bay, which could potentially set a new junior world record. This impressive haul, significantly larger than his previous best catch, has garnered considerable local and media attention. The Her family is currently documenting the trophy fish for verification with the Florida-based International Game Fish Association (IGFA). If accepted, Julian's catch would surpass the existing junior world white sea bass record of 59 pounds, set in 2002, and establish a new junior class record for that fishing line strength.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced an immediate halt to issuing worker visas for commercial truck drivers. This pause is intended to facilitate a comprehensive and thorough review of screening and vetting protocols, aiming to ensure that all drivers meet the highest standards for road safety and national security. Rubio stated that the increasing presence of foreign drivers operating large trucks on U.S. roads endangers American lives and undercuts the livelihoods of American truckers. This policy shift, effective immediately, comes amidst a reported shortage of approximately 60,000 truck drivers in the U.S. and aligns with broader administration efforts to enforce English proficiency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate cooled to 3.1% in July, a decrease from 3.3% the previous month, marking its lowest level since March, largely attributed to easing rice prices. While the figure still exceeded the 3% expected by economists, headline inflation also dropped to 3.1%. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) had recently upgraded its inflation forecasts, projecting core inflation at 2.7% for the 2025 fiscal year. Despite this slight moderation, the 3.1% headline inflation represents the 40th consecutive month above the BOJ's 2% target, prompting some experts to criticize the central bank for being "too little too late" in addressing persistent inflation (not investment advice).</p>

Screenshots revealed photographs of women in various states of undress, often taken while they were asleep, accompanied by sexually explicit and violent comments. This disturbing discovery has ignited concerns about the proliferation of similar groups and the deeply ingrained link between violence and sexuality in cultural discourse. Revenge porn, the sharing of private sexual images without consent, was outlawed in Italy in 2019, and thousands have reported the group to cybercrime police.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom launched a fierce attack on President Trump, accusing him of attempting to "rig the election" and implement authoritarian policies, citing Trump's efforts against mail-in voting and deployment of military forces. Newsom's remarks initiate a campaign for Proposition 50, a ballot measure that seeks to discard the state's independent congressional boundaries in favor of partisan districts. This move could potentially unseat as many as five California Republicans. Newsom frames this partisan redistricting as a necessary counterweight to Trump's perceived threats to American democracy and an effort to neutralize similar partisan gerrymandering in states like Texas.</p>

Operators of the farm diverted natural creek water, cleared substantial vegetation, and constructed illegal trails and campsites in the federally protected wilderness.
