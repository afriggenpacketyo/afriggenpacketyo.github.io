          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 06:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the killing of Charlie Kirk, there is growing concern that the American right is developing a broad-based campaign for repressing the political opposition. Ordinary Americans are reportedly being fired for expressing their opinions about the incident, and prominent right-wing voices are identifying targets. Vice President JD Vance encouraged people to contact employers of those celebrating Kirk's death, and Stephen Miller vowed a federal crackdown on left-wing organizations. Policies under consideration include stripping left-wing organizations of their tax-exempt status and weaponizing anti-corruption laws against them, raising concerns about free expression. The article expresses concern about the potential for political repression.</p>

          <p>A Pennsylvania man, Donald Henson, is being sought by the FBI after he allegedly drove his car into a metal gate at the FBI Building in Pittsburgh. The FBI is treating the incident as an "act of terror," citing the intentional nature of the ramming. Henson allegedly fled the scene after the crash, and authorities believe he may be dangerous, with a possible history of mental health issues. After the crash, Henson allegedly exited the car, took an American flag out of the trunk and stuck it on the gate. The FBI is working with the U.S. Attorneys Office to draft a complaint against Henson.</p>

          <p>Jerry Greenfield, co-founder of Ben & Jerry's, has resigned from the ice cream brand, citing the company's loss of independence to pursue its values under Unilever's ownership. This follows the company's failure to block Unilever from selling its ice cream in West Bank settlements. Greenfield stated that his firm has been silenced and sidelined, particularly regarding issues like civil rights and LGBTQ+ rights. Unilever is in the process of spinning off Magnum, which is expected to begin standalone operations by mid-November. The article highlights the conflict between social activism and corporate control.</p>

          <p>Researchers investigating the cause of a toxic algal bloom in L.A. have concluded that it's unlikely that wildfire debris worsened the event. The algal bloom, which caused numerous marine animal deaths, was more likely influenced by the upwelling effect, which brought nutrient-rich waters to the surface. While fire retardants added some nutrients, their impact was dwarfed by the upwelling. Scientists have known that the fires did not initiate the bloom, but the acceleration of marine wildlife deaths led some to wonder if the fires were a contributing factor.

          <p>The California Department of Public Health has issued a health advisory about the New World Screwworm, a parasitic fly whose maggots can infest living livestock, pets, and humans. The fly has rapidly spread northward from Panama and is present in southern Mexico, with some cases reported in travelers. While the risk to humans in the U.S. is relatively low, infestations can occur through open wounds or mucus membranes. The USDA is investing in new technology to accelerate the pace of sterile fly production to combat the spread. The article provides a warning about a potential health threat.</p>
