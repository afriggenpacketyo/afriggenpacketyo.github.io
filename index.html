          <h2>JD Vance Suggests US May Withdraw from Ukraine Negotiations Without Agreement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 11:22:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US Vice-President JD Vance stated that the US might withdraw from diplomatic efforts unless Ukraine and Russia reach an agreement soon, echoing similar sentiments from other US officials. This statement follows downgraded London talks after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff withdrew, shifting focus to Moscow talks where Witkoff will meet with Vladimir Putin. Vance emphasized the need for both sides to compromise, potentially ceding territory to freeze the conflict, while Zelensky insists on an immediate ceasefire and rejects recognizing Crimea as Russian territory. Russia has intensified attacks after a brief Easter lull, complicating the already tense negotiation landscape.</p>

          <p>Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg confirmed that Chinese airlines have ceased taking deliveries of Boeing aircraft due to the ongoing trade war and escalating tariffs imposed by the US. Some 737 Max planes intended for Chinese carriers have been rerouted back to the US, and Boeing is considering reallocating future orders to other customers. Ortberg emphasized that Boeing will not allow these trade disputes to derail the company's recovery, as demand for the 737 Max remains high. This announcement follows Boeing's report of a narrower-than-expected loss in the first quarter, with better-than-anticipated cash flow due to increased airplane deliveries.</p>

          <p>A man in Israel died after being attacked by a shark off a popular beach, prompting authorities to close the area following a two-day search for his remains. The victim, identified as Barak Tzach, entered the water with snorkeling gear to document the sharks, which have been drawing crowds despite warnings against approaching or feeding them. This incident marks one of the few recorded shark attacks in Israel, raising concerns about human interaction with marine life in the area. Authorities had previously condemned the behavior of beachgoers who were seen swimming with and even tugging on the tails of the sharks.</p>

          <p>Nerys Bethan Lloyd, owner of a paddleboard firm, received a 10-year and six-month prison sentence after four individuals died during a paddleboarding excursion on the Western Cleddau river in Wales in 2021. Lloyd, an ex-police officer, pleaded guilty to gross negligence manslaughter, as she was unqualified to lead such a tour under the hazardous river conditions. The court found that Lloyd's "abysmal" approach to safety, coupled with the dangerous conditions of the river, directly contributed to the deaths of the four participants. The judge emphasized Lloyd's disregard for safety, prioritizing an "exciting route" over the well-being of the group.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price is increasing for a third consecutive day, driven by a market-wide relief rally spurred by President Trump's softened stance on China tariffs and less confrontational approach towards Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The cryptocurrency's price has risen by 1.3% to $92,654, reaching as high as $94,499.86 earlier in the day, marking its highest level since March 3. This recovery has allowed Bitcoin to regain about half of its losses since Inauguration Day, positioning it just below the flat line for the year. According to market strategist Joel Kruger, this surge reflects investors capitalizing on a dip in an asset that serves as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty and US dollar volatility.</p>

While the union accuses the city council of inconsistent communication, the council states that negotiations are ongoing and positive. The strike has led to significant waste accumulation in the city, prompting a major incident declaration last month due to public health concerns.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term has seen a disruption of established domestic and foreign policy, particularly with steep tariffs impacting US allies and foes. This has fractured the Western alliance, creating an opportunity for China to alleviate the diplomatic, economic, and military pressures it faced during the previous administration. With NATO gaining new members and Brussels taking a tougher stance on trade with China under the Biden administration, Trump's actions are now reversing these trends. The cracks are most visible in Europe, where leaders view the alliance with America as weakened, potentially allowing China to make inroads.</p>

          <p>Jose Hermosillo, a 19-year-old US citizen with intellectual disabilities, was detained by Customs and Border Protection agents in Arizona for 10 days after being arrested for illegal entry. His family provided documentation proving his citizenship, but DHS initially defended the arrest, claiming Hermosillo stated he had entered the U.S. illegally. Hermosillo's parents assert that their son cannot read or write and has trouble speaking, making it impossible for him to understand what he was signing. The Arizona Attorney General's office is investigating the incident, deeming it unacceptable to wrongfully detain U.S. citizens.</p>

The electric vehicle maker's first-quarter results were weak, with a 20% year-over-year drop in automotive revenue and a 71% decline in net income.

These controversies appear to be impacting Tesla's sales, particularly in the US and Europe, as buyers turn to competing electric vehicle brands. The company is also facing challenges in China, where local EV companies are offering more advanced features.
