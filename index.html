            <p>Tim Arel, the FAA's head of air traffic, is retiring early as the agency implements changes at Reagan National Airport following safety concerns. These changes include replacing senior managers and increasing staffing to address recent close calls and a midair collision. The FAA is also investigating a fight between employees inside the air traffic control tower. These measures aim to improve safety data trends, performance management, and training standards at the airport, which is crucial for ensuring the safety of daily air traffic operations.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>GOLF Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee revealed that covering the Masters Tournament requires specific etiquette, strongly encouraged by broadcast producers. This includes using terms like "patron" instead of "fan" and referring to the "tournament practice facility" instead of the "driving range." The final nine holes are called the "second nine" rather than the "back nine" to avoid colloquialisms. Chamblee believes this approach contributes to the Masters being the best golf tournament of the year, with broadcasters being judicious in their word choice to maintain a reverent tone.</p>

The US State Department called the reports disturbing, citing China's role as a major enabler of Russia's war through the supply of dual-use goods.

            <p>The State Department clarified that upcoming talks between the United States and Iran are not negotiations over Tehran's nuclear program, but rather a meeting to touch base. President Donald Trump has reimposed sanctions on Iran and stated that Iran has a choice to negotiate or face consequences. Steve Witkoff, the special envoy to the Middle East, will represent the Trump administration during the session. While Trump asserted that direct diplomacy was underway, Iran characterized the talks as indirect and high-level, taking place in Oman.</p>

            <p>Hannah Hampton is challenging Mary Earps for the starting goalkeeper position in the England national team ahead of the Women's Euros. While Earps has a decorated career and is the more experienced player, Wiegman has been rotating goalkeepers, favoring Hampton in recent matches. Hampton has performed well for Chelsea, conceding few goals this season and featuring in key Champions League matches. This rotation signals a potential shift towards the future, as Hampton is eight years younger than Earps, indicating a long-term strategy for the team.</p>

            <p>A federal judge ruled that the White House must lift restrictions on the Associated Press (AP) after it was barred from certain events. The restrictions stemmed from the AP's decision to continue using the name "Gulf of Mexico" instead of "Gulf of America," as declared by President Trump. The judge stated that the White House's actions violated the First Amendment, as the AP was being excluded based on its viewpoint. The ruling requires the White House to provide the AP with the same access as other news outlets.</p>

Kennedy promoted treatments with aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin, but experts emphasize the importance of the MMR vaccine for prevention.

The decision has sparked criticism, with concerns raised about the impact on jobs and the environment.

            <p>Canada and China are implementing harsh trade retaliations against the U.S. in response to President Trump's global tariff policy. Canada will impose 25% tariffs on select U.S. car imports, while China vowed to "fight to the end" and face a 104% duty on all products imported from China to the United States. These actions have led to market turmoil, with major indexes erasing earlier gains. Trump has said he is waiting for talks to begin with China, the third-largest U.S. trading partner after Canada and Mexico.</p>

            <p>Advocates are criticizing the State Department's decision to cut over $1.3 billion in foreign aid, which they say could be a "death sentence for millions." The cuts include terminating USAID contracts supporting food, water, and medicine delivery in Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia, Syria, and Lebanon. The State Department claims that the majority of funding to the World Food Programme (WFP) remains active, but some programs were terminated due to concerns about funding benefiting terrorist groups and misuse of cash-based assistance. The WFP warns of dire consequences for those facing extreme hunger and starvation.</p>

The supervisors voted to create a "unified permitting authority" to cut through bureaucracy and speed up approvals. The Eaton fire destroyed over 9,000 structures, mostly single-family homes, in Altadena, where the county government has final say on building permits. The new authority will have the final say on permitting issues and will include senior-level liaisons from various county departments.</p>

            <p>The S&P 500 recently experienced its worst week since March 2020, declining roughly 9% due to tariff-related concerns. Experts predict that the recovery may be different this time, with a slower rebound than the one seen after the pandemic crash. Investor confidence has been shaken, and the Federal Reserve may not immediately intervene due to concerns about both slowing growth and rising inflation. The market's volatility is driven by fears that Trump's tariffs could halt U.S. economic growth, potentially leading to a recession. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>As Tesla shares experienced a fourth consecutive day of decline, CEO Elon Musk intensified his attacks on President Donald Trump's trade advisor, Peter Navarro. Musk criticized Navarro's comments about Tesla being a "car assembler," calling him a "moron" and "dangerously dumb." The public feud highlights the differing views on trade within the Trump administration. Tesla's stock has significantly decreased, resulting in substantial financial losses for Musk, who also leads the Department of Government Efficiency.</p>

            <p>Oren Cass, chief economist at American Compass, argues that tariffs are necessary to bring back manufacturing to the United States, despite potential economic costs. He believes that making things matters and that the U.S. should prioritize domestic production over cheap consumer goods. Cass contends that a global tariff is the best approach, allowing the market to determine which industries should return to the U.S. He also suggests that Americans are willing to pay more for goods made in the U.S. to support a stronger industrial base and more stable communities.</p>

            <p>Cambodia, facing the highest tariff rate of any country under President Trump's new trade plan, is unlikely to reshore manufacturing to the U.S., according to a trade group. The 49% tariff will create an existential crisis for Cambodian factories and workers, but manufacturers are looking at other countries, such as Egypt and India, to relocate their supply chains. The American Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia believes Americans are unlikely to want to perform the labor-intensive garment manufacturing jobs. The Cambodian government is exploring fiscal policies to mitigate the pressure.</p>
