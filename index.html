            <h2>Trump Tariffs Unlikely to Reshore Manufacturing from Cambodia, Experts Say</h2>

            <p>Despite President Trump's goal of bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. through tariffs, a 49% tariff on Cambodian goods is unlikely to achieve this, according to the American Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia. Manufacturers are instead looking to countries like Egypt, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Indonesia to mitigate the tariffs. Supply chain experts at Moody's suggest companies will pause executive decision making due to uncertainty surrounding tariff responses from other countries. The White House claims Cambodia's tariffs on the U.S. are as high as 97%, a figure disputed by Cambodia and trade organizations.</p>

            <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that China made a 'big mistake' by escalating trade tensions with the U.S., asserting that the U.S. has a stronger position because it imports significantly less from China than it exports. Bessent anticipates that several countries with large trade deficits will soon negotiate with the U.S. He believes tariffs can bring jobs back to the U.S. and generate revenue, ultimately becoming a 'melting ice cube' as manufacturing returns. China has vowed to 'fight to the end' and imposed tariffs on U.S. products, while Trump threatens additional tariffs if China doesn't withdraw its measures.</p>

            <p>Walgreens reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue, driven by cost-cutting measures as the company prepares to go private with Sycamore Partners. The company withdrew its fiscal 2025 guidance due to the pending transaction, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Walgreens is closing stores and reducing costs due to pharmacy reimbursement pressures, decreased consumer spending, competition from rivals like CVS and Amazon, and struggles in its healthcare expansion. The company's operating cash flow was impacted by legal payments related to opioid settlements and a dispute with Everly Health Solutions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>China is aiming to become a “strong agricultural country” by 2050, focusing on improving standards in farming supplies, scientific equipment, and industrial competitiveness. The plan is jointly released by the Communist Party’s Central Committee and the State Council. The country, where most farmers still operate on a relatively small scale, aims to improve standards in farming supplies, scientific and technological equipment, and industrial resilience and competitiveness by 2050, according to a plan issued on Monday.</p>

            <p>The US and Iran will hold "direct talks" over a possible new nuclear deal on Saturday, says President Donald Trump. Hours after the surprise announcement, Iran's foreign minister said the talks in Oman would be "indirect" but could be "as much an opportunity as... a test". Trump - who pulled the US out a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers during his first term - said discussions would be at "very high level" and that Iran would be in "great danger" if talks were not successful.</p>

            <p>A company called Colossal Biosciences announced it used "deft genetic engineering and ancient DNA "to breed three dire wolf puppies and to "de-extinct" the species. But while the young wolves - Romulus, Remus, and Khaleesi - represent an impressive technological breakthrough, independent experts say they are not actually dire wolves. Experts have pointed to important biological differences between the wolf on the cover of Time and the dire wolf that roamed and hunted during the last ice age.</p>

            <p>Grand National runner Celebre d'Allen has died after collapsing at the final fence at Aintree on Saturday. The 13-year-old horse was treated on the course before being taken to the racehorse stables for further assessment.

The British Horseracing Authority (BHA), who passed the suspension on Nolan, said Celebre d'Allen passed the necessary checks to race at Aintree.</p>

The system involves putting younger teens on the platforms into more restricted settings by default, with parental permission required in order to live stream or turn off image protections for messages. It was first introduced last September on Instagram, which Meta says "fundamentally changed the experience for teens" on the platform.</p>

            <p>Senator Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) has introduced a bill proposing a federal tax credit for homeowners who retrofit their homes against wildfires and other natural disasters. The bill, co-sponsored by Sen. Tim Sheehy (R-Mont.), would cover up to half the costs for qualified home upgrades, capped at $25,000 for families with incomes under $200,000. The measure aims to help families protect their homes and encourage insurers to cover more homes in vulnerable areas. The tax credit would cover up to half of the costs for qualified home upgrades, including for things such as new fire-resistant roofs, in states such as California and Montana, where the federal government has declared disasters in recent years, Schiff said.</p>

            <p>President Trump has defended his new tariffs, calling for Americans to be "strong, courageous and patient." The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Trump administration continuing to deport what it says are Venezuelan gang members. The 5-to-4 vote threw out a lower court's ruling to temporarily stop the deportations under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act. The attorneys for the men deported last month say that using the act during a time of peace is illegal.</p>
