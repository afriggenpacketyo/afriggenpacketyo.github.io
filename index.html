The demonstrations, initially peaceful, have escalated with instances of violence, property damage, and looting, resulting in numerous arrests and the implementation of a curfew in downtown Los Angeles.

While the U.S. market presents a significant opportunity for soccer, the history of other sports suggests that there may be a limit to how much the country can handle.

          <p>A California law designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by diverting organic waste from landfills is inadvertently exacerbating illegal dumping in the Antelope Valley. The law requires residents and businesses to separate food waste and yard trimmings, but the lack of infrastructure and demand for compost in the area has made disposal more expensive. This has incentivized waste haulers to dump illegally, threatening the fragile desert ecosystem with invasive species and contaminants. The situation has sparked lawsuits and calls for stronger enforcement and tracking of waste.</p>

With evidence suggesting that a small number of companies have significantly contributed to greenhouse gas emissions, the author examines the legal implications of corporate actions that knowingly create lethal climate harms. While proving causation poses challenges, the piece suggests that homicide charges may be appropriate given state laws that punish causing death through reckless conduct or extreme indifference to human life.

          <p>New guidelines from the Chinese government may allow Hong Kong-listed companies to seek secondary share listings in Shenzhen. The new opportunity would diversify fundraising options for businesses within the Greater Bay Area. The dual-listing scenario could also tempt more businesses to seek listings in Hong Kong, as a single application could allow them to offer shares in both markets.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has suspended its loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts across the border to North Korea. This action aims to "restore trust" between both countries. The action comes a week after the election of new president Lee Jae-myung, who had campaigned on improving inter-Korean ties. Organisations advocating to improve the human rights of North Koreans have criticised the suspension.</p>

          <p>The Bensalem Township School District is weighing options for a new middle school, with all plans costing over $100 million. The options include renovating existing schools, constructing a single building, or creating a campus with separate buildings. A decision is expected soon, as the district aims to alleviate capacity issues in its elementary and middle schools. The board voted unanimously last fall to move the district's sixth graders up to the middle school in the hope to alleviate capacity issues within the district's elementary and middle schools.</p>
