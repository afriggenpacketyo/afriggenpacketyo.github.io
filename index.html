          <p>President Trump has announced plans to host a UFC championship fight on the White House grounds as part of the 2026 "America250" celebration. The event, which Trump described as a "full fight" for up to 25,000 spectators, will be organized by UFC CEO Dana White. The White House confirmed the president is serious about the idea, which was revealed during a speech in Iowa. This event highlights Trump's long-standing relationship with the UFC, which dates back to hosting fights at his casino in 2001.</p>

          <p>Russian forces launched a significant drone and missile attack on Kyiv, injuring at least 14 people and causing damage primarily to residential buildings. The assault occurred shortly after the U.S. announced a pause on some arms shipments to Ukraine, a move President Trump defended by stating the need to preserve America's own weapon supplies. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed hope to discuss the aid situation with Trump soon, as the halt in deliveries has raised concerns in Kyiv about its defense capabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has temporarily barred U.S. trading firm Jane Street from its securities market, accusing it of manipulative trading practices. SEBI has also frozen approximately $566 million in alleged illegal gains, claiming the firm artificially influenced India's Nifty 50 index to profit from large options positions. While Jane Street disputes the findings, the regulator cited the "intensity and sheer scale" of the firm's actions as grounds for the ban, calling the behavior egregious. This move occurs as India's derivatives markets attract more global trading firms. (not investment advice)</p>

While his advisors insist the trip is focused on helping Democrats and highlighting issues in rural communities, its location in an early presidential primary state is seen by many as strategic groundwork.

The suit contends that the administration's actions, including significant staff reductions and the termination of grant programs, violate the separation of powers.

This trend contradicts the administration's stated focus on targeting violent criminals and reflects a broader push to increase arrests.

          <p>Authorities have reported that seven people remain unaccounted for after a series of powerful explosions destroyed a fireworks warehouse in Yolo County, California. The incident at Devastating Pyrotechnics in the community of Esparto caused a large fire that spread to surrounding grasslands and injured two people. Family members of the missing, including three brothers, have gathered near the scene awaiting news. Officials confirmed the facility was operating without local licenses for fireworks storage, and a multi-agency investigation, including the ATF, is now underway.</p>

          <p>A stateless Palestinian woman who was detained by ICE upon returning from her honeymoon has been released after more than four months in custody. Ward Sakeik, 22, was arrested in February despite having complied with ICE check-in requirements since she was a child. Her case drew significant attention after the government attempted to deport her twice, once in defiance of a judge's order. Sakeik, whose family is from Gaza, was born in Saudi Arabia and described being criminalized for her statelessness, something over which she has no control.</p>

          <p>Republican Derrick Van Orden of Wisconsin faced backlash after sharing and then deleting a social media post that appeared to celebrate the negative consequences of a new tax bill. Van Orden had replied "YES!" to a post detailing how the legislation would cause 17 million people to lose healthcare and 3 million to lose food assistance. After deleting the post, he claimed it was a mistake and that he intended to reply to a different White House statement. The incident drew criticism for its perceived cruelty, highlighting the human cost of the bill's social program cuts.</p>

          <p>Recent staffing cuts at the National Park Service (NPS) are raising safety concerns as the summer visitor season peaks, with some parks operating with fewer lifeguards and other personnel. At Assateague Island National Seashore in Maryland, for example, shuttered lifeguard towers and warning signs are now visible. According to the National Parks Conservation Association, the NPS has lost 24% of its permanent staff since January due to a hiring freeze and layoffs. This reduction in staff is creating fears of increased risk for the millions of visitors to the nation's parks.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives has passed the Trump administration's signature legislative package, a massive bill featuring significant tax and spending cuts alongside increased funding for defense and immigration enforcement. The measure, which passed by a narrow 218-214 vote, now heads to the president's desk to be signed into law. The bill's passage followed a tense overnight session where Republican leadership worked to secure support from skeptical members. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has placed 139 employees on administrative leave after they signed a public "declaration of dissent" criticizing the agency's direction under the Trump administration. The employees' letter argued that the EPA is failing its mission to protect human health and the environment. In response, the EPA stated it has a "zero-tolerance policy for career bureaucrats unlawfully undermining" the administration's agenda. The employees have been placed on paid, non-duty status pending an administrative investigation, which the agency insists is not a disciplinary action.</p>

While acquitted of the most serious racketeering and sex trafficking charges, Combs was convicted on two lesser counts and still faces significant jail time and numerous civil lawsuits. The trial revealed sordid details of his private life, which have permanently tarnished his reputation as a hip-hop mogul. Despite this, some supporters remain loyal, and analysts note that other artists have continued their careers after criminal convictions.</p>
