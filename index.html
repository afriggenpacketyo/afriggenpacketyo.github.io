          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called for Iran to resume negotiations after the US bombed nuclear sites within the country, emphasizing regional stability as a priority. Starmer described Iran's nuclear program as a significant threat to international security, noting that the UK was not involved in the US strikes but was informed in advance. He stated that Iran must not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons and that the US action was intended to alleviate that threat. Iran's ambassador to the UK indicated that Iran is considering its response, while the UN Secretary General expressed concern over the dangerous escalation. </p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that Japan is closely monitoring developments in Iran following the US attacks on nuclear facilities, but refrained from endorsing the US action. Ishiba emphasized the importance of de-escalating the situation and instructed officials to monitor energy supplies, as Japan relies heavily on the Middle East for crude oil. While acknowledging concerns, he stopped short of explicitly supporting the US military intervention, highlighting the delicate balance Japan must strike in its foreign policy. The Prime Minister underscored the need to maintain stability in the region, given Japan's economic dependence on Middle Eastern resources.</p>

          <p>Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has stated that Tehran reserves all options to defend its sovereignty after the US conducted strikes on nuclear enrichment facilities. Iran also launched additional missile and drone attacks against Israeli military targets, prompting retaliatory missile offensives from Israel. Araghchi condemned the US strikes as "outrageous" with "everlasting consequences," accusing the US and Israel of undermining recent diplomatic efforts. US President Donald Trump claimed the strikes had "completely obliterated" Iran's key enrichment facilities, though this has not been independently verified, and the IAEA reported no radiation leaks.</p>

          <p>Following the US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iranian dissident groups have renewed their calls for the overthrow of the Islamic Republic and its leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Reza Pahlavi, son of the last Shah, asserted that the attacks resulted from the regime's pursuit of nuclear weapons at the expense of the Iranian people. Maryam Rajavi, president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, stated that Khamenei must step down, blaming him for wasting trillions of dollars on a failed nuclear program. These groups advocate for a free, democratic, and non-nuclear Iran, signaling a desire for fundamental political change.</p>

          <p>As the conflict between Israel and Iran continues, speculation has grown regarding the possibility of regime change in Tehran, a historically fraught concept. Experts caution against external imposition of regime change, citing the potential for instability and violence, as seen in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya. Eckart Woertz from the German Institute of Global and Area Studies (GIGA) emphasizes that a successful regime change requires a ground force and support from local people, conditions that are not currently present in Iran. The article suggests that aerial bombardment alone is unlikely to achieve regime change, highlighting the complexities and risks associated with such interventions.</p>

          <p>The US bombing of Iranian nuclear sites has fundamentally altered the course of the conflict between Israel and Iran, prompting questions about Iran's potential response. While Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the US action, Iran had previously warned of retaliation against any US military intervention. With the nuclear sites potentially neutralized, Israel may have achieved its primary war aim, though Iran claims to have moved its nuclear material. The future escalation of the conflict hinges on how Iran and its allies react, with the potential for further attacks or a shift towards diplomatic negotiations.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have found that advances in cell transplant into the spleen could transform the organ into a hub for treating diabetes. Studies found that shielding islet cells could improve their survival after being transplanted into the spleen to treat type 1 diabetes. The spleen, a more promising long-term survival site than the conventionally used liver, could be engineered into a transplant hub with the help of nanoparticles. This research offers a potential new avenue for diabetes treatment, addressing the growing number of diabetes cases worldwide.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik's conviction for the 2001 murder of her husband, Bob, was overturned after she spent two decades fighting for her freedom. New testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed that some spots were never tested and others were not blood at all. Dorotik maintained her innocence throughout her imprisonment, arguing that authorities focused on her from the beginning of the investigation and failed to follow other leads. Despite the overturned conviction, the DA's office initially sought to retry her but eventually dropped the charges due to insufficient evidence, though a shadow still remains.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the US carried out a "successful" bombing attack on three nuclear sites in Iran, claiming they have been "obliterated". Israel stated they were in "full co-ordination" with the US in planning the strikes, while Iranian officials confirmed the attacks but downplayed the damage. The US reportedly used GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators to attack Fordo, a uranium enrichment plant. The Iranian Atomic Energy Organization condemned the bombing, but the IAEA reported no increase in radiation levels.
