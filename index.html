          <p>The IMF recently lowered its growth forecast for the eurozone, citing the negative effects of U.S. tariffs as outweighing the positive impact of increased German infrastructure spending.  While Germany's new infrastructure and climate fund is expected to boost growth, it won't be enough to counter the tariff-related drag on the European economy.
