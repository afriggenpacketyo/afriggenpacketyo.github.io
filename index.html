This marks the state's 12th execution in 2025, a record number since the death penalty was reinstated, highlighting a significant increase in death warrants signed by Governor Ron DeSantis. Pittman's final appeals, which argued he had intellectual disabilities that should have precluded his execution, were denied by the courts.

During a Senate hearing, FBI Director Kash Patel expressed support for the bill, which Cruz argues is necessary to combat politically motivated violence seen in various recent protests. Cruz has been a vocal critic of the groups allegedly behind these events and has called for the death penalty for Kirk's assassin.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is reviewing numerous social media posts from service members that appeared to mock or celebrate the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has condemned such commentary as "completely unacceptable," and several officers in the Army and Marines have already been suspended or reassigned pending investigation. While service members have tighter speech limits under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, legal experts note that securing a conviction in a court-martial for such posts could be challenging for prosecutors.</p>

          <p>A man identified as Donald Henson was arrested after allegedly ramming his car into the entrance gate of the FBI's Pittsburgh field office in what officials initially called a "targeted attack." After the crash, Henson reportedly threw an American flag over the gate before fleeing on foot. Authorities noted that Henson had recently visited the office to file a complaint that lacked a federal nexus and is believed to have a history of mental health issues. No injuries were reported in the incident.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva told the BBC that he has no relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, citing a lack of civilized communication. Lula criticized Trump's recent imposition of 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods as a political move related to the conviction of former president Jair Bolsonaro, stating American consumers would bear the cost. He contrasted this with his positive relationships with other world leaders and asserted that while he would greet Trump civilly, the U.S. president is not the "emperor of the world."</p>

          <p>A report from Bloomberg indicates that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signed mortgage documents in 2007 that simultaneously declared two different properties as his "principal residence." This is similar to the allegations of mortgage fraud President Trump has used in his attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. While Bessent's lawyer and the lending bank stated everything was handled properly and no wrongdoing occurred, the revelation is notable given Bessent's previous comments suggesting that a Fed official who committed mortgage fraud should not be serving.

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Recent Tax Legislation Creates Inequities and Complex Loopholes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" argues that recent Republican-led tax changes are creating a system of targeted loopholes that benefit specific groups at both high and low income levels. The legislation extends tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy while introducing new deductions for tipped income and overtime pay, which could lead to workers in similar financial situations facing vastly different tax bills. Critics argue this approach complicates the tax code, shrinks the overall tax base, and encourages people to game the system rather than promoting broad, equitable tax relief.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid record levels of U.S. household debt, this article outlines several strategies for individuals whose debt payments have become unaffordable. Options include debt consolidation, which combines multiple debts into a single loan with a lower interest rate, and debt management plans offered by credit counseling agencies to reduce rates and fees. For more severe situations, debt settlement may allow for negotiating a lower total balance, while bankruptcy can offer a "clean slate" as a last resort, though with significant credit repercussions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, bringing the new target range to 4% to 4.25% in response to a weakening labor market and slower economic growth. This is the first rate reduction since December 2024, with central bank projections suggesting two more cuts may occur this year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated the move was necessary due to rising downside risks to employment, signaling that supporting job growth has become a more pressing concern than recent inflation figures.

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers star pass rusher Khalil Mack is expected to miss four weeks after suffering a dislocated elbow during a game against the Raiders. While a significant blow to the team's defense, the diagnosis was a relief compared to initial fears of a season-ending injury. Coach Jim Harbaugh praised Mack's toughness, and the team will now rely on players like Tuli Tuipulotu and Bud Dupree to step into larger roles. Mack has been a durable player for the Chargers, and his absence will be felt in upcoming divisional matchups.</p>

          <p>A large study of nearly 34,000 veterans has found that taking nicotinamide, a form of Vitamin B3, is associated with a lower risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancers. The most significant reduction, 54%, was observed in individuals who began taking the supplement after their first skin cancer diagnosis. This research reinforces previous findings and provides stronger evidence for dermatologists who often recommend the over-the-counter supplement as a secondary prevention measure for high-risk patients, as B3 is known to help protect cells from UV radiation damage.</p>

          <p>A dive team has identified a shipwreck located 200 feet underwater off the coast of Nantucket as the ST Seiner, a fishing boat that sank during a storm in January 1929, resulting in the loss of all 21 crew members. The vessel, which had been missing for nearly a century, was identified by distinctive features like its double drum trawl winch and steam engine. The discovery was made by Atlantic Wreck Salvage, which hopes the find can provide some measure of closure to the descendants of the men who were lost.</p>
