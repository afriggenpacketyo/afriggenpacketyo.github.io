          <p>The UK government has committed Â£900 million to boost both major sporting events and grassroots facilities across the nation, marking a significant investment aimed at transforming the sports landscape. Over half of the funds, exceeding Â£0.5 billion, will support the delivery of prominent international events like Euro 2028, co-hosted by the UK and Ireland, as well as the 2026 European Athletics Championships in Birmingham and the Tour de France cycling races in 2027. While the government has already backed these events and is considering a bid for the 2035 Women's World Cup, a decision on supporting London's bid for the 2029 World Athletics Championships is still pending, despite urging from numerous British athletes. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy emphasized that this investment will drive economic growth and create pathways for future sporting heroes. </p>

          <p>An opinion piece analyzes Donald Trump's foreign policy, contrasting his initial boasts of geopolitical prowess with the current strategic landscape. Despite Trump's earlier confidence and promises to swiftly finalize deals with Russia and Iran, the situation has escalated in various conflict zones. The author argues that Trump's inability to translate geopolitical capital into tangible gains has led to new strategic quagmires, potentially strengthening rivals like Russia and China. The piece suggests that public dissatisfaction with the ruling elite has fueled the rise of Trump, but his policies have not delivered the promised results.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erick, initially a Category 3 hurricane, made landfall in Oaxaca, southern Mexico, and was later downgraded to a tropical storm by the National Hurricane Center. Despite the downgrade, the hurricane center warned of continued heavy rainfall, posing a significant risk of life-threatening flooding and mudslides, especially in areas with steep terrain. The storm's center was located approximately 35 miles north-northeast of Acapulco, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph, and it was moving northwest at 12 mph. Erick is expected to continue weakening rapidly and likely dissipate overnight, though it is still projected to produce 8 to 12 inches of rain, with maximum totals of 16 inches in Oaxaca and Guerrero.</p>

          <p>The White House has stated that Iran possesses all the necessary components to produce a nuclear weapon within a couple of weeks, pending a decision from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt emphasized the existential threat this would pose to Israel, the United States, and the world. This assessment comes amidst ongoing debate regarding Iran's "breakout timeline" for weapon development.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in Icarus suggests that a passing star could potentially destabilize the solar system within the next four billion years, posing a threat to Earth's orbit. Researchers found that simulations indicate isolated models of the solar system may underestimate future orbital changes of giant planets, making the planets and Pluto less stable than previously thought. While the chances of a direct collision with Earth are low (around 0.2%), the gravitational tug from a passing star could significantly increase the risk of instability for planets like Mercury and Mars. Though these events are not probable, the potential vulnerability of the solar system to planetary chaos is a concern.</p>

The raids, occurring across Southern California, have prompted protests and marches, with community members and organizations advocating for the rights of undocumented immigrants. Despite fears among the immigrant community, efforts such as free food distribution and legal support are underway to provide assistance and demonstrate solidarity, while community leaders emphasize the importance of staying informed and vigilant.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that plastic bag bans and fees are effectively reducing shoreline pollution, with up to a 47% decrease in plastic bag waste collected during beach cleanups in areas with such policies. Researchers analyzed data from over 45,000 beach cleanups between 2016 and 2023, cross-referencing it with local bag policies. The study found that fee-based policies were more effective than full or partial bans, suggesting that policy design is crucial. California's experience with plastic bag regulations highlights this, as an initial ban led to an increase in thicker plastic bag waste due to a loophole, however, a new ban set to take effect in 2026 aims to eliminate single-use plastic bags entirely.</p>

In her resignation letter, Foxcroft expressed understanding of the need to address the rising welfare bill but argued that cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit should not be part of the solution. The government responded by stating its commitment to fixing a broken welfare system and ensuring support for those who can and want to work, while protecting those with severe disabilities and health conditions. The government's bill, which tightens criteria for personal independence payments and reduces the sickness-related element of universal credit, has faced criticism and potential rebellion from within the party.</p>

Despite Iran's consistent denial of any intention to build nuclear weapons, Israel maintains that Iran is rapidly advancing towards nuclear capability.

          <p>A review of "28 Years Later" describes the film as a tonally uneven but ambitious entry in the zombie genre. The plot follows survivors nearly three decades after a viral outbreak, with the film praised for its unique characters and frenetic editing. The film also explores themes of societal regression and the cyclical nature of human conflict. The review suggests that the film's strengths lie in its challenging style and thought-provoking commentary on humanity, while also acknowledging that its unconventional approach may not resonate with all viewers.</p>

          <p>As tensions rise between Israel and Iran, the possibility of a U.S. strike on Iran's Fordo nuclear site has brought attention to the Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bomb and the B-2 Spirit bomber. The MOP, designed to destroy deeply buried facilities, can only be carried and deployed by the B-2 Spirit, known for its stealth capabilities. The combination of the MOP and B-2 would give the US the capability to destroy Fordo. The potential use of these assets has sparked debate, with some suggesting it would be a provocative move.</p>

          <p>A new report details the final minutes of a flight that crashed in San Diego, killing six people. The NTSB report indicates that the plane was flying too low before it struck power lines and crashed into a house, with the plane reaching a descent point about three miles from the runway that was too low. The report also confirmed that the automated system providing weather conditions and runway lights was not operational before the crash. The victims included rock drummer Daniel Williams and music agent Dave Shapiro.</p>
