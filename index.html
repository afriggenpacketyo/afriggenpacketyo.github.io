            <p>The U.S. Commerce Department is initiating a national security investigation into imports of semiconductor technology and related products, signaling potential tariffs. This probe will assess the feasibility of increasing domestic semiconductor capacity to reduce import reliance and determine if trade measures are necessary to protect national security. The investigation covers a broad range of items, from silicon wafers to chipmaking equipment and downstream products containing semiconductors, with massive implications for Trump's global trade war. While exemptions have been made on electronics, including smartphones, Trump indicated these were temporary and part of plans to apply separate tariffs to the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Patients in the South West of England with inflammatory skin diseases like eczema, psoriasis, and acne are enduring long waits for NHS dermatology treatment, described as a "living hell". Delays are exacerbated by increased skin cancer referrals and a shortage of dermatologists, leaving many patients suffering with pain, itching, and mental health issues. Some are turning to costly private care, while others are advocating for better support and recognition of the impact of skin conditions. The situation highlights the urgent need for improved resources and prioritization of inflammatory skin disease care within the NHS.</p>

            <p>Veterinarians in the UK report feeling pressured to prioritize income generation over animal welfare at practices owned by large corporate groups. Vets at IVC Evidensia, a major pet-care provider, say they are monitored and set targets based on revenue, leading to concerns about upselling and compromised clinical decisions. The British Veterinary Union's survey reveals that monitoring and targets influence the decisions of veterinary staff. This raises questions about the impact of corporate ownership on the quality of care and ethical practices within the veterinary industry.</p>

            <p>In Afghanistan, girls are increasingly turning to low-paid carpet weaving after being barred from education by the Taliban. With limited job opportunities, women and girls are forced into long, laborious days of carpet weaving to support their families. While the carpet export business is booming, weavers earn meager wages, often less than a dollar a day. This situation underscores the dire economic conditions and lack of opportunities for women under Taliban rule, pushing them into exploitative labor.</p>
