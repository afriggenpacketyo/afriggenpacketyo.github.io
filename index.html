          <p>Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has commenced a five-year sentence for conspiring to fund his 2007 election campaign with illicit money from former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. This marks a historic moment, as he is the first French ex-leader since World War Two to be jailed, underscoring significant legal accountability for a former head of state. Sarkozy, who vehemently protests his innocence, has appealed the conviction but was ordered to begin his term due to the "exceptional seriousness of the facts." He is held in an isolation wing at La Santé prison, occupying a 9 sq m cell and allowed one hour of exercise daily. The case has generated considerable public interest, with supporters gathering outside the prison, while officials like President Macron and the Justice Minister have shown a measure of support.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's parliament has elected ultraconservative Sanae Takaichi as the nation's first female prime minister, following a coalition deal between her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the right-wing Japan Innovation Party. This election ends a three-month political vacuum after the LDP's election loss. Takaichi, a protégé of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, is expected to pursue hawkish and nationalistic policies, including a stronger military and economy, and potentially revising Japan's pacifist constitution. Despite her historic appointment, Takaichi is not prioritizing gender equality and holds traditional views on imperial succession and marriage. Her untested alliance faces challenges in parliament, potentially leading to government instability.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Declan Rice, a prominent Premier League central midfielder, has significantly adapted his role at Arsenal since his £105m transfer. Initially a holding midfielder, he transitioned to a box-to-box player, boosting his attacking contributions with nine goals and ten assists last season. The recent £60m signing of Martin Zubimendi has further refined Rice's position, allowing him to operate deeper alongside Zubimendi while still leveraging his athleticism to join attacks. This tactical shift has made him a "complete midfielder," leading Arsenal in ball carries, passes into the box, and chances created this season. Both Arsenal and England's managers are utilizing his versatile, all-action capabilities.</p>

          <p>Olympic medallist Matt Richardson, a track cyclist, explains his controversial switch from Australia to Great Britain, attributing it to the "magic" and comprehensive program of British Cycling. He describes the British setup as "Hogwarts" compared to Australia's "high school," crediting it for his record-breaking 8.857-second flying 200m time. Richardson is now preparing for the World Championships in Santiago, Chile, aiming for his first individual world gold after consistently being beaten by Dutch rival Harrie Lavreysen. His girlfriend and teammate, Emma Finucane, a triple Olympic medalist, will also compete, adapting to new team dynamics in the sprint events.

          <p>Texas Secretary of State Jane Nelson announced that a comprehensive review identified over 2,700 potential non-citizens registered on the state's voter rolls, triggering eligibility investigations across all 254 counties. This initiative, made possible by direct access to the federal SAVE database, aims to bolster election integrity ahead of the 2026 election cycle. Each flagged voter will receive a notice requiring proof of U.S. citizenship within 30 days, failing which their registration will be canceled. Confirmed non-citizens who voted in previous Texas elections will be referred for potential prosecution, with Governor Greg Abbott emphasizing the removal of over one million ineligible registrations in the last three years as proof of Texas's commitment to election integrity.</p>

          <p>UK government borrowing hit £20.2bn in September, marking the highest level for that month in five years, according to the Office for National Statistics. This increase, up £1.6bn from last year, was primarily driven by a rise in debt interest payments, offsetting increased tax income. Borrowing for the first six months of the financial year now stands at £99.8bn, up £11.5bn year-on-year. These figures intensify pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who is expected to raise taxes in the upcoming November Budget to meet fiscal rules. Public sector debt is currently at 95.3% of GDP, levels not seen since the early 1960s, indicating significant economic challenges.</p>

The book, released months after Giuffre's death, recounts three alleged instances where Prince Andrew had sex with her, and further describes Jeffrey Epstein's private jets as "flying trafficking agents." Wallace urges Prince Andrew to share what he witnessed, emphasizing that his life is being "eroded" due to past behavior, and highlights Giuffre's bravery in standing up for victims.</p>

She also criticized the "condescending and controlling language" used towards survivors and the inquiry's secretive conduct. The Home Office denied claims of watering down the inquiry and committed to collecting ethnicity data for perpetrators of group-based child exploitation.

The islands, while offering minor tactical advantages for reconnaissance, are low-lying and exposed, making resupply and troop rotations exceptionally difficult and dangerous for Russia.

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced late Monday that it had resolved a massive outage that affected over 1,000 apps and websites globally, including social media platforms like Snapchat and major banks such as Lloyds and Halifax. The problems, originating from AWS's US operations and linked to DNS resolution issues, caused widespread disruptions for much of the day, with Downdetector recording over 11 million user reports. Experts highlighted the perils of over-reliance on a few dominant cloud providers, noting that even small errors can have significant, cascading impacts across interdependent infrastructure. The incident underscores concerns about concentrated supply in cloud computing, prompting calls for more local services and resilient market structures to mitigate future shocks.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Chicago and Illinois urged the Supreme Court to uphold a lower court's order blocking the deployment of the National Guard into Chicago, despite federalization by the Trump administration. They argued that the administration's claims rely on "mischaracterizations" and that state and local law enforcement are adequately handling isolated protest activities. With the temporary restraining order nearing expiration, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul emphasized that the current arrangement safeguards the constitutional balance of power between federal and state governments. The brief asserts that Illinois would suffer irreparable harm if the deployment were permitted, and the Trump administration is unlikely to justify the takeover.</p>

          <p>Myles Connor, a famous American art thief known for stealing a Rembrandt painting, offered his insights on the recent Louvre Museum heist, calling it "damn close" to the most expensive in history. Connor suggested the thieves' best strategy for profit would be to hold the items for years, then negotiate their return through an attorney for a reduced sentence or reward, as he did with his Rembrandt. He estimates a potential reward of up to $5 million for the Louvre items. Connor expressed concern that the stolen jewelry, which belonged to Emperor Napoleon I, would be ruined due to its historical significance, predicting the thieves would be "vilified" by the entire country.</p>

          <p>French police are intensely searching for priceless jewels stolen from the Louvre Museum in a brazen daylight robbery, but experts warn they may already be "long gone." Thieves escaped with eight valuable items in an eight-minute heist, though one crown and another item were dropped. Dutch art detective Arthur Brand believes the professional perpetrators will likely dismantle the jewels, melting down gold and silver, and cutting gems into smaller, untraceable stones to sell for a fraction of their worth, potentially fetching up to £10 million. Jewellery historian Carol Woolton suggests the robbers "cherry-picked" the most important gemstones. The incident has deeply shocked France, with many feeling a personal loss akin to the Mona Lisa being stolen.</p>

          <p>A theory dubbed "winology," coined by Chinese academics, is gaining traction online, addressing what it perceives as unfair Western dismissal of China's economic and technological advancements. This viewpoint suggests a hierarchical Western thinking that categorizes nations, placing Germanic peoples as "first-class" and Chinese as "fourth-class" global citizens. The theory explores how countries can achieve global leadership and recognition. Discussions around winology have attracted academic attention, including a seminar at Wuhan University, with participants from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and Tsinghua University, highlighting its role in fostering intellectual debate about international perceptions and national development.</p>

          <p>Construction has begun on President Donald Trump's new ballroom, with parts of the White House's East Wing being demolished. Trump stated the $250 million project, privately funded by "generous Patriots," will "fully modernise" the East Wing without interfering with the existing structure. However, former NPS chief historian Robert K Sutton criticized the lack of transparency and rigorous review process, expressing concern that the rushed project might reflect Trump's personal style rather than historical preservation. The East Wing, constructed in 1902 and last modified in 1942, is undergoing significant changes, including plans for seating hundreds and decadent gold chandeliers, raising public debate over presidential renovation powers.</p>

          <p>Brazil's government has approved state-run oil giant Petrobras's request to drill for oil near the Amazon River mouth, a decision that has drawn sharp criticism from environmental activists. The Equatorial Margin deposit is believed to be rich in oil and gas, and the approval follows a five-year battle and initial refusal by the environmental agency IBAMA. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva supports the plans, citing potential oil revenue to fund Brazil's climate transition. However, environmental groups like Observatorio do Clima condemn the move as "sabotage" to the upcoming COP30 climate summit, warning of impacts on the rainforest and indigenous communities, despite Petrobras's claims of no direct coastal or community impact.</p>

          <p>New court filings in the case against former FBI director James Comey reveal that "Person 3," whom the Department of Justice alleges Comey authorized to leak information, is Daniel Richman, a Columbia University law professor and Comey's longtime friend. Comey was charged with lying to Congress in 2020 about authorizing anonymous sources regarding the Hillary Clinton investigation. Comey's attorneys are seeking to dismiss the charges, arguing vindictive prosecution driven by President Trump's "personal animus" and that Senator Ted Cruz's questions were specifically about Andrew McCabe, not Richman. The filings highlight a complex legal battle over alleged leaks and political motivations, with Comey's team planning a "literal truth" defense.</p>

Veteran infielder Miguel Rojas emphasized the team's collective focus on securing "four more wins." While acknowledging the value of rest, shortstop Mookie Betts also noted the importance of staying in rhythm, as the team seeks to become MLB's first repeat champion in 25 years.</p>
