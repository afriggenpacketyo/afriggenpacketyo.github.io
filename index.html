        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has approved a settlement between the NCAA and its athletes, paving the way for schools to directly compensate athletes, marking a historic shift in college sports. The agreement allows schools to share up to $20.5 million with athletes annually and allocates $2.7 billion over the next decade to former players who were previously restricted from revenue sharing. NCAA President Charlie Baker stated the settlement would stabilize college sports by enabling direct financial benefits to student-athletes and regulating third-party NIL agreements. The professionalization of college athletics is expected to impact recruitment and potentially lead to program adjustments at various institutions. Optimism regarding the new framework is tempered by concerns about potential impacts on walk-on athletes and the equitable distribution of resources.</p>

          <p>Chicago Police Officer Krystal Rivera was accidentally shot and killed by a fellow officer while pursuing a suspect in Chatham. Officers were conducting an investigatory stop when the suspect fled into an apartment, leading to a confrontation where a second individual pointed a rifle at the officers. During the incident, an officer's weapon discharged, unintentionally striking Rivera, who later died at the hospital after the vehicle transporting her caught fire due to a mechanical issue. The Chicago Office of Police Accountability is investigating the shooting, including reviewing body camera footage to determine the circumstances of the investigatory stop. The loss of Officer Rivera is a profound tragedy for the Chicago Police Department, and her dedication to protecting the city will be remembered.</p>

          <p>Multiple immigration enforcement operations conducted by Homeland Security Investigations, the DEA, and the FBI across Los Angeles led to the arrest of dozens of individuals and sparked widespread protests. Federal agents executed search warrants in areas such as the Westlake District, downtown L.A., and South L.A., resulting in approximately 44 administrative arrests. During one of the operations, the president of the Service Employees International Union-United Service Workers West, David Huerta, was taken into custody and allegedly injured. Community leaders and elected officials, including L.A. Mayor Karen Bass and Senator Alex Padilla, have condemned the operations, citing concerns about sowing terror in communities and disrupting basic principles of safety. The events have ignited a debate over immigration enforcement tactics and their impact on immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>Former Osceola County Sheriff Marcos Lopez has been arrested on charges of racketeering and conspiracy related to an illegal gambling operation. Prosecutors allege that Lopez profited approximately $700,000 from the operation, which involved slot machines, a lottery, and a "gambling house" at a business called the Fusion Social Club in Kissimmee. The illegal gambling operation reportedly generated over $21.6 million over the years, and four other individuals face similar charges. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suspended Lopez following his arrest, appointing a Florida Highway Patrol officer as interim sheriff. The community's trust in law enforcement has been shaken, and the legal proceedings will determine the extent of Lopez's involvement.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been brought back to the U.S. to face federal criminal charges.

Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that the Salvadoran government agreed to return Abrego Garcia to face the charges after being presented with an arrest warrant. Abrego Garcia's attorney contends that his client is not going to be convicted of these crimes and that the government abused its power.

          <p>A lawsuit has been filed against Sonoma County, California, alleging that code enforcement is using drones to take aerial images of private properties without warrants. The ACLU claims the county has used drones over 700 times to find code violations, raising concerns about privacy and unreasonable searches. The lawsuit argues that the county's drone policy violates the California Constitution and residents' right to privacy. Residents report feeling violated and concerned about the ongoing surveillance of their properties.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines is canceling over a dozen flights daily due to tariffs hindering its ability to accept delivery of new aircraft. The airline is delaying the delivery of two Embraer 175 regional jets to avoid incurring additional tariff-related costs. President Trump's tariff agenda has disrupted supply chains for businesses, forcing many to raise prices. Without the new aircraft, Alaska Airlines is cutting routes served by multiple flights to minimize disruption for passengers.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly suggested creating a new political party in the U.S., potentially escalating his feud with President Trump. Musk posted a poll on X asking his followers if it's time to create a new political party representing the "80% in the middle." He endorsed the name "America Party," resembling his political action committee, America PAC. This move could signal Musk's intention to remain engaged in politics and challenge Trump's influence. The feasibility of starting a new political party remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Tesla is facing massive challenges trying to get back on track after a disastrous first quarter, and those headwinds strengthened considerably this week as CEO Elon Musk officially concluded his term with the Trump administration. After Musk called the "one, big beautiful bill" an "abomination" and rallied his followers on X to "kill the bill," Trump said Musk had gone "CRAZY" and threatened to end government contracts and cut off subsidies for Musk's companies. The rift sent Tesla shares plummeting 14% on Thursday, wiping out roughly $152 billion in value. A senior White House official told NBC News on Friday that the president was "not interested" in having a call with Musk to resolve their feud.</p>
