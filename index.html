          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is scheduled to address several hundred high-ranking U.S. military officers at a rare gathering at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia. According to officials, Hegseth will use the meeting to personally convey his vision for restoring a "warrior ethos" within the armed forces and present new standards to achieve this goal. The unusual summons for officers in command positions from across the globe has raised questions about logistics, costs, and security. The brief but significant event is expected to outline a new direction for how the U.S. military will conduct itself under his leadership.</p>

          <p>One year after Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic flooding and landslides in western North Carolina, volunteer pilots are reflecting on their critical role in the immediate aftermath. With roads washed out and communications down, pilots from companies like Total Flight Solutions and networks like Carolina Aviators Network were among the first to witness the destruction and conduct rescue missions. They flew dozens of missions daily, rescuing stranded residents and air-dropping essential supplies like food and medicine. The coordinated effort, supported by groups like the United Cajun Navy, highlights the immense community response that saved hundreds of lives before larger-scale relief could arrive.</p>

          <p>South Korea is facing a severe demographic crisis as its birth rate, which fell to a record low of 0.721 in 2023, threatens to undermine decades of economic progress. Projections from the Bank of Korea and the Korea Development Institute warn that the shrinking workforce could lead to a sustained economic slowdown and potential contraction by the 2040s. Despite the government spending over $270 billion on pro-childbirth incentives, the measures have had little effect. This demographic cliff also poses significant challenges to the nation's pension system and military readiness, casting a shadow over the future of the "Miracle on the Han River."

          <p>Entrepreneurs are sharing their experiences of navigating the emotional and professional challenges of failed startups, highlighting the intense pressure and sense of identity loss that often accompanies such events. Founders like Ismael Dainehine and Ainars Klavins describe the difficulty of disappointing investors, laying off employees, and questioning their own abilities after their businesses closed. However, the article also notes that the skills gained from running a company, such as multitasking and a holistic business understanding, can make former founders highly valuable employees. Ultimately, reframing failure as a learning experience and focusing on a deep sense of purpose are key to bouncing back.</p>

          <p>To attract more foreign visitors and stimulate its tourism sector, Beijing has been progressively relaxing its visa requirements for entry into mainland China. The country now offers several options for visa-free travel, including a transit program that allows passport holders from 55 nations to stay for up to 10 days in many regions. Recently, China announced that Russian citizens can now stay for up to 30 days without a visa, adding to a growing list of nationalities granted similar privileges.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hungary is experiencing an increasingly aggressive and polarized public discourse, marked by hate speech and intense media pressure, particularly in the run-up to elections. The recent suicide of a police chief, who had been targeted by a pro-government newspaper, has highlighted the toxic political environment. Critics, including media law professor Gabor Polyak, point to the governing Fidesz party's strategy of dehumanizing opponents and flooding the public sphere with taxpayer-funded propaganda. In response, tens of thousands protested in Budapest against hate speech, while Prime Minister Viktor Orban continues to rally against perceived enemies, further hardening political divisions in the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sweeping UN economic and military sanctions are poised to be reimposed on Iran after the UK, France, and Germany triggered a dispute mechanism, accusing Tehran of failing to meet its nuclear deal commitments. The move comes after Iran expanded its banned nuclear activities following the US withdrawal from the 2016 accord. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has condemned the impending sanctions as "unjust and illegal," while a last-minute Russian and Chinese effort to delay them failed to gain support in the Security Council. The reimposition of sanctions, which includes an arms embargo and a ban on uranium enrichment, severely heightens regional tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Women's Rugby World Cup final between England and Canada represents more than just a title match; it's a clash between two vastly different funding models for the sport. England, the world's best-funded team, has 32 players on full-time professional contracts and benefits from the world's top domestic league. In stark contrast, Canada's players earn a fraction of that and the national team relied on a fundraising drive to cover its World Cup preparations. Despite this financial chasm, Canada has proven to be a formidable opponent, making the final a significant test case for whether targeted investment and clever preparation can compete with a fully professionalized system.</p>

While the team is now fully professional, many key players began their careers balancing elite rugby with demanding day jobs. Hooker Amy Cokayne serves as a police officer in the RAF, and veteran Marlie Packer, a member of the 2014 title-winning squad, was a plumber who took unpaid leave to compete. Other stars like Lark Atkin-Davies and Hannah Botterman worked as a teacher and a painter, respectively, underscoring the dedication required before full-time contracts became available.</p>

          <p>Since returning to office, President Donald Trump has expanded the use of presidential authority to target perceived political enemies, a promise of retribution he made during his campaign. His administration has openly encouraged the Justice Department to prosecute political opponents like former FBI Director James Comey, suggested revoking TV licenses of critical media outlets, and targeted law firms seen as adversaries. While supporters justify these actions as a response to the investigations Trump faced during the Biden administration, critics warn of a dramatic and norm-shattering shift toward authoritarianism. This approach reflects a fundamental belief within the administration that America faces an existential threat from leftist culture and a corrupt establishment.</p>

The movement echoes historical German anti-war protests but currently lacks a single, unified goal, according to conflict researcher Jannis Grimm.

The conflict arises after President Trump successfully pushed to strip public broadcasting of all federal subsidies.

          <h2>Supreme Court Allows Trump Administration's Freeze on Billions in Foreign Aid to Continue</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with its freeze on over $4 billion in foreign aid that was previously approved by Congress. In an emergency order, the court's conservative majority stated that the potential harm to the president's conduct of foreign affairs outweighed the harm to aid recipients. The three liberal justices dissented sharply, with Justice Elena Kagan arguing that the decision undermines the Constitution's separation of powers by allowing the executive branch to override Congress's spending authority. The ruling is a significant victory for the administration's policy of drastically reducing U.S. foreign aid operations.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech firms Huawei and AI start-up DeepSeek are at the forefront of China's drive to develop a domestic AI ecosystem independent of U.S. technology. Huawei recently unveiled its latest Ascend AI chips and hardware, designed to compete with Nvidia's processors, while DeepSeek announced a shift toward supporting these home-grown chips. This move toward self-reliance has been accelerated by U.S. export restrictions, which have inadvertently spurred innovation within China's tech industry. As Beijing encourages its tech giants to favor domestic alternatives, these companies are becoming key players in the nation's strategy to gain ground in the global tech rivalry.

          <h2>Federal Judge Rules MyPillow Founder Mike Lindell Defamed Smartmatic with False Election Claims</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that MyPillow founder and Trump ally Mike Lindell defamed Smartmatic by repeatedly making false statements that the company's voting machines rigged the 2020 presidential election. The judge identified 51 specific instances where Lindell falsely claimed Smartmatic interfered with results in Los Angeles County. While the ruling confirms the statements were false, the court has yet to determine if Lindell acted with "actual malice," a requirement for Smartmatic to collect damages. Lindell has vowed to continue his fight against voting machines, while Smartmatic stated it will seek nine-figure damages for the harm caused by his disinformation campaign.</p>

          <p>U.S. Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley is facing criticism for his pairings and strategy after Europe established a commanding 5 ½ to 2 ½ lead on the first day of competition at Bethpage. Despite a heavy foursomes loss, Bradley has decided to send out the same pairing of Collin Morikawa and Harris English to face the same European duo of Rory McIlroy and Tommy Fleetwood on Saturday. Bradley defended his decision, stating the team will not panic and will stick to its original plan. The American players struggled on the greens, and the captain emphasized the need to reset their mindset as they play from behind.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has issued a public health alert for certain ready-to-eat pasta meals sold at Walmart and Trader Joe's due to potential contamination with listeria. The warning covers Walmart's Marketside Linguine with Beef Meatballs & Marinara Sauce and Trader Joe's Cajun Style Blackened Chicken Breast Fettuccine Alfredo. The bacteria strain may be linked to a deadly outbreak earlier this year tied to pre-made chicken alfredo meals that killed four people. While no new illnesses have been reported, consumers are urged to discard the products, which may still be in their refrigerators, as the investigation into the contamination source continues.</p>
