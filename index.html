          <p>A unique recycling company in Miami, Sneaker Impact, collects used sneakers from donation boxes and other drop-off locations across the United States, processing over a million shoes annually. The company sorts the shoes, sending reusable pairs to developing countries like Haiti and Honduras, where they are resold in mom-and-pop shops, creating microbusiness opportunities. Shoes that cannot be reused are crushed and recycled into materials like foam, rubber, and textiles, which are then used to make flooring, mats, tiles, and even sandals. Sneaker Impact aims to reduce waste and promote environmentally friendly business practices, hoping other companies will replicate their model to combat landfills. </p>

          <p>Cassie Ventura concluded four days of testimony in the criminal trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs, stating she would return her $20 million settlement if it meant never participating in his "humiliating" drug-fueled sex parties, referred to as "freak-offs." During intense questioning, Ventura revealed graphic details about her decade-long relationship with Combs, including alleged physical violence and coerced participation in sexual encounters. Combs' defense attempted to highlight Ventura's financial incentives for her accusations, suggesting she was struggling financially before filing her lawsuit, but Ventura refuted this claim, emphasizing her desire for agency and autonomy free from the trauma of the "freak-offs," which she said caused her physical injuries and stifled her career.</p>

          <p>Newly leaked audio from Joe Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur reveals that Biden admitted to keeping a classified document related to Afghanistan after his vice presidency, stating it was "for posterityâ€™s sake." Biden initially claimed he didn't know why he had the document but later suggested it was related to his views on Afghanistan and technology's impact on international societies. The audio also contains instances where Biden appeared confused, struggling to recall the year of his son's death and when he left the vice presidency. The release of the audio followed demands from congressional lawmakers seeking insight into Biden's memory lapses and mental acuity during the investigation into his handling of classified documents.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is considering closing two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its restructuring plans, according to a company source. This move follows Nissan's announcement earlier in the week that it would shut seven vehicle plants and cut 20,000 jobs globally after experiencing a net loss of 670.90 billion yen for fiscal 2024. The plants under consideration are Nissan's main Oppama plant and the Shonan plant of its unit Nissan Shatai Co., which together account for approximately 30 percent of Nissan's domestic production capacity. The decision remains uncertain as discussions with labor unions, parts makers, and municipalities are pending.</p>

          <p>Audio recordings from a 2023 interview with former President Joe Biden have surfaced, revealing instances of memory lapses during questioning by a Justice Department investigator. Biden appeared to struggle with recalling the year he left office as vice-president and the date of his son Beau's death. The audio, obtained by Axios, is part of Special Counsel Robert Hur's investigation into Biden's handling of classified documents, during which Hur described Biden as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory." The release of the audio has renewed scrutiny of Biden's cognitive abilities.</p>

          <p>A four-minute audio clip from President Joseph R. Biden Jr.â€™s 2023 special counsel interview was released, revealing the president struggling to recall key dates and speaking softly. The audio was published by Axios as the Trump administration made plans to release the full interview recording. The clip shows Mr. Biden stumbling over the years his son died and Donald J. Trump was first elected, and when he left office as vice president.

          <p>The administrator of an Islamic religious and educational complex in Pakistan denied claims by India that the site is a terrorist hub, following a missile strike that killed three people. The facility, located in Punjab province, was one of six sites targeted by Indian missiles and airstrikes after an attack in India-administered Kashmir. The administrator asserted that the complex has no ties with any militant groups and is overseen by government-appointed officials. Despite the damage to the mosque and residential buildings, the facility remains committed to its educational mission, calling for peace and dialogue between the two nations.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for the Chicago area as a fast-moving wall of dust significantly reduced visibility across the city and suburbs. The National Weather Service confirmed this was only the second time in its history that it issued a dust storm warning for the Chicago metropolitan area. The dust storm, caused by high winds blowing over dry farmlands, led to near-zero visibility on major interstates, prompting ground stops at O'Hare and Midway airports. Showers and storms mixed with the dust, resulting in reports of "mud rain" in some areas, with wind gusts reaching over 70 miles per hour.</p>

          <p>In a New York Times opinion piece, Michelle Goldberg discusses the Democratic Party's need for a reckoning regarding their handling of Joe Biden's declining health and cognitive abilities. She argues that the party's insistence that Biden was fit for office was a form of self-deception driven by groupthink and risk aversion. While some blame Biden's inner circle for covering up his condition, Goldberg suggests that the broader issue is the party's failure to acknowledge and address the obvious signs of his infirmity, ultimately leading to a disastrous political misstep.</p>

          <p>Moody's downgraded the credit rating of the United States, citing rising debt levels and a lack of meaningful action to curtail U.S. debt. The downgrade, to one notch below the highest triple-A rating, reflects concerns about Washington's fiscal management and the potential for further increases in debt due to tax cuts. The downgrade means that all three major credit rating agencies no longer give the United States their best rating, potentially leading to higher borrowing costs. The White House blamed the previous administration for the downgrade, while some conservatives called for deeper spending cuts.</p>

The White House criticized Moody's, stating they were focused on fixing the previous administration's fiscal mess.
