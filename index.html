          <p>Tennis star Novak Djokovic began his US Open campaign with a resilient first-round victory against American teenager Learner Tien, marking his pursuit of a record 25th major title. The 38-year-old Serb displayed his characteristic grand slam tenacity, navigating through physical issues and a time violation to secure a 6-1, 7-6 (3), 6-2 win under the Arthur Ashe Stadium lights. This triumph was his first singles match since the Wimbledon semi-finals, highlighting his determination as he embarks on another significant tournament. The challenging match against the 19-year-old Tien tested Djokovic's resolve, especially in the draining second set, before he ultimately asserted his dominance, overcoming a foot blister and a heated debate with the chair umpire to advance.</p>

          <p>Mississippi health officials have declared a public health emergency, responding to the state's infant mortality rate reaching its highest point in over a decade, almost twice the national average. This urgent measure seeks to address the crisis, which significantly impacts Black infants and is primarily attributed to factors like congenital malformations, premature birth, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Proposed solutions include expanding prenatal services, regionalizing obstetric care, and bolstering community health worker programs. The article underscores critical challenges posed by federal funding cuts to maternal and infant health initiatives and potential adverse effects of Medicaid policy changes on healthcare access for vulnerable women.</p>

          <p>Russian officials reported that Ukrainian drones caused an overnight fire at a nuclear plant in Russia's Kursk region and another at a major fuel export terminal in the Leningrad region. These alleged strikes occurred on Ukraine's 34th Independence Day. While the nuclear plant fire was rapidly extinguished with no reported injuries or abnormal radiation levels, a transformer sustained damage. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed to intercept 95 Ukrainian drones, whereas Ukraine stated it shot down or jammed 48 of 72 Russian drones and decoys launched overnight. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, speaking from Kyiv, reiterated his commitment to building a secure and peaceful Ukraine, despite ongoing conflict.</p>

This directive from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth signifies an escalation in President Trump's federal intervention into the nation's capital, despite local police data indicating a recent decline in violent crime. The troops, initially unarmed and primarily tasked with protecting landmarks and crowd control, will now operate under strict Rules for the Use of Force, permitting weapon use only in response to imminent threats. This development unfolds amidst the presence of nearly 2,000 National Guard members in the city.</p>

          <p>Chinese property giant Evergrande has been delisted from the Hong Kong stock market, marking a significant milestone in its spectacular collapse under immense debt. Once China's largest real estate firm, its stock market valuation plummeted by over 99%. The delisting was deemed inevitable after the company was ordered to be wound up in January 2024, following its inability to present a workable plan for its billions in overseas liabilities. This event highlights the severe ongoing property crisis, which has been a major drag on China's economy, leading to layoffs, reduced consumer spending, and a reorientation of government priorities towards high-tech industries.</p>

Concerns are rising that Trump's policies, designating some cartels as terrorist organizations, could inadvertently penalize victims forced to pay extortions, leading to rejections or detentions for those seeking refuge.</p>

          <p>Lourdes, a revered site in southern France, has seen over 70 medical miracles officially recognized by the Catholic Church across 163 years, attracting millions of pilgrims annually. The Lourdes Office of Medical Observations, under Dr. Alessandro de Franciscis, meticulously investigates thousands of reported cures, often over decades. This rigorous process involves world-renowned doctors and researchers who ascertain if recoveries are sudden, complete, lasting, and defy current medical explanation. While some skeptics question the historical scientific rigor, no one has successfully disproven the office's findings, with recent analyses, including one from the University of Arizona, affirming the credibility of their conclusions.</p>

          <p>Nearly 24 years after the 9/11 attacks, critical evidence, including a video of Saudi national Omar al-Bayoumi filming the U.S. Capitol and an airplane sketch with a descent calculation, has surfaced but was never shared with key FBI field agents or top intelligence officials. This information, seized in 2001, came to light through a lawsuit by 9/11 families against the Saudi government. Retired FBI and CIA officials expressed shock and anger over the oversight, believing it could have significantly aided investigations and potentially implicated Bayoumi as an al-Qaeda facilitator. The lack of sharing raises serious questions about intelligence failures.</p>

          <p>Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse has been ousted as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), a move confirmed by senior defense officials, though no specific reason was provided. This firing has sparked concerns among intelligence committee leaders and DIA employees about the Trump administration's alleged politicization of intelligence work. The DIA had previously produced an assessment on military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities that contradicted President Trump's public claims about their effectiveness. This incident follows the recent removal of other high-ranking military officials, further fueling anxieties within the intelligence community regarding leadership stability and political interference.</p>

          <p>A homeowner's association (HOA) issued a warning to a resident for charging a Tesla in their driveway using the vehicle's standard Level 1 cable, not due to the electric vehicle itself, but because of the perceived "ugly" appearance of the extension cord. The HOA's letter cited a rule against "Electrical chords running along the ground," which many online commenters, including an energy engineer, contended was a misinterpretation of the National Electrical Code (NEC 625). This peculiar incident underscores the often-micromanaging tendencies of HOAs and their emphasis on aesthetics, sometimes resulting in questionable enforcement against otherwise compliant and common practices.</p>

          <p>A new case of the flesh-eating screwworm parasite has been confirmed in a person in Maryland, traced back to recent travel from Guatemala, marking a significant public health development in the US this year. This detection occurs as an escalating outbreak of the parasite, known for devastating cattle and wildlife, progresses northward from Central America. The affected individual received prompt treatment, and comprehensive prevention measures were subsequently implemented. This incident has raised concerns within the beef and cattle futures market, already grappling with record-high prices due to tight supplies.

          <p>A fiery car crash on Interstate 15 in Temecula, California, resulted in four deaths when a BMW M4, driven recklessly, crossed the concrete median into oncoming southbound traffic. The BMW collided with a Nissan Sentra and immediately burst into flames. Three passengers in the BMW—a 23-year-old woman, a 14-year-old boy, and a 15-year-old girl—were killed, as was the 35-year-old driver of the Sentra. The 25-year-old BMW driver sustained major injuries but survived and was pulled from the wreckage by Good Samaritans. Alcohol was not a factor, but charges against the BMW driver are pending as the California Highway Patrol investigates.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners slugger Cal Raleigh etched his name into baseball history by hitting his 48th and 49th home runs against the Athletics, setting a new single-season record for catchers. This remarkable achievement surpassed Salvador Perez's 2021 total and marked Raleigh's ninth multi-home run game of the season, an unprecedented feat for switch-hitters in major league history. The 28-year-old, a first-time All-Star, has showcased an extraordinary power surge, building on his 27, 30, and 34 homers from previous seasons. Raleigh's exceptional performance firmly places him among baseball's elite, with the potential to become the first American League catcher to lead the major leagues outright in home runs.</p>
