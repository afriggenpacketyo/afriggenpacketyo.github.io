            <p>Blue Origin successfully launched its New Shepard rocket with an all-female crew, marking the first all-female spaceflight since 1963. The crew included pop star Katy Perry, Jeff Bezos's fiancée Lauren Sanchez, journalist Gayle King, and former NASA scientists. The sub-orbital flight lasted approximately 11 minutes, reaching a height of about 60 miles above Earth. This mission, officially called NS-31, took off from Blue Origin's Launch Site One in West Texas, fulfilling Perry's 15-year dream of going to space and furthering the company's goal of accessible space travel.</p>

            <p>Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) is introducing the Tax Delinquencies and Overdue Debts are Government Employees' Responsibility (Tax DODGER) Act to address tax delinquencies among federal employees. The bill mandates the IRS to publish an annual report on tax delinquencies of current and retired federal employees and could make applicants with "seriously delinquent" tax debt ineligible for federal jobs. Ernst highlighted a Treasury Inspector General report showing over 2,000 IRS employees with past-due balances totaling more than $12 million. The legislation seeks to end the 'rules for thee, but not for me' mentality in Washington by ensuring government employees pay their taxes.</p>

            <p>Hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio voiced concerns about global trade disruptions, mounting U.S. debt, and emerging world powers threatening the existing international economic order.

            <p>Investors can navigate bond market volatility using a bond ladder strategy, which involves investing in a range of treasury maturities and holding them to maturity for regular income. This approach can offer exposure to treasury bonds without the worry of short-term price swings. The LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) uses this strategy, investing in treasuries from 30-day issues to 10-year bonds, distributing roughly 11% monthly through 2035. Experts recommend this strategy for investors seeking shelter in the market storm, providing a steady income stream with a decades-long horizon. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Saving money in an inflationary environment requires earning a return that matches or exceeds inflation, and certificates of deposit (CDs) can help. CD rates vary depending on the term, with short-term CDs currently offering competitive rates due to the inverted yield curve. Strategies for securing good CD rates include looking at online banks, which often have lower overhead costs, and considering short-term CDs. A practical approach is to ladder your CDs, buying some with one-year, two-year, and three-year terms to take advantage of high rates while saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Filing for a tax extension allows taxpayers more time to complete their returns, but it does not extend the payment deadline. The IRS will grant an extension if Form 4868 is filed before the April 15 deadline, providing a new deadline of October 15. While this avoids penalties for late filing, penalties still apply to unpaid taxes. Taxpayers should estimate their tax liability and pay it by the original deadline to avoid additional fees. It's crucial to plan and complete taxes even with an extension to avoid further delays.</p>

The decision comes amid a booming market for obesity treatments dominated by injectable drugs from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.</p>
