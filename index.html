          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has responded defiantly to new U.S. tariff threats, stating that while Beijing does not want a trade war, it is not afraid of one. The statement accused the U.S. of a "double standard" following President Trump's promise to impose 100% tariffs after China tightened export controls on rare earth minerals, a move which rattled U.S. stock markets. Beijing defended its export controls as a legitimate measure to safeguard national security and world peace, asserting they do not constitute an export ban and will have a limited impact on global supply chains. The escalating tensions have undermined recent trade negotiations and cast doubt on a potential meeting between the two nations' leaders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A mass shooting at a bar on St. Helena Island, South Carolina, has resulted in the deaths of four people and injuries to at least twenty others. The incident occurred early Sunday at Willie's Bar and Grill when a large crowd was present. Beaufort County Sheriff's Office deputies arrived to find multiple victims with gunshot wounds, four of whom were pronounced dead at the scene. Among the injured, four were reported to be in critical condition at local hospitals. The investigation is ongoing, and authorities have asked for patience as they process the tragic event.</p>

          <p>Actress Barbara Stock, who played Liz Adams on the hit series "Dallas," revealed she was unaware her character was being written off until her last day on set. She now realizes a scene where her character was packing a suitcase should have been a clear indicator of her departure. Despite her initial heartbreak at not being part of the show's final season, Stock holds no hard feelings and has fond memories of the cast, including stars Larry Hagman and Patrick Duffy. After leaving acting in the early 2000s to focus on her family and a new career in interior design, she has no regrets about her decision.</p>

          <p>A state of emergency has been declared across New Jersey in anticipation of a powerful nor'easter moving up the East Coast. The storm is expected to bring significant coastal flooding, inland flash floods, and winds up to 60 mph through Monday. The National Weather Service has issued coastal flood warnings and wind advisories for the region, including New York City and Long Island. In preparation for the storm's impact, which includes potential beach erosion, some airports from Washington, D.C. to Boston have already reported flight delays and cancellations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vice President JD Vance has accused Democrats of engaging in "hostage-taking" by refusing to fund the government without an extension of expiring health insurance tax credits. As the government shutdown entered its twelfth day, Vance stated that the administration will not negotiate with leaders who have taken the federal government hostage over a policy dispute.

The stalemate continues with both parties trading blame and over 4,000 federal workers receiving layoff notices.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his new memoir, "Life, Law & Liberty," former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy reflects on how his upbringing in Sacramento, California, shaped his judicial philosophy. He writes that the West taught him the importance of economic freedom, personal liberty, and treating people as individuals beyond their background. Kennedy describes his unexpected path to the judiciary and his hope that his Western perspective, with its emphasis on community, tolerance, and dignity, guided him in his long service on the nation's highest court. The memoir aims to explain his journey and his commitment to the nation's founding principles.</p>

          <p>Jeremy Allen White, star of the acclaimed series "The Bear," is taking on the role of Bruce Springsteen in the new film "Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere." The movie focuses on the creation of Springsteen's 1982 album "Nebraska," a period when the musician was experiencing significant personal turmoil. White discusses the challenge of portraying the iconic artist, his deep dive into Springsteen's struggles with mental health, and how he found common ground with the musician's feeling of being an observer in his own life.

Wade. Kennedy emphasized the importance of civility and rational discussion in public life, warning that its absence puts democracy in danger.

          <p>An unsanctioned "Pub Crawl" event in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, led to two firearms disturbances and an officer being injured. Police responded to reports of males brandishing guns, leading to the arrest of a 17-year-old who was found with a loaded handgun after resisting an officer. During a large disturbance involving about 100 people, an officer was knocked down and sustained a non-life-threatening head injury. Another suspect was arrested after a foot pursuit where he was seen with a handgun.

          <p>Human rights advocates and lawyers are expressing alarm over the increasing presence of Border Patrol agents in major U.S. cities, far from the nation's borders. These agents, trained for border interdiction, are now being used for civil immigration enforcement in urban areas, leading to concerns about aggressive and potentially unconstitutional tactics. The agency has legal authority to operate within 100 miles of any international boundary, which includes most major cities, but their deployment in this capacity is a recent shift. Critics argue the agents are ill-suited for community policing and bring a culture of combative enforcement that may violate civil rights.</p>

This article argues that the responsibility for this decline in productivity lies not with AI technology itself, but with employers. It posits that many businesses fail to invest in proper training, establish clear AI policies, or develop strategic plans for implementation. Instead of being a magical solution, AI is a tool that requires investment in the people using it to be effective, and the failure to do so is what ultimately produces low-quality output.</p>

Screenwriter Noah Oppenheim and Bigelow hope the film reminds audiences that despite the end of the Cold War, the nuclear era persists.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the appointment of conservative commentator Bari Weiss to a leadership role at CBS News is not a sudden shift but the result of a five-decade-long plan to make media more pro-business. The author traces this strategy back to the 1971 Powell memo, which urged corporations to exert influence over news outlets to counter criticism of the free enterprise system. The article contends that this long-term project, aided by media deregulation and consolidation, has aimed to transform journalism from an adversary of power into its champion, culminating in appointments like Weiss's.</p>

          <p>China's National Administration of State Secrets Protection has issued a stern warning to staff in propaganda departments and other classified units to prevent the leaking of confidential information. An official article stated that some news workers, in a pursuit of novelty, have prioritized publicity over confidentiality, endangering national security. The authorities cautioned that public information released by state-run entities is closely scrutinized by foreign powers. The directive calls for bolstering confidentiality reviews to stop sensitive information from being inadvertently disclosed in media interviews or on official websites.</p>

          <h2>Collapse of UK Spy Case Against Alleged Chinese Agents Sparks Political Blame Game</h2>

          <p>The collapse of a high-profile UK espionage case against two men accused of spying for China has ignited a political firestorm. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) dropped the charges, stating that the government did not provide crucial evidence needed for a conviction, specifically regarding China's status as a national security threat during the time of the alleged offenses. Conservative critics suggest the prime minister's national security adviser, who has sought closer ties with Beijing, was responsible for withholding the information. The government denies ministerial involvement and insists it could only act based on the official policy in place at the time.</p>

          <p>This advice column addresses the dilemma of enjoying the Harry Potter series while disagreeing with author J.K. Rowling's views on transgender issues. It argues that one can separate the art from the artist by critically engaging with the work's positive messages about rejecting discrimination, while also acknowledging its flaws and the author's harmful statements. Rather than simply boycotting or offsetting purchases with donations, the article suggests fans should actively interrogate the text in community with others. This approach allows for continued appreciation of the series while fostering a more nuanced and socially conscious fandom.</p>

          <p>Scottish National Party leader John Swinney has stated that the "precedent is on my side" in his push for a second independence referendum. His strategy, backed at the party's conference, is to treat the next Holyrood election as a de-facto poll on independence, arguing that winning a majority of seats would create a mandate for a new vote, just as it did in 2011. This position puts him at odds with the UK Labour government, which has stated it does not support another referendum. Swinney contends that independence is the best way to improve living standards in Scotland.</p>

          <p>Prominent MAGA figures have voiced support for El Salvador's authoritarian president, Nayib Bukele, who called on the Trump administration to impeach "corrupt judges" in the United States. This comes amid what experts describe as unprecedented threats against the U.S. judiciary, with a significant increase in threats against federal judges recorded in 2025. Critics argue that this rhetoric, employed by administration officials and allies, is a tactic used by authoritarians globally to undermine judicial independence and subvert democratic accountability when courts rule against their political agenda.</p>

          <p>A close ally of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, Blaise Ingoglia, is leading an initiative to audit Democratic-run cities and counties for what he calls "excessively wasteful" spending. The move is facing strong pushback from local officials, such as those in Broward County, who argue the state's calculations are based on inaccurate data and ignore unfunded mandates from the state legislature. The initiative is also drawing criticism for what some see as intimidation tactics, after armed officers were sent to the home of a retiree who sent Ingoglia a non-threatening postcard critical of his actions.</p>

          <p>Scottish football club Rangers is in a state of disarray after its top choice for manager, Steven Gerrard, turned down the job for a second time. Gerrard reportedly flew to London for talks but ultimately decided the timing was not right, with a reluctance to work under the club's new sporting director structure cited as a key issue. Having gone all-in on the popular former manager, the club's board is now forced to consider other candidates for the high-pressure role. The situation highlights the challenges facing the club, which has a new ownership group and a different operational structure than during Gerrard's first successful stint.</p>
