          <p>A SpaceX Starship rocket exploded during a routine test at the Starbase facility in Texas, causing a large fireball but with no reported injuries, according to SpaceX and local authorities. The rocket "experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase," and an investigation is underway to determine the cause of the explosion. Elon Musk hopes Starship will be used for NASA's Artemis missions to the Moon and eventually for colonizing Mars, with plans to transport Optimus robots to Mars by 2026 and potential human landings as early as 2029. The explosion raises concerns about the reliability of the massive rocket and may impact future launch schedules. The optimism score for this event is relatively low due to the setback in space exploration efforts. </p>

          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has ruled out dissolving the lower house of parliament for the time being, according to a lawmaker. This decision makes same-day elections for both chambers of parliament in July unlikely, as the ruling bloc led by Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party does not hold a majority in the House of Representatives. Yoshihiko Noda, head of Japan's main opposition party, stated that a political vacuum should be avoided amid concerns over higher U.S. tariffs and rising tensions in the Middle East. Ishiba had previously expressed readiness to dissolve the lower house if a no-confidence motion was submitted. </p>

          <p>Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel is calling on the UK government to support the US if it decides to take action against Iran. Patel argues that the UK cannot "hide behind legal advice at a time of crisis" and should work with allies like the US and Israel. Foreign Secretary David Lammy has traveled to Washington to meet his US counterpart Marco Rubio, following President Trump's consideration of joining Israeli strikes against Iran. There are reports that the Attorney General Lord Hermer has privately raised questions over the legality of Israel's actions, which could restrict the government's ability to support any US action. </p>

          <p>The escalating conflict between Israel and Iran has led to a significant increase in insurance costs for ships sailing through the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. Marine insurers are now charging 0.2% of a ship's value for journeys into the Gulf, up from 0.125% before Israel's attack on Iran. War risk insurance rates have also increased for the Red Sea, and coverage for ports in Israel has more than tripled to 0.7%. The reassessment of shipping insurance costs reflects the deteriorating security environment in the Middle East, with potential for broader conflict and U.S. intervention. </p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces a dilemma regarding U.S. tariffs ahead of a crucial national election, as he seeks to prioritize "Japan first." Ishiba's efforts to secure a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump over tariffs ended without an agreement, highlighting the challenges of balancing national interests and trade relations. Japan is wary of yielding to Trump's "America First" pressure, particularly concerning the 25 percent auto tariff, which is critical to the export-driven Japanese economy. With a House of Councillors election approaching, Ishiba must navigate these trade negotiations carefully to avoid voter backlash and economic repercussions.  (not investment advice)</p>

Experts suggest that Trump is acting with greater intensity than other noted autocrats, and that his efforts to assert control over the armed forces are particularly concerning. The recent shooting of a state legislator and her husband in Minnesota, allegedly by a Trump supporter, is seen as creating a climate of fear. </p>

          <p>South African politician Julius Malema has been denied entry to the UK by the Home Office, which deemed him "non-conducive to the public good." The UK government cited his vocal support for Hamas, including a speech he made after the October 7 attacks, and his threat to call for the "slaughter of white people" and to "take up arms." The decision highlights the UK's stance against extremism and hate speech. The UK deemed it "undesirable" to grant him entry based on his statements. </p>

          <p>Japan's decision to make high school tuition virtually free, even for private institutions, is raising alarm among educators and policy experts, who fear it could lead to an exodus from public schools and exacerbate inequalities. Critics argue that the policy, implemented as part of a political deal, lacks adequate support for struggling public schools, which are already facing declining enrollment and budget deficits. While the aim is to ease households' financial burdens, the policy may undermine the role of public schools as safety nets for students with diverse needs. Experts emphasize the need for the government to provide resources and a vision for the high school system.  (not investment advice)</p>

Trump, who previously signed an executive order banning transgender participants from women’s sports, questioned the players about whether a woman could make their team. When Juventus's general manager, Damien Comolli, attempted to deflect the query, Trump insisted that transgender women should play with women. This occurred as the US Supreme Court ruled in favor of a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming care for minors, highlighting increasing hostility towards trans people in the US. </p>

          <p>Researchers in China have achieved controlled nuclear reactions between hydrogen and lithium in a compact device for the first time, marking a breakthrough in neutron generation technology. This portable particle gun uses an electromagnetic technique to smash hydrogen protons into lithium atoms, producing a nail-size beam with 10 billion fast neutrons per second. Each neutron packs 3 million electron volts of energy, similar to particles emitted during an atomic bomb explosion. Neutrons are tiny particles inside atoms with no electric charge, allowing them to slip through materials. </p>
