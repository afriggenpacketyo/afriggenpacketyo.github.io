          <p>The United States is undertaking a partial evacuation of its embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, due to increasing security risks attributed to heightened tensions with Iran. Non-essential personnel and their families are being moved out of the country. Officials cited potential Iranian retaliation against US sites in Iraq, possibly in response to a potential Israeli operation against Iran, as the reason for the evacuation. Despite the situation, US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff still plans to hold talks with Iran about its nuclear program. The US continues to assess personnel posture at all embassies. The situation is tense, with potential for escalation. Optimism is tempered by the inherent instability.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is under curfew for the second consecutive night following nearly a week of unrest sparked by US immigration raids, resulting in numerous arrests for curfew violations, assault, and obstruction. The National Guard and Marines have been deployed to help quell the unrest, with some National Guard troops authorized to detain individuals until police can arrest them. Mayor Karen Bass attributes the demonstrations to President Trump's immigration raids, which she says have caused fear and panic among residents. The military deployment is estimated to cost $134 million, with Trump vowing to use every asset to quell the violence. The situation remains tense, with ongoing political disputes between state and federal officials.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, Chinese companies are continuing to expand into the U.S. market. Camera company Insta360, for example, considers the U.S. one of its biggest markets, and home appliance company Hisense aims to become the top seller of television sets in the U.S. within two years. This expansion trend is evolving as Chinese businesses build international brands with offices in different regions, hiring local employees. While growth at home has slowed, these companies remain unfazed by geopolitical risks, focusing on user-centric research and development to meet consumer needs.</p>

          <p>A juror in Sean "Diddy" Combs' federal trial for sex crimes has sparked credibility concerns, potentially leading to a mistrial. The U.S. Attorney's Office raised issues about the juror's lack of candor, suggesting potential bias. The defense objected to the juror's removal, and the judge will rule after reviewing submitted letters. The trial continues with testimony from Diddy's ex-girlfriend, who described alleged drug use and hotel parties. The trial is expected to conclude by July 4, with Diddy maintaining his innocence throughout the proceedings.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called on government officials to improve their ability to anticipate challenges and implement policies effectively amidst a turbulent geopolitical environment. Li's comments come as China faces rising tensions with the West over trade and technology issues. Negotiations with the United States over tariffs and export controls are ongoing, and China is preparing for a major trade summit with the European Union in July. While recent talks with the U.S. have led to a framework for de-escalating tensions over rare earths and strategic technologies, the U.S. is maintaining tariffs on Chinese goods. The situation calls for adaptability and strategic foresight.</p>

          <p>China is entering the photonic chip market with the production of high-performance photonic chips that could power advances in artificial intelligence (AI), 6G, and quantum computing. Shanghai Jiao Tong University Chip Hub for Integrated Photonics Xplore (CHIPX) has begun producing 6-inch wafers for thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chips. These chips use light instead of electrical signals for information transmission, potentially overcoming limits for high-speed optical links.

          <p>Newspaper headlines are divided over the chancellor's Spending Review, with some describing it as "renewing Britain" and others as a "reckless splurge." The Daily Express warns of "tax pain," while the Guardian highlights the NHS and defence as "big winners." The Daily Mail criticizes the review as a "reckless splurge" that voters will be paying off for years. The Times reports that some departments, including the police, still face a "challenging" fiscal situation, and economists predict tax increases. The Daily Mirror welcomes the plans, saying they put "the needs of ordinary majority ahead of the privileged few."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump attended a performance of Les Misérables at the Kennedy Center against the backdrop of immigration protests in Los Angeles. The event was intended to boost fundraising for the Kennedy Center, but the president was met with a mix of cheers and boos. The performance and Trump's presence at the Kennedy Center sparked a heavy dose of irony, with some attendees highlighting the themes of revolution and social justice in the musical. The president's appearance was also marked by cultural ignorance and political commentary.</p>

          <p>A reopened nuclear cruise missile launch site in Okinawa reveals a dark legacy from the U.S. military occupation during the Cold War. The Mace B cruise missile launch site is the last remainder of four that were constructed in the 1960s. The site was opened to the public this spring, and it has drawn visitors who are interested in the history of nuclear weapons in Okinawa. The missiles deployed at the bases in Okinawa in the first half of the 1960s could strike China and parts of the Soviet Union.</p>

          <p>South Korea's newly elected President Lee Jae-myung is facing criticism for continuing the cycle of "revenge politics" by launching investigations into his predecessor, Yoon Suk Yeol, and his wife. Despite promising to break the cycle of political retaliation, Lee has approved special counsel investigations into Yoon's declaration of martial law and his wife's alleged corruption. Concerns are growing about the concentration of power in Lee's hands and the potential for him to protect himself after his term by passing new laws. Lee himself has faced legal cases, including allegations of corruption and election law violations.</p>

The Chinese fighter jet flew as close as 45 meters to the MSDF patrol plane on Saturday and passed in front of it on Sunday at a distance of around 900 meters.
