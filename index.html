          <p>Former investment banker and LAUSD superintendent Austin Beutner seems to be preparing a campaign to challenge Mayor Karen Bass in the 2026 Los Angeles mayoral election. Social media accounts briefly displayed "AUSTIN for LA MAYOR" branding before its removal, signaling his potential intentions. Beutner, who previously served as a high-level aide to Mayor Villaraigosa and publisher of the Los Angeles Times, would be a significant contender. His potential run comes amidst various crises faced by Mayor Bass, including a large budget shortfall and public criticism over emergency responses.</p>

          <h2>Judge Blocks California Tribes' Attempt to Sue Cardrooms Over Gaming Rights</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit by California casino-owning tribes against cardrooms, ruling that federal gambling law supersedes the state measure allowing the tribes to sue. The tribes argued they have exclusive rights to Las Vegas-style games, claiming cardrooms illegally cut into their revenues. This legal setback is part of a long-standing and costly dispute between the two gambling interests. The ruling means cities relying on cardroom taxes for essential services avoid an immediate financial threat, though tribes plan to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard troops to the Chicago area, amidst ongoing protests at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. The court upheld a district judge's ruling against the White House's request to deploy troops on city streets. However, it granted the Trump administration's request to keep the National Guard troops under federal control for now. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul hailed the decision as a victory for the state and local law enforcement.</p>

          <p>During the federal government shutdown, the Trump administration mistakenly issued reduction-in-force notices to key CDC employees, including those involved in responding to outbreaks and producing the weekly science journal. A federal health official attributed these errors to "coding errors," stating the affected employees would eventually have their terminations rescinded. Despite these rescissions, hundreds of HHS employees will still lose their jobs. This comes as the U.S. faces multiple public health threats, with concerns raised about the impact on critical services.</p>

Due to a broken bone and severe bleeding, Quaker was deemed unable to return to duty. The Horse Trust sanctuary will provide him with a well-deserved retirement.</p>
