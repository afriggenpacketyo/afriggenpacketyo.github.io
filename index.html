          <p>Shedeur Sanders, once projected as a high-round NFL draft pick, was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round after reported concerns about his attitude and work ethic during pre-draft interviews. Despite his talent, some NFL coaches felt Sanders was trying to dictate terms and lacked preparation on schematic packages. Sanders will face competition from other quarterbacks on the Browns roster, including Dillon Gabriel, Kenny Pickett, and Joe Flacco. Despite playing behind a weak offensive line in college, Sanders demonstrated resilience under pressure, but his transition to the NFL will require adapting to a more complex offensive system.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's reduction in federal jobs, hiring freezes, and attacks on DEI programs are destabilizing a traditional pathway to the middle class for many Black workers.

This shift is raising concerns about the fragility of the Black middle class and the potential for decreased opportunities in both the public and private sectors.

          <p>Former clients of Canadian tech entrepreneur Josh Adler allege they were defrauded after paying his company, ConvrtX, significant sums for start-up assistance. Customers worldwide claim they paid up to $245,000 for services like website and app development but received substandard or incomplete products. The company, launched in 2019, billed millions in sales but had few success stories, with complaints including legal threats and fake testimonials.

Despite facing legal challenges, media scrutiny, and moral condemnation, Trump's greatest threat is his own incompetence and instability, which will lead to his self-destruction. The piece calls for democratic means to contain and depose him, while emphasizing the hope that his hubris will ultimately be his undoing.</p>
