          <p>A devastating fire at the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, has resulted in the deaths of nine residents and left one critically injured. Firefighters arrived to a chaotic scene with heavy flames and rescued numerous individuals, though many perished either at the scene or in hospitals. The cause is under investigation but is not currently considered suspicious, while officials are examining the building's safety compliance and sprinkler systems. The incident has prompted discussions about firefighter staffing levels and the mental health impact on first responders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in the journal Pediatrics reveals a dramatic 763% increase in the rate of young children accidentally ingesting nicotine pouches between 2020 and 2023. These smoke-free products, such as Zyn, still contain nicotine, which can be highly toxic to children under six. Researchers analyzing calls to U.S. poison centers found that while pouch ingestions are a small fraction of all nicotine cases, they are more likely to lead to serious medical outcomes. Health advocates are calling for bans on flavorings in all nicotine products to reduce their appeal to both children and teens.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni has strongly refuted criticisms suggesting that Super Bowl-winning quarterback Jalen Hurts was merely a 'game manager' carried by a talented team. Sirianni praised Hurts' selflessness and adaptability, stating he will do whatever is necessary for the team to win, whether it involves passing or handing off the ball frequently. He emphasized that football is a team sport and that no quarterback or coach can achieve consistent success without skilled players around them. Hurts has been a two-time Pro Bowler and was named the Super Bowl LIX MVP, solidifying his elite status.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Victorville, California, have arrested a man for allegedly staging a prank involving a teddy bear that appeared to be made of human skin. The suspect, Hector Corona Villanueva, is accused of filing a false emergency report and planting the macabre object at a gas station, prompting a response from law enforcement. The San Bernardino County coroner quickly determined the bear was not made of human remains. The artist who created the prop confirmed she had sold it to a customer in the area but was unaware of their intentions, condemning the misuse of her work.</p>

          <p>The future of FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is uncertain following a heated dispute with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case, which has caused a rift within the MAGA movement. Bongino, a former Secret Service agent and right-wing media personality, reportedly stormed out of a meeting and is considering quitting his post. The conflict stems from unfulfilled expectations surrounding a supposed 'client list' that both Bongino and Bondi had previously hyped. This internal turmoil has placed Bongino, a controversial appointee, in a precarious position within the Trump administration.</p>

A drought declaration enables water companies to implement their contingency plans, which can include measures like hosepipe bans, to manage strained water resources. While the immediate cause is low rainfall, experts note that climate change and increasing water consumption are exacerbating the risk of future water shortages across the country.</p>

          <p>Shares of fintech companies like Block and PayPal rallied after analysts suggested that the impact of JPMorgan Chase's potential new fees for data access would be minimal. The bank is reportedly considering charging data aggregators like Plaid for access to customer financial information, which had caused a brief sell-off in the sector. However, firms like Evercore ISI and Morgan Stanley noted that the proposed costs are unlikely to break business models, especially for large fintechs that have diverse transaction methods. The rebound was also supported by broader market momentum and a rally in cryptocurrencies. (not investment advice)</p>

Three months after the trees were cut, Jacoby listed his home for nearly $10 million, with the listing highlighting 'sweeping views of the Atlantic Ocean.'

          <p>This article argues that Major League Baseball is missing a significant opportunity by not having its biggest stars, Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge, participate in the Home Run Derby. Ohtani has cited the physical toll of the current format as a reason for his absence, having experienced a performance decline after his only appearance in 2021. The author suggests the league should be flexible and modify the rules, such as by limiting swings or focusing on distance, to persuade its most popular players to compete. Ensuring their participation would not only boost viewership but also elevate the profiles of other talented players in the event.</p>

According to White House sources, Trump feels humiliated by Russian President Vladimir Putin's repeated defiance of his calls to de-escalate the conflict, making him appear weak. After months of attempting a diplomatic approach, Putin's continued aggression and rejection of a U.S.-proposed ceasefire have led Trump to take a more confrontational stance. This move aims to reassert his authority, even as the long-term reliability of U.S. support for Ukraine remains uncertain.</p>
