          <h2>Psychologist Warns Against Using Comparison in Relationships</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [other person]?" as particularly damaging to relationships. The article explains that such comparisons lead to insecurity and feelings of inadequacy in the recipient, who may start questioning their worth. The root cause is often a fear of openly communicating needs, leading to bottled-up frustrations that eventually erupt in harmful comparisons. The psychologist suggests that partners should focus on clear and direct communication of their needs to foster a secure and emotionally close relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump expressed uncertainty about whether people in the U.S. are entitled to due process rights, guaranteed by the Constitution. When asked if he agreed with Secretary of State Marco Rubio's assertion that all people in the U.S. are entitled to due process, Trump stated, "I don't know. I'm not, I’m not a lawyer. I don't know." He added that his lawyers would follow the Supreme Court's guidance. Trump also reiterated that pursuing a third presidential term is not something he is considering.</p>

          <p>A new book reveals that Joe Biden's top aides considered having the president take a cognitive test in February 2024, prior to the election, but decided against it. The aides worried that even taking the test would raise questions about his mental abilities. Biden ultimately stepped down from his re-election campaign in favor of Kamala Harris, who later lost the presidential election to Donald Trump. The book highlights the concerns surrounding Biden's age and mental acuity during the lead-up to the election.</p>

          <p>Sarah Snook's one-actor take on The Picture of Dorian Gray on Broadway explores the parallels between Oscar Wilde's novel and the modern obsession with image and social media. Snook plays 26 roles, using elaborate wigs and camerawork, including a smartphone to broadcast herself to a giant screen. The production highlights the dangers of prioritizing appearance over substance and the ways in which performing a persona for others can obliterate an interior life. In contrast, Vanya suggests a different perspective, where the expression of many selves can be a form of liberation.</p>
