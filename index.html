          <p>Despite ongoing prisoner exchange efforts, Russia launched a large-scale drone and missile attack on cities across Ukraine, resulting in at least 18 deaths and numerous injuries, including children, marking the fourth consecutive night of intense bombardments. Ukrainian officials reported neutralizing a significant portion of the incoming missiles and drones, but the strikes caused extensive damage to residential buildings and enterprises, particularly in Kyiv, where university dormitories were hit. Russia claimed the attacks targeted Ukraine's military-industrial complex, while Ukrainian President Zelenskyy decried the strikes as deliberate acts of terror against civilians and urged increased international pressure and sanctions on Russia to halt the ongoing aggression. The attacks occurred amidst stalled U.S.-brokered peace talks, with both sides accusing each other of undermining negotiations, underscoring the continued volatility of the conflict.</p>

          <p>Despite being surrounded by Russian forces, the last working maternity ward in Ukrainian-controlled Donetsk continues to provide care, highlighting the resilience of Ukrainians in the face of ongoing conflict. Located in Sloviansk, the hospital operates at 90% capacity, enduring missile strikes and utility cuts to serve the local population. While some residents express determination to remain in their homes despite the war, others, like a couple from Kramatorsk, plan to move westward for the safety of their newborn child, fearing the future of the region under Russian control. The hospital director emphasized their commitment to providing care to Ukrainians until the last moment, despite the dangers, as they see it as their duty, akin to soldiers in a trench.</p>

          <p>Russia has intensified its strikes on Ukraine, launching the highest number of drones and missiles in a single night, resulting in at least 12 deaths, including three children, and dozens of injuries, according to Ukrainian officials. The attack, which was the second large-scale assault on the country in 48 hours, occurred despite calls for a ceasefire, prompting President Zelenskyy to urge allies to increase pressure on Moscow. Ukrainian forces reported shooting down 45 cruise missiles and neutralizing 266 UAVs, but hits were recorded in 22 locations, with deaths reported in several regions, as Russia's Shahed drones evolve with more explosives and improved technology to evade detection. The strikes coincided with Kyiv Day, an annual holiday, and forced hundreds of people to seek shelter in metro stations.</p>

He lauded the cadets' choice to serve in the military as a superior path compared to high-paying careers in the business world, highlighting the values of honor and sacrifice.

          <p>North Korea has detained shipyard officials, including the chief engineer, following the failed launch of a new warship that resulted in damage to the vessel. Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un reportedly expressed distress over the incident, blaming military officials, scientists, and shipyard operators for carelessness and unscientific practices. Satellite imagery revealed the warship lying on its side, covered in tarps, after a flatcar malfunctioned during the launch, and Kim has ordered its restoration before a ruling party meeting in June. The North Korean military reiterated its commitment to containing military threats amid U.S. military buildup in the region, continuing its focus on developing its military arsenal under Kim's leadership.</p>

          <p>Rachel Feintzeig discusses her obsession with the HBO series "The Last of Us" as a distraction from real-world anxieties, arguing that fictional apocalypses offer a temporary escape from the more pressing issues of 2025. Drawing on personal experience, Feintzeig recounts how horror movies helped her cope with grief after a miscarriage, providing a sense of perspective by focusing on someone else's problems. Despite finding the zombie show disturbing, she acknowledges the relief it brings from the relentless nature of the real world, and contemplates what alternate reality she will escape to once the season ends. The author finds it easier to cope with fictional creatures than real life problems.</p>

          <p>A year after independent observers say he falsified presidential election results, Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro is calling on voters to head to the ballot box again for legislative and gubernatorial elections. The vote has reopened a rift among opposition activists, who are divided over whether to participate or abstain, with some arguing that participation gives credibility to Maduro's assertion of power and others claiming that abstaining will allow the government to say they won without resistance. Independent monitors will not be present, and many inside Venezuela believe that the results will once again be manufactured, with the vote serving to project a veneer of democracy amidst a crackdown on dissent, as the government detains opposition leaders and restricts political participation.</p>

          <p>President Trump and his family are monetizing the White House more extensively than any predecessor, normalizing activities that once would have sparked heavy criticism and investigations. The Trump family has collected millions from various ventures, including cryptocurrency and overseas real estate deals, while ethical boundaries are blurred and accountability mechanisms are dismantled, as the president has fired inspectors general and installed loyalists in key positions. Despite some public pushback, particularly regarding the gift of a luxury jet from Qatar, Democrats are divided on how much to focus on Trump's profit-making, and the lack of official investigations has made it difficult to gain traction. Critics argue that Trump's actions represent an unprecedented use of the presidency for personal gain, yet the normalization of such schemes reflects a shift in accepted behavior in Washington.</p>

Despite initial widespread support, the movement's popularity has declined, and a Pew Research Center study indicates that most Americans believe the increased focus on race did not improve Black lives, with some activists facing recriminations and scorn. While some see the shift as a necessary course correction, others view it as a deliberate resurgence of old power structures, highlighting the cyclical nature of American social movements and the ongoing struggle for racial justice.</p>

          <p>An essayist reflects on the decline of deep male friendships in America, noting that men are increasingly isolated and struggle to connect with one another on an emotional level. The author shares personal anecdotes and cites studies showing a significant decrease in the number of close friends men have, attributing this trend to societal expectations around masculinity, a fear of vulnerability, and the prioritization of romantic relationships and families. While acknowledging the challenges, the author explores potential solutions, such as embracing self-improvement and seeking inspiration from historical examples of male intimacy, and emphasizes the importance of making an effort to nurture and maintain friendships, even in the face of societal pressures and personal anxieties.</p>

          <p>President Trump's warming toward Syria and its new leader, Ahmed al-Shara, has complicated Israel's military strategy, leading to a reduction in Israeli airstrikes on the country. After a series of attacks aimed at preventing hostile groups from gaining power, Trump's meeting with al-Shara and plans to lift sanctions have undercut Israel's efforts to prevent the rise of another anti-Israel neighbor. While Israel has expressed concerns about the new Syrian government's ties to extremism, Trump's actions have forced Israel to reconsider its approach and seek de-escalation, highlighting the reshaping of American foreign policy in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Allies of President Trump are seeking to leverage pro bono commitments made by elite law firms in exchange for exemptions from executive orders, requesting free legal work for various causes, including veterans' issues and conservative litigation. Law firms, including Skadden, Kirkland & Ellis, and Paul Weiss, are navigating how to fulfill these commitments without compromising their autonomy or alienating staff, as they grapple with requests ranging from individual cases to large-scale litigation support. The requests come as some firms face internal resistance from attorneys who do not want to work on matters that align with the administration's policies, raising questions about the scope and implementation of pro bono legal services under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>A drone brigade called Kaskad, commanded by a member of Parliament, offers Russian officials short stints far from the fighting in Ukraine, providing a career boost and avoiding the dangers faced by ordinary soldiers. Analysts describe Kaskad as a "V.I.P. unit" that allows politically minded recruits to gain a hero's welcome and potential promotions, with members typically serving for three to eight months before returning to their jobs. The brigade has been described as a "sinecure for officials" by pro-war Russian bloggers, and the trend highlights how Russian elite figures can sidestep statutory military service requirements while currying favor with the Kremlin, in contrast to the indefinite contracts and high death toll faced by regular soldiers.</p>

Despite promises that compensation schemes would be "non-legalistic," these promises have turned out to be "worthless," as claims are rejected on legal technicalities or because the parameters of the scheme do not extend to certain items.</p>

While there have been no human cases of locally-acquired West Nile Virus in the UK to date, the public is advised to avoid mosquito bites by covering up and using insecticide, as the expert emphasizes awareness rather than undue concern.</p>
