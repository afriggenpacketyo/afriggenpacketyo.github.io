          <p>Luigi Mangione's defense attorneys allege that prosecutors are intentionally trying to bias the public against their client by releasing his handwritten journal entries. The defense argues that the release of these writings, intended to justify murder charges with a terrorism enhancement, undermines Mangione's right to a fair trial. Mangione is charged with the murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson and faces both state and federal charges. His defense team is attempting to delay the state case to focus on the federal prosecution, which could result in the death penalty. The defense asserts that forcing Mangione to choose between asserting a defense in state court and giving the prosecution an advantage in his capital trial is untenable.</p>

          <p>Shasti Conrad was elected as the Democratic National Committee's vice chair, resolving the controversy surrounding David Hogg's departure from party leadership. Hogg stepped down due to internal divisions sparked by his plan to primary challenge vulnerable incumbent Democrats. The DNC has faced criticism over its leadership and financial stability, with reports of officials considering borrowing money. The election of Conrad aims to refocus the party on key issues after a period of internal strife and procedural debates, as members expressed a desire to move beyond the distractions and focus on more pressing matters. The election process itself involved multiple rounds of voting and highlighted underlying tensions within the DNC, with some members alleging discrimination in the initial election results.</p>

          <p>Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth revealed that OpenAI countered Meta's lucrative job offers to employees of AI startups. The AI hiring war has intensified, with Meta investing heavily in talent and technology for superintelligence, including a significant stake in Scale AI to attract Alexandr Wang. Meta also sought to acquire Safe Superintelligence and reached out to Perplexity AI, but deals did not materialize. Bosworth emphasized Meta's belief in AI's potential to assist humans and highlighted the company's investments in personnel and computing power. OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman claimed Meta offered substantial signing bonuses and annual compensation to attract talent, but OpenAI's top employees chose to stay.</p>

Attendees enjoyed music spanning generations, from Aaliyah to YG, and participated in activities like rhythmic breathing exercises and sound baths. The celebration honored the history of the Ebony Beach Club, which was founded in 1957 but barred from opening due to racial discrimination, and provided a space for Black people to occupy the pier and enjoy the holiday.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This satirical piece critiques the lack of clear uniforms for ICE agents, highlighting how this ambiguity can undermine accountability and create confusion. The author humorously suggests that agents should avoid anything that identifies them as officials, instead opting for attire that blends in or appears disheveled. By obscuring their official status, the article implies, ICE agents can operate with less scrutiny and accountability. The piece references Coco Chanel's controversial past to underscore the idea that appearances can be deceiving and that true accountability requires transparency.</p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines reflect contrasting viewpoints on the assisted dying bill passed by the UK Parliament. Some papers highlight the "victory" for campaigners and the terminally ill, while others emphasize the "uphill battle" the bill faces in the House of Lords. The Daily Telegraph notes government plans to map the DNA of every baby under an "NHS revolution," and carries a comment piece which says the assisted dying vote gave the state "the power to kill". The Guardian focuses on the transformation of end-of-life care following the bill's passage. The Sun reports on pro-Palestinian activists who broke into an RAF base, leading to the government's decision to ban Palestine Action as a proscribed group.</p>

          <p>President Trump has given Iran a two-week deadline to "come to their senses," dismissing European efforts at diplomacy and acknowledging the deadlock in the Middle East. Trump stated that he would decide whether to join Israel in its strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities within this timeframe. He criticized his own intelligence community, including Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, for their assessment that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon. Meanwhile, Israel's representative to the UN insisted that his country could act alone if necessary. Analysts warn that giving Iran more time could allow it to advance its nuclear program, while the State Department is providing assistance to thousands of Americans seeking guidance on the security situation in the region.</p>

The pilot program will operate within a geofenced area, with a limited number of cars and a "Tesla Safety Monitor" in the front passenger seat. The robotaxis can be hailed via a Robotaxi App, with service available from 6 a.m. to midnight. This launch follows scrutiny from government officials and safety advocacy groups regarding autonomous vehicle safety, and some Texas lawmakers have requested a delay until new regulations take effect. The success of this robotaxi service could significantly boost Tesla's market value, potentially reaching a $2 trillion market cap by the end of 2026.</p>

The movie depicts the tense atmosphere and the growing horror of the visitors as they confront the regime's atrocities.

While the plaintiffs believe the ruling applies to all school districts in Louisiana, the state's Attorney General disagrees and intends to appeal.

          <p>Iran has stated it will not resume nuclear program talks while under attack, following Israel's warning of a prolonged conflict. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European diplomats in Geneva, where he insisted that diplomacy would only be considered once Israel's aggression stops. Araghchi emphasized that Iran's nuclear program is peaceful and that its defense capabilities are non-negotiable. Meanwhile, President Trump suggested that Iran has a "maximum" of two weeks to avoid possible U.S. air strikes, dismissing European diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated 639 employees at Voice of America (VOA) and its parent organization, USAGM, reducing the international broadcasting service to a fraction of its former size. These terminations are part of a larger effort to eliminate 1,400 positions since March, effectively dismantling an organization founded in 1942 to counter Nazi propaganda. Kari Lake, Trump’s senior advisor to USAGM, stated that the agency had been riddled with dysfunction and bias. The cuts represent a significant retreat from America's Cold War strategy of using broadcasting to promote democratic values globally.</p>
