        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Syria is conducting its first parliamentary elections after decades of dictatorship, utilizing a complex, indirect voting system due to the displacement of millions and a fragile legal framework. Instead of a public vote, an electoral college of 6,000-7,000 members, appointed by subcommittees, will choose 121 parliamentarians. The process has drawn criticism for granting significant power to the interim president, who will directly appoint another 70 members, making it difficult for the assembly to challenge his decrees. While some see it as a modest improvement, civil society groups and minorities have questioned its legitimacy.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that current negotiations for a peace deal between Israel and Hamas represent the closest the parties have come to securing the release of all hostages in Gaza. He outlined a two-phase plan, with the immediate focus on the logistical challenges of the hostage exchange, which he stressed must happen quickly. However, Rubio cautioned that numerous pitfalls remain, and the second phase—establishing a permanent, terror-free governance structure in Gaza—will be even more difficult to achieve. He emphasized that Hamas cannot be part of any long-term solution.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed actor Daniel Day-Lewis has clarified that he never intended to fully retire, but rather chose to step away from one type of work to focus on another, including making fiddles. He reveals his impulse to return to acting was largely inspired by his son, Ronan Day-Lewis, becoming a filmmaker. The two collaborated on Ronan's directorial debut, "Anemone," which the elder Day-Lewis co-wrote and stars in. In the interview, he also reflects on his immersive preparation methods and the difficult childhood experiences at boarding school that shaped his life's work.</p>

The attacks struck civilian infrastructure, with a deadly strike in the western Lviv region killing four people, including a teenager. In the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, another civilian was killed, and tens of thousands were left without power. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated his urgent call for more advanced air defense systems from Western partners to counter Russia's "aerial terror."</p>

          <p>Hundreds of mourners gathered for the funeral of Melvin Cravitz, a 66-year-old man killed in a terrorist attack at a Manchester synagogue during Yom Kippur services. Cravitz was fatally attacked when an assailant rammed a car into worshippers and then began stabbing people. In a tribute, his family described him as a kind and caring man who was devoted to his wife and community. The service was attended by family and community members, including the rabbi who helped prevent the attacker from gaining further entry into the synagogue.</p>

          <p>At President Trump's request, the Securities and Exchange Commission is exploring a rule change that would end the mandate for public companies to file quarterly reports, moving instead to an optional semi-annual schedule. While this could save companies significant time and money, it poses a major financial threat to the "Big Four" accounting firms, which could lose a substantial portion of their audit business. Proponents argue the change would encourage more private companies to go public, potentially offsetting some of the revenue losses for the accounting industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge asserts that the most crucial rule for raising healthier children in a high-tech world is to ban all electronic devices from their bedrooms overnight. This straightforward, no-cost rule is aimed at protecting sleep, which she describes as absolutely crucial for the physical and mental health of developing brains. Lack of sleep is linked to numerous negative outcomes, from depression to illness, and removing devices can help ensure kids get the rest they need for cognitive development and emotional regulation.</p>

The author contends that Washington's "derivative" tariffs on finished goods containing these metals pose a more immediate and significant threat to European manufacturers and climate policy goals. The piece suggests that reaching a compromise with Beijing on EVs would free up the political capital needed to effectively push back against the U.S. trade measures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A JPMorgan report advises Americans to move away from the arbitrary $1 million retirement savings goal, suggesting more realistic targets based on an income-replacement model. For a household earning $90,000 annually, a target of $700,000 would likely be sufficient to maintain their lifestyle, relying partly on Social Security benefits. However, the analysis notes that households earning over $125,000 would probably need a seven-figure sum, and it cautions that potential future cuts to Social Security could require all savers to aim higher.
