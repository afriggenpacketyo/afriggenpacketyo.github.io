          <p>President Trump asserted in an interview that he has already secured 200 tariff deals and engaged in discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump anticipates finalizing these deals within a few weeks. However, Chinese officials have disputed the White House's claims of active tariff negotiations, calling them "fake news". Trump also addressed the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an alleged MS-13 member, and reiterated his stance on the Russia-Ukraine war, blaming Ukraine's NATO aspirations for the conflict and projecting optimism about reaching a peace agreement that would cede territory to Russia.</p>

          <p>Senator Dick Durbin suggested that elderly lawmakers should consider retiring to make way for a younger generation, emphasizing the importance of competence over age. Durbin, who is himself retiring, cited Senator Bernie Sanders as an example of an older politician who remains effective. He also highlighted the current threat to the U.S. Constitution as a critical issue that transcends political campaigns. Durbin's retirement is part of a broader trend of elderly lawmakers stepping down, potentially paving the way for younger Democrats to assume leadership roles.</p>

          <p>A senior Russian general, Lieutenant General Yaroslav Moskalik, was killed by a car bomb just outside Moscow, prompting a murder investigation. The explosive device, packed with metal fragments, detonated in the town of Balashikha. Moskalik was a deputy head of the main operational directorate of the military's General Staff and had previously been involved in "Normandy format" talks on Ukraine in 2015. The bombing occurred as a U.S. envoy was expected to meet with Putin to discuss a U.S.-brokered peace plan for Ukraine, echoing similar attacks on Russians linked to the military offensive in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>An affidavit from Ronen Bar, the former head of Israel's Shin Bet security agency, details Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's attempts to turn the agency into a tool for personal protection rather than national security. Bar's refusal to comply with these demands highlights the importance of high officials resisting self-coups and upholding democratic norms. The article discusses Netanyahu's efforts to influence investigations and manipulate security assessments, and emphasizes the need for public officials to prioritize their allegiance to the democratic system over personal loyalty to a leader.</p>
