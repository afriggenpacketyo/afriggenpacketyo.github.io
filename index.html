          <p>Small business owners are pulling back on hiring due to increased costs from tariffs, leading to reduced spending on labor. Some businesses are cutting worker hours or pausing hiring altogether, while others are considering layoffs to offset rising expenses on imported goods. The National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) reported a drop in small business owners planning to create new jobs, reflecting concerns about labor costs and economic uncertainty. The moderation in hiring aligns with current economic challenges, particularly for smaller enterprises lacking the flexibility of larger companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a farewell press conference highlighting Elon Musk's contributions to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), President Trump rescinded the nomination of Musk ally Jared Isaacman for NASA administrator. Trump cited a "thorough review of prior associations" for pulling Isaacman's nomination, who is an investor in SpaceX and led two private spaceflight missions with the company. Tensions escalated as Musk criticized Trump's tax and spending package, labeling it a "disgusting abomination," leading to Trump accusing Musk of "Trump derangement syndrome" and being upset over cuts to electric vehicle tax credits. The White House pointed to Isaacman's donations to Democrats as a potential factor, though Isaacman identifies as "right-leaning."</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador, has returned to the United States to face charges related to undocumented immigrant smuggling. A federal grand jury indicted Abrego Garcia on charges of illegally smuggling undocumented migrants and conspiracy to commit that crime. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that Abrego Garcia played a significant role in a smuggling ring that operated for nearly a decade, while Abrego Garcia's attorney claims the Trump administration is abusing its power. The Supreme Court had previously upheld an order for Abrego Garcia's return to ensure his case is handled properly.</p>

Mamdani, a Democratic Socialists of America member, is running on a progressive platform including a rent freeze and fare-free buses.
