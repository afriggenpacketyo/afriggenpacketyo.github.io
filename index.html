        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of the Labour Party conference, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has condemned Reform UK's immigration proposals as "toxic" and divisive. He specifically highlighted their plan to abolish indefinite leave to remain for legal migrants already in the country, arguing it would tear society apart by targeting people who are established contributors to British society. Starmer positioned the conference as an opportunity to present Labour's vision of "patriotic national renewal" as an alternative to what he describes as Reform's politics of decline.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to send troops to Portland, Oregon, to address ongoing protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). In a social media post, he stated he was authorizing "Full Force, if necessary" to protect federal facilities from what he described as attacks by "Antifa, and other domestic terrorists." This action follows months of demonstrations in the city, which has declared itself a sanctuary city, creating a flashpoint between local officials and federal immigration authorities.</p>

          <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation has fired more than a dozen agents who were photographed kneeling during the Black Lives Matter protests in Washington, D.C., in 2020. According to sources, the termination letters cited the agents' alleged "lack of judgement" for their actions. The FBI Agents Association strongly condemned the firings, accusing FBI Director Kash Patel of violating due process as part of a wider personnel purge that has reportedly damaged morale within the agency.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked the visa of Colombian President Gustavo Petro following his remarks at a protest in New York.

The incident marks a significant escalation in tensions between the U.S. and Colombia, a historically close ally, and follows recent disagreements over anti-narcotics efforts and deportation policies.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a volatile week, ultimately closing with minor losses for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq despite reaching record highs earlier. Key developments included Nvidia's massive $100 billion investment in OpenAI to build AI data centers, which boosted related stocks like GE Vernova and Eaton. Other major corporate news involved strong iPhone 17 sales, a positive FAA update for Boeing, and a post-earnings stock dip for Costco despite beating revenue expectations.

          <p>Market analyst David Zervos has warned that the Federal Reserve may be underestimating the labor market impact of the artificial intelligence boom. He suggests a scenario where the economy experiences strong growth, potentially 3.5% to 4%, while simultaneously shedding millions of jobs due to AI-driven automation. This would create a significant dilemma for the Fed, which is mandated to balance price stability with full employment, forcing it to navigate a complex economic landscape.

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Advice for Pregnant Women to 'Tough It Out' Reflects Broader Misogyny</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's recent comments advising pregnant women to avoid Tylenol and "tough it out" are irresponsible and rooted in misogyny. The author contends that this rhetoric dismisses women's pain, a common issue within the medical establishment, and contributes to a culture of mom-shaming by blaming mothers for health outcomes like autism without scientific evidence. The piece frames the administration's focus on Tylenol not as a genuine health concern but as another attempt to control women's bodies.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security has issued a warning about foreign attempts to illegally acquire the country's strategic mineral resources, circumventing export controls. The agency revealed it had recently disrupted two smuggling operations involving antimony, a rare metal crucial for various industrial applications. One case involved a family-run network that used shell companies and third-country transit routes to smuggle high-purity antimony ingots, highlighting a threat to China's national and economic security.</p>

          <p>Major dating apps, including Bumble and those under Match Group, are integrating advanced AI to combat user swipe fatigue and dissatisfaction with superficial matching. The new vision involves AI acting as a "personal shopper" for romance, using large language models to match users based on deeper values and life goals rather than just photos and brief bios. While this promises more thoughtful connections, experts remain skeptical, noting that romantic chemistry is unpredictable and that past data-driven approaches have had limited success.</p>

          <h2>ICE Arrests Superintendent of Iowa's Largest School District</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 08:12:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The superintendent of Des Moines Public Schools — Iowa’s largest school district – was detained Friday morning by immigration agents, according to the Department of Homeland Security, which said the educator was in the country illegally and had existing weapon possession charges.\n\nSuperintendent Ian Roberts – an educator with decades of experience who previously competed as an Olympic athlete for Guyana – was arrested as part of a “targeted enforcement operation” and fled after US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers approached him, according to statements from DHS and the Iowa Department of Public Safety.\n\nDHS said he was “in possession of a loaded handgun, $3,000 in cash and a fixed blade hunting knife” at the time of his arrest. It’s a violation of federal law to own a firearm and ammunition if an individual doesn’t have legal status in the US.\n\nCNN is working to identify Roberts’ attorney.\n\nThe school district and DHS presented starkly divergent portraits of Roberts. DHS described him as a “criminal alien” and suggested he was a public safety threat. But at a news conference after his arrest, board president of Des Moines Public Schools Jackie Norris said the superintendent was “an integral part of our school community” who “has shown up in ways big and small” for students and staff. And Roberts disclosed his weapon charge, related to a hunting rifle, when he was hired, a district spokesperson told CNN.\n\nThe arrest spurred a protest outside the federal courthouse in Des Moines. “Education, not deportation / Free Dr. Roberts,” read one sign carried by a demonstrator, according to footage from CNN affiliate KCCI. Local education and immigration advocacy groups have rallied behind the superintendent.\n\nThe Iowa Board of Educational Examiners issued Roberts a license to serve as superintendent in the state in July 2023, according to Norris.\n\n“There is new information that has been made public that we did not know, and we have not been able to verify,” Norris said.\n\nRoberts oversaw over 30,000 students in the Des Moines public school system, according to the district’s website, and had previously worked at public schools across the country.\n\nAnother administrator, Matt Smith, has taken the role of interim superintendent in the meantime, according to a message posted on social media by the district earlier.\n\n“Our priority is to provide a safe, secure and outstanding education for all students and to support our students, families, and employees,” the statement read.\n\nRoberts’ arrest comes amid the Trump administration’s continued crackdown on immigration, which has seen raids on workplaces and arrests of community pillars including a firefighter, a journalist and a pastor.\n\nSuperintendent was given final order of removal in 2024, DHS says\n\nRoberts entered the US on a student visa in 1999 and was given a final order of removal by an immigration judge in May 2024, according to the DHS statement. He had existing weapon charges from 2020, the agency added.\n\nDes Moines Public Schools said it was unaware of the order of removal but Roberts did inform the school board of a firearms offense related to a hunting rifle during his hiring process. The district said in a statement Roberts “provided sufficient context and explanation of the situation to move forward in the hiring process.”\n\nPublic records show Roberts pleaded guilty to a weapon charge in Pennsylvania in 2022. CNN has been unable to verify whether Roberts has a separate charge from 2020.\n\nThe district also said Roberts submitted an employment eligibility verification form and an I-9 as part of the hiring process.\n\n“The district has not been formally notified by ICE about this matter, nor have we been able to talk with Dr. Roberts since his detention,” district spokesperson Phil Roeder said.\n\nICE Enforcement and Removal Operations St. Paul Field Office Director Sam Olson said in a statement Robertson’s arrest should be a “wake-up call for our communities to the great work that our officers are doing every day to remove public safety threats.”\n\nICE’s online detainee locator system shows Roberts was born in Guyana and is being held at a county jail in Council Bluffs, Iowa.\n\nCommunity rallies behind longtime educator\n\nRoberts was named Des Moines Public Schools superintendent in 2023, according to the district’s website. He was “born to immigrant parents from Guyana, and spent most of his formative years in Brooklyn, NY,” the website reads.\n\nBefore becoming an educator, the superintendent was an Olympic athlete and competed in track and field at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.\n\nRoberts’ long educational career has included positions in New York City; Baltimore; Washington, DC; St. Louis; Oakland, California; and Erie, Pennsylvania, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nAmong the crowd protesting Roberts’ arrest Friday was district teacher Mary Pat LaMair, who said she was excited to see the display of support.\n\n“I just think it’s really important that we take care of one another, and we seem to be at a spot where that’s not what’s happening,” LaMair told CNN affiliate KCCI. She added, “It’s important for people to know that the general public, I think, is not okay with what’s happening.”\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, was made aware of the incident and is in contact with local and federal authorities, according to KCCI.\n\nThe Iowa State Education Association and Des Moines Education Association said they were “shocked” by Roberts’ detention and described the administrator as a “tremendous advocate” in a statement, reported KCCI.\n\n“His leadership and compassion for all students, regardless of background, identity, or family origin, are a beacon of light in one of the state’s most diverse school districts,” reads the statement, according to KCCI. “It is a dark and unsettling time in our country. This incident has created tremendous fear for DMPS students, families, and staff.”\n\nThe Directors Council — a nonprofit group serving Des Moines’ Black community — identified Roberts as a board member and offered him their “full support” in a post on Facebook.\n\nRoberts “has been a trusted partner, a dedicated advocate for equity, and an unwavering supporter of families and youth in Polk County,” reads the post. “His contributions to both The Directors Council and the wider community are immeasurable, and we stand with him during this uncertain moment.”\n\nIn a video statement posted on their Facebook page, organizers from the Iowa Movement for Migrant Justice said news of the superintendent’s detention was shocking and scary for immigrant communities.\n\n“We know in advance that our families right now are afraid that if they go to pick up their kids, if they send them to school, if immigrant agents are going to go take their kids out of school,” Elizabeth Balcarcel said in the video statement. “There are many questions, many doubts.”\n\nThe Des Moines School Board has scheduled a special closed-session meeting on Saturday to discuss the arrest and Roberts’ status with the district.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN’s Catherine Shoichet contributed to this report.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the 1977 legal battle over a neo-Nazi group's right to march in Skokie, Illinois, a suburb with many Holocaust survivors. The ACLU's defense of the group's First Amendment rights, though painful for the community, affirmed a crucial principle of free speech. The author argues that this historical event serves as a powerful reminder that free speech protections must apply even to offensive and hateful ideas, because restricting them gives officials the power to censor any speech they dislike.</p>
