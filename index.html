          <p>A recent UK-EU deal addresses trade, defense, fishing, and energy, but leaves key questions unanswered. The financial contribution the UK will make for certain benefits, like reduced food export checks, remains unclear. The number of participants and duration of the "youth experience scheme," allowing young people to work in the UK and EU, are still under negotiation. The deal states there will be "no legal barriers" to Britons using e-gates when traveling to and from EU countries after the introduction of the European Union Entry/Exit System, but it is up to individual EU countries to decide whether British passport holders can use e-gates at their airports. The deal only recognizes the "value" of touring artists and promises to continue efforts "to support travel and cultural exchange".</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The SEC is nearing a decision to allow asset managers to offer ETF share classes of existing mutual funds, potentially offering investors more choices but also introducing tax risks. Over 50 asset managers have petitioned the SEC for exemptive relief, with the SEC prioritizing the issue after Commissioner Mark Uyeda's announcement in March. The key difference between ETFs and mutual funds lies in tax treatment, where ETFs avoid capital gains tax for remaining shareholders when one shareholder exits. The SEC is concerned that co-mingling the funds might subject ETF holders to unexpected tax bills, and the Dimensional amendment includes updated guidelines around oversight of funds that could help navigate issues like tax impact.</p>

Trump asserts that Republicans are unified and urges passage of the bill, threatening those who oppose it.

          <p>Ukrainians express disappointment but continued resolve following President Trump's apparent shift away from actively seeking an end to the war in Ukraine. Many view Trump's diplomatic efforts as detached from the realities of the conflict. Despite exhaustion and ongoing Russian bombardments, Ukrainians emphasize the need to rely on themselves and seek support from allies. President Zelensky has proposed a free-trade agreement to the U.S. as part of efforts to maintain relations with Washington. The situation in combat zones continues to intensify, with little hope for a near-term end to the fighting.</p>

          <p>President Putin aims to end the war in Ukraine on his terms, defending his approach to negotiate a comprehensive peace deal while continuing military operations. While Trump has welcomed direct peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, he emphasized that American economic rapprochement with Russia would come after peace in Ukraine, not before. Putin's goal is to convince Trump that Russia's vast natural resources are a sufficient prize to make up for the international acclaim that the American president would miss by failing to stop the bloodshed in Ukraine. Sanctions have helped Mr. Putin hammer the message to his public that Russia is locked in an existentialist struggle with the West in Ukraine.</p>

The company was labeled a Chinese military company by the Pentagon, prompting U.S. lawmakers to call on Wall Street banks to withdraw from the listing.

          <p>Joe Biden's announcement that he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer has revived questions about what health issues the former US president was dealing with while he was in the White House. Republicans claim that Biden, who ran for re-election as the oldest president in history at 81, was mentally and physically unfit for office. According to Original Sin, a new book by journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, Biden was unable to recognise Hollywood actor and Democratic donor George Clooney or to recall the names of key aides in his final year in office. The publicity generated by the book has forced senior Democrats to field questions on why they did not do more to respond to Americans' concerns about Biden's health as he campaigned for re-election.</p>
