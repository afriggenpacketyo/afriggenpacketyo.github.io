          <h2>Hong Kong's Future Beyond 2047: An Examination of Legal Systems</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article addresses concerns about Hong Kong's legal system post-2047, following discussions initiated by activist investor David Webb. Webb questioned whether Hong Kong law students should continue studying the current system or transition to mainland law, particularly regarding contract law and land leases. The article urges calm, drawing parallels with anxieties before 1997, and suggests focusing on maintaining the existing system rather than prematurely shifting to mainland law. It highlights the importance of addressing these concerns to ensure stability and confidence in Hong Kong's future legal framework.</p>

          <p>A Mexican Navy training ship, the Cuauhtémoc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday night, resulting in the deaths of two crew members and injuries to at least 22 others. The ship, carrying 277 people, reportedly lost power before the crash, causing its masts and rigging to smash against the bridge's underside. New York City Mayor Eric Adams confirmed the fatalities, while the Mexican Navy reported that 11 of the injured were in critical condition. The National Transportation Safety Board is set to investigate the incident, which briefly closed all lanes of the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the recurring themes of struggle and misfortune in the films presented at the Cannes Film Festival this year. Ari Aster's "Eddington" satirizes the anxieties of the pandemic era, while Dominik Moll's "Dossier 137" explores the moral compromises faced by a police officer. Sergei Loznitsa's "Two Prosecutors" depicts the disillusionment of an idealist in Stalinist Russia, and Oliver Laxe's "Sirât" portrays a harsh, apocalyptic world. The article contrasts these bleak narratives with Harris Dickinson's directorial debut, "Urchin," which offers a more hopeful, albeit Sisyphean, view of overcoming adversity.</p>

          <p>A recent internal survey by the Bundeswehr Center of Military History and Social Sciences indicates that "systemic" extremism is not prevalent within the German military. The study found that less than 1% of soldiers harbor right-wing extremist attitudes, though problematic chauvinist and xenophobic views were observed among a small percentage. Despite these findings, some researchers remain skeptical, citing past incidents of far-right networks and potential influence from the timing of the surveys. The ongoing debate underscores the challenges of monitoring and addressing extremism within the armed forces.</p>

          <p>In the retrial of Karen Read, accused of murdering her boyfriend John O'Keefe, the judge has barred references to a separate, flawed murder investigation by Canton Police. The defense aims to portray the investigation as unreliable and corrupt, while the prosecution seeks to focus on the evidence directly related to Read's case. Experts suggest these cases should prompt a review of police training, particularly in evidence collection and documentation, to avoid mistakes that could compromise justice. The trial continues to raise questions about the integrity of the investigation and the quality of police work.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to finance infrastructure projects in Africa, marking a shift from direct government loans. This model involves granting Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for construction financing. Projects like Nairobi’s mega-highway and Zambia’s Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway are adopting PPPs. During Kenyan President William Ruto’s visit to China, he sought funding for the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) extension, with Chinese financiers contributing 40% and gaining exclusive construction and operating rights for at least 25 years.</p>

          <p>The upcoming Romanian presidential election is a rerun after the previous vote in November was annulled by the constitutional court. The annulment followed findings of irregularities in the financing and organization of the leading campaign of far-right candidate Calin Georgescu. Alleged electoral violations included the use of fake social media accounts to spread pro-Georgescu messages, which were described as a Russian hybrid attack. Georgescu has since been banned from standing in the rerun, raising concerns about electoral integrity and foreign interference.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed delaying the expansion of Medi-Cal to more undocumented adults and charging current beneficiaries with "unsatisfactory immigration status" a monthly fee of $100 starting in 2027. These changes aim to address a $12 billion state budget deficit, attributed to Trump's tariffs and rising healthcare costs. The plan would suspend access to comprehensive services for undocumented adults over 19, while charging a monthly fee to those with "unsatisfactory" status. These policies are projected to save California $5.4 billion by fiscal year 2028-29.</p>
