            <h2>Novel Drug Shows Promise in Slowing Advanced Breast Cancer</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-11 05:47:40 EDT</div>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A new targeted therapy drug, capivasertib, has been approved for use on the NHS in England for certain types of advanced breast cancer. Clinical trials showed that the drug, when combined with hormone therapy, doubled the time it took for the cancer to grow, and shrank tumors in some patients. It works by blocking the activity of a protein molecule called AKT, which drives cancer growth. This drug offers a new treatment option for women with hormone receptor-positive secondary breast cancer, potentially delaying the need for chemotherapy and improving their quality of life.</p>

            <p>China has responded to the U.S.'s increased tariffs by raising its own levies on U.S. goods to 125%, asserting that further tariff hikes from the U.S. would be economically meaningless. Despite the escalation, China's commerce ministry reiterated its openness to negotiations with the U.S. on an equal footing. This comes amid fading hopes for a resolution to trade tensions, with both countries sending clear messages that further tariff increases are pointless, potentially leading to significant disruptions in global supply chains.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is invoking the McCarran-Walter Act, an obscure law from the Cold War era, to justify the deportation of immigrant student protesters.

Critics argue that this infringes on free speech rights and could set a dangerous precedent.
