          <p>President Trump's first stop on his four-day Middle East tour was Saudi Arabia, where he received an opulent welcome from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, solidifying the strong diplomatic and business ties between the two nations. The Saudi Royal Court, resembling a "Mar-a-Lago East," impressed Trump with its lavish gold dÃ©cor, aligning with his taste for luxury. The visit included a tour of Saudi megaprojects and a reenactment of historical Saudi-American partnerships, highlighting the kingdom's efforts to strengthen relations with the U.S. and appeal to Trump's personal interests, including real estate development. </p>

          <p>President Trump's public claims regarding U.S. mediation efforts between India and Pakistan have caused political friction with India, despite a cease-fire agreement. India refuted Trump's assertions that trade incentives and warnings influenced their decision to halt hostilities, viewing his statements as undermining their military efforts and portraying India and Pakistan as equals. Analysts suggest this has led to unease among India's political leaders, who worry about public perception and the country's relationship with the United States. The incident has reignited concerns about the U.S. approach to the region and its impact on India's foreign policy. </p>

          <p>State Farm has been granted temporary permission to increase homeowners' insurance rates by 17% in California, following catastrophic fires, despite criticism from consumer groups and homeowners. The insurer cited a "dire situation" and requested the increase to address financial strains. Consumer Watchdog argued the increase was unjustified and criticized State Farm for allegedly lowballing claims after the fires. The state's insurance commissioner presented the increase as a compromise amidst a statewide insurance crisis, while State Farm stated it remains concerned about its California subsidiary's financial position. </p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has expressed openness to discussing the deployment of France's nuclear weapons in other European countries, amid growing concerns about European security. Macron emphasized that any shared nuclear deterrence would not compromise France's defense capabilities, with ultimate control remaining with the French president. The proposal comes as many European leaders feel they can no longer rely on the US' nuclear commitment to Europe, particularly in light of the Russian threat. Germany and other nations have shown interest in the proposal, though Germany maintains that it is not a substitute for the U.S. nuclear guarantee. </p>

          <p>Left-wing streamer Hasan Piker claims he was detained and questioned for hours at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport after arriving from Paris, alleging that federal agents asked about his political views, including his opinions on President Trump, Israel, Hamas, and the Houthis. Piker, who has openly criticized the Trump administration, believes he was targeted for his political stance. The Department of Homeland Security acknowledged Piker's detention but denied that his political beliefs were the reason for the inspection. Legal analysts note that while international travelers give up certain rights at entry points, there are limits to questioning beyond identity and citizenship. </p>
