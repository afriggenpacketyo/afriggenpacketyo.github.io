            <p>Former Los Angeles Councilmember Kevin de León is facing an $18,750 ethics fine for voting on city council decisions in which he had a financial interest and for failing to disclose income.

            <p>The Tren de Aragua, a dangerous gang, originated within the Tocorón prison in Venezuela, exploiting the country's economic crisis to expand its operations. Led by Héctor Guerrero, the gang controlled the prison through force and extortion, establishing a city-like environment with amenities. The gang's activities extended beyond the prison walls, involving drug trafficking, extortion, and kidnappings, leading to its spread across Venezuela and into other countries. The gang's notoriety has grown as President Trump has focused on it as a symbol of the threat posed by immigrants.</p>

            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of violating the announced "Easter truce" despite Vladimir Putin's order for a ceasefire. Putin stated his forces would halt military activity, but Zelensky reported ongoing fighting in the Kursk and Belgorod regions, as well as Russian drone activity. Zelensky reiterated Ukraine's readiness to adhere to a full ceasefire if Russia reciprocates. Previous attempts at ceasefires have failed due to lack of agreement.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court temporarily halted the deportation of Venezuelans detained under the Alien Enemies Act, pending further review. The ACLU challenged the deportations, arguing that the detainees were not given the opportunity to contest their removal in court. The White House defended the use of the act, while the ACLU welcomed the pause. The Alien Enemies Act, previously used during wartime, has been invoked by the Trump administration to deport alleged gang members.</p>
