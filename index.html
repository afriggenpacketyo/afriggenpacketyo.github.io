          <p>Japanese and U.S. officials have agreed to continue negotiations over tariffs, though significant disagreements remain, particularly concerning the U.S. treatment of Japan's auto industry. The talks in Washington occurred as the Trump administration hints at potentially extending a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, which is set to expire in early July. Japan faces a potential combined tariff rate of 24 percent, with a separate, substantial 27.5 percent tariff on imported passenger vehicles already impacting its automotive sector. The ongoing discussions aim to find a mutually beneficial trade agreement and address economic security cooperation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4, moving into sole possession of the best record in Major League Baseball. Despite a performance that manager Dave Roberts described as not their best, the team managed to secure the win. Key moments included home runs from Shohei Ohtani and Max Muncy, and a crucial game-ending double-play induced by closer Tanner Scott with the bases loaded. The victory highlights the team's ability to win games even when not playing at their peak potential, continuing their successful run.</p>

          <p>A Supreme Court ruling has affirmed the right of parents in Montgomery County, Maryland, to opt their children out of classroom lessons featuring specific LGBTQ+ themed storybooks on religious grounds. The 6-3 decision requires schools to provide advance notification before these books are read. The case centered on nine picture books, such as "Uncle Bobby's Wedding" and "Prince and Knight," which were part of the school district's effort to include LGBTQ+ family representation in the curriculum. The majority opinion argued these books promote messages contrary to some parents' religious beliefs, while the dissent argued that excluding them fails to acknowledge the existence of LGBTQ+ people in society.</p>

It references an exchange where a U.S. senator allegedly stated the goal was to reduce any regional rival to a "pre-industrial society," a policy that reportedly became official after September 11, 2001. The piece frames this agenda, once associated with neoconservative ideology, as a key driver of regional instability and conflict.

          <p>China's solar panel industry is facing a severe downturn, grappling with a domestic price war and prohibitive U.S. tariffs that are blocking export markets. Prices across the solar supply chain have plummeted by 60 to 80 percent in 2024, leading to significant financial losses for many of the nation's leading producers. The industry, once hailed as a new economic driver, is now contending with a supply glut and widespread unprofitability. This downturn has been reflected in the stock market, with major Chinese solar companies seeing their share prices fall dramatically. (not investment advice)</p>

The lawsuit alleges that Harbaugh and other university officials knew Weiss was improperly accessing private information but allowed him to coach in a playoff game before he was fired. Weiss faces separate criminal charges for allegedly hacking into the accounts of over 2,000 college athletes to find private images. The suit claims a lack of oversight by Harbaugh enabled the assistant's predatory behavior.</p>

          <p>Iran's Foreign Minister, Abbas Araghchi, has warned the Trump administration to cease its "disrespectful" rhetoric towards Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei or risk serious repercussions. The warning comes after a 12-day conflict with Israel and subsequent U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Araghchi asserted that if President Trump desires a deal, he must show respect, and threatened that Iran would not hesitate to "unveil its Real Capabilities" if provoked further.

This decision is seen by experts as reflecting a shift in priorities, with Indo-Pacific nations increasingly concerned that conflicts in the Middle East are distracting the United States. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba reportedly cancelled his trip after it became clear a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump was unlikely.

Federal courts must now narrow existing injunctions, potentially allowing the policy to be implemented in 28 states that did not sue.

The vote largely fell along party lines, though it highlighted ongoing Democratic frustration over what they describe as a lack of transparency from the administration regarding the strikes and their impact.

          <p>A new study from Tulane University reveals that parts of New Orleans' concrete flood protection system, reinforced after Hurricane Katrina, are sinking at an alarming rate, in some places nearly two inches per year. This subsidence is occurring faster than sea-level rise, potentially degrading the city's defenses against storm surges. The research used satellite radar data to identify sinking hotspots, particularly around industrial sites and new developments, likely due to soil compression and groundwater withdrawal. The findings serve as a critical warning about the need for ongoing monitoring and maintenance to protect the low-lying city.</p>

The 6-3 ruling came in a case concerning President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship. Writing for the majority, Justice Amy Coney Barrett argued that such sweeping orders likely exceed the authority granted to courts by Congress. While the decision narrows the injunctions against the birthright citizenship policy, it did not rule on the policy's constitutionality, instead remanding the issue to lower courts. The dissent, authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, warned the decision weakens the judiciary's ability to check executive power.</p>

          <p>Several communities in Los Angeles County have cancelled or postponed Independence Day parades and other July events due to widespread fear among residents over ongoing immigration enforcement raids. Organizers cited concerns for the safety of participants and spectators, noting that many community groups had withdrawn from events. The raids, reportedly occurring in public spaces like Home Depot parking lots and near food vendors, have created a climate of fear, with Mayor Karen Bass stating that families are afraid to go out in public. This has led to a significant disruption of community life and cultural celebrations.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has warned that a Republican budget bill in the U.S. Senate could cause as many as 3.4 million Californians to lose their Medi-Cal health insurance. The bill proposes new work requirements for many Medicaid recipients, which Newsom argues would create a "labyrinth of manual verification" and lead to massive coverage losses. He also stated the bill threatens funding for struggling rural hospitals and could drive up premiums on the state's ACA marketplace. Newsom characterized the proposed cuts as "reckless and cruel," posing a significant threat to California's healthcare system.</p>

          <p>A recent study by the Japan Institute for Health Security found a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals who consume a traditional Japanese-style diet. The diet, which includes rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables, was assessed among nearly 12,500 employees. Researchers noted that certain foods in the diet, such as those rich in omega-3 fatty acids and folic acid, may contribute to improved mental well-being by assisting in the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin. While further research is needed, the findings suggest a potential link between this dietary pattern and mental health.</p>

The May 16 escape, which went unnoticed for hours, has drawn heavy criticism of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's management of the facility.

Lemons then moved to Tennessee and used the stolen funds for personal expenses, including a new car, property, and airline tickets.

          <p>As antibiotic resistance grows into a "silent pandemic," scientists are revisiting a century-old idea: using bacteriophages, or "phages," to treat infections. Phages are viruses that specifically target and kill bacteria, offering a potential alternative to antibiotics for incurable superbugs. A project at the University of Southampton is actively collecting phage samples from the public to build a library for potential medical use. While phage therapy is not yet mainstream, the UK's drug regulator has published rules to support its development, signaling a renewed interest in this approach to combat the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance.</p>
