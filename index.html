          <p>Vivian Spohr, the wife of Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr, is being investigated for negligent homicide following a fatal traffic accident on the Italian island of Sardinia. She allegedly struck and killed a 24-year-old Italian woman with her SUV while on holiday in the resort town of Porto Cervo. In a statement, Spohr expressed deep regret and confirmed her full cooperation with the Italian judicial authorities for the investigation. Initial tests for alcohol and drugs on Spohr came back negative, and authorities are reviewing security camera footage to clarify the circumstances of the tragic event.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to impose a 35% tariff on Canadian goods, escalating trade tensions just as a deadline for a new deal approaches. The threat was issued via social media and is part of a broader strategy that includes potential tariffs on other major trading partners like the European Union. Trump linked the proposed tariffs to Canada's alleged failure to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S., a claim Canadian officials dispute while affirming their commitment to border security. This move adds to existing levies on Canadian steel, aluminum, and auto products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 15:19:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin has surged to a new record high, briefly exceeding $118,000, driven by a significant influx of institutional investment into cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs experienced their largest single day of inflows for the year, totaling $1.18 billion, which fueled the rally. The price increase also triggered a wave of short liquidations, further accelerating the upward momentum. Analysts attribute the sustained interest to expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve and potential crypto-friendly legislation, which are seen as positive catalysts for the digital asset.

          <p>Crystal Palace has been controversially stripped of its historic spot in the Europa League, which will now be awarded to Nottingham Forest due to a conflict with UEFA's multi-club ownership rules. The issue centers on John Textor, who holds a significant stake in both Crystal Palace and French club Lyon, which also qualified for the competition. Because Lyon finished higher in their domestic league, they were given precedence, demoting Palace to the less prestigious Conference League. Crystal Palace, arguing Textor lacks decisive control, missed a key deadline to restructure and is now expected to appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines is planning to introduce more varied ticket options within its premium cabins, mirroring the segmentation strategy it successfully applied to its main economy cabin. The airline's president, Glen Hauenstein, stated that the goal is to cater to the diverse needs of premium travelers, though specific details of the new fare structures were not disclosed. This focus on high-end cabins comes as revenue from premium seats has grown by 6%, while main cabin revenue has seen a slight decline. The move could result in different tiers of business or first-class fares, potentially offering varied levels of amenities like lounge access or seat selection.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to federal drug trafficking and criminal enterprise charges in a Chicago court. As a leader of the "Los Chapitos" faction of the Sinaloa cartel, he admitted to overseeing a massive fentanyl trafficking operation that supplied vast quantities of the opioid to the United States. As part of his plea agreement, Guzman Lopez must provide "substantial assistance" to the government, which could lead to a sentence of less than life in prison. He is the first of El Chapo's sons to strike such a deal with U.S. prosecutors.</p>

          <p>This article posits that the current season of the reality show 'Love Island USA' serves as a compelling portrait of Gen Z's dating habits, characterized by emotional guardedness and a lack of deep romantic connections. Despite high viewership, the season has been criticized by fans for featuring "situationships" rather than genuine love stories. The author suggests this reflects a broader trend among young adults who grew up online and during the pandemic, leading to anxiety about vulnerability and direct communication. The show's most popular contestants are those who defy this trend by openly expressing their strong emotions, resonating with an audience that may struggle with similar inhibitions.</p>

          <p>Christina Block, the 52-year-old heiress to Germany's Block House steakhouse chain, is on trial in Hamburg, accused of orchestrating the violent kidnapping of her two youngest children from their father in Denmark.

Block's defense claims she was a desperate mother acting to reclaim her children, who she alleges were wrongfully kept by her ex-husband in defiance of a German court order.

          <p>President Trump's new tax legislation temporarily increases the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000, but a phaseout provision could create a significant tax spike for certain high earners. Tax professionals warn of a "SALT torpedo," where the deduction benefit is reduced for those with modified adjusted gross incomes between $500,000 and $600,000. This quirk in the law means that for every dollar earned within that specific income range, individuals could effectively lose part of their deduction, potentially pushing their marginal federal tax rate to as high as 45.5%.

While the number was initially arbitrary, subsequent research has shown it to be a reasonably effective benchmark for promoting good health. Experts note that health benefits, such as reduced cardiovascular risk, can begin at lower step counts, around 2,500 to 3,000 per day. The consensus is that while 10,000 is a useful and motivating target, the most important thing is to remain active, with any amount of walking being better than none.</p>

The resurgence is attributed to declining vaccination rates, fueled by pandemic-related disruptions to routine immunizations and the growing influence of anti-vaccine sentiment. Officials are urging the public to ensure their MMR vaccinations are up-to-date, as this remains the most effective protection against measles and its potentially severe complications.</p>
