          <p>Hundreds of thousands of Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv and other cities, urging their government to secure a deal for the release of hostages held by Hamas and to end the war in Gaza. Organizers and families of hostages expressed fears that the government's planned occupation of Gaza City would endanger the remaining captives, transforming what they see as a just war into a pointless one. The protests, which included a one-day national strike, were criticized by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who claimed they would only harden Hamas's position. The demonstrations occur amid a dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where the UN reports widespread displacement and malnutrition.</p>

          <p>British actor Terence Stamp, renowned for his six-decade career and iconic roles such as General Zod in the "Superman" films, has passed away at the age of 87. Nominated for an Oscar for his debut in "Billy Budd," Stamp became a prominent figure in the 1960s, known for both his talent and high-profile relationships. After a career lull, he experienced a major resurgence with "Superman" and later earned acclaim for his role as a transgender woman in "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert." Colleagues and organizations like Bafta are paying tribute to his extraordinary body of work.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, was downgraded to a Category 3 storm but is forecast to intensify again as it moves north of the Caribbean. While not expected to make direct landfall on the U.S. East Coast, its large size is generating life-threatening surf and rip currents along the Southeast coast. The storm, which briefly reached Category 5, is undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, a process that can lead to temporary weakening followed by re-strengthening. Tropical storm warnings are in effect for the Turks and Caicos Islands and parts of the Bahamas, with heavy rain and potential flooding expected.</p>

          <p>A Texas judge has issued a restraining order preventing former congressman Beto O'Rourke and his political organization, Powered by People, from transferring funds out of the state. The order stems from a complaint by Attorney General Ken Paxton, who alleges the group's fundraising for out-of-state Democratic lawmakers constitutes deceptive trade practices. The Democratic lawmakers had left Texas to break quorum and block a Republican-led legislative session on congressional redistricting. The judge's ruling freezes the group's assets within Texas, including those on fundraising platforms like ActBlue, amid the ongoing political battle.</p>

The teenager was reportedly a resident of La Puente. As of Sunday, no arrests have been made, and authorities are actively investigating the circumstances that led to the fatal incident.

Manager Ruben Amorim's decision to start Bayindir over the recently fit Andre Onana came under scrutiny after Bayindir failed to handle a corner, leading to Riccardo Calafiori's decisive goal. Despite an improved attacking performance, United could not find an equalizer, intensifying the debate around the club's goalkeeping situation. Amorim defended his player, suggesting he was fouled, but the loss highlights ongoing questions about the team's roster composition.</p>

          <p>Iraqi officials have commenced the excavation of a large sinkhole south of Mosul, believed to be a mass grave containing the remains of thousands of people killed by the Islamic State group a decade ago. The site, known as al-Khafsa, is considered one of the largest and most complex mass graves in the country's modern history. The initial phase involves collecting surface evidence and preparing for a full exhumation, which will require international support due to site hazards. Authorities are also building a DNA database to help identify victims, who are believed to include Iraqi security personnel, Yazidis, and other civilians.</p>

          <p>Businesses in several Florida beach cities are reporting a significant downturn, with some calling their towns "ghost towns" and experiencing revenue drops of up to 30% this summer. This decline is occurring even as statewide tourism numbers appear stable, suggesting a shift in consumer behavior. Experts believe that persistent inflation and economic uncertainty are causing American travelers to slash their budgets for items like airfare and lodging, leading to lower overall spending. For savvy consumers, this local slump could present an opportunity for discounts on hotels, restaurants, and attractions in the affected areas. (not investment advice)</p>

With the season opener against the Houston Texans just three weeks away, the 37-year-old veteran's absence is becoming a serious concern for the team's prospects. Coach Sean McVay has provided few details, increasing speculation about Stafford's availability and the team's contingency plans. In his absence, backups Jimmy Garoppolo and Stetson Bennett have been taking snaps, but the team's potential as a Super Bowl contender largely depends on a healthy Stafford.</p>

The Democrats' departure successfully derailed an initial special session called by Governor Greg Abbott to pass a plan that would likely create five new Republican-leaning U.S. House seats. Their return coincides with a new special session and follows a strategic countermove by California's governor, who announced a plan to redraw his state's districts to favor Democrats.

While polling shows a majority of Ukrainians oppose formally ceding land, some citizens in the war-torn region express a desire to prioritize saving lives over territory.

          <p>A former student research assistant at Michigan State University is planning to file a $100 million lawsuit against the institution, alleging that her thyroid cancer was caused by workplace negligence. The lawsuit claims that LingLong Wei was repeatedly exposed to dangerous chemicals without proper safety training or protective equipment, despite her requests for them. Her law firm stated that the university ignored numerous safety protocols, leading to her diagnosis. The university has not yet responded to the allegations, and a news conference is scheduled to provide more details about the case.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 11 civil liberty and anti-racism organizations, including Liberty and Big Brother Watch, has called on London's Metropolitan Police to cancel plans to use live facial recognition (LFR) technology at the upcoming Notting Hill Carnival. In a letter to the commissioner, the groups described LFR as a "mass surveillance tool" that unfairly treats all attendees as suspects and raised concerns about its accuracy, particularly for women and people of color. The Met Police defended the technology, stating it is accurate, helps keep people safe, and has led to over 1,000 arrests this year.</p>

          <p>Two American tourists, both passengers on Carnival cruise ships, died in separate drowning incidents at the cruise line's private resort in the Bahamas. The deaths occurred on Friday at Celebration Key on Grand Bahama Island. According to police reports, a 79-year-old man lost consciousness while snorkeling at a beach, and a 74-year-old woman lost consciousness while swimming in a pool. In both cases, lifeguards administered CPR, but the individuals were later pronounced dead. The Royal Bahamas Police Force is investigating the circumstances surrounding both fatalities.</p>

          <p>A new study of dental remains discovered at an archaeological site in China is challenging previous understandings of early human evolution in Asia. The 300,000-year-old teeth exhibit a "mosaic" of features, combining archaic traits typical of Homo erectus with more advanced traits found in Homo sapiens. This unique combination suggests that modern humans were present in Asia much earlier than previously believed and that interbreeding occurred between different hominin groups. Researchers state this discovery reveals that human evolution was not a linear process and that Asia was a site of diverse evolutionary experiments.</p>

          <p>Spain is struggling to contain numerous large wildfires as the country endures a heatwave now in its third week, with temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius (104 F). The fires have already claimed at least three lives, destroyed over a thousand square kilometers of land, and forced thousands of people to evacuate their homes. The government has deployed military emergency units to support firefighters, particularly in the hard-hit northwestern region of Galicia. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has acknowledged the crisis, and Spain has requested assistance from the European Union, with several countries sending aid.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump Shifts Stance from Ceasefire to Full Peace Agreement After Putin Meeting</h2>

          <p>Following his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Trump has altered his public stance on resolving the Ukraine war, now advocating for a direct peace agreement over an immediate ceasefire. This new position aligns with Russia's preference and contrasts with that of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, who favors a ceasefire as a necessary first step to halt hostilities before complex negotiations. This article analyzes the shift, noting that Ukraine fears protracted negotiations without a ceasefire would allow Russia to continue its attacks and buy time. The change in Trump's approach sets the stage for a critical meeting with Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House.</p>

          <h2>Draft of New 'Make America Healthy Again' Report Avoids Strict Pesticide Restrictions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A draft of the Trump administration's upcoming "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) report does not recommend severe restrictions on pesticides or ultra-processed foods, a position seen as a victory for the agriculture industry. This approach appears to be a setback for HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has strongly advocated against chemical additives in the food supply, linking them to health issues in children. Instead of calling for elimination, the draft suggests more precise pesticide application and further research. The document also proposes developing a government-wide definition for "ultra-processed food" rather than restricting its use.</p>
