          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index and Topix surged to record highs after Sanae Takaichi was elected as the new leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, positioning her to become the country's first female prime minister. Investors anticipate her administration will continue market-friendly policies, with Credit Agricole CIB suggesting she will likely ask the Bank of Japan to maintain accommodative monetary policy, though a rate hike by early 2026 is still considered. The yen weakened past 150 against the dollar, raising concerns about its impact on domestic issues such as overtourism and property prices. This article details the immediate market adjustments and future economic expectations under Takaichi's leadership, noting the potential for further yen weakness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker announced that President Trump has ordered 400 Texas National Guard members to deploy to Illinois, Oregon, and other locations, without direct coordination with state officials. Pritzker condemned the move as "Trump's Invasion" and a political weaponization of military troops, urging Texas Governor Greg Abbott to withdraw support. Abbott, however, stated he fully authorized the deployment to ensure safety for federal officials amidst ongoing protests and clashes.

These machines perform repetitive tasks such as welding and assembly, effectively filling labor gaps and ensuring the manufacturing sector's continued competitiveness. Professor Gao Xudong of Tsinghua University emphasizes that despite the shrinking overall population, improvements in workforce education and the widespread use of robots will enable China to maintain and enhance its industrial edge.

          <p>This article explains why COVID-19 vaccines are currently excluded from the traditional Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), which typically covers recommended childhood immunizations. Instead, claims for COVID vaccine-related injuries are processed through the more restrictive Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP), designed for emergency measures. Legal experts advocate for integrating COVID vaccines into the VICP, citing its more comprehensive compensation and longer statute of limitations for claimants. The primary concern with this transition, however, is the potential for an overwhelming backlog, given the thousands of unresolved cases already existing in the CICP.</p>

The consumer campaign group Which? is accusing the US tech giant of anti-competitive practices, alleging that Qualcomm forced Apple and Samsung to pay inflated prices and licensing fees for essential handset components. This, in turn, pushed up the cost of those smartphones for consumers. The trial, expected to last five weeks, focuses on whether Qualcomm held and abused a dominant market position, potentially resulting in an estimated £17 per affected user.</p>

This perceived style imbalance, popularized on TikTok, can lead to feelings of mismatched vibes or even disrespect, according to dating coaches. However, relationship experts also caution against trying to change a partner's style, which can be seen as an imposition. Some couples demonstrate that differing styles don't necessarily create negativity if mutual respect and individual expression are prioritized.

While a formal peace treaty is yet to be signed, the region has seen a cessation of hostilities since the Washington meeting. However, the project faces immense challenges, including building infrastructure from scratch and navigating colliding interests from Russia, which claims the region as its sphere of influence, and Iran, which has issued threats against the plan.

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is set to restart some production this week, beginning with its Wolverhampton engine factory, after a major cyberattack forced a month-long shutdown of its global operations. While this offers relief, full capacity is weeks away, and suppliers, many small businesses, face continued financial pressure from six weeks of zero sales and ongoing costs.

          <p>Gisèle Pelicot is returning to court to face one of her sexual assaulters, who is appealing his conviction from last year's trial where 51 men were found guilty of sexually assaulting her while she was drugged. Her defiant public stance was initially seen as a catalyst against sexual violence in France, but campaigners now express concern over a perceived decline in optimism and lack of substantive changes. Conviction rates remain flat despite a sharp rise in reported sexual assault cases, and a Senate report criticized the government's strategy.

After multiple inconclusive examinations, an MRI scan revealed a large tumor, leading to the diagnosis. Due to the tumor encasing blood vessels and nerves, amputation was the only viable option.
