        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Block's first-quarter earnings fell short of Wall Street's expectations, leading to a 15% drop in the stock price during extended trading. The company reported adjusted earnings per share that may not be comparable to estimates and revenue of $5.77 billion, which was below the expected $6.2 billion. Block also provided weaker-than-expected profit guidance for the second quarter and full year, attributing this to a dynamic macro environment and caution due to President Trump's tariffs on imported goods. Despite these challenges, CFO Amrita Ahuja highlighted that Block delivered its most profitable quarter ever, reflecting business discipline and efficiency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cambodia continues to struggle with the deadly threat of landmines, a remnant of decades of conflict, including the Vietnam War and the Khmer Rouge regime. Millions of mines and unexploded ordnance still litter the countryside, posing a significant danger to civilians. Organizations like Cambodia Self Help DeMining are working to clear these explosives, but the process is slow and dangerous. While Cambodia hoped to be mine-free by 2025, the goal is no longer attainable due to the vast number of uncleared minefields.</p>

          <p>Santa Cruz has implemented a new "soda tax," adding a 2-cents-per-ounce tax on nonalcoholic beverages with added sweeteners, despite a statewide ban on such taxes. The tax, approved by voters, applies to beverages with 40 or more calories per 12 fluid ounces. Santa Cruz is the first city to institute a new soda tax since the statewide ban was enacted in 2018. Proponents framed the campaign as a battle against the American Beverage Association, emphasizing local control.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approach to ending the war in Ukraine has shifted, with frustration now directed towards Vladimir Putin. After a disastrous meeting with President Zelensky, Trump initially pursued a peace plan favoring Russia.

Analysts caution that Trump's approach remains unpredictable, with conflicting views among his advisors. Trump has publicly criticized Putin and threatened to escalate economic pressure on Russia.</p>
