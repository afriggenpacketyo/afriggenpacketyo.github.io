            <p>An American Airlines plane clipped the wingtip of another American Airlines plane on a taxiway at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. No injuries were reported, and airport operations were not affected as both planes returned to their gates for inspection. The FAA is investigating the incident, which involved a flight headed to Charleston and another to JFK, with damage limited to a winglet on each aircraft. Several members of Congress were on one of the flights and expressed concern about FAA staffing levels in light of the incident.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods are causing panic among Amazon sellers who rely on China for manufacturing. With tariffs potentially reaching 145%, sellers face raising prices or absorbing increased costs. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy indicated that sellers will likely pass the costs to consumers, while Amazon explores strategic inventory buys and renegotiates terms. Some sellers are considering moving manufacturing out of China, but many find it financially infeasible to relocate to the U.S. due to infrastructure limitations.</p>

            <p>Despite a temporary pause on some tariffs, experts warn that President Trump's trade policies, particularly the increased duties on Chinese goods, still risk inflation and recession.

Economists suggest that these factors could lead to a slowdown for businesses and a decrease in consumer spending, potentially triggering an economic downturn. Even with the tariff pause, the U.S. faces the highest average effective tariff rate since 1909.</p>

The incident is part of a broader campaign of sabotage targeting key infrastructure in Europe, allegedly in retaliation for support of Ukraine.

            <p>The US House of Representatives passed a budget bill that includes trillions of dollars in cuts to taxes and government spending, despite opposition from Democrats and some Republicans. The bill is a key part of President Trump's legislative agenda and aims to cut taxes and government spending. The House bill has deeper spending cuts than the Senate version, requiring a reconciliation process. The bill would also add to the US government's debt, leading to opposition from some Republican hard-liners.</p>
