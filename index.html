          <p>The Leadmill, an iconic music venue in Sheffield for 45 years, has hosted its final event after losing a prolonged battle with its landlords. The venue, which helped launch the careers of bands like Pulp and Arctic Monkeys, is cherished by musicians and fans who remember it as a cultural cornerstone. Although the new owners, The Electric Group, plan to keep it as a music venue under a likely new name, many artists and patrons have stated they will not return out of principle, mourning the loss of a grassroots institution.</p>

          <p>A massive spending package backed by President Trump has cleared a critical procedural hurdle in the Senate, advancing after a tense and lengthy vote. The legislation, which faced opposition from some Republican holdouts, only passed after several senators switched their votes at the last minute. This sets up a final vote on the nearly 1,000-page bill, though its passage is not guaranteed as it still needs to clear the House, where some members have expressed opposition to the Senate's version. Democrats are employing delay tactics by forcing a full reading of the bill.</p>

          <p>After a six-year wait for justice, the family of Blaze Bernstein saw his killer, Samuel Woodward, convicted of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement. Bernstein, a 19-year-old gay and Jewish college student, was stabbed to death by his former high school classmate, who was involved with a neo-Nazi group. The trial detailed Woodward's extremist ties and the violent nature of the murder, which the prosecution successfully argued was motivated by prejudice. The verdict means Woodward now faces a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new partnership with major food retailers in England to encourage customers to make healthier choices and tackle rising obesity rates. Under the plan, supermarkets and manufacturers will voluntarily implement strategies such as offering promotions on healthy food, adjusting loyalty point systems, or changing store layouts to make nutritious options more appealing. The initiative aims to improve public health and relieve pressure on the NHS, but some experts caution its impact may be limited without broader, more comprehensive changes to the food system.</p>

This issue mirrors the dark side of the original UK franchise, where two former contestants died by suicide, leading to a government inquiry into reality television. Experts note that while the UK has improved its duty-of-care protocols, the US version is now grappling with how to balance the demand for on-screen drama with the mental well-being of its cast in an era of intense social media scrutiny.</p>

He emphasized that while criticism is part of the job, threatening statements from high-level politicians are inappropriate and dangerous, urging them to consider the potential consequences of their words.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "urban heat island" effect is a phenomenon that causes cities to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas, particularly during heatwaves. This occurs because dark, hard surfaces like roads and buildings absorb and retain the sun's energy, while natural landscapes with vegetation and water provide cooling through evaporation. This stored heat is released slowly, raising urban temperatures and making city populations more vulnerable to the health risks of extreme heat, a problem exacerbated by climate change and growing urban populations.</p>

          <p>Japan's first fully professional women's football league, the WE League, has concluded its fourth season with a record-breaking total attendance, signaling significant growth for the sport. The league's success is credited to innovative promotional strategies, including collaborative events with the men's J-League and player-led campaigns that have substantially boosted crowd sizes. A doubleheader event in Tokyo set a new attendance record for a domestic women's league match, and the league plans to build on this momentum by enhancing marketing strategies for all its clubs.</p>
