          <h2>Conservative Karol Nawrocki Wins Polish Presidential Election</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 00:49:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to final vote counts, conservative Karol Nawrocki has won Poland's presidential election in a tight race against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski. Nawrocki secured 50.89% of the vote, while Trzaskowski received 49.11%, revealing deep divisions within the country, a key member of NATO and the EU. The outcome suggests Poland will likely take a more nationalist direction under Nawrocki's leadership, who was endorsed by former U.S. President Donald Trump. With most day-to-day power residing with the prime minister, the president still wields influence over foreign policy and can veto legislation, potentially hindering Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda. The election result is a boost for the Law and Justice party, which lost power in 2023, renewing their hopes for the 2027 parliamentary elections, as Nawrocki's victory will allow the party to continue to champion traditional, patriotic values.</p>

          <p>An attack at Boulder's Pearl Street Mall in Colorado has left eight people injured after a suspect allegedly used a "makeshift flamethrower" and threw Molotov cocktails during a march supporting Israeli hostages. The suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was taken into custody and is being investigated for terrorism by the FBI, with witnesses reporting that he yelled "free Palestine" during the attack. The victims, ranging in age from 52 to 88, included four women and four men, with one critically injured. The attack occurred during a weekly walk organized by Run For Their Lives, a pro-Israeli group raising awareness for hostages in Gaza, prompting condemnation from Colorado Governor Jared Polis and other officials. The FBI is conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity related to the attack in El Paso County, Colorado, as the investigation continues.</p>

Meanwhile, the Daily Mail teases lines from Sarah Vine's forthcoming memoir, focusing on Brexit's impact on her marriage. Healey's comments on migrants crossing the English Channel also make headlines, with the Metro reporting his admission that "We've lost control," and the Daily Express quoting him saying small boat smugglers are running a 'taxi' service across the Channel.</p>

          <p>Right-wing historian Karol Nawrocki is likely to become Poland's new president, with nearly all votes counted by the state electoral commission, though the official result is pending. Local media extrapolations indicate Nawrocki won 50.9% of the votes, narrowly defeating Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, who secured 49.1%. Should Nawrocki's victory be confirmed, he is expected to use his presidential veto power to impede Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda. Both candidates support continued assistance for Ukraine, but differ on their approach to the EU, with Trzaskowski favoring closer ties with Germany and France, while Nawrocki advocates for a strong, sovereign Poland.</p>

          <p>Shares of Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and its affiliate Brickworks have surged following the announcement of a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger. The deal involves a new company listed in Sydney acquiring all outstanding shares of both Soul Patts and Brickworks, creating a merged entity with approximately $9 billion in value and A$13.1 billion in holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit. The merger aims to simplify the corporate structure, add scale, and create a more investable company by unwinding a 56-year mutual ownership designed to fend off hostile takeovers. Brickworks shareholders are set to receive an implied value of A$30.28 per share, reflecting a 10.1% premium over the stock's closing price last Friday (not investment advice).</p>

Critics, however, argue that the vote will politicize the judiciary in a country already struggling with crime and gang violence. Voters were tasked with electing around 880 federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, along with hundreds of local judges and magistrates, with another election for remaining positions scheduled for 2027. Turnout appeared low, with many voters expressing difficulty in choosing from hundreds of largely unknown candidates, while some voiced concerns about feeling pressured to vote or disillusionment with the system.</p>

          <p>Ukraine claims it completed its biggest long-range attack of the war with Russia, using smuggled drones to launch a series of major strikes on 40 Russian warplanes at four military bases. The attacks come as Russian and Ukrainian negotiators are heading to Istanbul, Turkey, for a second round of peace talks. Russia confirmed Ukrainian attacks in five regions, calling them a "terrorist act". President Volodymyr Zelensky said 117 drones were used in the so-called "Spider's Web" operation by the SBU security service, striking "34% of [Russia's] strategic cruise missile carriers".</p>

          <p>A Chinese national, Haoxiang Gao, charged with voting illegally at the University of Michigan, has fled the U.S., according to an FBI criminal complaint. Gao, who admitted to registering and voting in the 2024 general election, was ordered to surrender his Chinese passport and remain in Michigan, but he boarded a flight to Shanghai using a different passport. He has been federally charged with flight to avoid prosecution, though the U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with China. The case is among the few instances of noncitizens voting in federal elections, with analysis finding 30 suspected cases out of 23.5 million votes cast in reviewed jurisdictions.</p>

A government review of higher education funding is underway in England, and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is supporting collaboration where possible. The review by Universities UK found universities were reluctant to collaborate due to concerns around breaking business laws. Greater collaboration between universities could be a solution for institutions struggling to cut costs, but more clarity is needed to prevent universities from making decisions about course closures in isolation.</p>
