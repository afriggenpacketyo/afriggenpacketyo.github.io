          <p>The Trump administration has blocked Harvard University from enrolling international students, citing concerns about violence, antisemitism, and coordination with the Chinese Communist Party. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that enrolling foreign students is a privilege, not a right, and accused Harvard of refusing to address these issues. The administration had previously frozen federal grants to Harvard and threatened to revoke its ability to enroll foreign students, demanding the university eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and evaluate international students for ideological concerns. Harvard has not yet commented on the matter.</p>

          <p>The Senate voted to revoke three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move disputed by the chamber's parliamentarian. The waivers, approved by the Biden administration's EPA in 2024, allowed California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards, including an EV mandate requiring all new vehicle sales to be zero emissions by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act permits overturning agency rules, while Democrats claim the vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. California's Attorney General is prepared for a legal fight, and 16 other states and D.C. have adopted California's standards, potentially impacting cities and states around the country.</p>

The shooting is being investigated as a hate crime, and the FBI is involved in the investigation.

          <p>Thailand's deep south is experiencing renewed conflict between Thai military forces and separatist groups, particularly the Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN), despite ongoing peace talks. Violence has surged in 2025, with attacks targeting both civilians and security forces. The Thai government, influenced by Thaksin Shinawatra, is under pressure to find a solution, but analysts suggest that current efforts are more symbolic than substantive. Malaysia's role as a facilitator in peace talks is also being questioned, with some suggesting Thailand should directly engage with the BRN's proposals for negotiation and a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 4-to-4 decision, upheld a ruling by the Oklahoma Supreme Court that blocked the school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School. The evenly divided Supreme Court rejected a plan to allow Oklahoma to use government money to run the nation’s first religious charter school, which would teach a curriculum infused by Catholic doctrine. The deadlock means that an earlier ruling by the Oklahoma Supreme Court will be allowed to stand, as the state court blocked a proposal for the Oklahoma school. Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself from the case, and the decision provided no reasoning. The decision sets no nationwide precedent on the question of whether the First Amendment permits states to sponsor and finance religious charter schools.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Expropriation Act, which allows the government to seize private property for public use with compensation, has sparked international debate, particularly with the Trump administration. The law aims to address historical land imbalances resulting from Apartheid policies, where a significant portion of commercial farmland is owned by the white minority. While the government has yet to seize land without compensation, concerns persist among minority groups and international observers regarding potential threats to private ownership. The situation has drawn comparisons to land reforms in Zimbabwe, raising fears of economic instability and human rights abuses.</p>

          <p>Two Israeli Embassy employees were shot and killed outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. The victims have been identified as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim. Law enforcement officials described the attack as "targeted" and said the suspect shouted "Free Palestine" as he was being detained. The shooting was being investigated as a hate crime, a law enforcement source said. The suspect, identified as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez of Chicago, was initially "observed pacing back and forth outside of the museum" before he approached a group of four people, "produced a handgun," and shot the two victims, Smith said at a late-night news conference.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration on Thursday halted Harvard University’s ability to enroll international students, a major escalation in the administration’s efforts to pressure the college to fall in line with the president’s agenda. The administration notified Harvard about the decision after a back-and-forth in recent days over the legality of a sprawling records request as part of the Department of Homeland Security’s investigation, according to three people with knowledge of the negotiations. The decision is effective immediately, according to a letter sent to the university by Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have advanced a multi-trillion-dollar tax and spending package that could significantly impact household finances. The bill, called the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," proposes making President Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while introducing new provisions affecting student borrowing, health savings accounts, and car ownership. The legislation includes raising the SALT deduction limit, expanding the child tax credit, cutting Medicaid and SNAP benefits, and offering a "bonus" deduction for older adults. It also introduces new "Trump Accounts" for child savings and a car loan interest deduction. (not investment advice)</p>

Under the terms of the agreement Mauritius would gain sovereignty of the islands from the UK, but allow the US and UK to continue operating a military base on Diego Garcia for an initial period of 99 years. The Conservatives described the deal as "an act of national self-harm", which left the UK "more exposed to China" because of its ties with Mauritius.</p>

The federal agency placed its final order for penny blanks this month, with the United States Mint slated to end manufacturing of the penny when that runs out. Ending production of the penny will save the Mint about $56 million in annual savings, the Treasury said on Thursday. The penny, which dates from the early days of the U.S. Mint after its establishment in 1792, now costs more to manufacture than the coin is worth.</p>
