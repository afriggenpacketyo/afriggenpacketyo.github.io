            <h2>TSMC Earnings Fail to Lift Nvidia Amid Market Concerns</h2>

            <p>Despite strong first-quarter earnings and a positive second-quarter revenue forecast from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), Nvidia shares experienced a decline, reflecting broader market anxieties. TSMC, a key chip supplier for Nvidia, Broadcom, and Apple, reported no changes in consumer behavior and maintained its annual revenue forecast, also anticipating a doubling of AI accelerator revenue in 2025. Jim Cramer retired his 'own it, don't trade it' mantra on shares of Nvidia and Apple at our Monthly Meeting on Wednesday, suggesting a shift in investment strategy amid tariff uncertainties and market instability. The market's decline was further influenced by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's cautious stance on near-term interest rate cuts due to tariff impacts. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The UK government has temporarily banned the personal import of cheese and certain meats from the EU into Great Britain to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease, a measure that does not affect commercial imports. This ban, effective since April 12, applies to travelers arriving from the EU by any mode of transport but excludes Northern Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man. The ban aims to protect livestock from the highly contagious disease, which is harmless to humans but devastating to animals like cattle, sheep, and pigs, with potential fines up to £5,000 for offenders.</p>

            <p>A federal judge ruled that Google illegally maintained a monopoly in the publisher ad servers and ad exchanges markets, marking a significant legal setback for the tech giant. The ruling stated that Google's control over ad technology resulted in website creators earning less and advertisers paying more. While Google won a partial victory by not being found to hold a monopoly in advertiser ad networks, the overall decision could reshape the online advertising business, which is heavily relied upon by website publishers. Google intends to appeal the portion of the ruling it lost, arguing that publishers have many options and choose Google because its tools are simple, affordable, and effective.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump met with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni at the White House amid ongoing trade tensions with the European Union, where Meloni aimed to position herself as a mediator between the Trump administration and the EU. Trump stated he is 'very confident' about securing a trade deal with the EU and said that every nation is on his priority list for trade negotiations. Meanwhile, Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, stating his 'termination cannot come fast enough' after Powell suggested Trump's tariff policies would cause higher inflation and slower economic growth.</p>

            <p>Astronomers have detected promising hints of potential life on the exoplanet K2-18b, located 124 light years away, using the James Webb Space Telescope. Researchers found signs of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in the planet's atmosphere, a chemical produced only by life on Earth, primarily by phytoplankton. While cautioning that more observations are needed, the researchers suggest this is the strongest evidence yet of possible life beyond our solar system, with the potential for confirmation within one to two years. K2-18b, orbiting within its star's habitable zone, is considered a prime candidate for a 'hycean planet'—an ocean world with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.</p>

While overall attitudes remain largely unfavorable at 77%, the percentage of Americans with 'very unfavorable' views decreased by 10 points to 33%. The survey, conducted after Trump announced two rounds of tariffs on Chinese imports, revealed that only a third of Americans now consider China an 'enemy,' compared to 42% last year, suggesting a shift in public perception despite ongoing geopolitical tensions.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is threatening to ban Harvard University from enrolling foreign students unless the institution makes changes to hiring, admissions, and teaching practices to combat antisemitism on campus. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has requested records on the 'illegal and violent' activities of foreign student visa-holders, while Harvard has rejected these demands as an attempt to regulate the university's 'intellectual conditions.' This threat comes after a freeze of $2.2 billion in federal funding and potential removal of Harvard's tax exemption, escalating the conflict between the administration and universities where pro-Palestinian protests have occurred.</p>

            <p>Target's CEO, Brian Cornell, is scheduled to meet with civil rights leader Al Sharpton to discuss the company's decision to scale back its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Sharpton's organization, the National Action Network, has been encouraging consumers to boycott retailers that have reduced their DEI efforts. Target, along with other companies like Walmart, Amazon, and PepsiCo, has eliminated policies aimed at promoting diversity among employees and reducing discrimination, following President Trump's move to end DEI programs within the federal government.</p>

            <p>The Texas House approved a controversial school choice bill that would provide eligible families with public funds to help pay for private school tuition, after nearly 11 hours of debate. The bill, passed with an 85-63 vote, will provide taxpayer-funded education savings accounts, also known as school vouchers, allowing students in public schools to attend private institutions if accepted into the state's program. The measure, supported by Governor Abbott and President Trump, is seen as a victory for parents seeking more education choices, while Democrats criticize it as 'welfare for the rich' that will harm public school districts.</p>

            <p>President Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, stating that his 'termination cannot come fast enough' and calling for interest rate cuts. Trump's remarks followed Powell's warning about the potential consequences of the administration's trade war, which could reignite inflation, and came after the European Central Bank cut rates. Despite Trump's criticism, Powell has defended the Fed's independence and stated that presidents do not have the power to fire the Fed chair, whose term ends in May 2026.</p>

            <p>UnitedHealth Group's stock experienced a significant drop of 20% after the company reduced its annual profit forecast, citing higher-than-expected medical costs in its Medicare Advantage plans. This downturn raises concerns for other health insurers with Medicare Advantage plans, as analysts suggest it could be a warning sign for the industry. The rise in medical costs is attributed to more seniors returning to hospitals for procedures delayed during the pandemic, with UnitedHealth noting a notable increase in doctor and outpatient services.</p>

            <p>An article argues that Trump's attacks on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and his demand for interest rate cuts undermine the Fed's independence and threaten economic stability. It draws parallels to Trump's politicization of the FBI, suggesting that he may attempt to install a loyalist at the Fed to influence monetary policy for political gain. The author contends that Trump's trade war is causing economic turmoil, and he is seeking to blame Powell to deflect criticism from his own policies, potentially leading to a market crash.</p>

            <p>A shift towards broader employee stock ownership is emerging as a potential solution to address worker disengagement and wealth inequality, with companies like KKR and BDO USA adopting employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs). ESOPs aim to award all workers, not just executives, with equity in the company as part of retirement planning, leading to increased worker retention, engagement, and happiness. While ESOPs have faced challenges in scaling across various company sizes, advocates are pushing for policy updates to modernize the federal law governing ESOPs and create a more transformational impact on corporate operations.
