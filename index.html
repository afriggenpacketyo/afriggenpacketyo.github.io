          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 08:35:34 EDT</div>

          <p>According to a New York Times article, clinicians at the Department of Veterans Affairs are struggling with a return-to-office mandate that forces them to work in inadequate, makeshift spaces. This situation compromises the privacy of sensitive mental health conversations with veterans, as these discussions can be easily overheard. The lack of suitable office environments raises concerns about the quality of care and the ethical obligations to protect patient confidentiality, potentially undermining the trust between veterans and their healthcare providers. The article emphasizes the need for the VA to address these logistical challenges to ensure veterans receive the private and respectful care they deserve.</p>

          <p>This article features a poem by Caki Wilkinson titled "Good Lord, These Muscadines." The poem explores themes of intimacy, confession, and the acceptance of imperfection within a relationship. Through vivid imagery of muscadines, sour dishes, and undone sheets, the poem delves into the speaker's struggle with vulnerability and the realization that longing is not the only song in their repertoire. The poem encapsulates a moment of forgiveness and acceptance of the "utter glut" of shared life, moving beyond idealized longing to embrace the messy reality of connection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses two new Broadway productions, Sarah Snook's one-actor adaptation of "The Picture of Dorian Gray" and Andrew Scott's "Vanya," both of which examine themes of self-perception and performance in the context of modern social media. "Dorian Gray" uses technology like smartphones to critique the superficiality of image-centric culture, while "Vanya" suggests that richness can be found in embracing multiple intertwining voices within oneself. The article posits that these plays raise questions about whether performing a persona is a perversion of truth or a manifestation of self, reflecting the ongoing debate about social media's impact on identity and authenticity. Ultimately, the article suggests that "Vanya" offers a more optimistic view, suggesting that expressing oneself can be a form of liberation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an ABC News article, over a dozen U.S. government health-tracking programs have been eliminated due to layoffs and proposed budget cuts. These programs, primarily at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), tracked deaths and diseases, including those related to abortions, pregnancies, lead poisonings, sexual violence, and youth smoking. Health experts express concern that these cuts will hinder the nation's ability to understand and address public health issues effectively. The Trump administration plans to shift some of the CDC's work to a new agency, the Administration for a Healthy America, but critics argue that the eliminated programs are not duplicative and their absence will leave Americans uninformed.</p>

          <p>The New York Times reports that the Trump administration has canceled over $800 million in NIH grants related to LGBTQ health, impacting studies on cancers, viruses, and sexually transmitted infections. Termination letters cite the research as no longer aligned with agency priorities, with some claiming it's based on "unscientific" gender identity concepts. Critics argue these cuts create a hierarchy of patients, undermining efforts to address health disparities in sexual and gender minority groups. The cancellations have led to job losses and the halting of clinical trials, raising concerns about the future of LGBTQ health research and the potential resurgence of diseases like HIV. This article highlights the administration's broader efforts to dismantle medical research infrastructure and prioritize ideological agendas over evidence-based science.</p>

          <p>This article from The Guardian details how Republicans in Congress are staunchly defending President Trump's tariffs, even as economic data suggests they are destabilizing the U.S. economy. Despite a Senate resolution to repeal the tariffs, the White House issued a veto threat, and the House prevented its consideration. While Democrats criticized the tariffs for causing economic contraction, Republicans defended them as a necessary strategy for renegotiating trade policies.

          <p>Following heavy losses in English local elections, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch stated that a change of leadership would not be sufficient to address the party's challenges. She acknowledged Reform UK's gains and emphasized a "slow and steady" plan to return to government by the end of the decade. Badenoch stressed the importance of credible policies over rushed promises to win votes. While recognizing the possibility of Reform UK leader Nigel Farage becoming prime minister, she asserted her commitment to preventing it, arguing that he lacks the necessary solutions for the country's problems.</p>

          <p>This Guardian article argues that President Trump's policies are creating uncertainty and instability in the U.S. economy, likening the situation to a cartoon character running off a cliff. The author cites concerns from businesses and consumers, driven by policy ambiguity and the unknowable future of tariffs. While acknowledging positive economic data, the article points to declining consumer sentiment and potential worker shortages due to immigration policies. The author suggests that Trump's love of political drama and inability to stick to a course are key factors, leading to a precarious economic outlook.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times opinion piece, Ezra Klein argues that Donald Trump's choice of JD Vance as his vice president signaled a shift towards a more loyalist and less restrained administration. Klein contends that Vance's selection, over more moderate options, demonstrated Trump's desire for a "royal court" of courtiers rather than a coalition government. The article posits that this change in structure, with the absence of checks and balances, has led to a more reckless and uninhibited presidency in Trump's second term, with devastating consequences.</p>

Voters were concerned about the cost of living and alarmed by the market's reaction to Trump's policies.
