          <p>Federal prosecutors announced the arrest of sixteen individuals, including a Sinaloa cartel leader, in connection with a massive fentanyl bust across several western states. The operation, described as the "largest fentanyl bust in DEA history," resulted in the seizure of three million fentanyl-laced pills, along with significant quantities of fentanyl powder, methamphetamine, cocaine, and heroin. Attorney General Pam Bondi emphasized the severity of the fentanyl crisis, noting its role as the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 34. The Justice Department intends to keep those convicted in American prisons for as long as possible.</p>

          <p>Despite recent military strikes by India within Pakistani-controlled territory, Indian financial markets have shown remarkable resilience, driven by strong domestic demand and positive economic fundamentals. Investors appear undeterred by the geopolitical tensions, focusing instead on India's growth prospects and progress in trade negotiations, including a free trade agreement with the U.K. Analysts suggest that historical precedents and expectations of a swift de-escalation contribute to the market's stability. While acknowledging potential near-term volatility, experts remain optimistic about the long-term trajectory of Indian assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to eliminate federal research into pollution caused by satellites and rockets, including those operated by Elon Musk's space companies. This decision raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest, as the research could lead to regulations impacting Musk's businesses. The research projects, part of NOAA's atmospheric research office, aimed to study the accumulation of metals in the stratosphere from spacecraft and the impact of rocket emissions on the ozone layer. Critics argue that the cuts prioritize commercial interests over environmental protection, effectively leaving the health of the stratosphere in the hands of private companies.</p>

          <p>Shares of Novo Nordisk experienced a 5% increase following the company's announcement that sales of its weight-loss drug Wegovy are projected to improve in the latter half of 2025. This positive outlook is attributed to the anticipated phasing out of copycat compounded drugs, which had previously impacted Wegovy's market share in the U.S. Despite reporting lower-than-expected first-quarter sales for Wegovy, Novo Nordisk's CEO, Lars Fruergaard JÃ¸rgensen, expressed confidence that the end of the FDA's drug shortage ruling would revitalize sales. The company is also launching a direct-to-consumer online pharmacy and partnering with telehealth providers to enhance access to Wegovy.</p>

However, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds insists the deal won't harm British workers, citing existing agreements preventing double taxation and highlighting the deal's potential to boost trade and economic growth. </p>
