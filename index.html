          <p>The UK is intensifying its response to Israel's military actions in Gaza, suspending trade deal talks, summoning the Israeli ambassador, and imposing sanctions on West Bank settlers. Foreign Secretary David Lammy condemned the military escalation as "morally unjustifiable," citing warnings of starvation in Gaza due to blocked supplies. These actions follow growing pressure from MPs, the public, and international leaders, reflecting frustration with the lack of progress toward a ceasefire. Despite criticism from Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel, Lammy affirmed the UK's commitment to further action if needed and expressed openness to recognizing the state of Palestine in coordination with France and Saudi Arabia.</p>

The league will negotiate safety and scheduling logistics with the NFL Players Association and international governing bodies, with a limit of one player per NFL club. Flag football, a five-on-five non-contact sport, was approved as an Olympic sport in October 2023, along with baseball/softball, cricket, lacrosse, and squash.

          <p>The Labour Party has postponed its annual Women's Conference after receiving advice following a Supreme Court ruling on the legal definition of a woman. The ruling, which defines a woman based on biological sex, prompted concerns about the conference's compliance with the law, as Labour had previously allowed self-identified women to participate. A leaked advice paper suggested restricting attendance to biological women to avoid legal challenges, potential protests, and security risks. The decision has sparked criticism from both trans rights advocates and gender-critical activists, highlighting the complexities of balancing inclusivity and legal compliance within the party.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has unveiled plans for a new missile defense shield called the ‚ÄúGolden Dome,‚Äù estimating a cost of $175 billion with operational capabilities within three years.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth highlighted technological advancements since Reagan's era as enabling this initiative, which will be led by Gen. Michael Guetlein.

Carvana's CEO noted a pull-forward in car sales due to tariff fears but sees no evidence of growing consumer weakness. Airline CEO Barry Biffle expressed optimism about consumer spending rebounding, while homebuilder Sheryl Palmer highlighted the resilience of older homebuyers.

          <p>A former FBI agent, Tom Martens, told a 911 dispatcher that he may have killed his son-in-law, Jason Corbett, after intervening in a fight with his daughter, Molly Corbett. The case involves claims of self-defense, with Molly and Tom Martens asserting that Jason Corbett was abusive and threatening. However, prosecutors argued that Jason Corbett's death was murder. Molly Corbett and Tom Martens were initially convicted of second-degree murder in 2017, but the convictions were overturned, and they later pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter, resulting in additional prison time. The victim's sister maintains that the Martens not only murdered Jason but also attempted to tarnish his reputation.</p>

The PSA test is a blood test used primarily to screen for prostate cancer, measuring the amount of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood, according to the Mayo Clinic.</p>

          <p>Joseph St. Clair, a U.S. Air Force veteran, has been released from detention in Venezuela, joining other Americans freed during the Trump administration. The circumstances of his release remain unclear, but his family expressed joy and gratitude. St. Clair, who served four tours in Afghanistan and suffered from PTSD, was reportedly wrongfully detained. His release leaves eight U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents still in Venezuelan custody, as Venezuela seeks to ease sanctions amid economic challenges.</p>

          <p>Economists are debating whether companies should be blamed for raising prices in response to President Trump's tariffs, with some arguing that it's a natural consequence of increased costs. While mainstream economists believe companies generally pass along tariff costs, populist thinkers suggest companies have more pricing power than acknowledged. Critics argue that large companies exploit inflation concerns to manipulate prices, while others defend the need to maintain profits. The debate highlights differing perspectives on corporate behavior and the complexities of economic policy.</p>
