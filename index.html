          <p>A former British paratrooper, identified only as Soldier F, has been acquitted of murder and attempted murder charges related to the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre in Northern Ireland. The trial centered on the deaths of James Wray and William McKinney, two of the 13 people shot dead by soldiers during a civil rights march. The prosecution's case faltered as key evidence, primarily statements from other soldiers given in 1972, was deemed inadmissible, bringing the long and painful legal process to a close without a conviction for the victims' families.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, actor Michael J. Fox reflected on the prevalence of "bully culture" in modern society, identifying his own battle with Parkinson's disease as his biggest personal bully. He drew parallels to the themes in his iconic film "Back to the Future," emphasizing the importance of resilience and courage in confronting such challenges. Fox, who is returning to acting in the series "Shrinking" after a five-year retirement, spoke about how his new role, which also features a character with Parkinson's, allows him to work without hiding his symptoms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an economy marked by persistent inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace rising costs. While national average yields for one-year CDs are below 2%, top online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some short-term CDs exceeding 4.4% APY. The article explains the phenomenon of the inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently provide better returns than long-term ones, and suggests strategies like laddering to maximize earnings.

          <p>President Donald Trump has confirmed that the entire existing structure of the White House East Wing will be torn down to make way for a new, $250 million ballroom. The project, which is being funded by Trump and private donors, has drawn criticism from Democratic politicians and conservationists for a lack of transparency and for bypassing the public review process typically required for historic buildings. Trump defended the demolition, stating the East Wing was "never thought of as being much" and that the changes have been desired for over a century.</p>

          <p>In a major consolidation of Europe's space industry, defense firms Airbus, Thales, and Leonardo have announced they will merge their satellite and space activities to form a new joint venture.

The new entity will employ 25,000 people and is intended to serve as a trusted partner for national sovereign space programs, bolstering Europe's technological sovereignty in an increasingly competitive market.</p>

          <p>The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 is projected to be between 2.7% and 2.8%, a figure that has some beneficiaries concerned it will be insufficient to cover the rising costs of essentials like healthcare and housing. While the annual adjustment provides crucial inflation protection, its formula has been criticized for not fully reflecting the expenses faced by seniors. The modest increase, which would add about $54 to the average monthly benefit, follows several years of more substantial adjustments that were still quickly absorbed by inflation.

The criticism highlights growing diplomatic friction as the U.S. simultaneously works to maintain momentum on a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) has issued an apology for a massive outage in its North Virginia data center that took major platforms like Snapchat, Reddit, and Lloyds Bank offline. The company explained that the disruption was caused by a dormant bug triggered by an error in its automated Domain Name System (DNS), which prevented computers from connecting to websites. The incident has renewed concerns among experts about the internet's heavy reliance on a few dominant cloud providers and the need for greater resilience in digital infrastructure.</p>

          <p>According to multiple sources, France is retreating from its recent pledge to take more aggressive maritime action to stop small boats crossing the English Channel, a setback for the UK government's strategy. A promised new "maritime doctrine" to intercept and turn back inflatable boats is now being described as a "political stunt," with French political turmoil cited as a contributing factor. Legal and safety concerns also remain a major obstacle, as French authorities fear that such interventions could lead to deaths and legal repercussions for security forces.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the contemporary debate over free speech often misses a crucial point by focusing solely on the right to express oneself without considering whether the speech itself comes from a position of intellectual freedom. Drawing on John Stuart Mill, it posits that true free speech requires conscientious thought, study, and an openness to criticism, rather than being beholden to prejudice, fear, or manipulation. The author contends that attacks on science, education, and the consolidation of media by billionaires are significant threats to the free thought on which genuine free speech depends.</p>

          <p>A recent survey of real estate agents reveals that a majority of prospective homebuyers are delaying their purchases because they expect mortgage rates to fall further. Despite rates hovering at a one-year low, affordability remains the top concern, leading many buyers to sit on the sidelines in a standoff with sellers who are still pricing for a more competitive market. To cope with current costs, buyers are reportedly using interest rate buydowns, borrowing from family, and compromising on home size or location. (not investment advice)</p>

The author suggests that classic essay assignments are now obsolete, much like manual calculations after the invention of the calculator, and that educators must adapt by creating assignments that AI cannot easily complete. Rather than lamenting a decline in traditional reading, the article embraces the shift, suggesting AI can handle grammatical busywork, freeing students to focus more on critical thinking.</p>
