          <p>A suspect was arrested and booked on several felony charges, including the use of an incendiary device, after allegedly attacking a crowd of pro-Israel demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado, with a "makeshift flamethrower." Eight people were hospitalized with burn injuries, ranging in age from 52 to 88, with one victim in critical condition. The suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was allegedly heard yelling "Free Palestine" during the attack, which the FBI is investigating as a "targeted terror attack" motivated by ideology. The incident occurred during a "Run for Their Lives" walk aimed at raising awareness about hostages in Gaza, leading to the cancellation of future events. </p>

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a conservative candidate backed by President Trump, narrowly won Poland's presidential runoff election with 50.89% of the vote, defeating liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski. The outcome suggests Poland will likely take a more populist and nationalist path under Nawrocki's leadership, which has been lauded by Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed confidence that the EU would continue its cooperation with Poland. Nawrocki, a 42-year-old historian, succeeds Andrzej Duda and is expected to influence foreign policy and legislation. </p>

          <p>The UK government is set to announce the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) to redesign flight paths over UK airspace, potentially leading to quicker flights and fewer delays for passengers. The modernization aims to allow planes to climb quicker during takeoff and descend more smoothly, reducing aviation's climate change impacts and paving the way for new technologies like flying taxis. The plans represent the largest redesign of UK airspace since the 1950s, with UKADS expected to be fully operational by the end of the year. A community aviation group has warned that the plans could result in new flight paths over previously unaffected areas. </p>

His key challenges will include reviving South Korea's economy and finalizing a trade agreement with the U.S., with potential shifts in tariff negotiations.

          <p>Chinese scientists have engineered a new type of rice, dubbed "tea rice," that is enriched with catechin, an antioxidant compound found in green tea. The researchers claim that this rice can provide the health benefits of tea without the side effects of caffeine. Catechins have been shown to have antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and cardioprotective properties, potentially regulating blood pressure, aiding in weight loss, and lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease. Catechins make up a significant portion of the dry weight of tea, particularly in green tea. </p>

          <p>The GOP megabill, which includes tax cuts, increased border and military spending, and Medicaid cuts, is moving to the Senate, where it faces potential changes due to concerns about its price tag and impact on the national debt. Several Republican senators are criticizing the bill, with some calling for it to be broken up into separate pieces or for spending to be returned to pre-pandemic levels. The bill also faces challenges related to Medicaid cuts and the Byrd Rule, which could lead to the removal of certain non-budgetary measures. The CBO estimates that the bill's tax changes would increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next 10 years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is facing questions about the safety of a fast-tracked fire debris removal process following January's wildfires, with concerns raised about lingering toxins in the soil. Despite the removal of debris from residential lots, health officials found that over a quarter of properties still had toxins above California standards. Experts are calling for comprehensive testing of soils, but FEMA is no longer required to do so nationally, leading to criticism from disaster recovery experts. The speedy clean-up has left some survivors feeling uneasy about rebuilding on potentially contaminated land. </p>

Local groups are working to help residents rebuild their lives, but the housing shortage and economic disruption have made recovery slow.
