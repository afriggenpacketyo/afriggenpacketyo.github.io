          <p>Following a period of significant political difficulty, the Scottish National Party is experiencing a resurgence under the stabilizing leadership of John Swinney. This recovery is bolstered by splintered support among its rivals, which has improved the SNP's standing in recent polls. With renewed optimism, the party is now focused on securing a majority in the next Holyrood election, viewing it as a necessary precedent to demand another independence referendum from the UK government.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani issued a statement on the release of Israeli hostages from Gaza after facing public criticism for his initial silence. In his remarks, Mamdani described the scenes as moving but did not mention Donald Trump's role in the negotiations, drawing further condemnation from political opponents. The controversy highlights the intense scrutiny surrounding politicians' responses to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, especially within local U.S. politics.</p>

          <p>As Beijing drafts its 15th five-year plan, the focus is turning to its implications for industrial collaboration with Taiwan. The economic relationship has evolved significantly, with many Taiwanese firms now acting as crucial suppliers of specialized, high-tech components to leading mainland Chinese industries, such as the electric vehicle sector. This integration highlights a complex dynamic of economic codependence existing alongside deep-seated political tensions across the Taiwan Strait.</p>

The issue is a central point of contention in government shutdown negotiations, with Democrats insisting on their renewal.

          <p>Several prominent U.S. news outlets, including The New York Times and The Washington Post, have announced they will not sign a new Pentagon policy that restricts journalistic access. The controversial rules require reporters to pledge not to obtain unauthorized material and to be escorted in certain areas. Media organizations argue the policy undermines First Amendment protections and is designed to stifle a free press, while the Pentagon defends it as necessary for national security.</p>

          <p>The U.S. supply chain is facing new cost pressures from additional tariffs on Chinese-made port equipment, including cranes and terminal tractors, which could see effective tariff rates as high as 270%.
