          <p>A human foot found inside a hiking shoe on the shore of Fishlake, Utah, has been identified as belonging to a man who went missing 28 years ago. The shoe model, produced for only one year in 1996, helped investigators link the remains to the 1997 disappearance of David White. DNA testing confirmed a parental match with his daughter, bringing closure to a long-standing mystery. White's family expressed gratitude for the discovery, which finally provides answers after his boat was found empty on the lake decades ago.</p>

The base has since lifted the lockdown, stating there is no longer an active threat to the community as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell who died by suicide, has publicly spoken out against a potential presidential pardon for Maxwell. Her sister-in-law described the possibility as a "travesty" and a "slap in the face" to survivors, urging that their voices be heard over those of a convicted perjurer. The family's statement comes after reports that Maxwell would be willing to testify before Congress in exchange for clemency. They emphasized Giuffre's view that Maxwell was a primary orchestrator in the abuse ring.</p>

          <p>A Czech zoo has announced the public debut of four rare Barbary lion cubs, a breed that is extinct in the wild. The birth of the three females and one male is a significant step in an international program aimed at preserving the species in captivity with the ultimate goal of reintroducing them to their native habitat in North Africa. The Barbary lion was wiped out from the wild by the 1960s due to human activities. Experts are in preliminary talks with Moroccan authorities about a potential reintroduction plan in the Atlas Mountains.</p>

          <p>Despite nearly two years of war severely weakening its capabilities, Hamas has maintained a system to pay salaries to thousands of civil servants in Gaza. The article reveals that the group uses a secret, cash-based system to distribute partial payments, with employees receiving about 20% of their pre-war salary every 10 weeks. This is made possible by a large cash reserve reportedly stockpiled in tunnels before the war. However, the small payments and rampant inflation are causing growing resentment among recipients struggling with severe food shortages.</p>

          <p>Apple has announced plans to increase its investment in the United States by an additional $100 billion, bringing its total commitment to $600 billion over four years. The move comes as the company faces pressure from President Donald Trump, who has threatened significant tariffs on its products if it does not move more manufacturing to the US. The new funds will reportedly be used to encourage Apple's suppliers to establish more production in America. This announcement is seen as a strategic effort by Apple to avoid new tariffs on its products.</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents conducted a raid on a Home Depot in Los Angeles, using a rented Penske truck as a 'Trojan Horse' to arrest immigrant day laborers. Witnesses reported that agents emerged from the back of the truck after a driver offered work, causing people to scatter as arrests were made. The operation has revived fears of widespread immigration sweeps and raised questions about the tactics used, particularly in light of a recent court order limiting indiscriminate enforcement. Penske stated it was unaware of and did not authorize the use of its vehicle in this manner.</p>

          <p>A 56-year-old fugitive, Roy Barclay, has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 25 years for the murder of Anita Rose in Brantham, Suffolk.

Barclay, who had been on the run for two years for breaching his parole from a previous violent crime, was linked to the scene by DNA evidence. The judge described him as an unpredictable and dangerous man prone to violent outbursts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to strip Washington D.C. of its local governance and place it under direct federal control, citing what he called out-of-control youth crime. The threat followed an assault on a 19-year-old federal employee, which was also highlighted by Elon Musk. Trump stated that if D.C. officials do not address crime, he will "federalize this City," and specifically called for minors as young as 14 to be prosecuted as adults. Revoking the city's "home rule" would be an unprecedented move likely to face significant legal and political challenges.</p>

          <p>Jesse Calhoun, a man already accused of killing three women in the Portland, Oregon area, has been indicted for a fourth murder. A grand jury charged him in the November 2022 death of 22-year-old Kristin Smith, whose remains were found in early 2023. The discovery of multiple bodies in a 100-mile radius had sparked fears of a serial killer in the region. Calhoun was arrested in June 2023 and had previously been released early from prison for helping to fight wildfires, a decision that was later revoked by the governor.</p>

          <p>The US government's decision to incinerate over $9.7 million worth of contraceptives will deny care to more than 1.4 million women and girls in five African nations, according to the IPPF. This action is projected to lead to 174,000 unintended pregnancies and 56,000 unsafe abortions. The destruction of these supplies, many of which were not near their expiration date, stems from US rules prohibiting aid to organizations involved with abortion services. The move has been condemned as appalling and wasteful by international health advocates.</p>

          <p>Shares in European pharmaceutical companies have fallen to a four-month low after President Trump reiterated threats to impose significant tariffs on imported drugs. The Stoxx Health Care index slid by 2.8% as investors reacted to the possibility of levies reaching as high as 250% over the next year and a half. The policy is intended to force drugmakers to relocate production to the US. This pressure is compounded by White House demands for price cuts on prescription drugs and a decision to wind down federal funding for mRNA vaccine development. (not investment advice)</p>
