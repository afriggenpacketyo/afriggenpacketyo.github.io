        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Israel Premier Tech cycling team has been excluded from the upcoming Giro dell'Emilia race in Italy, with organizers citing concerns over potential pro-Palestinian protests. This controversial decision follows widespread disruptions at the recent Spanish Vuelta, where the team's presence led to significant demonstrations. An Italian local politician, Roberta Li Calzi, publicly supported the exclusion, emphasizing the need for sport to uphold universal values of sharing and fair competition. This incident underscores the increasing impact of the Gaza conflict on international sports, with other major bodies like UEFA also reportedly considering suspending Israeli teams from international play, reflecting a broader trend of political tension affecting athletic events globally.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Collagen, the body's most abundant protein, is widely marketed for its purported anti-aging benefits for skin, joints, and hair, yet its effectiveness as a supplement remains a subject of considerable debate among medical experts. While some individuals report positive changes, consultant dermatologists express skepticism about oral collagen peptides effectively reaching the skin in sufficient quantities to make a significant difference. They also dismiss topical collagen creams as ineffective. Furthermore, a recent study highlighted conflicting findings between industry-funded research, which suggested improvements, and independent studies that found no effect. Experts ultimately recommend proven methods like consistent sun protection, a healthy diet, and cessation of smoking for maintaining youthful skin, rather than relying on expensive supplements.</p>

          <p>The Ryder Cup descended into controversy after the event's master of ceremonies reportedly led vulgar chants targeting golfer Rory McIlroy, setting a deeply hostile tone for the day. McIlroy endured continuous personal abuse throughout his matches, eventually confronting hecklers directly. Despite his pleas for respect while he was addressing the ball, the PGA of America initially remained silent on the incident, only later displaying etiquette warnings that were met with boos from the crowd. This article highlights the unsportsmanlike behavior that overshadowed McIlroy's strong performance and raises serious questions about crowd control and the organizers' responsibility to ensure a respectful environment in major sporting events.</p>

The intensity of the match was further highlighted by St Helens forward Matty Lees leaving midway through the game after his wife went into labor. This stunning comeback now sets up a semi-final trip to Hull KR for St Helens.</p>

          <p>Bali, widely depicted as an idyllic tropical paradise on social media, is increasingly facing criticism from disillusioned tourists due to severe overtourism, traffic congestion, and unchecked urban development. A significant post-pandemic tourism boom has placed immense strain on the island's infrastructure, contributing to recent deadly floods that officials linked to poor waste management. While the local government has announced restrictions on new construction, many believe these interventions are too little, too late. Locals express sadness over the erosion of Bali's natural beauty and cultural richness, urging visitors to look beyond superficial "Instagrammable" spots and engage more responsibly to mitigate the negative environmental and social impacts.</p>

The piece explores whether this rapid progress means China has now surpassed Europe in the race for a high-tech future, highlighting a significant shift in the global balance of technological innovation and economic influence, posing a challenge to Europe's long-held leadership.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of federal troops to Portland, Oregon, authorizing the use of "full force" if necessary, to suppress protests targeting immigration detention centers.

However, Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and other Democratic lawmakers swiftly condemned the deployment as an abuse of power, asserting that the city is currently safe and calm.

Postecoglou acknowledges the imperative to transform dominance into wins, while former players express a belief that the team's fortunes will eventually turn. The article also highlights controversial referee decisions in their latest loss, which added to the team's frustration and contributed to their ongoing struggles to secure positive results.</p>

          <p>A man in his 50s has tragically died, and seven other individuals, including emergency service workers, were treated for suspected carbon monoxide poisoning at a takeaway in Bloxwich, West Midlands. Emergency crews responded to concerns for a man's welfare on Friday night, leading to the temporary evacuation of nearby properties. A local councilor suggested that a generator, possibly operated without adequate ventilation during refurbishment, released the toxic gases. Police and the Health and Safety Executive are currently investigating the incident to determine the exact cause. The event left a neighboring shop worker feeling unwell after exposure to the fumes, highlighting the dangers of carbon monoxide.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an El Salvador native mistakenly deported in March and now facing human smuggling charges, has been transferred from a Virginia detention center to the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Phillipsburg, Pennsylvania. His attorneys argue this transfer significantly complicates access for his Nashville-based defense team, contradicting ICE's claim of improved access. Concerns are also being raised about the conditions at Moshannon, citing a recent detainee death by hanging, reports of assaults, inadequate medical care, and insufficient food. Garcia's legal team is now assessing the implications of this move on his ability to prepare for trial and receive proper counsel.</p>

          <p>The FBI has reportedly terminated 15 to 20 agents who were photographed kneeling at a 2020 racial justice protest following George Floyd's death, with their termination letters citing a "lack of judgement." The FBI Agents Association strongly condemned these dismissals, alleging a violation of agents' rights and criticizing FBI Director Kash Patel's actions as detrimental to the Bureau's strength and recruitment. This controversial move is widely perceived as part of the Trump administration's broader effort to purge officials deemed to hold "left-wing" or "woke" policies. The act of kneeling became a powerful symbol of dissent against racism and police brutality, sparking both support and criticism.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how President Trump's open and often defiant approach to actions traditionally considered misconduct is fundamentally altering American public perception of political scandal. Unlike previous presidents who meticulously concealed wrongdoing, Trump frequently boasts about his controversial actions, such as publicly directing the Justice Department to target political opponents. Observers suggest this brazen strategy perversely grants him an aura of authenticity and desensitizes the public to actions that once ended political careers. Critics argue this normalization of perceived corruption undermines the rule of law, while supporters view him as a "baddest cowboy" effectively challenging a rigged establishment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A groundbreaking study published in Science has revealed that chimpanzees regularly consume significant amounts of alcohol from naturally fermented fruit in their wild habitats. Researchers observed these primates ingesting a daily alcohol dose equivalent to approximately one small bottle of beer for humans, primarily from ripe fruit pulp with an average alcohol content of 0.3%. This fascinating discovery suggests that the regular consumption of alcohol might possess deeper evolutionary roots, extending beyond human cultural practices, and echoing previous research findings on chimps sharing alcoholic fruits. While the precise reasons for their deliberate consumption are still under investigation, this challenges prior assumptions about wild animals and ethanol intake.</p>
