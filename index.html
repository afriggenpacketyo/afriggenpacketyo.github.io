          <p>Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, stated that while he is a strong ally of President Trump, he does not want to be held responsible for every policy decision made by the administration. Musk's comments came after his tenure leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which faced criticism for job cuts and spending policies. He expressed disappointment with the GOP's multitrillion-dollar tax and spending package, suggesting it undermines DOGE's efforts. Musk's remarks highlight a potential rift between him and the administration regarding fiscal responsibility and government spending. Optimism surrounding the administration's goals is somewhat tempered by internal disagreements and criticisms.</p>

          <p>Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), suggested that President Trump may not need Congress's approval for massive cuts to the federal workforce. Vought indicated that the White House prefers to use "executive tools" for most of the cuts, rather than seeking congressional approval. He defended the cost-cutting measures proposed in the One Big Beautiful Bill, while acknowledging concerns about the bill's impact on the deficit. Vought's comments underscore the administration's focus on dismantling the federal workforce and consolidating power in the executive branch.</p>
