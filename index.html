          <p>The UK's historic steel towns, such as Port Talbot, are grappling with an uncertain future as the industry faces a long-term decline exacerbated by high energy costs and potential US tariffs. This article explores the human impact of job losses, detailing the personal stories of former steelworkers who are adapting to new careers or struggling with the economic shift. While some find new fulfillment, the broader communities worry about losing their core identity and economic foundation, pinning hopes on green technology and government support for a potential revival.</p>

          <h2>FBI Director Kash Patel Denies Resignation Rumors Amid Epstein File Controversy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 19:44:47 EDT</div>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel has publicly refuted rumors that he intends to resign over the Justice Department's decision not to release more files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The speculation arose amid criticism from hardline political figures who dispute the official findings of Epstein's death and demand the release of a supposed "client list." Both the FBI and DOJ have maintained a united front, stating their review found no evidence to predicate new investigations, though this has not quelled conspiracy theories circulating among some political commentators.</p>

          <p>In eastern DR Congo, M23 rebels control the lucrative Rubaya mining site, a crucial source of the world's coltan, which is essential for mobile phones and other electronics. A BBC team granted rare access observed thousands of miners working under rebel oversight, who claim to have brought stability to the operation. The situation highlights the complex link between the region's long-standing conflict, valuable mineral resources, and international interests, particularly as the US engages in peace talks that may involve granting American firms access to these resources.</p>

Both the EU and Mexico have expressed their disagreement with the tariffs, with the EU stating it will take necessary steps to safeguard its interests, potentially including retaliatory countermeasures if a negotiated agreement is not reached.

          <p>A new book titled "2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America" provides a deeply sourced analysis of the election that returned Donald Trump to the presidency. Written by journalists Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager, and Isaac Arnsdorf, the book chronicles how Trump capitalized on public frustration with established institutions to overcome numerous legal challenges. It also examines the Democratic campaign's shortcomings, including President Biden's struggles and the party's failure to maintain its 2020 coalition, posing several "what-if" scenarios that could have altered the outcome.</p>

          <p>Lord Mandelson, the British ambassador to the United States, has stated that the 10% tariff on most UK goods imported into the US is likely "here to stay." While suggesting there is room for negotiation in specific sectors, he indicated the universal baseline tariff is unlikely to be removed under the current administration. His comments come amid ongoing uncertainty over steel tariffs and a broader move by the U.S. to impose steep 30% tariffs on goods from the EU and Mexico, signaling a challenging trade environment.

          <p>In a social media post, President Trump stated he is giving "serious consideration" to revoking the U.S. citizenship of his long-time rival, comedian Rosie O'Donnell, who recently moved to Ireland. The threat comes despite a 1967 Supreme Court ruling that prevents the government from involuntarily stripping citizenship from a native-born American. Legal experts affirmed that the president has no authority to take such an action, framing it as the latest instance of the president targeting a political critic.</p>

The high temperatures have also impacted travel and sporting events, prompting amber heat health alerts for southern England, which signify a likely increase in health risks, particularly for vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has reportedly fired more than 20 employees who worked on the special counsel investigations into former President Trump, including the classified documents and January 6th cases. Sources indicate that the terminations are part of a broader purge directed by a "weaponization working group" established by Attorney General Pam Bondi to review Biden-era law enforcement policies. One fired public affairs specialist warned of a continuing wave of retribution and the erosion of the traditional separation between the White House and the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>Tensions flared at the end of day three of the third Test between England and India, with the Indian team angered by what they perceived as England's time-wasting tactics. England opener Zak Crawley used delays, including calling for a physio, to ensure his side would only have to face one over before the close of play instead of two. England's bowling coach Tim Southee dismissed India's complaints, pointing out that Indian captain Shubman Gill had engaged in his own on-field delays earlier in the match.</p>

The Fed's page clarifies that no new VIP dining rooms are being built and explains that cost increases were driven by unforeseen conditions and design changes, not lavish spending.

The arrests in London, Cardiff, and Manchester were primarily on suspicion of supporting a banned group, which is now a criminal offense under the Terrorism Act. The proscription follows a series of direct-action events by the group targeting arms companies, but critics argue the government is misusing terror legislation to suppress political protest.</p>
