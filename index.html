            <p>Ofcom, the UK's online regulator, has launched its first investigation under the new Online Safety Act into a pro-suicide forum. This action follows BBC News reports linking the forum to at least 50 deaths in the UK. The forum, which hosts discussions on suicide methods and instructions for acquiring deadly chemicals, has been the subject of concern for years. Families of victims are urging swift action to prevent further deaths, while Ofcom faces challenges including the anonymity of the forum's operators and its US-based hosting.</p>

            <p>President Trump has implemented a new round of tariffs on imports from numerous countries, exceeding a base rate of 10% and affecting 86 nations.

            <p>A faulty radio antenna contributed to a deadly mid-air helicopter collision at an Australian theme park and resort, according to transport safety officials. The accident, which occurred in January 2023 near Sea World on the Gold Coast, resulted in four fatalities and several serious injuries. The ATSB report found that a call from the arriving helicopter was either not received or not heard by the pilot on the ground due to the faulty antenna, preventing the broadcast of a critical taxiing call.</p>

Justin Wrobleski struggled in his spot start, giving up eight runs in five innings. While Snell's MRI showed no structural damage, his absence highlights the importance of the Dodgers' pitching depth. The team is expected to rely on other arms until Snell returns, but their current options are not foolproof.</p>
