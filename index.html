The court ruled the blaze an "anticipated disaster," citing a lack of proper safety measures and inadequate worker training. This marks the longest jail term under the country's industrial safety law. Park's son, a senior executive, also received a 15-year sentence, as the company was found responsible for changes hindering escape routes.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, one of the strongest storms in years, has caused significant devastation across Asia. In eastern Taiwan, a lake burst killed at least 14 people and left 124 missing, inundating villages and sweeping away a major bridge. The typhoon also struck Hong Kong with 195 kph winds, causing 13 injuries, widespread flooding, and infrastructure damage, leading to suspended services. Earlier, the storm killed three people and displaced thousands in the northern Philippines, and forced over a million evacuations in China's Guangdong province as it approached landfall.</p>

          <p>Tiow-Gan Ong, a prominent chemist and professor at National Taiwan University, has left Taipei to join the Chinese University of Hong Kong in Shenzhen. This move highlights Taiwan's ongoing concern about a "talent outflow," a phenomenon Ong himself had previously acknowledged and hoped to see reversed. Ong held multiple joint appointments internationally, underscoring his high profile in the scientific community. His relocation to Shenzhen, a burgeoning tech hub, signifies a significant gain for China's scientific ambitions.</p>

          <p>Datong, a city in China's Shanxi province, successfully averted disaster during severe summer rains, despite nearly 20 hours of upstream flood discharges. This success is attributed to a project initiated over 15 years ago by former mayor Geng Yanbo, which widened the city's main waterway and reinforced its banks. Residents initially questioned the investment, but now recognize its crucial role in preventing catastrophe. Economists suggest such infrastructure investment not only enhances urban resilience but also stimulates the economy, as seen with Beijing's recent 1 trillion yuan sovereign debt issuance for disaster prevention.</p>

Germany has historically been reluctant, preferring a solution through negotiations between Israel and Palestinians.

          <p>A Canadian investigation concluded that TikTok's efforts to prevent underage use and protect children's personal data are insufficient. The probe found hundreds of thousands of Canadian children use the app despite its 13-and-under age restriction, and that TikTok collected sensitive data for targeted marketing. While TikTok disputes some findings, it has agreed to implement measures to strengthen platform safety for Canadians. This adds to global scrutiny over the Chinese-owned app's impact on users and national security, with other nations also taking action.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has significantly altered his position on the Ukraine war, stating that Kyiv can "win all of Ukraine back in its original form" due to pressures on Russia's economy. This shift, expressed on Truth Social after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, contradicts his previous suggestions of territorial concessions. Trump indicated that Ukraine could achieve this with support from Europe and NATO, and that the US would continue supplying weapons to NATO for their use.

          <p>Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust has been compelled to repay nearly £5 million after falsely claiming it met safe maternity care standards.

This incident adds to a pattern of trusts misreporting compliance with the scheme.

The investigation began in August after Customs and Border Protection detected Cesium-137 in an imported shipment from Indonesia.
