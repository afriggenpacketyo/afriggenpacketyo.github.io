          <p>A 20-year-old American citizen from Florida, Sayfollah Musallet, was allegedly beaten to death by Israeli settlers in the West Bank town of Sinjil. According to his family, Musallet was protecting his family's land when he was attacked, and settlers blocked an ambulance from reaching him for hours. He is the fifth American killed in the West Bank since October 7, 2023. His family is demanding an immediate investigation led by the U.S. State Department to hold the perpetrators accountable.</p>

          <p>Poland's Iga Swiatek won her first Wimbledon title, defeating American Amanda Anisimova in a completely one-sided final that lasted just 57 minutes. The 24-year-old Swiatek won 6-0, 6-0, a rare 'double bagel' victory not seen in a women's Wimbledon final since 1911. While it was Anisimova's first Grand Slam final appearance after a career break, her nerves were apparent through numerous unforced errors. This victory marks the sixth major title for Swiatek, who has now won on all three major court surfaces.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. will impose a 30% tariff on all goods imported from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1. The announcement was made in letters to the leaders of both trading partners, with Trump citing persistent trade deficits and a need for a more 'reciprocal' relationship. The administration warned that any retaliatory tariffs from the EU or Mexico would result in further increases to the 30% rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elaine Stypula, a 60-year-old ultrarunner from Michigan, collapsed and died during the Hardrock Hundred endurance race in Colorado's San Juan Mountains.

This move places Trump alongside other former presidents, such as George H.W. Bush and Barack Obama, who also have roadways named after them within the same county.</p>

          <p>In the wake of devastating floods in central Texas, a panel of journalists analyzed the future of federal emergency disaster response under the second Trump administration. Panelists observed that while President Trump can be effective at mobilizing resources, his approach often relies more heavily on state and local officials. They also noted his response style tends to lack the personal, empathetic connection with victims on the ground that has been a hallmark of many previous presidents.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump posted on social media that he is giving 'serious consideration' to revoking the U.S. citizenship of actress and longtime nemesis Rosie O'Donnell. In his post, Trump called O'Donnell a 'Threat to Humanity' and suggested she should remain in Ireland, where she recently moved. O'Donnell responded by calling Trump a 'danger to the nation.' Legal scholars affirm that the president does not have the authority to revoke the citizenship of a U.S.-born individual.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party called the 'America Party,' aiming to provide a centrist alternative to the established Democratic and Republican parties. However, political scientists express strong skepticism about its chances for success, pointing to the immense structural advantages of the two-party system. Historically, successful third parties in the U.S. have influenced policy by acting as disruptors, a different approach than the one Musk appears to be taking.</p>

          <p>China's space program is rapidly advancing, posing the most significant challenge to America's long-held leadership in space exploration in sixty years. The country is making tangible progress on its goals, including landing astronauts on the moon before 2030 and developing key hardware like the Long March-10 moon rocket. While NASA's Artemis program has a slightly earlier target for a crewed lunar landing, it faces major technical hurdles, setting the stage for an intensified space race.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a writer reflects on the strange and contradictory state of being transgender today, where increased public visibility coexists with a growing political and legal backlash. Recounting their own experience of transitioning as an adult after a difficult youth, the author pushes back against 'survivorship bias'—the flawed argument that because some older trans people survived without support, today's youth should be denied gender-affirming care. The piece champions early acceptance as vital to avoiding needless pain.</p>

          <p>Health officials in Coconino County, Arizona, have reported that a resident has died from pneumonic plague, marking the first such death in the state since 2007.

The pneumonic form, which infects the lungs, is the most severe and contagious but is effectively treatable with modern antibiotics if diagnosed early. The identity of the victim was not released.</p>

The legislation also tightens eligibility for Pell Grants for some students while expanding it for others in workforce training programs, and it eliminates economic hardship deferments starting in 2026.

The traumatic event, which dramatically altered the 2024 campaign, remains a frequent topic for Trump, who has decorated his surroundings with memorabilia from that day.</p>
