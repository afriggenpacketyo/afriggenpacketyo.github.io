          <p>Saudi Aramco announced a decrease in its second-quarter revenue, attributing the decline to lower prices for crude oil and chemical products. Despite the drop, the company's adjusted net income of $24.5 billion surpassed analyst expectations. CEO Amin Nasser expressed optimism for the second half of 2025, projecting a significant increase in oil demand. The company plans to boost its dividend and is navigating an economic landscape affected by U.S. trade tariffs and fluctuating crude prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, following the release of a July jobs report that showed weaker-than-expected growth. The administration claimed the numbers were "rigged," a move that has drawn widespread criticism for potentially undermining confidence in federal economic data. This action is part of a broader pattern of the president ordering investigations into political adversaries from his first term, including former FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director John Brennan. Critics, including former officials and financial analysts, have warned against politicizing the nation's economic statistics.</p>

          <h2>New Research Explores Link Between Psychological Stress and Cellular Aging</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists are investigating the connection between psychological stress and the aging process at a molecular level, with recent studies suggesting stress can induce changes in DNA similar to those seen in aging. A new hypothesis focuses on how the brain manages the aging process, potentially involving what are sometimes called "zombie cells." This research explores the mechanisms by which stress accelerates aging and considers potential scientific interventions to mitigate these effects. The findings could offer new insights into how to maintain health and vitality over a longer lifespan by addressing the cellular impact of stress.</p>

          <p>US Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed prosecutors to present evidence to a grand jury regarding the origins of the 2016 Trump-Russia collusion investigation. This legal step will determine if formal charges should be filed against individuals who may have conspired to falsely accuse Donald Trump. The move follows the declassification of an appendix from the Durham report, which cited a memo alleging a plan by Hillary Clinton's campaign to link Trump to Russia. This development reignites the debate over the "Russiagate" affair and the alleged politicization of intelligence agencies during the 2016 election.</p>

          <p>A former assistant to Maximilian Krah, a prominent politician from Germany's far-right AfD party, is on trial in Dresden accused of spying for China. The defendant, identified as Jian G., is alleged to have supplied information to a Chinese secret service since 2002, including details about proceedings at the European Parliament. This case has brought scrutiny upon the AfD, as Krah himself is under a separate investigation for potential bribery and money laundering.

          <p>India has responded to President Trump's threats of higher tariffs by defending its oil trade with Russia, stating it was "targeted" unfairly. The Indian foreign ministry argued that it only began significant Russian oil imports after traditional supplies were redirected to Europe following the 2022 conflict in Ukraine. The statement highlighted that both the U.S. and the EU continue their own trade with Russia, particularly in sectors like uranium and fertilizers, suggesting a double standard. New Delhi asserted it was encouraged by the U.S. to buy Russian oil to stabilize global energy markets and will take necessary measures to protect its national interests.</p>

          <p>In response to falling beef prices and strong competition from imports, the Chinese government has unveiled a new plan to support its domestic cattle industry. The policy, announced by several government departments, aims to increase local beef production and promote consumption by implementing a quality-grading system for domestic products. Officials stated that there is significant room for growth in high-quality protein consumption among Chinese residents. The move is part of a broader strategy to strengthen key agricultural sectors and enhance the appeal of domestic farm goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York City police arrested more than 40 protesters outside the Trump International hotel during a demonstration against the war in Gaza. The event, organized by the Jewish-American group IfNotNow, drew hundreds of people demanding an end to the conflict and calling for the U.S. to pressure Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into the territory. Protesters, including prominent community figures and a former Biden administration official who resigned in protest, gathered to voice their opposition to the Israeli government's blockade and the worsening humanitarian crisis. The arrests occurred after demonstrators blocked the street in front of the hotel.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court ruling, U.S. border agents have reportedly been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order that partially limited the ban, stating it could not be used to completely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum seekers. This directive means that officials at Customs and Border Protection will now process migrants according to existing U.S. immigration law rather than the contested proclamation. The ruling is a significant development in the ongoing legal challenges to the administration's restrictive immigration policies.</p>

By leaving, the Democrats broke the legislative quorum, halting all business in the House. The Republican House Speaker subsequently issued arrest warrants to compel their return. The Democratic lawmakers, who traveled to Illinois or New York, maintain their actions are a constitutional tool to protest a map they argue is designed to unfairly favor Republicans in future elections.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) has agreed to a $1.7 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit brought by 45 California counties alleging the company improperly disposed of hazardous waste. The investigation found that UPS locations were discarding corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials into regular trash bins, which were then sent to landfills not equipped to handle such waste. UPS cooperated with the investigation and has since implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs.
