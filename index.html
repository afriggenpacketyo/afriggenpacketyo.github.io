          <p>The price of Bitcoin fell to approximately $115,000 after reaching a new record high, leading a broader downturn in the cryptocurrency market. This decline was prompted by investor concerns over higher-than-expected wholesale inflation data, which has cast doubt on a potential Federal Reserve rate cut. The sell-off triggered over $576 million in forced liquidations of long positions across the market in a 24-hour period. Comments from the Treasury Secretary regarding the strategic bitcoin reserve also contributed to the negative sentiment among investors. (not investment advice)</p>

Investigators have opened a criminal case for violations of industrial safety rules, suggesting the cause was likely not a Ukrainian attack. The factory has a history of safety issues, including a deadly blast in 2021 that led to prison sentences for its management.</p>

The mother, Rebecca Haro, initially claimed her son was kidnapped after she was attacked and knocked unconscious, but authorities noted inconsistencies in her story. Due to her decision to cease communication, the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department stated that it cannot rule out foul play in the infant's disappearance.

He shared a personal account from his time managing in Major League Soccer where a player was racially abused, highlighting the profound impact such incidents have. Rooney's call to action follows a recent event where a Premier League player reported being racially abused by a spectator. He suggests that sanctions like point deductions or significant fines are necessary to compel clubs to address the issue effectively.</p>

The political maneuver in Texas has prompted a national response, with California Democrats moving forward with their own redistricting plan to counteract the potential Republican gains.

          <p>Financial experts are advising savers on how to approach investing in certificates of deposit (CDs) during the current economic climate. While CD rates are still solid, the decision on how much money to deposit depends on an individual's overall financial situation, including their emergency savings and liquidity needs. Experts suggest considering the potential for Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year, which would lower CD returns. Strategies like CD laddering, which involves spreading funds across multiple CDs with different maturity dates, are recommended to maintain flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of bitcoin miner and datacenter operator TeraWulf surged over 10% following an announcement that Google is increasing its stake in the company from 8% to 14%. This move provides TeraWulf with up to $1.4 billion in additional financial backing to expand its Lake Mariner facility in New York. The investment solidifies a strategic alignment between the two companies to build out advanced infrastructure for artificial intelligence. The news comes just a week after TeraWulf's stock soared on the announcement of major computing deals with AI cloud provider Fluidstack. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The private members' club chain Soho House has been acquired for $2.7 billion (£2 billion) by a consortium that includes actor and investor Ashton Kutcher. The deal, led by U.S. hotel group MCR Hotels, will take the company private again after its shares struggled following a 2021 stock market listing. Soho House, known as a popular destination for celebrities, has expanded to 46 locations globally but faced challenges with profitability and perceptions of declining exclusivity. As part of the acquisition, Ashton Kutcher will become a member of the company's board.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed a new rule that would limit eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. The U.S. Department of Education aims to prevent employees of organizations deemed to be "undermining national security and American values" from receiving loan forgiveness. Critics argue the vague language could be used to exclude any non-profit the administration disapproves of, creating a political litmus test for a bipartisan program designed to encourage public service. The proposed changes are not retroactive, meaning past work at a later-deemed ineligible organization would still count.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis suggests that Germany's top football league, the Bundesliga, is losing its international prestige compared to rivals like England's Premier League and Spain's La Liga. The departure of star players, coupled with a decline in European tournament success, points to a growing gap. Financially, the Bundesliga generates significantly less revenue from television rights than the Premier League, which has also recently surpassed it in average stadium attendance. Critics, including former football stars, argue that German football needs to address this decline to remain competitive at the highest level.</p>

This electricity will help supply Google's regional data centers with reliable, carbon-free energy. The collaboration is a significant step toward commercializing smaller, advanced nuclear reactors in the U.S., with Google and Kairos bearing the financial risk of construction.</p>
