            <p>Dive teams are continuing their search in the Hudson River for the remaining wreckage from a helicopter crash that killed six people. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has recovered the main fuselage and other significant parts, but is still looking for the main rotor and tail components, which experts believe could hold vital clues to the cause of the accident. The helicopter lacked flight recorders, making the recovery of physical evidence crucial. Authorities are considering mechanical failure as a possible cause, alongside discussions of potential bird or drone interference. The victims included a family and the pilot, a U.S. Navy veteran.</p>

            <p>A concert by Mexican singer Luis R Conriquez in Texcoco descended into chaos after he omitted his signature 'corridos bélicos' (war ballads) due to warnings from authorities. The audience reacted negatively, throwing objects and eventually destroying musical instruments on stage. Conriquez had previously announced his self-censorship on Instagram, stating he would refrain from performing songs related to drug trafficking. This incident raises questions about the future of his U.S. tour, as federal authorities have been scrutinizing and taking measures against artists performing such genres, including revoking visas. His decision could be seen as an act of courage or a mere survival strategy in the face of increasing scrutiny.</p>

            <p>Australian avocado exporters are anticipated to gain from improving trade relations with China, with avocados potentially being next on the priority list for import negotiations. Canberra will first negotiate market access for apples and blueberries, while Beijing aims to introduce jujube and kiwi fruits to Australia. Industry players have already engaged in technical cooperation within China's growing avocado sector. Negotiations for apples are expected to conclude in the coming months, paving the way for avocados to be prioritized. This development is viewed positively by the Australian avocado industry.</p>

            <p>Former ESPN employee Jemele Hill voiced her disappointment with the Los Angeles Dodgers for visiting President Donald Trump at the White House, citing the recent removal of Jackie Robinson's military service from the Department of Defense's website. Hill suggested the Dodgers' visit was insensitive given the administration's perceived attempts to erase Robinson's legacy. However, the Department of Defense stated the removal was due to an AI-driven effort to remove DEI content, resulting in some errors. The Philadelphia Eagles are also scheduled to visit the White House, with team owner Jeffrey Lurie calling it a 'time-honored tradition'.</p>

            <p>India is facing a growing obesity crisis, with the 'pot belly' transforming from a symbol of prosperity to a health concern. A Lancet study projects that 450 million Indians could be overweight or obese by 2050. Abdominal obesity, affecting 40% of women and 12% of men, is linked to insulin resistance and chronic diseases. Experts suggest an evolutionary adaptation to famine conditions may contribute to fat distribution patterns in South Asians. New guidelines redefine obesity for Asian Indians, considering fat distribution and related health issues.</p>

            <p>Ahead of the May 3rd election, the Australian government has pledged A$10 billion for grants and loans to build up to 100,000 homes for first-time buyers. Prime Minister Albanese's Labor government aims to construct 1.2 million homes by 2030 to address housing affordability issues. The plan includes partnering with state developers and guaranteeing a portion of first home buyer loans with a 5% deposit. Opposition leader Peter Dutton proposes allowing first-time buyers to deduct mortgage payments from income taxes. Both leaders are campaigning on the nation's housing crisis, with Dutton's approval ratings nearing Albanese's.</p>

            <p>The UK government rushed through emergency legislation to take control of British Steel's Scunthorpe plant, averting its potential closure. Government officials were stationed near the plant awaiting Royal Assent to the bill, which occurred rapidly compared to typical legislative timelines. The government intervened due to concerns that Jingye, the Chinese-owned parent company, was seeking to sell raw materials en route to the plant. The move aims to secure necessary materials to keep the blast furnaces operational, though nationalization remains a likely outcome. The situation has raised questions about the government's handling of the crisis and the complexity of international supply chains.</p>

            <p>Rory McIlroy is in a strong position to win the Masters after a commanding third-round performance, leading Bryson DeChambeau by two shots.

McIlroy is seeking to complete the career Grand Slam, having already won the US Open, The Open, and two US PGA Championships.

            <p>The State Department has informed a federal judge that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, is alive and secure in a Salvadoran prison. However, the filing did not detail the steps the Trump administration is taking to facilitate his return to the U.S., as requested by the judge. President Trump mentioned El Salvador President Nayib Bukele's custody of violent aliens, but did not directly address Abrego Garcia's case. Attorneys for Abrego Garcia have requested additional relief, including holding the government in contempt for failing to comply with prior court orders.</p>

McIlroy birdied the 13th and played a glorious second to the 15th, setting up an eagle. DeChambeau ramped up the pressure, holing out from 16 yards and off the 18th green. Ludvig Åberg, Scottie Scheffler, and Patrick Reed are also in contention.</p>

            <p>A study estimates that over three million children died in 2022 due to infections resistant to antibiotics, with children in Africa and South East Asia being most at risk. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when microbes evolve to resist antibiotic drugs, posing a significant public health threat. The study highlights a significant increase in AMR-related infections in children, potentially worsened by the Covid pandemic. The authors point to a rise in the use of 'watch antibiotics' and 'reserve antibiotics,' warning of dwindling treatment options for multidrug-resistant infections.</p>

Scheffler, a two-time Masters champion, struggled with an even-par 72, finding himself five under par and well off McIlroy's pace. Scheffler played a good round of bad golf, making mistakes but managing to recover. His partner, Tyrrell Hatton, also struggled, finishing three over for the day.

            <p>President Trump has urged Congress to pass legislation making daylight saving time permanent, aiming to eliminate the biannual clock changes. Trump believes the change would be popular and cost-effective for the government. The Sunshine Protection Act, reintroduced in the House and Senate, seeks to adopt daylight saving time permanently. While some support the change, citing economic and energy benefits, others argue for permanent standard time, aligning with the sun's natural rhythm for better health.</p>

            <p>This article analyzes Donald Trump's deal-making strategies, suggesting that flattery, money, and ensuring a personal 'upside' are key to successful negotiations. It references Trump's book 'The Art Of The Deal' and the opinions of those who regret enabling his rise. The article examines Trump's recent tariff decisions, arguing that his actions destabilized the economy and that his negotiating tactics involve making concessions in advance without securing anything in return. It suggests that other nations may be prepared to flatter Trump but will seek to negotiate down from the lower baseline he has conceded. (not investment advice)</p>

The cause of death is unknown, with no signs of physical injury. Samples have been sent to a lab for testing. Scientists have noted a high number of gray whale deaths this year, with at least 70 deaths reported in Baja California. Some believe malnutrition may be a factor, as many of the dead whales appear depleted. This event underscores concerns about the health and well-being of gray whale populations.</p>
