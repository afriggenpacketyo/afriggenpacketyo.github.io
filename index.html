          <p>Wisconsin's Democratic Governor, Tony Evers, has announced he will not run for a third term, setting up the state's first open gubernatorial race in 16 years. In his announcement, Evers cited a desire to focus on his family after five decades in public service. His tenure has been defined by frequent clashes with the Republican-controlled legislature, where he used his veto power extensively, but also by recent bipartisan success on the state budget. This decision opens a key contest in a major battleground state, with Democrats hopeful that newly redrawn electoral maps will give them an advantage in upcoming elections.</p>

          <p>Chuck Mangione, the Grammy-winning jazz flugelhornist and composer, has passed away at the age of 84. He was best known for his instrumental hit "Feels So Good," which became a smooth-jazz staple and reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1977. Mangione won two Grammy Awards during his career and also composed the theme for the 1980 Winter Olympics, "Give It All You Got." He later gained a new generation of fans through his recurring role as a fictionalized version of himself on the animated series "King of the Hill."</p>

          <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella sent a memo to employees acknowledging the difficulty of recent job eliminations, stating the decisions have been "weighing heavily" on him. The company has laid off over 15,000 people in 2025, part of a broader trend of workforce reductions across the tech industry, even as Microsoft's stock has soared. In his message, Nadella framed the changes as part of a necessary evolution in the era of AI, shifting the company from a "software factory to an intelligence engine." The memo attempts to reassure staff while navigating the dissonance between record corporate success and significant layoffs.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has extended a pause on a lower court ruling that could significantly weaken the Voting Rights Act. The case originates from North Dakota, where two tribal nations successfully challenged a state legislative map for diluting Native American voting power. An 8th Circuit Court of Appeals panel later ruled that private individuals and groups, like the tribes, do not have the right to sue under Section 2 of the act, a departure from decades of precedent. This temporary hold keeps the current protections in place while the Supreme Court decides whether to take up a full review of the case.</p>

Analysts suggest the market may have misjudged the report, overlooking positive indicators like a 7% increase in bookings, which signals future growth, and record-high profit margins. The analysis posits that the sell-off presents a buying opportunity, as the company's strategic portfolio changes are setting it up for accelerated growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve headquarters, escalating his public pressure campaign against its chairman, Jerome Powell. The visit follows months of criticism from Trump, who has demanded interest rate cuts and recently suggested that cost overruns on a Fed building renovation could be grounds for firing Powell. Such a move would threaten the central bank's long-held political independence and likely destabilize financial markets. The visit is a highly symbolic act, bringing the president's critique directly to the institution he has repeatedly targeted for its monetary policy decisions.</p>

Trump asserted that he wants all U.S. businesses, including Musk's ventures like Tesla and SpaceX which receive significant federal contracts and credits, to "THRIVE like never before."

          <p>Despite significant staffing cuts at U.S. National Parks under the Trump administration, many summer visitors are not yet seeing a major impact on their experience. This is largely because parks have prioritized hiring seasonal, public-facing staff, creating a facade of normalcy. However, watchdog groups and former park officials warn that deep cuts to permanent, behind-the-scenes positions are creating a crisis. Critical functions like infrastructure maintenance, scientific research, and future hiring are being neglected, raising concerns that the park system is facing irreparable long-term damage that will become more visible in the coming years.</p>

While the government has offered a 5.4% pay rise, it says it cannot afford more but was willing to negotiate on working conditions, an offer the BMA rejected as insufficient without addressing the core pay issue.</p>

          <p>Despite predictions of soaring prices, sweeping tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have not yet caused runaway inflation. Economists point to several reasons, including the delayed implementation of many tariffs, businesses stockpiling inventory to absorb initial costs, and a reluctance to pass on price hikes to already strained consumers. However, the article warns this is likely a temporary reprieve. As inventories deplete and tariffs on major trading partners take full effect, price increases on import-sensitive goods like electronics, apparel, and furniture are expected to become more noticeable later in the year.

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has reversed its plan to eliminate paper checks for all beneficiaries after September 30. The agency will now continue issuing paper checks to recipients who have no other means of receiving their payments. This decision came after Senator Elizabeth Warren and other advocates raised concerns that the move would harm vulnerable populations, including many seniors and unbanked individuals who rely on physical checks. While the SSA will still promote the security and efficiency of electronic deposits, it has committed that no one will be left behind by the transition.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan men who were deported from the U.S. to a high-security prison in El Salvador are describing their detention as a "horror movie" filled with abuse. The men, accused by the U.S. of gang affiliation, allege they were subjected to severe beatings and psychological torture at the infamous Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot). Their transfer was part of a deal between the U.S. and El Salvador, and they were recently repatriated to Venezuela in a subsequent prisoner swap. Venezuela's attorney general has opened an investigation into the allegations of abuse, which include claims of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>The power of the U.S. passport has continued to wane, dropping to a tie for 10th place in the 2025 Henley Passport Index, its lowest position in the ranking's 20-year history. The index measures global travel freedom by ranking passports based on the number of destinations their holders can enter without a prior visa. While the U.S. passport allows visa-free access to 182 destinations, this is significantly less than top-ranked Singapore, which grants access to 193. The report notes that countries like the U.S. and U.K. have seen their rankings fall while appearing to retreat behind more restrictive entry policies.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines' shares fell over 11% after the carrier posted second-quarter earnings that missed expectations and sharply cut its full-year profit forecast. The airline now anticipates pre-tax earnings of $600 million to $800 million for 2025, a significant reduction from its earlier forecast of $1.7 billion. While CEO Bob Jordan noted that travel demand has recently stabilized, the company cited a challenging domestic market and the financial impact of its new fare structures. In response, Southwest is overhauling parts of its business model and has announced a new $2 billion share buyback program.</p>

          <p>A Dutch couple, Erik and Karin Vonk, have transformed a retirement hobby into Richland Rum, one of Georgia's most acclaimed craft distilleries. What sets their product apart is their method: they are among a small percentage of global producers who make rum directly from fresh sugarcane juice grown on their own estate, rather than the more common byproduct of molasses. This dedication to process has earned their spirits numerous awards and turned their rural distillery into a major tourist destination. The business has thrived following changes in Georgia law that now permit distilleries to sell products directly to consumers.</p>

This activity, where investors bet against the stock, can trigger a "short squeeze" that artificially inflates the price. The surge in interest also coincides with the launch of a new marketing campaign for the retailer's denim line, featuring popular actress Sydney Sweeney.</p>

The team's most undeniable weakness is its bullpen, and it is widely expected they will acquire a high-leverage relief pitcher. Beyond that, their strategy is less clear; the front office may choose to bet on their underperforming star players to improve rather than pursuing major external upgrades for the lineup or rotation. The team's recent struggles have fueled speculation, but internally, the belief in the existing talent remains strong.</p>
