          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler, a veteran New York Democrat, has announced his decision not to seek re-election in 2026, marking the end of his 34-year career in the House of Representatives. The 78-year-old cited a personal reflection on the need for generational change within the Democratic Party, particularly in the face of ongoing political challenges. Nadler, a prominent figure who chaired the House Judiciary Committee and led efforts in Donald Trump's impeachments, expressed his belief that a younger successor could bring renewed energy and potentially offer a more effective response to the current political climate. His announcement follows a recent primary challenge from a younger candidate, highlighting the broader internal party discussions about leadership evolution.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett has publicly expressed his disappointment regarding the recent decision to split Kraft Heinz, a company formed from a merger he orchestrated a decade ago. Berkshire Hathaway, which holds a substantial 27.5% stake, has remained a steadfast shareholder despite the company's struggles. Buffett conceded that the original merger did not yield the anticipated success, yet he remains skeptical that dividing the company will effectively address its deep-seated problems, such as declining sales driven by evolving consumer preferences and insufficient brand investment. Following these comments, Kraft Heinz shares experienced a notable drop of over 5%, signaling market apprehension. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in her new memoir "Listening to the Law," defends the 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, asserting that the ruling "respected the choice" of the American people. She argues that the court's role is to uphold societal agreements, not dictate them, framing the original Roe v. Wade as usurping public will. This stance comes despite polls showing a majority of Americans support legal abortion in most cases. The article highlights the political nature of her confirmation and the subsequent conservative majority's impact, while Barrett maintains the court's function is to interpret law, not engage in political battles.</p>

          <p>Activist investor Elliott Investment Management has acquired a significant $4 billion stake in PepsiCo, positioning itself among the company's top five active investors. Elliott believes there is a "historic opportunity" to revitalize the snack and beverage conglomerate, which has recently experienced weakened demand attributed to sustained price increases and evolving consumer preferences. The firm intends to work with PepsiCo's leadership to enhance focus, stimulate innovation, and improve operational efficiency, particularly within its North American food and beverage divisions. This strategic investment led to a more than 3% jump in PepsiCo's shares, indicating market confidence in Elliott's proposed turnaround plan. (not investment advice)</p>

Xi and Putin have previously declared a "no limits partnership," with China's economic support for Russia's war in Ukraine and North Korea's direct military aid underscoring this emerging "Axis of Upheaval."</p>

          <p>The Utah Supreme Court has issued a stay on the scheduled execution of Ralph Leroy Menzies, a 67-year-old death row inmate, due to his advanced dementia. Menzies, who was convicted of abducting and killing Maurine Hunsaker in 1986 and had opted for a firing squad, will now undergo a reevaluation of his mental competency. His legal team argued that his severe dementia prevents him from understanding the nature of his punishment, aligning with previous U.S. Supreme Court rulings against executing individuals with profound mental illness. The court's decision, while prolonging the victim's family's suffering, emphasizes adherence to legal principles concerning a prisoner's fitness for execution.</p>

His platform emphasizes radical action on climate change linked to inequality, proposing policies like Universal Basic Income and nationalized water companies. Polanski's unconventional path and confrontational communication style signal a decisive shift to the left for the party, potentially opening doors for cooperation with other new left-wing political movements.</p>

          <p>Biologists near the California-Oregon border are employing an innovative method to protect livestock from wolves: drones equipped with loudspeakers that blast heavy metal music, movie clips, and human voices. This experiment aims to scare wolves away from cattle, building on efforts to manage increasing conflicts as wolf populations recover in the U.S. West. While the technology shows promise in interrupting wolf hunts, concerns remain about its long-term effectiveness as wolves might habituate to the drones. This non-lethal approach, though costly and limited in dense areas, offers a new tool for coexistence between ranchers and wildlife, potentially reducing livestock deaths and associated economic stress.</p>

          <p>UK government borrowing costs have climbed to their highest level since 1998, with the 30-year bond yield reaching 5.698%, making it more expensive for the government to secure loans. This surge amplifies pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of the upcoming Budget, fueling expectations of potential tax increases to meet fiscal rules. Analysts suggest investors are concerned about the public finances, leading to a sell-off in UK government debt. The article notes that while global factors contribute, the chancellor faces "highly difficult choices" to balance economic growth with fiscal responsibility, with households and banks likely bearing the brunt of any new taxes.

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made a bold prediction, stating that Optimus humanoid robots, which are still in development, will eventually constitute approximately 80% of Tesla's overall value. This projection comes as Tesla faces a multi-quarter sales slump for its electric vehicles due to increased competition and an aging product lineup. Musk is attempting to redirect investor focus towards Tesla's long-term vision, centered on robotaxis and advanced AI, despite the company currently lagging behind competitors in these emerging markets. Tesla plans to produce 5,000 Optimus robots this year, aiming for wider deployment in its factories by 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Center indicates strong nationalism in China, with most citizens desiring an active global role for their nation and perceiving it as moderately strong. The findings suggest the Chinese public largely supports President Xi Jinping's assertive foreign policy. This contrasts sharply with growing U.S. wariness towards foreign engagement, exemplified by President Trump’s "America First" agenda, which has alienated allies and reduced U.S. global involvement. The article posits that the U.S. withdrawal from international institutions may inadvertently bolster Beijing's international profile and influence, despite Chinese public's continued wariness of the U.S.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court ruled that most of the Trump administration's tariffs are illegal, raising the significant prospect of the U.S. government having to refund billions of dollars in wrongfully collected money. This decision, which the administration plans to appeal, could lead to "total administrative chaos" in processing repayments to millions of Americans and businesses. Treasury and Commerce secretaries warned of "devastating and dire consequences," highlighting the complexity of reversing the tariff regime, especially for companies that have already exited the U.S. market due to the unpredictable regulatory burden. The article suggests this situation exemplifies a consistent Trump method of pushing executive power to its limits, then presenting courts with chaos if limits are enforced.

          <p>Poland's newly elected President Karol Nawrocki is visiting Washington to strengthen the bilateral alliance with the U.S., particularly on security policy. Situated on NATO's eastern flank, Poland seeks to ensure continued American support amid waning U.S. interest in Europe, especially by securing arms purchases and military presence. Nawrocki's visit follows President Trump's endorsement during his campaign, which helped him win the election. The trip is overshadowed by a domestic power struggle between Nawrocki and Prime Minister Donald Tusk, reflecting differing views on foreign policy and internal political influence. Despite this, Poland aims to solidify its strategic importance to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Marc Rowan, CEO of Apollo Global, contends that the traditional investing model is "broken" and foresees a significant shift from publicly traded stocks to alternative investments. He argues that passive investing, coupled with market concentration in a few mega-tech stocks, diminishes diversification and the ability to truly invest in the broader American economy. Rowan highlights the post-financial crisis growth of private credit, which now fills the gap left by reduced bank lending and offers attractive returns. He suggests that private investments, once deemed risky, are becoming increasingly vital for diversification and will see greater allocation from investors as the market evolves.

This strategy aims to reach high-net-worth individuals and bring the historically discreet alternative assets industry into the mainstream. Historically shrouded in secrecy, alternative asset managers are increasingly targeting retail investors through semi-liquid vehicles, necessitating a shift towards more public engagement. Blue Owl's chief marketing officer, Suzanne Escousse, initiated this approach after identifying low brand recognition compared to competitors, believing alignment with stakeholders' passions fosters stronger business relationships and curiosity about their offerings.

It was later revealed he faces a separate criminal charge for allegedly hiding a secret camera in a parliament toilet, which he denies. Girlguiding stated that robust safeguarding policies were followed, and no girls were affected. The allegations have caused "deep unease and horror" within the parliament, raising questions about accountability and the safety of the workplace.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the reasons behind the UK's rising long-term government borrowing costs, with the 30-year gilt yield hitting a 27-year high. While some attribute this to economic mismanagement, the article notes it's part of a broader pan-European trend, potentially signaling UK growth outperformance and less room for interest rate cuts. Unlike the 2022 mini-Budget crisis, the current rise primarily affects long-term debt, with limited direct impact on most mortgages. Factors include global geopolitical tensions, U.S. trade policies, and an upcoming French confidence vote, alongside concerns about UK inflation and changes in pension fund investment patterns.

          <p>A wave of deadly protests has erupted across Indonesia, fueled by deep-seated economic hardship, perceived government indifference, and a widening gap between the elite and ordinary citizens.

Protesters are demanding accountability for violence, an end to military involvement in civilian security, and structural reforms to parliament and police institutions. The government's response, including disabling TikTok livestreams and President Prabowo Subianto's labeling of some actions as "treason," has intensified public anger and raised concerns about militaristic tactics and impunity.</p>

Starring Domhnall Gleeson as the earnest but disastrous editor Ned Sampson, and Oscar Nuñez reprising his role as accountant Oscar Martinez, the series aims to capture the spirit of its predecessor while forging its own narrative. The show balances high stakes, as Ned tries to revive local journalism with no budget, with the familiar deadpan humor and relatable characters. Creators and cast emphasize it's a new story, not a reboot, encouraging viewers to watch with an open mind.</p>
