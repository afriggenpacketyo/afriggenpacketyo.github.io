          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD is launching an aggressive price war in Japan, offering discounts up to 1 million yen (US$6,700), to boost its struggling sales. Despite opening 45 sales locations and introducing new models, BYD sold only 5,300 vehicles between January 2023 and June this year, facing strong Japanese consumer loyalty to domestic brands and a preference for gas-electric hybrids. This discounting tactic, effective in China, could backfire in Japan by potentially upsetting early buyers and diminishing resale values. The article underscores the significant difficulties foreign automakers encounter when trying to establish a foothold in Japan's unique market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Labour government is facing significant challenges in restoring business confidence, with prominent figures like billionaire John Caudwell expressing a "desperate loss of faith" after the recent Budget. Despite campaigning as "the most pro-business government," post-election policies, including a £25bn rise in employers' National Insurance and a substantial increase in the National Living Wage, have generated widespread concern. While the government points to large inward tech investments, many smaller businesses feel neglected, grappling with escalating costs and new employee protection laws. This article highlights the difficult balancing act for Labour between shoring up public finances and fostering a supportive environment for all sectors of the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>West Ham United has appointed Nuno Espirito Santo as their new manager, replacing Graham Potter, with the team currently languishing in 19th place in the Premier League. The article analyzes Nuno's tactical approach, characterized by a low-possession, counter-attacking style, which aligns more with West Ham's recent successful periods under David Moyes. His previous stints at Wolves and Nottingham Forest demonstrated an ability to elevate squads, and his focus on direct attacks and utilizing player strengths is seen as a good fit for West Ham's current roster. Beyond tactics, Nuno's strong interpersonal skills and calm demeanor are highlighted as crucial for improving a reportedly sour club environment.</p>

This significant Communist Party meeting, attended by President Xi Jinping and over 370 Central Committee members, follows a public consultation and Xi's directive for a "forward-looking approach" considering global dynamics. The new plan, which replaces the current 14th five-year plan, requires endorsement by this plenary session before its final submission to the annual legislative session in March. This strategic gathering also precedes President Xi's anticipated meeting with US President Donald Trump at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea.</p>

          <p>Following their Women's Rugby World Cup triumph, England's Red Roses are strategically planning to convert new fans into regular participants and volunteers. The team's post-win activities include public celebrations, player appearances at RugbyFest, and a front-loaded domestic Premiership Women's Rugby season with expanded broadcast deals. Unlike previous missed opportunities, the Rugby Football Union has pre-loaded a £14.5m "Impact 25" program to support grassroots growth, already showing a 35% increase in age-grade girl players. The article also discusses potential protectionist measures for the PWR to ensure the development of English players amidst a growing influx of international talent, aiming to sustain global dominance and leverage increased player visibility for commercial gain.</p>

          <p>The foreign ministers of China and North Korea, Wang Yi and Choe Son Gui, have agreed to strengthen bilateral relations to resist "all forms of hegemonism," a thinly veiled reference to their joint opposition to the United States. This meeting in Beijing follows North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's recent attendance at a military parade hosted by China's President Xi Jinping. China reiterated its "unswerving strategic policy" to maintain strong ties, while North Korea expressed willingness to cooperate in multilateral affairs to promote a "fairer and more just world order." Both nations view the US as an adversary, with China challenging its economic and strategic dominance, and North Korea its demands regarding its nuclear program.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy has strongly criticized the "unacceptable and abusive behaviour" at the Ryder Cup in New York, revealing that his wife, Erica, was hit by a thrown drink. Despite Europe's 15-13 victory over the United States, the world number two expressed dismay over the hostile crowd, which targeted him and his teammates throughout the event. McIlroy, who usually enjoys American support, stated that golf should be held to a higher standard and vowed to ensure such incidents do not occur at the 2027 Ryder Cup in Ireland.

          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, is on track for a clear parliamentary majority following an election heavily impacted by claims of "massive Russian interference." The PAS secured 50% of the vote, far surpassing the pro-Russian Patriotic Electoral Bloc, despite opposition leaders attempting to claim victory prematurely and call for protests. The electoral process was disrupted by bomb scares at polling stations, both domestically and abroad, and arrests related to alleged plots of unrest, which the PAS attributed to Moscow-backed criminal groups. This critical vote underscores Moldova's commitment to its EU path, having gained candidate status in 2022, amidst ongoing geopolitical tensions and economic challenges.</p>

Despite the club's continued support for Amorim, Manchester United remains 14th in the Premier League, unable to secure back-to-back victories.

          <p>Nesrine Malik's opinion article critiques Kamala Harris's memoir, "107 Days," suggesting it exposes a disconnect between the Democratic Party and the electorate. The author argues that the book portrays Harris as focused on political machinery and celebrity spectacle rather than substantive policy or a distinct vision. Malik contends that Harris's account lacks self-awareness, attributing her defeat to external circumstances rather than internal campaign shortcomings. The article implies that the memoir reflects a broader issue within the Democratic establishment, which prioritizes presentation and continuity, hindering its ability to mount a compelling challenge against figures like Donald Trump and address voter disillusionment.</p>

After three days of communication and increasing pressure, the reporter's phone was bombarded with two-factor authentication requests, a tactic known as MFA bombing, leading to a temporary disconnection from BBC systems.

          <p>Goldman Sachs predicts that China's central bank will likely ease its monetary policy in the fourth quarter, citing slowing economic momentum and pressure to support growth. The forecast includes a 10-basis-point policy rate cut and a 50-basis-point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, anticipating year-on-year growth to slow towards 4%. This projection follows the People's Bank of China's third-quarter meeting, which maintained a dovish bias and subtly shifted its economic outlook from "positive momentum" to "making strides while maintaining stability," indicating a more cautious stance. However, the data-dependent nature of PBOC decisions means inaction is possible if growth targets are met. (not investment advice)</p>

This decision follows recent reports of unidentified drone sightings over Danish military sites and other European nations, leading to a "drone wall" initiative by 10 EU defense ministers.

          <p>The United States has deployed a prototype of its Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) air defense system in South Korea, marking the first known instance of such a system being stationed at an overseas US base. This strategic move is widely interpreted as a direct response to rising tensions and perceived threats from both China and North Korea. The IFPC system, a mobile, ground-based weapon, is designed to intercept and defeat cruise missiles, unmanned aircraft systems, and various rockets, artillery, and mortars. This deployment underscores a broader US strategy to enhance the air and missile defense capabilities of its allies in critical global hotspots, signaling increased regional security measures.</p>

          <p>The ongoing decline of American shopping malls and strip centers is creating unexpected real estate opportunities for small, local businesses, including health practitioners and artists. With national vacancy rates rising, landlords are becoming more flexible, offering favorable terms like reduced rents, shorter leases, and even rent-free periods to keep spaces occupied. While rental rates still generally increase, their slower pace combined with increased vacancies makes previously unaffordable prime locations accessible. This trend allows small businesses to test physical presences without overextending capital, fostering local regeneration, although the success varies geographically and landlords remain cautious about small business failure rates.

While some experts, like Goldman Sachs, acknowledge the momentum, they question if the rally is disconnected from economic fundamentals, which show signs of slowing growth and weak domestic demand. Nomura has warned of excessive leverage and potential "bubbles" in certain overheated sectors like technology and contract research organizations. (not investment advice)</p>

State Attorney General Dan Rayfield announced the suit, arguing that President Trump lacks the legal authority to federalize the National Guard for this purpose, emphasizing that local officials are capable of maintaining public safety without federal intervention. President Trump had publicly directed the deployment to protect federal property from alleged "Antifa, and other domestic terrorists." However, Governor Tina Kotek asserts there is no "insurrection or a threat to public safety" necessitating military intervention, viewing the action as an abuse of power and a media-driven political maneuver.</p>
