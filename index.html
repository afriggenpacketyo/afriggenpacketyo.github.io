          <p>Gilead Sciences will pay $202 million to resolve allegations of paying kickbacks to doctors to prescribe its HIV medications.  Prosecutors claim the company used speaker programs from 2011 to 2017 to provide honoraria, meals, and travel expenses in exchange for increased prescriptions. This violated the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, leading to false claims for reimbursement from federal healthcare programs. Gilead denies wrongdoing but settled to avoid litigation.</p>
