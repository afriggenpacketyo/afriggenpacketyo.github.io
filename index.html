The world's top-ranked golfer demonstrated remarkable consistency throughout the tournament, securing his third major title before the age of 30. This victory marks his second major win of 2025 and brings him one step closer to achieving the career Grand Slam, with only the U.S. Open remaining. His next chance to complete the prestigious feat will be at the 2026 U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills.</p>

          <p>Montgomery County, Maryland, experienced unprecedented flash flooding after intense rainfall, prompting over 100 water rescue calls within just two hours on Saturday. The National Weather Service issued its first-ever flash flood emergency for the D.C. area, as some local waterways rose ten feet in only 30 minutes. Although no initial injuries were reported, numerous people were trapped in cars and buildings, requiring emergency evacuation. Residents expressed shock at the sudden and severe nature of the flooding, which caused significant road closures and disruptions.</p>

          <p>A fragile ceasefire is in effect in Suweida, southern Syria, following a week of deadly sectarian clashes between Druze and Bedouin communities that killed over 1,120 people. Bedouin fighters have withdrawn from the city but are demanding the release of their wounded, threatening to resume hostilities if their demands are not met. The violence, which also involved government forces and Israeli airstrikes, has displaced at least 128,000 people and created a severe humanitarian crisis. International figures are calling for accountability for atrocities committed by all sides during the conflict.</p>

          <p>A new CBS poll indicates that President Trump's job approval rating has fallen to 42%, with declining support for his key policies on immigration and trade. A majority of Americans now believe the administration's deportation efforts are broader than expected and no longer prioritize only dangerous criminals, leading to reduced approval. Furthermore, most Americans oppose the administration's focus on tariffs, believing it detracts from efforts to lower consumer prices. The polling suggests that while Trump's base remains strong, there is growing doubt among the wider public regarding the direction and impact of his policies.</p>

          <p>The acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Todd Lyons, has stated he will continue to permit his officers to wear masks during arrest raids, despite widespread criticism. Legal advocates and officials argue the practice undermines accountability and creates fear, with some cases of criminals impersonating ICE agents. Lyons acknowledged these concerns but defended the policy as a necessary tool to protect agents and their families from potential doxxing and threats. This comes as the agency ramps up deportation efforts under the Trump administration, leading to increased scrutiny of its tactics.</p>

Lyons also announced a renewed focus on cracking down on American companies that employ unauthorized workers, framing it as an effort to combat exploitation.
