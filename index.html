        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion libel lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal's publisher, Dow Jones & Company, and its parent company, News Corp. The suit alleges a recent article falsely claimed Trump sent a "bawdy" birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, calling the report defamatory and unsubstantiated. The lawsuit faces a high legal bar, as public figures must prove "actual malice" to win defamation cases. Trump's legal action comes amid his own administration's move to unseal grand jury records related to the Epstein investigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Block, the fintech company founded by Jack Dorsey, surged more than 10% in extended trading following the announcement of its inclusion in the S&P 500 index. Block is set to replace oil producer Hess, which was recently acquired by Chevron, with the change taking effect on July 23. Inclusion in a major index like the S&P 500 often boosts a company's stock price as index-tracking funds are required to purchase its shares. Despite a 14% decline in its stock value this year, Block's market capitalization of around $45 billion places it well above the median for the index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Justice Department Moves to Unseal Epstein Grand Jury Records</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 19:32:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a directive from President Trump, the Department of Justice has formally requested a court to unseal grand jury records from the federal investigations into Jeffrey Epstein. This move reverses the DOJ's earlier stance that no further disclosures were warranted, citing "extensive public interest" as the reason for the change. The filing states that transparency is of utmost importance but ensures that victim-related information will be redacted to protect their privacy. The action occurs amidst heightened political pressure and scrutiny over the administration's handling of the Epstein files.</p>

          <p>The family of Cornelius Taylor, a 46-year-old homeless man, has filed a lawsuit against the city of Atlanta after he was killed when a bulldozer crushed his tent during an encampment sweep. The lawsuit alleges that city employees were negligent for failing to check inside the tents before using heavy machinery to clear the area. Taylor's death has sparked outrage among advocates, who criticize the city's approach to homelessness as inhumane amid an affordable housing crisis. The family is seeking unspecified damages and a call for more dignified treatment of the city's unhoused population.</p>

While many people dislike the insects, ecologists emphasize their crucial role as apex predators and natural pest controllers in the ecosystem. The article notes that the common wasp appears to be thriving, bucking the trend of widespread decline seen in many other global insect populations. To coexist peacefully, experts advise staying calm and distracting the insects with a small amount of something sweet placed away from picnic areas.</p>

The creators insist the show is an affectionate homage rather than a malicious satire, celebrating the couple as heroic figures who have endured immense public scrutiny.

This finding helps explain the unpredictable nature of the disease and could pave the way for more precise, personalized treatments for the millions affected by inflammatory bowel disease.</p>

          <h2>Australian Prime Minister's China Visit Signals a More Confident Foreign Policy Stance</h2>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's recent six-day trip to China, which included meetings with Premier Li Qiang, is being interpreted as a sign of Canberra's "stiffening spine" in its foreign policy. The visit, aimed at stabilizing relations with Beijing, demonstrates Australia's effort to navigate the intense rivalry between China and the United States. Analysts suggest that Australia is forging a more independent path, balancing its crucial economic relationship with China against its security alliance with the U.S. This diplomatic maneuvering reflects a broader challenge faced by many nations in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <h2>Inside the Trump Administration's Strategy on the Epstein Files Controversy</h2>

          <p>This article details the Trump administration's internal deliberations on how to handle the growing controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files, revealing initial reluctance to take further action. President Trump was reportedly frustrated with his own supporters for not accepting his declaration that the matter was settled and felt betrayed by MAGA influencers. The strategy shifted dramatically after a Wall Street Journal report on an alleged letter from Trump to Epstein, prompting the president to order the unsealing of grand jury records. The episode illustrates the administration's struggle to control a narrative that involves Trump's own past association with Epstein.</p>

          <p>A $50 million civil lawsuit accusing media personality and former NFL star Shannon Sharpe of sexual assault has been settled. The attorney for the plaintiff, a Jane Doe, announced that a "mutually agreed upon resolution" had been reached and the lawsuit would be dismissed. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. The lawsuit, filed in April, alleged multiple non-consensual sexual encounters, which Sharpe had denied. An attorney for Sharpe confirmed the settlement and stated that the announcement should be considered the final word on the matter.</p>

          <p>After falling behind rivals like OpenAI and Google in the generative AI race, Meta is rebooting its approach with a new division called Meta Superintelligence Labs. Despite creating its pioneering FAIR research lab over a decade ago, the company has struggled to translate its research into competitive consumer-facing AI products. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is now personally recruiting top talent with massive compensation packages and plans to spend billions on data centers to build "personal superintelligence for everyone." This new strategy may involve moving away from its previous open-source model as it scrambles to regain a leading position in the critical AI sector.</p>

          <p>Vice Adm. Yvette Davids, the first woman to lead the U.S. Naval Academy, is being reassigned after about 18 months in the role. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has nominated a Marine Corps general, Michael Borgschulte, to succeed her, which would be a first in the academy's history. While a Pentagon official stated the move was not a dismissal and Davids has been nominated for a senior position, it comes amid a pattern of the Trump administration removing high-ranking female and minority officers. Hegseth, a Trump loyalist, has previously drawn criticism for his past remarks questioning the role of women in military combat units.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons confirmed the agency plans to use government data, including from Medicaid, to locate immigrants in the U.S. illegally. He also stated that while he is not a "proponent" of agents wearing masks during arrests, he will continue to allow the practice due to safety concerns amid a rise in attacks on officers. Lyons attributed the increased attacks to ICE's higher visibility as it carries out the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies. The use of health data to track individuals has raised significant privacy and civil liberties concerns.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 17:36:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several prominent Democratic politicians, including Senators Adam Schiff and Bernie Sanders, are publicly questioning whether the cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" was politically motivated. They highlight the suspicious timing, coming just days after Colbert criticized CBS's parent company, Paramount, for a $16 million legal settlement with President Trump. The lawmakers suggest the decision could be an attempt to curry favor with the Trump administration amid a pending multi-billion dollar merger. CBS has maintained the cancellation was a "purely financial decision," but the move has ignited a debate about corporate influence and free speech.</p>
