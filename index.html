          <p>A federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, Adam Schleifer, was fired at the White House's behest, potentially linked to a case involving a fast-food executive.  The decision sparked concerns about political interference in the Justice Department. The Los Angeles Times' article is investigative in nature, but its focus on the political implications might overshadow the legal aspects of the case.</p>
