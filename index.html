          <p>An Israeli military strike accidentally hit the Holy Family Church, the only Catholic church in Gaza, resulting in three deaths and ten injuries, including the parish priest. The church was sheltering hundreds of displaced civilians, including Christians and Muslims. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged the strike was a mistake caused by "stray ammunition" and expressed deep regret, promising a transparent investigation into the incident. The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem and Pope Leo XIV condemned the tragedy and renewed calls for an immediate ceasefire to end the widespread suffering and destruction in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article details the ongoing tension between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump appointed but has since heavily criticized. Trump's dissatisfaction stems from the Fed's decision to maintain relatively high interest rates to combat inflation, a move he believes stifles economic growth. The piece explains the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices, its operational independence, and the legally untested nature of a president attempting to fire a Fed chair. It also touches upon other points of contention, including a renovation project at the Fed's headquarters.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Border Patrol Conducts Raids in Sacramento, Drawing Condemnation from California Officials</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents conducted immigration enforcement raids in Sacramento, including at a Home Depot, arresting 11 undocumented immigrants. A top Border Patrol official stated the operation was intended to send a message that "no such thing as a sanctuary state" exists. The action drew immediate condemnation from Governor Gavin Newsom's office, which accused the agency of illegal racial profiling and operating far from the border. The raids occurred despite recent federal court injunctions limiting such practices, and a video of a U.S. citizen being forcefully arrested while trying to intervene sparked further outrage and community fear.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly called for an immediate halt to the trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, describing the legal proceedings as an "unjust" and politically motivated attack. Bolsonaro is facing charges related to an alleged coup attempt following his 2022 election loss. In a letter posted on social media, Trump expressed solidarity with Bolsonaro and criticized what he termed as attacks on free speech in both Brazil and the U.S. This intervention follows meetings between Bolsonaro's son and White House officials and a threat by Trump to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian products over the matter.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has reversed its previous ban, now permitting Juul to keep its tobacco and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes on the market. The agency concluded that the company's studies sufficiently demonstrate that the products can benefit adult smokers by helping them switch from more harmful traditional cigarettes. This decision is a significant milestone for Juul, which has faced intense scrutiny and legal challenges for its role in the teen vaping epidemic. Anti-tobacco advocates heavily criticized the move, arguing it's a step backward for public health, while Juul can now compete with other FDA-authorized menthol vapes.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna affirmed that his department is legally obligated to transfer inmates to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) when presented with a federal judicial warrant. He clarified that these warrants, which are distinct from civil detainer requests, are based on probable cause for criminal charges and supersede local sanctuary policies. Luna emphasized that his department does not honor the 995 civil detainer requests received this year and does not assist ICE with street-level enforcement operations.

          <p>President Trump announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to produce its soda using "REAL Cane Sugar" instead of high-fructose corn syrup, a change he championed for its superior taste. While the move has been praised by figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the article notes that the health benefits are largely negligible, as both sweeteners are metabolically similar. The announcement is framed as a symbolic political win for Trump, aligning with a "Make America healthy again" theme but lacking substantial public health impact. It reflects a pattern of pressuring companies for headline-grabbing changes that may not address underlying issues like overall sugar consumption.</p>

          <p>According to two U.S. intelligence sources, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian sustained leg injuries during an Israeli strike on a Supreme National Security Council meeting. The report, which aligns with Iranian state-run media accounts, suggests he was escaping through an emergency shaft when injured. It is currently unclear whether the president was an intentional target of the attack. The incident occurred during a recent 12-day conflict that also saw the deaths of several high-ranking Iranian commanders.

Speaking at a conference, Noem stated she is questioning all current TSA procedures and that the rules on liquid sizes "may be the next big announcement." This follows the recent elimination of the requirement for passengers to remove shoes during security checks. The potential change is linked to the deployment of new CT scanners at airports, which provide more detailed 3D images of bag contents, possibly rendering the 3.4-ounce liquid limit obsolete in the future.</p>

Democrats raised serious concerns about Bove's ethics, pointing to his alleged role in a quid pro quo deal involving NYC Mayor Eric Adams and a whistleblower's claim that Bove suggested ignoring court orders.

Researchers hope the data will illuminate a mysterious period known as the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, when the planet's glacial cycles changed dramatically. Understanding this "unknown period" could revolutionize knowledge of climate change and help predict how our planet will respond to current high levels of greenhouse gases.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, largely in line with market expectations. This easing was partly attributed to a slight moderation in the rapid rise of rice prices. Despite the slowdown, inflation has now remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months, maintaining pressure on the central bank to consider future interest rate hikes. However, concerns about economic growth, fueled by potential U.S. tariffs and a decline in first-quarter GDP, complicate the policy outlook for the nation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition affecting blood flow in the legs. The disclosure came after days of public speculation fueled by photographs showing bruising on the president's hand and swelling in his legs. A letter from the White House physician described the condition as "benign and common" and stated that tests showed no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt attributed the hand bruising to "tissue damage from frequent handshaking" combined with aspirin use, reiterating that the president is in "excellent health."</p>

          <p>Five migrants deported from the United States are being held in solitary confinement in the southern African nation of Eswatini, according to a government spokesperson there. The men, convicted of serious crimes in the U.S., were sent to Eswatini under a Trump administration third-country removal program because their home countries would not accept them. This practice has drawn international condemnation due to the human rights records of destination countries like Eswatini, where reports of torture and unlawful killings exist. The terms of the agreement between the U.S. and Eswatini remain classified, and it is unclear how long the men will be detained.</p>

          <p>The UK Labour Party has once again suspended Diane Abbott, the longest-serving Black MP in the House of Commons. The suspension follows a recent interview where she stated she did not regret comments made in 2023 that led to her initial suspension. In the original remarks, she appeared to downplay antisemitism by comparing it to prejudice against redheads, though she later apologized. The article notes that given her lack of regret for the original comments, the party had little choice but to be consistent with its previous action. The move underscores leader Keir Starmer's rigid stance on antisemitism within the party.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers are facing record-high beef prices this summer, with the average cost of ground beef and steaks rising significantly compared to last year. The price surge is driven by a decades-long decline in the U.S. cattle herd, which is now at its smallest size since 1951. Factors contributing to the tight supply include persistent drought, high feed costs, and ranchers selling cattle to capitalize on high prices rather than breeding them. Additional pressures from a pest outbreak in Mexico halting cattle imports and the potential impact of tariffs on imported beef suggest that prices are unlikely to decrease significantly soon.

The issue has created a rift within his own base, with a majority of his supporters wanting the documents made public. The president's defensiveness is amplified by his past, well-documented friendship with Epstein. Recent developments, including the firing of a prosecutor who worked on the case and a report of a personal letter from Trump to Epstein, have only intensified public interest and fueled conspiracy theories, putting the administration in a difficult political position.</p>

The legal battle centered on Governor Ron DeSantis's dismantling of a North Florida district where Black voters consistently elected their candidate of choice. The court's majority, led by a DeSantis appointee, ruled that while the new map does reduce Black voters' electoral ability, it would be impossible to draw a compliant district without race being the predominant factor. Critics and dissenting justices warned that this decision significantly weakens the state's anti-gerrymandering protections and could make them unenforceable.</p>
