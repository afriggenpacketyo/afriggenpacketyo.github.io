          <p>Public and political pressure is mounting on the US Justice Department to release all unclassified files related to Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking network. The article discusses Donald Trump's past association with Epstein in the 1990s and the political implications, noting that some of his own supporters are demanding transparency as promised during his campaign. It also mentions the recent posthumous memoir by survivor Virginia Roberts Giuffre, which has intensified speculation about Epstein's client list and potential video evidence of abuse.</p>

          <p>A police search is ongoing for Hadush Kebatu, an Ethiopian asylum seeker who was erroneously released from HMP Chelmsford. Kebatu had been sentenced to 12 months for sexually assaulting a schoolgirl and was scheduled for deportation. The incident has drawn sharp criticism from political figures, with Justice Secretary David Lammy expressing outrage over the 'operational error.' The Prison Service has launched an investigation and suspended an officer while authorities work to locate Kebatu, who is believed to be in London.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the United States of 'fabricating a new war' following the deployment of the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier to the Caribbean. The US states the military buildup, which includes air strikes on suspected drug trafficking boats, is part of a counter-narcotics operation. However, the move has fueled fears in Venezuela that it is a prelude to military action aimed at regime change, a possibility President Trump has previously mentioned. Analysts suggest the show of force is intended to pressure Maduro and his inner circle.</p>

He is accused of drugging and assaulting at least 60 men, with some incidents dating back to 2018. After fleeing to Guatemala, Orla was extradited back to Santa Clara County. Victims reported passing out after sharing drinks with the suspect and waking up injured in his home, with police also finding video recordings of unconscious victims.

          <p>The US government shutdown is set to continue into its 25th day with no deal in sight, as Congress remains at an impasse. With federal workers missing paychecks, the Pentagon confirmed it has accepted a $130 million anonymous donation to help cover military salaries. President Trump identified the donor as 'a friend of mine' and a 'patriot.' Meanwhile, the House of Representatives has canceled votes for a fifth consecutive week, with lawmakers heading home and no progress reported on negotiations to reopen the government.

          <p>On the eve of early voting, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has endorsed fellow Democrat Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race. Jeffries cited Mamdani's focus on the affordability crisis and his commitment to being a mayor for all New Yorkers as reasons for his support. The endorsement is a significant boost for Mamdani, a Democratic socialist assemblyman, and helps unify the Democratic party ahead of the general election. The move comes a day after Mamdani's opponent, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, received the endorsement of outgoing Mayor Eric Adams.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is expected to rapidly intensify into a major hurricane over the weekend, posing a significant threat to Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. The National Hurricane Center has warned of 'life-threatening and catastrophic' flash flooding and landslides, with some areas potentially receiving up to three feet of rain. A hurricane warning is currently in effect for Jamaica. While the storm is not projected to have a major impact on the US mainland, its slow movement and strengthening winds are creating a dangerous situation for the Caribbean islands in its path.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's upcoming visit to South Korea for the APEC summit is being interpreted by experts as a 'symbolic restart' for diplomatic relations, which have been strained in recent years. While major immediate breakthroughs are not expected, the visit itself is a carefully calibrated move toward de-escalation and rebuilding trust. This will be Xi's first visit since 2014, a time that represented a high point in Beijing-Seoul relations and resulted in a free-trade agreement. The current talks are expected to navigate a more complex geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Pew Research Center reveals that the Latino population in the United States has grown to 68 million, nearly doubling since the year 2000. Latinos now constitute one-fifth of the total US population and accounted for over half of the nation's population growth during this period. The report highlights that this population is also young, with a median age of 31, and that a large majority (79%) are US citizens. People of Mexican origin remain the largest subgroup, while California and Texas host the largest state populations.</p>

          <p>Officers discharged their weapons at a U-Haul truck that was reversing toward a police line outside the US Coast Guard base in Alameda, California. The incident occurred during a day-long protest against a planned immigration enforcement surge in the Bay Area. According to the Coast Guard, the driver failed to comply with verbal commands to stop, and officers fired when the vehicle posed a direct threat. The driver, who was wounded, was later taken into custody for a mental health evaluation. The FBI is now leading the investigation into the shooting.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico are asking a US appeals court to block a Trump administration order that would force them to dissolve their joint venture by January 1. The partnership allows the airlines to coordinate flights and pricing between the US and Mexico. The Department of Transportation ordered the termination over concerns it creates an anti-competitive environment. The airlines argue the decision is 'arbitrary and capricious' and will cause severe disruption, potentially leading to canceled routes and eliminating up to $800 million in annual consumer benefits.
