          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced another brief air traffic control outage, lasting approximately 90 seconds, due to a telecommunications issue impacting communications and radar display at the Philadelphia TRACON Area C facility. This incident occurred less than 24 hours after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to overhaul the U.S. air traffic control system, which has been plagued by outdated equipment. United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby stated that Newark airport cannot handle the current flight schedule due to FAA staffing issues, leading to further flight reductions. The FAA maintains that Newark airspace remains safe, but the repeated outages have caused significant disruptions for travelers.</p>

          <p>According to a report by Der Spiegel, Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie, known as the "Butcher of Lyon," played a significant role in establishing a major South American drug cartel.

Barbie also advised Bolivian security services and helped set up a death squad for dictator Luis Garcia Meza.

          <p>Forest and fire officials in Washington state and Oregon are facing challenges in preparing for the upcoming wildfire season due to Trump administration funding cuts and the loss of federal workers. The biggest concern is a lack of clear communication from the federal government regarding resource availability. The Forest Service workforce was reduced in February, and while some workers have been rehired, the loss of experienced personnel has set back preparations. These cuts impact not just firefighters but also trail maintenance crews and biologists who support fire operations, potentially hindering efforts to combat wildfires effectively.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Real estate analysts are observing a 'striking' trend of lower turnover among apartment renters, with some of the largest landlords reporting turnover rates as low as 30% compared to the typical 50%. This phenomenon is attributed to an unaffordable for-sale market, limited rental supply on the coasts, economic anxieties, moving costs, and a shift towards suburban apartments. The reduced turnover allows landlords to secure better pricing on renewals and improves cash flow due to lower turnover costs. The article suggests that the rebounds of San Francisco and Seattle, driven by AI and tech companies, are also influencing this trend.</p>

          <p>The recent trade agreement between the U.S. and the U.K. signals that tariffs, particularly a 10% baseline, are likely to remain a key component of Trump's trade policy. While the deal offers some tariff-free exports for British steelmakers and the aluminum industry, most other goods will be subject to a 10% tariff. Analysts suggest that this deal indicates a willingness for the U.S. to make bespoke deals with individual nations, though the minimum tariff of 10% will be in effect for most nations.

          <p>Republicans are considering Medicaid spending cuts to advance President Trump's domestic agenda, but options are dwindling after House Speaker Mike Johnson ruled out significant changes to the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion. The remaining major cut involves limiting how states use a tax loophole to increase federal Medicaid spending, which would disproportionately affect poorer, Southern states that supported Trump in the 2024 election. These states could face budget shortfalls, potentially leading to reduced health insurance coverage or cuts to other essential services. The article underscores the complex political and economic considerations surrounding Medicaid reform and its potential impact on different states.</p>
