            <p>Asian and European markets experienced a significant rally following President Trump's decision to temporarily suspend planned tariffs on most American trading partners, excluding China. The Nikkei 225 in Japan rose by 9%, and the STOXX 600 index in Europe jumped by over 7%. While key Chinese markets also saw gains, Trump increased tariffs on Chinese goods to 125%, citing a "lack of respect" from Beijing. U.S. markets closed with major rebounds the previous day after the tariff pause announcement, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing 7.8%. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Prominent Chinese economists suggest that the escalating US-China trade war is becoming a test of long-term economic and industrial resilience for both nations. The economists emphasize the importance of government stimulus to boost domestic demand in China to navigate the turbulent economic environment. Zheng Yongnian from CUHK-Shenzhen argues that the competition between the US and China is now about economic resilience, with the goal of building a robust industrial system. As of now, the US has imposed a 125% tariff on Chinese imports, while China's levy on US goods has risen to 84%.</p>

            <p>Carjackings, especially of luxury vehicles, are on the rise in the United States, with stolen cars being shipped to international destinations to maximize profits and minimize the risk of getting caught. Washington, D.C., has seen the highest vehicle theft rate in the country, leading to undercover operations targeting repeat offenders. Stolen vehicles are often moved to ports in New York or New Jersey before being shipped to West Africa, where they become difficult to trace. Experts attribute the rise in carjackings to soft-on-crime policies and the potential for higher profits overseas.</p>

            <p>A deep dive into NBA injury data challenges the long-held belief that Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau runs his players into the ground, making them more prone to injury. Independent research suggests there's no clear or consistent pattern showing Thibodeau-coached players are more likely to get hurt than others. However, the analysis reveals a broader trend of rising injuries across the NBA, regardless of coaching style or playing time. The article highlights the importance of embracing depth to weather the increasing injury storm, even if Thibodeau's players arenâ€™t getting hurt more than others.</p>

            <p>Taiwan's immigration chief is retiring early amidst a backlash over stricter regulations concerning spouses from mainland China. The National Immigration Agency (NIA) faced criticism for enforcing a policy requiring mainland-born spouses to provide documentation proving they have abandoned their mainland nationality. Failure to comply could result in revocation of their Taiwan residence permits and household registration, forcing them to return to the mainland. Critics argue that this policy could harm thousands of families.</p>

            <p>The article discusses the current situation of Wrexham's star striker, Paul Mullin, who has had a delayed start to the season due to back surgery and missed chances. His performance has been below par compared to previous seasons, and new signings have taken his place in the starting lineup. Despite his past achievements, Mullin's current form and the arrival of new strikers have left him with limited playing time. With the arrival of new talent, Mullin has found it difficult to find a place in the starting lineup.</p>

            <p>China's consumer prices have declined for a second consecutive month, while producer price deflation has worsened, as Chinese exporters prepare for more challenges amid the escalating trade war with the U.S. The consumer price index (CPI) fell by 0.1% year-on-year in March, while producer prices dropped by 2.5%. Despite these deflationary pressures, core inflation rose by 0.5%. Economists anticipate a divergence between consumer and producer prices, with core consumer prices showing signs of recovery.

            <p>Chinese citizens are expressing firm support for Beijing's retaliatory measures against the US in the escalating tariff war, despite anticipating economic hardship. Unlike the previous trade war, there is a widespread consensus in China that the US is targeting the country unfairly. Many Chinese are voicing frustration and concern but also defiance, backing Beijing's commitment to fight "to the end". Beijing has imposed 84% tariffs on all US products and pledged to solve conflicts through equal and respectful dialogue.</p>
