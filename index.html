          <h2>Heavy Metal Icon Ozzy Osbourne Dies at 76</h2>

          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the iconic English singer and frontman for the pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath, has passed away at the age of 76. His family confirmed his death, noting he was surrounded by love at the time. Osbourne had publicly battled Parkinson's disease since 2019, and a series of health setbacks, including a major fall and subsequent spinal surgeries, had forced him to officially retire from touring in 2023. Known as the 'Prince of Darkness,' his influential career spanned over five decades, defining a genre with Black Sabbath and achieving massive success as a solo artist, later finding a new generation of fans through the hit reality show 'The Osbournes.' His legacy includes multiple Grammy awards and an induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia's lower house of parliament, the State Duma, has approved a controversial bill that imposes fines on internet users for searching for online content deemed "extremist" by authorities. The legislation, which drew criticism from both opposition figures and some pro-government voices, would levy fines up to 5,000 rubles. The government's list of extremist materials is extensive, including items like songs praising Ukraine and blog posts by the feminist rock band Pussy Riot. It remains unclear how authorities will enforce the law, particularly regarding whether internet service providers or websites will be responsible for monitoring user searches, raising significant concerns about digital freedom and privacy in the country.</p>

          <h2>Arsenal Nears Completion of Deal for Sporting Striker Viktor Gyokeres</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 14:38:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Premier League club Arsenal is reportedly on the verge of finalizing a deal to sign Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP for a reported £63.5 million. While personal terms have been agreed upon, negotiations over the structure of add-on payments have slightly delayed the official announcement. The signing addresses manager Mikel Arteta's long-standing search for an elite center-forward to bolster his team's attack. Gyokeres has been in high demand after an exceptional season with Sporting, where he scored 54 goals in 52 games, and his arrival is seen as a significant move to help Arsenal compete for top honors in the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. has finalized a significant trade and military deal with the Philippines, though Manila has not yet confirmed the agreement. According to Trump's social media post, the deal includes a 19% tariff on Philippine goods imported into the U.S., while American goods will face no tariffs. The announcement followed a White House meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who cited the need to modernize his country's military due to regional tensions. This development is part of Trump's broader strategy of using tariff letters to negotiate what he considers new bilateral trade deals with various nations, aiming to create more favorable terms for the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers considering a certificate of deposit (CD), a new analysis reveals that a $20,000 deposit earns substantially less interest today compared to the higher rates available one year ago. For example, a 3-year CD opened in 2024 at 5.75% would earn over $1,000 more than one opened in 2025 at a 4.15% rate. While the returns are still significant compared to the near-zero rates of the early 2020s, the decline highlights a shifting interest rate environment. The article suggests that with the potential for further rate cuts looming, the current moment may still represent a valuable opportunity for savers to lock in fixed, predictable returns before rates fall further.

Analysts point to the stock's characteristics as a meme stock target: it is a well-known legacy brand with a high short interest of about 50%. This high level of short selling can trigger a "short squeeze," where rising prices force short sellers to buy shares to cover their positions, further driving up the stock price.

Trump dismissed the focus on the Epstein case as a politically motivated "witch hunt" and nonsense, urging the media to investigate his claims against his predecessor instead.

Unlike previous plans, RAP offers loan forgiveness after 30 years, a longer timeline than the typical 20-25 years.

While the White House recently approved the transfer of Patriot anti-missile systems, it simultaneously gave Russia a 50-day window to negotiate before considering new sanctions, effectively allowing Moscow to continue its bombing campaign unimpeded. The author contends that this strategy of providing just enough aid to keep Ukraine fighting but not enough to win, combined with a perceived deference to Vladimir Putin, strings Ukraine along without offering a clear path to victory. This policy is framed as a strategic gift to Russia, undermining Ukrainian sovereignty and American interests.</p>

          <p>A passenger aboard a SkyWest flight described a harrowing moment when the aircraft made an aggressive, sharp turn to avoid a B-52 bomber near Minot, North Dakota. The passenger likened the force of the maneuver to a "sharp turn on a roller coaster." The commercial flight, with 76 passengers, was on approach when the bomber, part of a planned flyover for the state fair, appeared to be coming toward them. The SkyWest pilot, who was reportedly not notified of the military aircraft's presence, took evasive action to ensure safety. The Federal Aviation Administration is now investigating the incident to determine how close the two planes came to each other.</p>

          <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) discovered and seized nearly 300 pounds of methamphetamine cleverly concealed within a shipment of fake solar panels. The illicit cargo was destined for New Zealand before it was intercepted by authorities. This seizure is the latest example of creative smuggling methods encountered by CBP at LAX, which have previously included drugs disguised as dog shampoo and clothes soaked in methamphetamine. The agency highlighted the discovery on social media, underscoring their ongoing efforts to combat international drug trafficking and prevent dangerous substances from reaching their destinations, both domestic and abroad.</p>

          <p>The preliminary investigation into the deadly Jeju Air crash in South Korea has suggested pilot error as a contributing factor, drawing immediate and strong protests from victims' families and pilots' unions. The report found that after both engines sustained bird strikes, the pilots shut down the less-damaged engine just before the crash, which killed all but two of the 181 people on board. Critics accuse authorities of attempting to shift blame onto the deceased pilots to deflect from other potential causes, such as improperly designed airport structures. They are demanding the public release of the cockpit voice and flight data recorders to ensure a transparent and unbiased investigation.</p>

          <p>A 65-year-old British man from Essex has been found guilty of attempting to spy for Russia under the UK's National Security Act. Howard Phillips offered to provide personal information about former Defence Secretary Sir Grant Shapps to individuals he believed were Russian intelligence agents. In reality, the agents were undercover British officers. Phillips, who his ex-wife said was "infatuated" with espionage and dreamed of being like James Bond, met with the officers and offered his "100% loyalty and dedication" to a foreign power. His conviction highlights ongoing counter-espionage efforts by UK authorities to address threats from hostile states and protect national security.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in eight years, the number of working Americans with a side hustle is shrinking, according to a new Bankrate survey. The report shows that 27% of workers have a second income stream, a significant drop from 36% in 2024 and the lowest level recorded since 2017. Analysts attribute this decline to a solid job market and several years of wage growth outpacing inflation, which has eased some economic pressure on households. This shift suggests that fewer people feel the need to take on extra work to cover basic living expenses, a contrast to the post-pandemic period when side hustles peaked amid record-high inflation.

          <p>Bernice King, the daughter of civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., has publicly called on the White House to release the files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Her call for transparency came shortly after the Trump administration declassified and released 230,000 files concerning her father's 1968 assassination, a move her family had not requested and engaged with cautiously. On social media, King pointedly wrote, "Now, do the Epstein Files," highlighting what she and others see as a political double standard. The move puts further pressure on the administration, which has faced criticism from its own supporters for its handling of the Epstein case and its claims that no further credible evidence exists.</p>

CEO Mary Barra stated the company is working to "greatly reduce our tariff exposure" and adapt to new trade policies. The report underscores the substantial financial pressures that ongoing trade disputes are placing on the U.S. auto industry, even as major players like GM work to absorb the costs without directly raising consumer prices.

The program will provide an additional $20,000 for residential security and $5,000 for monitoring services through the end of the fiscal year. This decision follows several recent violent incidents, including the fatal shooting of a congressional intern in Washington, D.C., and the separate shootings of two Minnesota state lawmakers and their spouses.

          <p>The city of San Francisco is set to implement a ban on living in recreational vehicles (RVs) by imposing strict new citywide parking limits. The policy, championed by Mayor Daniel Lurie as part of a street "cleanup" initiative, will establish a two-hour parking limit for all oversized vehicles. The move targets at least 400 RVs that currently serve as homes for people unable to afford the city's high housing costs. While officials argue the policy is necessary for public health and safety, critics call it a cruel measure that displaces vulnerable residents without providing sufficient alternative housing, as funding has only been allocated to assist a small fraction of the affected households.</p>

          <p>This opinion article laments the announced cancellation of 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,' arguing it represents a significant blow to political comedy and cultural commentary. The author posits that while CBS cited financial reasons, the timing—just days after Colbert criticized parent company Paramount's settlement with Donald Trump—suggests the decision was a "convenient sacrifice" to protect a major corporate merger. The piece praises Colbert as the most adept late-night host at holding power to account, providing a necessary and morally clear voice during tumultuous times. His departure is seen as a loss of a major institutional platform capable of speaking truth to power with wit and authority.</p>
