        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A former Parachute Regiment soldier, identified as Soldier F, has been acquitted of murder and attempted murder charges stemming from Bloody Sunday in Londonderry over 50 years ago. The judge acknowledged that members of the regiment had shot unarmed civilians, displaying a total loss of military discipline, but found the evidence against Soldier F insufficient for conviction. This outcome has been met with profound disappointment by victims' families, who continue their resilient campaign for justice, while others, particularly veterans' supporters, welcomed the verdict. The complex legal and evidential issues underscore the deep, lingering pain from the 1972 event, prompting calls for new ways to address legacy cases and ensure accountability for historical atrocities.</p>

          <p>The search for a new head of the UK's national inquiry into child sexual assault by grooming gangs is expected to take months, following the withdrawal of two leading candidates. This development comes amid significant turmoil, with four members of the inquiry's survivors panel resigning and accusing Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips of "betrayal." The government, however, remains committed to keeping Phillips in her post, despite calls for her resignation from some survivor groups. The process highlights the immense difficulty in establishing trust and navigating the highly charged environment surrounding the inquiry, which aims to provide justice for victims repeatedly let down by state agencies.</p>

          <p>Hall of Fame basketball player Carmelo Anthony has voiced significant concerns about the increasing pressure sports gambling places on today's athletes, stating it "mentally affects" players. His comments follow recent FBI indictments detailing alleged illegal NBA betting schemes involving current and former players and coaches. Anthony, a 10-time NBA All-Star, believes the betting culture is profoundly "changing the narrative of the game" by altering how players are perceived based on their performance against specific betting lines. He anticipates significant consequences for those involved in the latest allegations, emphasizing the critical need for severe ramifications to address and uphold the integrity of the sport.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has formally endorsed former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the contentious race to replace him, just two days before early voting begins. This endorsement signifies a notable reconciliation between the two political figures, who had previously engaged in public disputes. Adams, having recently exited the mayoral race, strongly criticized Democratic nominee Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani's rent freeze promises, labeling him a "snake oil salesman" and an "existential threat" to the city's future. Cuomo, running as an independent, reinforced these views, characterizing Mamdani as a "socialist" and raising concerns about his experience and controversial stances on various community issues.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has announced her legal team's intention to ask a federal judge to dismiss the criminal charges filed against her. The core argument for this challenge is that the U.S. Attorney in Eastern Virginia, responsible for obtaining the indictment, was unlawfully appointed to their position. This strategic legal maneuver aims to invalidate the charges by directly questioning the legitimacy of the prosecutor's authority and the process. The article provides initial details of this developing story, highlighting a significant legal challenge that could have broader implications for the ongoing case against the high-profile Attorney General.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford Motor Company surpassed Wall Street's third-quarter earnings expectations but subsequently lowered its 2025 guidance, primarily attributing the adjustment to the disruptive impact of a recent supplier fire. The fire at an aluminum supplier plant is projected to cost Ford between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, significantly disrupting production of its highly profitable large trucks and SUVs. Despite this challenge, Ford plans to mitigate much of the financial impact by significantly increasing U.S. pickup truck production next year, which includes adding 1,000 workers to its Michigan and Kentucky plants. The company's CEO expressed confidence in accelerating efforts to restore overall plant production sooner than initially expected, aiming to recoup about half of the 100,000 units anticipated to be lost this year.

          <p>An article argues that Beijing's recent tightening of rare earth export controls is a direct and reasonable response to the Trump administration's escalating restrictions on Chinese companies and exports. The author contends that the U.S. should not be surprised by China's actions, as Washington provided both the blueprint and the rationale for such measures through its own aggressive tariff policies. The article cites a series of U.S. actions in September and October 2025, including blacklisting Chinese institutions, imposing new tariffs, and extending export controls, as triggers for China's retaliatory trade measures. This perspective frames the export controls as a predictable consequence within an ongoing trade war.</p>

Starbucks Workers United, representing 12,000 employees across 550 cafes, has held previous national strikes and continues to push for increased hours, higher take-home pay, and resolution of alleged "unfair labor practice charges." While the union claims Starbucks has refused to meet demands beyond non-economic proposals, Starbucks asserts it has engaged in nearly 200 hours of negotiations and that the union walked away.

          <p>Oil prices surged by over 5% after the Trump administration imposed additional sanctions on Russia's two largest crude companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated the sanctions were due to Moscow's "lack of serious commitment to a peace process to end the war in Ukraine" and aimed to harm the Kremlin's revenue. A White House official indicated the sanctions were linked to a failed meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin. This move also seeks to pressure countries like India to reduce their purchases of Russian oil, further escalating economic measures against Russia amidst ongoing geopolitical tensions and efforts to end the conflict.

This change impacts the team responsible for assessing product risks and ensuring global regulatory compliance, a unit established after Meta received a $5 billion FTC fine related to its Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal. While the cuts follow broader organizational restructurings, including layoffs in its AI unit, Meta clarified that its revamped risk management system relies on basic automation rather than advanced generative AI.

          <p>A website named “Expose Charlie’s Murderers,” launched shortly after conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination, has disappeared after allegedly collecting over $30,000 in cryptocurrency donations. The site promised to identify and shame Kirk's critics to initiate a "firing operation," claiming to work with Fortune 500 data scientists. Anonymous developers justified crypto donations by citing high operational costs and their own political operative reputations. However, the group, which later rebranded as the Charlie Kirk Data Foundation, stopped posting on social media and is now facing accusations of scamming MAGA supporters. The incident highlights exploitation of tragedy and the risks associated with anonymous online fundraising.</p>

Despite Rohl's emphasis on speed and intensity, the team displayed the same issues seen under previous managers. The article points to an £8 million striker's poor performance as a "red flag" and questions the club's investment strategy.

          <p>The price of gold recently experienced a significant 6% drop, its largest single-day decline in over a decade, prompting questions about investment opportunities. This article suggests that most gold types, including those sold by major retailers like Costco, are worth considering for purchase during this dip. Costco offers a convenient and potentially trustworthy path for shoppers to invest in physical bullion, which can be easily sold for profit without shipping costs for members. Historically, gold price dips are often temporary, making the current lower price an attractive entry point for investors. However, gold sales from the retailer are final, requiring careful consideration before purchase. (not investment advice)</p>

Industry analysts suggest that without these credits, EV sales will falter as the market becomes saturated and vehicles remain expensive.
