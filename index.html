          <p>Generative AI models from Google and OpenAI achieved gold-level scores for the first time at the International Mathematical Olympiad, a prestigious competition for young mathematicians. While five human contestants still attained perfect scores, Google's Gemini chatbot and OpenAI's experimental reasoning model each impressively solved enough problems to earn 35 out of 42 points, a gold medal equivalent. This marks a significant leap in AI's mathematical reasoning, with Google's model solving problems within the 4.5-hour time limit, a substantial improvement from the previous year. The rapid advancement suggests AI could reach human-level cognitive abilities within a decade, prompting discussions on its exponential progress.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department's second-highest official, Todd Blanche, announced plans to meet with Ghislaine Maxwell, a convicted associate of Jeffrey Epstein, to gather information on the case. This outreach follows Attorney General Pam Bondi's directive and comes as a House panel seeks to subpoena Maxwell for a deposition. The DOJ and FBI previously concluded Epstein died by suicide and had no "client list," but President Trump has called for all credible evidence to be released. Maxwell, serving a 20-year sentence for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom, and abuse underage girls, is reportedly willing to testify truthfully.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson initiated an early August recess for the House of Representatives, aiming to prevent Republicans from being forced into politically charged votes on Democratic-backed motions concerning the release of Jeffrey Epstein files. Johnson stated there was "no purpose" for Congress to push the administration on actions it was already undertaking, labeling the legislative efforts as "political games." This decision comes amidst strong backlash against the Trump administration's initial stance on the Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell case files. In response, the Department of Justice, under Attorney General Pam Bondi, has since requested federal judges to unseal grand jury transcripts, and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche is actively pursuing a meeting with Maxwell for further information.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Target is discontinuing its 12-year-old policy that allowed customers to price match against Amazon and Walmart, effective July 28. Previously, shoppers could request a price adjustment if they found an identical item cheaper at these rival retailers within 14 days of purchase. The company explained the change by stating that "guests overwhelmingly price match Target and not other retailers." This strategic decision comes as Target grapples with declining sales and store traffic, having reported a nearly 3% drop in first-quarter sales. The retailer attributes these struggles to an "exceptionally challenging environment," including declining consumer confidence and uncertainties surrounding tariffs.</p>

          <p>A five-day doctor strike organized by the British Medical Association (BMA) is set to proceed in England starting Friday, after negotiations between the government and the union failed to reach a compromise. While talks were constructive on non-pay issues like mandatory exam fees and training placements, the BMA stated that the core issue of "pay restoration" was not adequately addressed. Health Secretary Wes Streeting had urged postponement of the strike to continue talks, but the BMA maintains that the offered terms were insufficient. The union also warns that NHS England's plan to minimize routine treatment cancellations during the strike could risk patient harm by overstretching senior doctors.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has appointed Sir James Cleverly as her shadow housing secretary, a key move in a significant reshuffle of her senior team. This new position places Cleverly, a former foreign and home secretary, in direct parliamentary opposition to Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. The broader shake-up, which involves around half a dozen changes, is intended to signal the party's policy renewal and reinforce unity under Badenoch's leadership. This strategic adjustment occurs eight months into Badenoch's tenure, a period during which the Conservatives have consistently ranked low in polls and experienced considerable losses in recent local elections.</p>

          <p>A four-year-old child was attacked by a mountain lion while hiking with family on Hurricane Ridge in Washington state's Olympic National Park. The child's father is being hailed as a hero for his swift intervention, pulling the child from the creature's jaws and likely saving their life. Emergency crews airlifted the injured child to a Seattle trauma center, and the child has since been discharged in satisfactory condition. Following the incident, park rangers tracked and euthanized the collared cougar responsible. While harrowing, mountain lion attacks on humans are extremely rare in North America, with only two fatalities in Washington state over the past century.</p>

          <p>The High Court has ruled that the estate of the late tech tycoon Mike Lynch and his business partner must pay Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) £700 million. This decision follows HPE's 2011 acquisition of Lynch's tech firm, Autonomy, which HPE claimed was based on misrepresented financial information. The court determined that HPE had overpaid for the company due to inaccurate financial reporting. Mike Lynch tragically died last year when his yacht sank, and the ruling was delayed due to this event. Despite the ruling against him, the judge expressed admiration for Lynch. HPE stated it looks forward to the final determination of its damages.</p>

          <p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described the destruction and humanitarian crisis in Gaza as a "horror show," unprecedented in recent times, with "devastation layered upon devastation." The UN reported over 1,000 Palestinians killed trying to access food aid since the US and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation began operations. While Israel states it facilitates aid, it accuses Hamas of theft, which Hamas denies. International pressure is mounting, with French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot strongly condemning Israel's expanding military operations and demanding access for foreign media. The WHO also reported Israeli forces storming its facilities, compromising health responses.</p>

Since Israel imposed a full blockade on March 2, the quantity of aid allowed in has been vastly insufficient, leading to severe shortages for over two million inhabitants. The controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, backed by the Trump administration, has seen over 1,000 people killed near its aid sites.</p>

The article argues that while political factors may be plausible, the show's significant financial losses (reportedly $40 million annually) and the broader shift in media consumption towards niche, partisan audiences are more fundamental reasons.

          <p>This article clarifies the concept of credit card grace periods, explaining that most cards offer a grace period on new purchases, allowing cardholders to avoid interest if the full balance is paid by the due date. However, it emphasizes that there is generally no mandated grace period for late payments; once the due date passes, late fees, penalty APRs, and credit score damage can occur. The article advises contacting the credit card company immediately if a payment will be missed, making a partial payment if possible, and setting up automatic payments to prevent the issue in the future.

CEO Mary Barra stated the automaker is working to "greatly reduce its tariff exposure" through manufacturing adjustments and cost initiatives. The company anticipates a total tariff hit of $4 billion to $5 billion for the year, with the second half more exposed. GM's North America margin decreased significantly, but the company is making progress on mitigating costs. While EV sales were 46,300 for the quarter, GM expects slower demand after tax credit expirations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new Harvard University study, published in Science Advances, suggests that the odds of having all boys or all girls are not a straight 50/50 chance. Analyzing 58,007 women's birthing records, researchers found that families with at least three children tend to follow a "weighted coin toss," indicating a distinct tendency toward one gender. For instance, if the first two children are girls, the probability of the third also being a girl is higher, a pattern continuing with subsequent births. While the exact mechanism is uncertain, the study points to factors like maternal age at first birth potentially influencing these sex clustering patterns within families.</p>

          <p>Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU-PF party is advancing a motion to further criminalize government critics, advocating for a comprehensive strategy to promote patriotism and national identity. This includes formalizing a national ideology and integrating "patriotic" education. The move builds upon the controversial Patriotic Act of 2023, which already criminalizes criticism on issues like healthcare and accountability, with potential penalties including life imprisonment or death. Opposition lawmakers and human rights groups strongly condemn these efforts, arguing that patriotism cannot be legislated and that such laws are designed to silence dissent and enforce a one-party state, undermining constitutional freedoms.</p>

The punishment stems from alleged breaches of multi-club ownership rules, as American businessman John Textor holds stakes in both Crystal Palace and Lyon, which also qualified for the Europa League. UEFA rules prohibit clubs influenced by the same entity from competing in the same European competition. Palace missed a March 1 deadline for ownership restructuring and argues Textor does not hold decisive influence.

The article traces Trump's consistent pattern of advocating for low rates under Republican presidents and high rates under Democratic ones, regardless of economic conditions.
