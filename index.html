          <p>A shooting at the Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire, resulted in one fatality and two individuals with gunshot wounds, alongside several other minor injuries. The suspect, identified as a 23-year-old former employee of the club, was arrested within 30 minutes of the incident. Authorities have charged him with second-degree murder and stated that there is no known connection between him and the victims, with a motive still under investigation. The article highlights the heroic actions of patrons who intervened, potentially preventing further casualties during the brief but violent event.</p>

          <p>Sir Nick Clegg, the former Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has described Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump as cringeworthy and embarrassing. Speaking at the Liberal Democrat conference, Clegg argued that the UK government's "endless knee-bending" to the unpredictable American president is a miscalculation. He urged the prime minister to more assertively "speak up" for British values and cautioned against over-reliance on the U.S., suggesting that the UK will eventually have to choose between its relationships with the U.S. and the European Union.</p>

          <p>British Member of Parliament Zarah Sultana has announced she is seeking to reconcile with former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn following a public dispute over the formation of a new left-wing political party. Sultana stated she would no longer pursue legal action after alleging she was sidelined by a "sexist boys' club" within the new organization. The conflict escalated after Sultana promoted a membership drive that Corbyn and other founders later disavowed as "unauthorized." Despite the internal turmoil, both parties have expressed a desire to move forward and proceed with the party's inaugural conference.</p>

          <p>Speaking at a large memorial service in Arizona, Christian author Frank Turek gave an emotional account of the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. Turek, who described Kirk as being "like a son to me," was just 25 feet away when Kirk was fatally shot at Utah Valley University. He recounted the immediate aftermath inside an SUV where first aid was attempted, confirming that Kirk died instantly and without pain. Turek also spoke of his role as Kirk's spiritual mentor, emphasizing that Kirk's place in heaven is due to his faith rather than his worldly achievements.</p>

          <p>Apple has taken full control of the core silicon in its new iPhone Air, introducing a suite of custom chips designed to significantly boost its artificial intelligence capabilities. The new A19 Pro chip features a major architectural change with neural accelerators on each GPU core, while the N1 wireless chip and C1X modem mark a strategic shift away from suppliers like Broadcom and Qualcomm. This vertical integration allows Apple to enhance performance, improve power efficiency, and prioritize user privacy by processing more AI tasks directly on the device.

          <p>President Donald Trump has openly called for Attorney General Pam Bondi to launch investigations into his political adversaries, including former FBI Director James Comey and Democratic Senator Adam Schiff. In a social media post, Trump expressed frustration that "nothing is being done" and stated that the delay is damaging the nation's reputation. This direct presidential pressure on the Department of Justice has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer warning that such actions are "the path to a dictatorship." The move tests the traditional independence of the Justice Department from political influence.</p>

          <p>According to a prominent Chinese analyst, Beijing is contemplating the construction of a science laboratory at the Scarborough Shoal, a territory contested by the Philippines in the South China Sea. Wu Shicun, president of the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, suggested the facility could host international experts for coral reef and fisheries research. This potential development has been condemned by the Philippines as an "illegitimate and unlawful" move within its exclusive economic zone. The proposal underscores the ongoing territorial tensions and China's strategy of reinforcing its claims in the region through civilian and scientific infrastructure.</p>

          <p>An ABC-affiliated television station in Sacramento, California, was struck by gunfire in what police have classified as a drive-by shooting.

After being released on bail, the same suspect was taken back into custody by the FBI on a federal charge of interfering with a radio communications station.

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, along with tech executives Larry Ellison and Michael Dell, are likely involved in a group of investors seeking to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations.

Trump described the potential investors as "American patriots" who would do a "really good job."

He expressed hope that Trump and Kim could resume negotiations, which broke down in 2019, believing their mutual trust could benefit regional stability.

City's possession dropped to a record low for a Guardiola-managed team, reflecting a strategy to absorb pressure due to player fatigue from a packed schedule.

Harris wrote that asking America to accept a Black woman and a gay man on the same ticket was too great of a political risk. In response, Buttigieg stated that he believes in giving "Americans more credit" and that politics should focus on results for voters rather than identity. The revelation has sparked online discussion about political realism versus idealism and the perceived electability of diverse candidates in the current American political climate.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, currently located in the western Pacific Ocean, has become the most powerful storm of 2025, reaching sustained wind speeds of 270 km/h. This intensity makes it a Category 5-equivalent storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The storm's immense strength is attributed to ideal conditions, including very warm sea surface temperatures near 30°C and a lack of wind shear. While not a direct threat to North America, the typhoon is expected to maintain its peak intensity before gradually weakening as it moves towards the South China Sea, brushing past the Philippines.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Leading Democrats, including Senator Chuck Schumer, have issued stark warnings that President Trump's actions against his political opponents are moving the United States toward a dictatorship. These concerns were amplified by Trump's public call for the Justice Department to prosecute his critics and the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show by ABC following pressure from federal regulators. Critics argue these moves represent an authoritarian effort to use the full power of the federal government to silence dissent. The events have intensified the national debate over the politicization of government institutions and the protection of free speech.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent online discussion, doctors and other medical professionals identified and debunked numerous persistent medical myths that are still widely believed in the U.S. Among the misconceptions addressed were the ideas that vaccines are inherently harmful, that "natural" supplements are always safer than proven medications, and that urine is sterile. The professionals also tackled outdated advice, such as the belief that nuts and seeds cause diverticulitis. The discussion highlights a significant gap in public health literacy and the challenges medical experts face in combating misinformation, especially regarding sensitive topics like end-of-life care and childbirth.</p>

          <p>Protests have erupted across all 26 states of Brazil against legislative efforts that could grant a pardon to former President Jair Bolsonaro and his allies convicted of attempting a coup. The demonstrations were sparked by the lower house fast-tracking a bill that could provide amnesty for those involved in the January 2023 uprising. Bolsonaro was recently sentenced to 27 years in prison for his role in the plot to overturn the 2022 election results. Prominent cultural figures, including legendary musicians Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil, joined the protests to oppose what they see as an attempt to shield politicians from justice.</p>

          <p>Sharifeh Mohammadi, a 46-year-old Iranian engineer and labor rights activist, has been sentenced to death for a third time on charges of "armed rebellion against the state." Her case has drawn international condemnation from human rights organizations and trade unions, who call it a politically motivated trial with serious procedural flaws. Mohammadi was arrested in 2023 for her union activities, which the government considers an "opposition group." Legal experts note that the vague wording of Iranian laws allows authorities to apply capital punishment to a wide range of political and civil activities, effectively suppressing dissent.</p>

          <p>The mother of a freed British-Israeli hostage has strongly criticized the UK government's decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state, calling it a reward for Hamas. Mandy Damari, whose daughter Emily was held captive for 15 months, argued the move is inappropriate while hostages remain in Gaza and Hamas is still in power. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has defended the decision as a necessary step to revive the two-state solution, insisting it is not a reward for the terrorist group. The criticism from a hostage family highlights the deep and personal divisions surrounding the diplomatic move.</p>

          <p>According to sources, the Department of Justice under the Trump administration shut down a public corruption investigation into Tom Homan, the president's "border czar." The probe allegedly involved an FBI sting operation where Homan was recorded accepting a bag containing $50,000 in cash from undercover agents posing as executives seeking future government contracts. The investigation, which began under the previous administration, was closed after internal discussions, raising concerns among some officials about the politicization of the Justice Department. The White House has criticized the probe as politically motivated and stated that no evidence of wrongdoing was found.</p>

          <p>Gary Cohn, who served as National Economic Council director during President Trump's first term, has stated that the U.S. job market is degrading. Citing a slowdown in job creation from over 100,000 to less than 50,000 per month, Cohn noted that companies are aggressively managing expenses by cutting labor costs. He argued that this trend, observed across various sectors, prompted the Federal Reserve's recent decision to lower its benchmark interest rate. Cohn believes companies have shifted from hoarding labor post-COVID to now allowing their workforces to decline through natural attrition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has seemingly dismissed the severity of new Pentagon restrictions that require journalists to pledge not to gather any information not officially authorized for release. When asked about the directive, Trump stated, "Nothing stops reporters," and indicated he did not believe the Pentagon should have ultimate control over what journalists can report. The new policy, implemented by Trump's Department of War Secretary Pete Hegseth, has been condemned by press freedom advocates as a direct assault on independent journalism and a form of prior restraint. Hegseth has defended the rules as necessary for security within the Pentagon.</p>
