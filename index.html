          <p>This article discusses the potential changes to the SALT (state and local taxes) deduction in President Trump's tax package.  Experts suggest that higher earners would benefit most from raising the SALT cap, currently set at $10,000. Lawmakers from high-tax states are pushing for reform, and while a complete repeal seems unlikely, a higher limit is possible. The article explores the potential impact on various income groups.</p>
