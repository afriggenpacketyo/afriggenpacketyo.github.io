          <p>Authorities have arrested a second suspect in Miami, believed to be an accomplice in the theft of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's purse, which occurred while she was dining with her family in Washington D.C. The primary suspect, an illegal immigrant with a criminal history, was previously arrested and charged with robbery. Noem expressed gratitude to law enforcement for their swift action and emphasized the importance of removing criminal aliens from the streets, while a retired NYPD inspector suggested the theft was opportunistic rather than targeted. The incident involved the theft of a Louis Vuitton bag containing cash, identification, and other personal items.</p>

          <p>Global military spending reached a new peak in 2024, exceeding $2.7 trillion, marking a 9.4% increase from the previous year. This surge is attributed to ongoing conflicts, particularly in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip, with significant increases observed in Europe and the Middle East. Germany has become the fourth-largest military spender globally, driven by a special fund for the Bundeswehr, while other European nations like Poland and Sweden also significantly increased their defense budgets. The United States remains the top military spender, focusing on modernizing its capabilities to maintain a strategic advantage over Russia and China, signaling a potential arms race in Asia.</p>

          <p>Two 18th-century shipwrecks discovered off the coast of Costa Rica have been identified as Danish slave ships, the Fridericus Quartus and Christianus Quintus, which sank in 1710. Investigations of ship timbers, bricks, and clay pipes confirmed the ships' identities, dispelling previous assumptions that they were pirate vessels. The Fridericus Quartus was set on fire, while the Christianus Quintus wrecked in the surf. The discovery, part of the National Museum of Denmark's research center, provides valuable insight into the history of the transatlantic slave trade and Denmark's involvement.</p>

          <p>A recent report by a leading health think tank reveals that urgent and emergency care services in England are performing significantly worse than before the pandemic.

While flu cases were higher than usual, the report argues that blaming external factors provides a false sense of comfort and that the NHS needs to address underlying issues to avoid annual winter crises. The report serves as a wake-up call for the government to prioritize long-term solutions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has been accused of removing a two-year-old US citizen to Honduras along with her deported mother, allegedly without due process. In a separate case, a Cuban-born mother of a one-year-old girl, who is also the wife of a US citizen, was deported to Cuba, separating her from her child. These actions have drawn criticism from civil rights organizations, who claim they violate ICE's own directives regarding the care of minor children during deportations.

          <p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly accused Ronen Bar, the head of Israel's domestic security agency, Shin Bet, of lying to the Supreme Court amidst a legal battle over Netanyahu's attempt to dismiss him. Netanyahu submitted an affidavit rebutting allegations made by Bar, who claimed his removal stemmed from a lack of personal loyalty rather than professional considerations. The accusations are part of a case brought by watchdog organizations against Netanyahu's decision to oust Bar.</p>
