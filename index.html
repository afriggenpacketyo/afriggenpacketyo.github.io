          <p>Sir Richard Knighton, the current head of the Royal Air Force, is reportedly set to become the next Chief of the Defence Staff, the most senior military officer in the UK. He will succeed Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, who has held the position since November 2021, and is expected to oversee significant reforms aimed at strengthening the UK's defense capabilities. An official announcement is anticipated in the coming days, pending Royal approval, marking a pivotal shift in the leadership of the British armed forces. Knighton's appointment signals a renewed focus on modernizing and adapting the UK's defense strategy to address evolving global security challenges. The transition is expected to be seamless, ensuring continuity in the UK's defense policies and operations.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Toyota Industries' shares experienced a significant drop after the Toyota Group announced a $33 billion deal to take the company private, highlighting concerns about unwinding cross-shareholding ties. This move comes amid increasing pressure on Japanese firms from regulators and investors to reduce these long-standing arrangements. The deal involves a tender offer of $26 billion for shares of Toyota Industries at a price lower than the previous day's closing value. The Toyota Group plans to establish a new holding company, with investments from various entities, including Toyota Motor and its chairman, Akio Toyoda, with financing backed by loans from major banks. This strategic shift reflects broader efforts to improve corporate governance and shareholder value within the Toyota Group.</p>

          <p>Bernie Sanders, speaking from London, argues that Trump's success stems from recognizing the failures of the American system for working-class people, albeit with flawed solutions. He criticizes the Democratic Party for lacking a compelling message for working people, focusing too much on the status quo rather than addressing economic inequalities. Sanders emphasizes the need to confront the billionaire class, ensure healthcare for all, and invest in affordable childcare and education. He also expresses concern over the increasing authoritarian tendencies in American politics, particularly the influence of money in elections and the erosion of critical voices. The overall tone of the article is critical of the current political landscape, but Sanders maintains hope for a grassroots movement focused on economic justice.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Karen Read's defense team's decision to keep her from testifying in her murder trial is a risky move, especially after the prosecution played damaging interview clips. Legal experts are divided on whether this strategy will help or hurt her case, as it prevents her from providing her own explanations but also avoids potentially damaging cross-examination. The defense stresses that the jury cannot hold her silence against her, as she has the right not to testify and is presumed innocent. The prosecution used clips from Read's televised interviews to highlight inconsistencies and potentially unfavorable statements, creating a new obstacle for the defense, as these videos were not presented in the first trial. The success of this strategy will only be known when the jury delivers its verdict.</p>

          <p>China's Tiandu-1 satellite has achieved a 3:1 resonant orbit, synchronizing with the Earth and moon's motion, but claims of being the first to do so are disputed by US and Canadian experts. This orbit is seen as crucial for lunar infrastructure, including navigation systems needed for interplanetary exploration. The Deep Space Exploration Laboratory states that Tiandu-1 successfully transitioned into this orbit after a key maneuver on May 22. Experts argue that NASA's IBEX probe, launched in 2008, achieved a similar orbit in 2011, making Tiandu-1's claim debatable, however, the feat is still an accomplishment for the Chinese space program.</p>

          <p>Japan's only seal sanctuary, the Okhotsk Tokkari Center in Mombetsu, Hokkaido, focuses on rescuing and rehabilitating injured or weakened seals for release back into the wild. To avoid emotional attachment, staff members refrain from naming the seals or having direct contact with them, but despite these efforts, bonds inevitably form. The center has helped over 200 seals since its establishment in the 1980s, when seals were viewed as pests. The center faces challenges such as declining seal populations due to habitat loss from melting drift ice, highlighting the importance of their conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>The US has increased tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum imports to 50%, a move criticized by trading partners but defended by Donald Trump as necessary to revitalize American industry. This increase applies to all countries except Britain, which has a preliminary trade agreement with the US. Canada and Mexico, major steel exporters to the US, will be significantly impacted, with both countries expressing concerns and seeking exemptions. EU officials are also hoping for an exemption, although immediate retaliation is unlikely due to ongoing trade talks.

          <p>Australia's economy grew by 1.3% year-on-year in the first quarter, missing estimates due to shrinking public spending, weakened consumer demand, and reduced exports. The quarter-on-quarter growth was only 0.2%, also below expectations, with extreme weather events impacting mining, tourism, and shipping. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) had previously cut rates to 3.85% to stimulate growth amid global trade tensions.

          <p>The United States and China have shifted from battling over tariffs to a potentially more damaging strategy: controlling global supply chains. This new approach involves flexing their influence over critical resources and technologies, creating a complex and uncertain environment for international trade. The shift marks a significant escalation in the economic rivalry between the two nations, with implications for businesses and consumers worldwide. The focus on supply chains underscores the strategic importance of controlling key industries and resources in the global economy.</p>

          <p>China is increasing enforcement of export controls on critical minerals as it seeks to maintain its dominance in global supplies amid rising pressure from the United States. Regions rich in these minerals, such as Guangxi, Guizhou, and Hunan, are intensifying inspections and cracking down on illegal mining operations. This effort aligns with Beijing's directive for tighter control over strategic mineral exports, requiring companies to obtain regulatory approvals before shipping minerals overseas. These moves come as tensions between China and the US persist, particularly regarding technology restrictions and trade policies.</p>

Commercial satellite imagery indicates the warship is upright for the first time since the May 21 incident, according to the 38 North program. Following the accident, several officials were reportedly detained, and Kim Jong Un ordered the ship to be restored before a party meeting this month. The Chongjin shipyard, primarily used for cargo and fishing vessels, may lack the necessary infrastructure to fully repair the warship.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese scientists have been charged with smuggling Fusarium graminearum, a toxic fungus, into the United States, with plans to research it at an American university. The fungus, classified as a potential agroterrorism weapon, causes head blight in crops and can lead to vomiting, liver damage, and reproductive defects in humans and livestock. One of the scientists was previously turned away at the Detroit airport after inconsistencies arose during questioning about red plant material in his backpack.
