            <p>A 50-foot gray whale was found dead in Huntington Beach, marking another in a series of whale deaths in the region. A necropsy revealed no signs of physical injury, and samples have been sent to a lab for testing. Scientists are investigating the cause of the increased whale deaths, with some suspecting malnutrition. Researchers have also noted a decline in the number of whales migrating north this spring.</p>
