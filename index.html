            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced new NIH studies to investigate environmental factors contributing to the rise in autism diagnoses, which now affect 1 in 31 children according to a recent CDC report. Kennedy disputes the notion that increased awareness and broadened diagnostic criteria fully explain the surge, emphasizing the need to explore potential environmental toxins like mold, food, and pesticides. Experts acknowledge the increase but attribute much of it to changes in diagnostic practices and genetic factors, with some criticizing Kennedy's claims as misrepresenting the reality of autism for many families. Autism Speaks has also released a statement calling Kennedy's comments "extremely disappointing and damaging."</p>

            <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has expressed concerns that President Trump's tariffs could create a "challenging scenario" for the Fed, potentially leading to both accelerating inflation and a slowing economy. Powell reiterated that the tariffs are larger than anticipated and will likely result in higher prices and slower growth. While the Fed plans to remain patient, Powell acknowledged the potential for inflation to be more persistent than initially expected, though some Fed officials disagree on the severity and impact of tariffs on the economy. Recent economic reports suggest a solid economy, but consumer and business confidence have declined. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Emily Ley, owner of Simplified, a stationery business in Florida, has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration over tariffs on Chinese goods. Ley argues that the tariffs, which have cost her company nearly $1.2 million since Trump's first term, threaten the viability of her business. She claims that the tariffs, enacted without Congressional approval, bypass voter representation and force her to consider reducing salaries or eliminating positions. While the White House argues the tariffs represent short-term pain for long-term gain, Ley contends that her business cannot survive the current economic climate.</p>

The goal is to provide faster and more convenient care within local communities, diverting an estimated two million people from hospitals by the end of 2025/26.

The Trump administration denies violating the order, citing the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, while Boasberg has given the government an opportunity to "purge" its contempt by taking the migrants back into U.S. custody.</p>

While the detection is not yet conclusive, the team hopes to obtain clinching evidence soon, which could indicate that life is common in the galaxy.

            <p>Court documents reveal that Jennifer Vasquez Sura, the wife of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, had a temporary order of protection against him in 2021, citing allegations of domestic violence. Vasquez Sura claimed Abrego Garcia punched and scratched her, ripped her clothing, and detained her against her will. However, she later stated that they worked through the situation privately and that Abrego Garcia has always been a loving partner and father. Abrego Garcia is currently incarcerated in an El Salvador mega-prison after being mistakenly deported despite a court order barring his deportation.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that for the purposes of British law, a woman is defined by biological sex. The ruling has been described as an 'historic victory' by some campaigners. The court's decision is expected to lead to changes across single-sex spaces, including NHS wards, and elite sport. The court has been asked to rewrite the laws on gender recognition.</p>

This intervention is not isolated, as Leapmotor previously scrapped plans to produce EVs in Poland in favor of factories in Germany and Slovakia after China urged EV makers to halt investments in countries that supported extra tariffs on Chinese-made EVs.</p>

            <p>MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, an election denier, claims he is financially ruined and unable to pay the $50,000+ in sanctions owed to Smartmatic. Lindell blamed "lawfare" for his financial difficulties, stating he had to lay off hundreds of employees, lost warehouse units, and owes millions to the IRS. A judge gave Lindell until Friday to file financial statements to prove his claims. Smartmatic's attorney expressed a preference for a lump sum payment but acknowledged respecting the judge's ruling.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has proposed a rule to redefine "harm" under the Endangered Species Act, limiting it to direct actions that kill or injure endangered species, potentially weakening protections against habitat destruction. Conservationists argue this change would undermine the act and a 1995 Supreme Court ruling, allowing for more development and resource extraction on public lands. The proposed rule triggers a 30-day public comment period, after which a final rule could be issued. Conservation groups have vowed to challenge the change in court.</p>

He argues that consumers are already resistant to high prices and that companies risk losing sales if they don't lower them. Cramer suggests that companies are afraid to "take the hit" and lower prices due to concerns about gross margins, but the only alternative to declining margins might be mergers to create new cost-cutting opportunities.
