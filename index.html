          <p>Former President Donald Trump publicly praised actress Sydney Sweeney, calling her American Eagle jeans ad campaign 'hottest out there' after reports surfaced of her being a registered Republican. Trump's comments, shared on his social media platform, linked Sweeney's political affiliation to his approval of the ad, stating 'Being WOKE is for losers, being Republican is what you want to be.' The campaign, which plays on 'jeans' and 'genes,' has drawn criticism for alleged eugenics promotion and hypersexualization, though American Eagle maintains it's solely about denim. This highlights the intersection of celebrity, politics, and marketing in contemporary discourse.</p>

          <p>A Minke whale died in New Jersey's Barnegat Bay after reportedly charging at a 21-foot boat, causing a passenger to be thrown overboard. The incident occurred near the inlet, with no injuries reported among the boat's occupants. Marine Mammal Stranding Center and New Jersey State Police responded, confirming the whale's death. Crews were unable to access the whale on a shallow sandbar for immediate examination, and it will be towed to a state park for a necropsy to determine the cause of death.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of American Eagle surged 20% following former President Donald Trump's public praise for the retailer's 'Sydney Sweeney has great jeans' advertising campaign. Trump's social media post, which also noted Sweeney's Republican registration, spurred the stock's rebound after a recent slump caused by criticism over the ad's perceived double entendre and hypersexualization. This event underscores the complex tightrope marketers walk in a polarized cultural landscape, where celebrity endorsements and political alignments can significantly impact brand perception and market performance. The campaign has generated substantial search interest for American Eagle, though its long-term sales impact remains to be seen. (not investment advice)</p>

Noem emphasized that these facilities, strategically located near airports for efficient deportations, offer a cost-effective alternative to current for-profit contracts, despite a higher per-bed cost than the reported average. However, the Florida site has faced legal challenges and claims of inhumane conditions, raising questions about the legality and treatment of detainees in state-run immigration facilities.</p>

          <p>Former Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioners and non-partisan economic groups have strongly criticized President Donald Trump's abrupt firing of BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. The dismissal followed a weaker-than-expected July jobs report and Trump's unsubstantiated claims that the data was 'rigged' to undermine his administration. Critics argue that the firing is without merit, sets a dangerous precedent, and undermines the nonpartisan integrity and credibility of federal economic statistics, which are vital for informed decision-making. They have called on Congress to investigate the removal and ensure the position's independence.</p>

          <p>The 60% reverse mortgage rule, introduced by the FHA in 2013, limits how much of a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) a borrower can access in the first year. This guideline, designed to protect seniors from rapidly depleting their home equity, caps initial withdrawals at 60% of total loan proceeds, unless more is needed to pay off existing mandatory obligations like a mortgage. While promoting long-term financial sustainability, the rule can pose challenges for those needing immediate large sums for expenses like healthcare or home improvements.

          <p>Two men have appeared in court charged in connection with the alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl in Nuneaton, UK. Ahmad Mulakhil faces two sexual assault charges, while Mohammad Kabir is accused of kidnap, strangulation, and aiding and abetting. The case has sparked controversy after a local council leader alleged the men were asylum seekers, accusing police and the Home Office of a cover-up regarding their immigration status. Authorities have stated they follow national guidance not to disclose ethnicity or immigration status, emphasizing that legal proceedings are active and justice will be delivered.</p>

          <p>Congresswoman Nancy Mace, previously a moderate Republican and Trump critic, has officially launched her bid for South Carolina governor, now identifying as a 'super Maga governor.' Her campaign video heavily features her pro-Trump credentials, including a clip of the former president calling her a 'fighter.' Mace's platform includes a 'zero-tolerance approach to crime,' eliminating state income tax, and opposing 'radical gender agenda' in schools. This announcement solidifies her political transformation, highlighting her alignment with Trump on culture war issues and extreme immigration policies, setting the stage for a competitive GOP primary.</p>

The action is a direct challenge to the recent proscription of Palestine Action as a terror organization, with protesters planning to display signs supporting the group. Organizers from Defend our Juries are coordinating the peaceful demonstration, despite warnings from the prime minister's spokesperson and Met Police that showing support for the proscribed group is an offense. The government's proscription is currently being challenged in the High Court, raising concerns about freedom of expression and assembly.</p>

This defection is seen as a significant local government milestone for Reform UK, adding to the perception of a fraying institutional Conservative Party at the local level.

          <p>In today's uncertain economic climate, marked by market volatility and inflation, more Americans are considering annuities as a means to secure their financial future. Annuities, which convert a lump sum into regular payments, can be beneficial for near-retirees seeking to lock in high interest rates for guaranteed income, especially those without pensions. However, they are not suitable for everyone; younger investors, individuals needing liquidity, or those with high-rate debt may find annuities restrictive or less financially advantageous. Careful consideration of personal circumstances and professional advice is crucial before purchasing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and his economic advisor, Kevin Hassett, have propagated unsubstantiated conspiracies claiming that recent federal jobs data was 'rigged' by federal workers to sabotage the administration. These allegations followed a weaker-than-expected July employment report and the abrupt firing of Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. The White House's efforts to discredit government economic data, particularly when it doesn't align with their political narrative, mirror past attempts to undermine public trust in institutions.

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society indicates that increased colorectal cancer screenings among individuals aged 45-49 are leading to a rise in early-stage diagnoses. Incidence rates for this age group saw a significant annual increase, jumping from 1.1% to 12% after screening recommendations were lowered from 50 to 45. While these findings are promising, screening rates in this younger demographic remain suboptimal and inequitable across different educational and insurance statuses.

This decision comes six months after a Delaware judge ordered the revocation of his previous $56 billion package from 2018. The company's move aims to secure Musk's leadership until at least 2030 and alleviate shareholder concerns, particularly as Tesla transitions to an AI-first company. Despite a 25% plunge in Tesla shares this year, partly due to blowback over Musk's political affiliations, the board believes this compensation will incentivize him to navigate intensifying competition and company challenges.</p>
