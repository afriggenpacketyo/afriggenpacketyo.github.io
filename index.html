          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 06:33:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) indicate that approximately one in eight women in England and Wales were victims of sexual assault, domestic abuse, or stalking last year. The data, part of the annual Crime Survey, is the first to combine these three crime types to monitor the government's progress on tackling violence against women and girls. Overall crime incidents rose by 7%, driven largely by a 31% increase in fraud, while shoplifting also reached a record high. The report highlights ongoing challenges in addressing these serious societal issues despite stated government ambitions.</p>

          <p>Global food giant Nestle has indicated that consumers may face higher prices for products like KitKat and Nespresso in the latter half of the year. The company is grappling with significant increases in commodity costs, particularly for cocoa and coffee, which have reached historic highs. While first-half organic sales grew due to previous price hikes, underlying profit margins have dipped, and the company anticipates further pressure from U.S. tariffs and currency fluctuations. CEO Laurent Freixe stated that while most pricing actions are complete, some additional increases might be necessary. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese agricultural authorities are implementing plans to decrease the nation's pig breeding inventory to combat a prolonged oversupply that has caused pork prices to plummet. The national breeding sow population remains above the official target, contributing to over seven months of financial losses for producers, a situation described as unprecedented by industry insiders. Analysts point to weak consumer demand and high inventory levels as major factors weighing on the sector. While some marginal improvements are anticipated later in the year, the overall potential for a significant recovery is considered limited. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The practice of hyper-personalized pricing, where companies use AI to charge different prices to different people for the same product, is growing and causing alarm. Delta Air Lines' recent announcement that it's expanding its use of AI for dynamic fares has intensified the debate, leading to consumer backlash and proposed legislation to ban the practice. While companies like Delta and Amazon deny using personal data for "surveillance pricing," investigations have found other retailers engaging in it. This advanced form of dynamic pricing leverages vast amounts of personal data, raising significant privacy and fairness concerns.</p>

          <p>BBC News, along with three major international news agencies, has issued a joint statement expressing grave concern for local journalists in Gaza, who are now facing the threat of starvation. These reporters, who serve as the world's primary source of on-the-ground information from the territory, are experiencing the same severe food shortages as the population they cover. The statement urges Israeli authorities to permit foreign journalists entry and to ensure adequate food supplies reach the region. This comes as numerous aid organizations warn of mass starvation and famine-like conditions developing across Gaza.</p>

          <p>A 2022 sentencing memorandum from federal prosecutors starkly detailed Ghislaine Maxwell's character, describing her as engaging in a "significant pattern of dishonest conduct" and being a vital participant in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation. The document, which preceded her 20-year prison sentence, asserted that Epstein could not have committed his crimes without her involvement in identifying, grooming, and abusing multiple teenage girls. This context resurfaces as the Department of Justice plans to meet with Maxwell, who continues to appeal her conviction, to potentially gather more information about Epstein's network.</p>

          <h2>Serbian Student Protest Movement Grapples with Ideological Divisions</h2>

          <p>A student-led protest movement in Serbia, initially united in demanding accountability for a deadly railway station collapse, is now facing internal ideological rifts. The movement began with a clear, non-partisan focus on justice, but as it grew, nationalist symbols and rhetoric began to appear at rallies, causing concern that the platform was being co-opted. Despite these divisions, especially on issues like Kosovo, the movement has persisted and appears to have influenced youth attitudes, with recent data showing a notable increase in support for democracy. The core challenge remains balancing inclusivity with a unified message.</p>

          <p>In a move to address its aging population and stimulate spending, China is planning to provide monthly electronic coupons to seniors to help cover care-service costs. The subsidies, ranging from 500 to 800 yuan, will be targeted at individuals assessed as having moderate to severe physical disabilities. This rare use of direct fiscal support is intended to ease the financial burden on families and encourage the use of services like meal assistance and day care. The policy is seen as a step toward strengthening the social safety net to unlock precautionary savings and boost domestic consumption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve's headquarters, continuing his public pressure campaign on its chair, Jerome Powell. The visit follows Trump's recent suggestion that he might fire Powell over the rising costs of a renovation project at the Fed's buildings. For months, the president has criticized Powell for not cutting interest rates more aggressively to stimulate the economy. The persistent attacks and threats to fire the Fed chair have raised concerns about the central bank's long-held political independence, a principle most economists consider crucial for financial stability.

          <p>The German government is facing scrutiny over its policy of deporting convicted criminals to Afghanistan, a practice that requires "technical contacts" with the Taliban regime, which Germany does not officially recognize. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has defended the flights as part of a "repatriation offensive," insisting that serious criminals have no right to reside in the country. However, critics and peace researchers argue the deportations are inadmissible if individuals face torture and that the cooperation lends legitimacy to the Taliban. The policy has also been criticized for abandoning former Afghan allies promised safety.</p>

However, with no guarantees and the final decision resting with President Trump, the EU is keeping its options open.

Kaylee Goncalves's sister forcefully told Kohberger that he had failed to instill fear and had united the community in disgust. Kohberger, who pleaded guilty, was sentenced to four consecutive life sentences without parole for the murders, plus the maximum penalty for burglary, after the death penalty was taken off the table.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is moving to overturn the 2009 "endangerment finding," a critical Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determination that allows for the regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. This finding serves as the legal foundation for most federal climate change policies, including limits on emissions from power plants and vehicles. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin framed the proposal as a major act of deregulation to boost the economy. If successful, the move would dismantle a cornerstone of U.S. climate action and make it much harder for future administrations to address climate pollution.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how President Trump's long-standing personal animosity toward wind turbines, which began with a dispute over a wind farm near his Scottish golf course, has escalated into a global policy agenda. As president, Trump has actively worked to undermine clean energy, culminating in a recent spending bill that guts support for the U.S. renewables industry. The piece argues this stance, which Trump is now extending globally, will cede economic and technological leadership to countries like China, which is heavily investing in green tech. The consequences include lost jobs, higher energy bills, and significant setbacks for climate action.</p>

          <p>The newly signed One Big Beautiful Bill Act initiates a historic overhaul of the U.S. federal student loan system, impacting millions of borrowers. The legislation will phase out the generous Biden-era SAVE repayment plan by 2028 and introduce two new, less generous plans. It also establishes tighter borrowing limits for graduate students and parents, significantly reducing the amount they can borrow for higher education. These sweeping changes will dramatically reshape the landscape of federal student aid, reducing repayment options and making it more difficult for some to finance pricier graduate programs.

          <p>A major new study challenges the common belief that a sedentary lifestyle is the main cause of rising obesity rates. Researchers compared the daily calorie expenditure of people from diverse cultures, including active hunter-gatherers and more sedentary individuals in industrialized nations. They surprisingly found that total calories burned per day were very similar across all groups, regardless of physical activity levels. This finding provides strong evidence that modern diets, particularly the prevalence of ultra-processed foods, are the primary driver of the obesity epidemic, rather than a decline in exercise.</p>
