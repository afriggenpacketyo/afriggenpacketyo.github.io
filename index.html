          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of an Ohio woman, Marlean Ames, who alleges she was denied a promotion and later demoted by the Ohio Department of Youth Services due to her heterosexual orientation, with gay candidates being selected instead. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson delivered the opinion, stating that Ames had been unfairly held to a higher legal standard as a member of a majority group. The court found that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals' requirement for majority group plaintiffs to show 'background circumstances' was inconsistent with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The ruling allows Ames' lawsuit to proceed, though it does not guarantee she will win her case. The court's decision clarifies the standard for establishing a prima facie case of employment discrimination.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a 90-minute phone call focused on trade, leading to a positive conclusion and the resumption of trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials. Trump announced that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will represent the U.S. in the upcoming meetings. The discussion addressed concerns about rare earth products, and Trump noted that Russia, Ukraine, and Iran were not discussed. Xi Jinping extended an invitation to Trump and his wife to visit China, which Trump reciprocated. The resumption of talks aims to alleviate the trade war between the two countries.

Merz intends to thank Trump for the invitation and present a small gift, with discussions also planned on trade policy, given Germany's significant investment in the U.S., and NATO, where Germany aims to have the strongest conventional army in Europe.

Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa noted that 2.2 million people in Japan entered the lottery to purchase the console on launch day, exceeding expectations. While shortages are expected to persist in Japan, there appears to be more availability in the U.K. Nintendo anticipates selling 15 million units in the fiscal year ending March 2026, though analysts predict even higher sales figures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of seven U.S. gun manufacturers who were sued by the Mexican government over allegations they aided and abetted illegal gun sales to Mexican cartels. The high court found that the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) protects gun makers from lawsuits and did not include exceptions that allowed Mexico to sue. Justice Elena Kagan wrote that Mexico's complaint did not plausibly allege that the gun makers 'proximately caused' harm to Mexico. The justices concluded that the commerce pipeline from manufacturers to cartels was too complex to establish proximate cause.</p>

          <p>U.S. imports experienced a significant decline in April, reflecting the impact of ongoing trade tensions and tariffs. Americans reduced their purchases of various goods from other countries, including pharmaceuticals, cellphones, cars, foreign machinery, and other essential supplies. This decrease in imports suggests a potential slowdown in economic activity and highlights the effects of trade policies on consumer behavior and international commerce. The reduction in imports may also indicate a shift in supply chains or increased domestic production in certain sectors.</p>

          <p>This article explores options for medical debt forgiveness, noting that it can take various forms, including hospital financial assistance programs, debt settlement, and careful review of insurance and billing statements. Many nonprofit hospitals are legally required to offer charity care or income-based relief, but patients often need to ask. Debt settlement through negotiation with creditors can also lead to partial forgiveness, though settled debt over $600 may be taxed as income. If forgiveness isn't an option, setting up payment plans or prioritizing debt repayment can help manage the burden.</p>

          <p>A leading TV weatherman in Florida, John Morales, warned viewers that funding cuts by the Trump administration to federal weather forecasting will degrade the accuracy of hurricane predictions. Morales stated that cuts to climate and weather agencies, including staff shortages at the National Weather Service and NOAA, will hamper his ability to inform the public about incoming hurricanes. He expressed concern that reduced weather balloon launches and potential grounding of NOAA 'hurricane hunter' aircraft will lead to less accurate forecasts. Morales urged viewers to contact their representatives to stop these cuts.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review the latest data on mifepristone, commonly known as the abortion pill. The FDA confirmed the review, but did not specify the scope or timeline. This action follows concerns raised by a report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center, which claims the pill harms women, though experts have questioned the report's methodology and conclusions. Mifepristone was initially approved by the FDA in 2000 and has undergone periodic reviews without new safety concerns being identified.</p>

MSF's director general, Stephen Cornish, described the situation as beyond anything they have ever seen, with people fearing for their lives and left to bleed out on the ground. The dire situation is compounded by the fact that most Palestinians are now too poorly nourished to donate blood.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a new travel ban targeting citizens from more than a dozen countries, creating a tiered system of escalating entry barriers. The ban restricts or prohibits citizens from countries including Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, and others from entering the United States. The White House cited national security issues, lack of reliable authorities, and terrorist activity as reasons for the ban. The proclamation represents a significant reshaping of the U.S.'s approach to global mobility.</p>

          <p>The Manhattan District Attorney's office filed an 82-page document revealing details from a notebook allegedly belonging to Luigi Mangione, who faces charges for the assassination of United Health Care CEO Brian Thompson. The notebook contains entries outlining plans for Thompson's murder, including targeting him at an investor conference. Prosecutors argue the terrorism charges are appropriate, claiming Mangione intended to broadcast a political message through violence. Mangione's defense team seeks to suppress the notebook and firearm evidence, claiming a warrantless search.</p>
