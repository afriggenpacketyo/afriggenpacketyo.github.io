        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Demonstrators in Los Angeles protesting federal immigration sweeps blocked traffic on the 101 freeway, leading to the assembly being deemed unlawful by police. The protests, which began Friday evening, continued through the weekend in response to President Trump's deployment of 2,000 National Guardsmen to address what Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called "lawlessness" in California. Governor Gavin Newsom has requested the Trump administration to rescind the deployment, describing it as "purposefully inflammatory" and likely to escalate tensions. The situation underscores the ongoing conflict between state and federal authorities over immigration enforcement policies. Optimism score is based on the reality that the protests reflect the ongoing tensions surrounding immigration policies, but also the active engagement of citizens and government officials in addressing the issue.</p>

          <p>Nursing staff in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland will vote on a 3.6% pay increase, with the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) already dismissing the award as "grotesque." Almost 350,000 nursing staff will participate in the vote, which could lead to strike action if rejected. RCN General Secretary Professor Nicola Ranger argues that nursing has been placed at the "back of the queue" regarding pay, leading to significant staff attrition. Resident doctors in England are already being balloted on strike action, potentially casting a shadow over the government's upcoming 10-year plan for the NHS in England.</p>

While some Democrats, including blue-state governors, have embraced the idea, anti-corporate populists view it as a threat to their focus on concentrated power. Klein highlights a poll commissioned by a leftist advocacy group, Demand Progress, which found that voters were more concerned about corporate power than bottlenecks hindering production. This division underscores a fundamental debate within the Democratic Party regarding its future direction and priorities.</p>
