          <p>The NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) is appealing for 200,000 new blood donors to increase the number of regular donors to over one million, ensuring a stable blood supply. Supplies have been critically low, especially for O negative blood types, leading to an "amber alert" last year which impacted patient treatment. The NHSBT is particularly emphasizing the need for more black donors, who are more likely to possess blood types crucial for treating sickle cell disease. Only a small fraction of the population donates regularly, and while donor registrations increased in 2024, only a quarter proceeded to donate. The NHS aims to prevent a "red alert" scenario, where demand exceeds capacity, by increasing donor numbers. </p>

          <p>President Trump's proclamation, "Restricting the Entry of Foreign Nationals to Protect the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats," has gone into effect, banning entry to the US for nationals from 12 countries, including Afghanistan, Myanmar, and Iran. Seven additional nations face partial restrictions with stricter visa checks. Trump cited the recent attack in Boulder, Colorado, as justification, arguing that these countries do not provide sufficient information on their nationals. Exemptions include Green Card holders, dual nationals with US passports, and close relatives of US citizens. Human rights groups have criticized the ban as discriminatory. </p>

          <p>China's consumer prices have fallen for the fourth consecutive month in May, indicating weak domestic consumption despite Beijing's stimulus measures. The consumer price index decreased by 0.1% year-on-year, while factory-gate prices dropped by 3.3%, the steepest decline since July 2023. A price war in the automotive industry and falling property prices have contributed to the downward pressure on consumer prices.

Ministers assert the pay rise is the second above-inflation increase for NHS staff in the last 10 months.

          <p>Analysts predict that the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) surprise rate cut will leave the rupee vulnerable to depreciation by pressuring foreign exchange forward premiums. The rupee has already underperformed against its Asian peers due to weak capital flows. The drop in dollar/rupee forward premiums makes the rupee less attractive for carry trades and diminishes the incentive for exporters to hedge future receivables. This also increases the likelihood that importers will step up their hedging activity, leading to a sharper depreciation. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced a sharp decline in May, dropping 34.5% year-on-year, marking the steepest fall since February 2020. Overall exports rose 4.8% but missed expectations, while imports plunged 3.4% due to sluggish domestic demand. The decline in exports to the U.S. was partially offset by increased shipments to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Africa. Despite the recent trade truce, the impact of previous tariffs continues to affect trade. (not investment advice) </p>
