        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Instagram has introduced a new opt-in feature called "Map" that allows users to share their real-time location, sparking controversy among privacy experts. Critics are concerned about potential safety risks and user confusion, despite Meta's assurance that the feature is off by default and requires explicit consent. Experts highlight the risk of "context collapse," where users may unintentionally share sensitive location data with a wider audience than intended, posing particular dangers for younger users who might feel social pressure to participate. The debate underscores the ongoing tension between social connectivity and personal data protection.</p>

          <p>The president of Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University in Suzhou, China, has identified geopolitics as the "biggest challenge" currently facing academia, stating it stifles scientific research and collaboration. Xi Youmin argued that global divisions, exemplified by conflicts and trade wars, are permeating university environments and pressuring institutions to make concessions that compromise academic integrity. He suggested that one way to improve international understanding and ease these tensions on campus is by simplifying visa restrictions for foreign students and visitors. This would foster better cross-cultural communication and scientific exchange.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has removed Billy Long from his position as IRS commissioner just two months after he was sworn in for a term intended to last until 2027. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will serve as the acting commissioner in the interim. Long, a former congressman, is expected to be nominated for the post of ambassador to Iceland, a role he expressed excitement about on social media. His brief tenure coincided with the implementation of new tariffs and tax code changes under the Trump administration. The move marks a significant and rapid leadership change at the top of the nation's tax agency.</p>

Authorities announced his arrest near the search area, bringing an end to the extensive search operation. Brown is accused of killing four people in what officials described as a cold-blooded attack at The Owl Bar, where he was reportedly a regular customer. Relatives and community members noted that the suspect, an Army veteran, had a history of mental health struggles, including PTSD. The capture provides a sense of resolution for a community grieving the loss of its residents.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a landmark peace deal at the White House, aimed at ending nearly four decades of conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The agreement, brokered by the U.S., involves the two nations committing to cease hostilities, establish diplomatic relations, and respect each other's territorial integrity. A key component of the deal is the creation of a transit corridor, to be named after President Trump, connecting Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave through Armenian territory. Both leaders praised the U.S. for its role in the historic diplomatic achievement, which is seen as a significant shift in regional geopolitics.</p>

          <p>House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, a Republican from Minnesota, has sharply criticized Governor Tim Walz following the release of a man who had been imprisoned for murdering his family as a teenager. Emmer accused the governor of implementing "soft-on-crime policies" that he claims endanger Minnesotans and deny justice to victims. The criticism targets a Minnesota law that led to the man's release, with Emmer attributing the outcome to what he calls the governor's "dangerous, far-left agenda." This article highlights a contentious political issue in the state, focusing on criminal justice reform and public safety.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the esteemed NASA astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97. Lovell is famously remembered for his calm and courageous leadership during the 1970 lunar mission, which became a "successful failure" after an onboard explosion forced the crew to abort their moon landing and improvise a safe return to Earth. He was also part of the pioneering Apollo 8 crew, the first to orbit the moon. Lovell's legacy is defined by his unflappable demeanor under extreme pressure, which inspired millions and was immortalized in the film "Apollo 13."</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the motivations behind Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to approve a plan to occupy Gaza City. It suggests the move is heavily influenced by his reliance on hard-right coalition partners who advocate for annexing Gaza and establishing new settlements, a vision not supported by the majority of Israelis or the security establishment. Netanyahu's political survival depends on appeasing these far-right factions, as losing their support could trigger elections he is projected to lose. The plan is seen as a strategic choice to maintain power, even as it conflicts with the views of the military and the public.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has sided with the Trump administration, throwing out a district judge's criminal contempt finding against officials involved in the deportation of Venezuelan migrants. The case originated when Judge James Boasberg ruled that the administration had willfully disregarded his order to halt the removal of migrants to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. However, the D.C. Circuit Court, in a 2-1 decision, vacated the order, calling the dispute an "extraordinary, ongoing confrontation" between the executive and judicial branches.

          <p>Shares of MP Materials rose after the company reported a smaller-than-expected loss for the second quarter, driven by record production of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide. This key material is essential for permanent magnets used in electric vehicles and electronics, and the production increase has fueled investor optimism about the company's path to profitability. The positive results follow a significant investment from the Department of Defense, which recently purchased $400 million in preferred stock, making the government MP's largest shareholder. The company is now focused on scaling up its magnet production facility in Texas. (not investment advice)</p>

Chikungunya, a mosquito-borne virus that causes fever and severe joint pain, is rarely fatal but can be debilitating. Because the virus is uncommon in China, the population has little immunity, prompting the aggressive public health measures to contain its spread.</p>

She also emphasizes the importance of working with the body's natural energy rhythms rather than fighting against them. The key takeaway is that incorporating small, intentional movement and environmental tidiness into the workday can be a crucial part of the creative process, helping to refresh the mind and spark new ideas.</p>

          <p>Some economists are raising concerns that the Trump administration's new sweeping tariffs could push the U.S. economy toward stagflation—a period of high inflation combined with low economic growth. The tariffs are expected to increase prices as businesses pass costs to consumers, while also potentially slowing the economy if companies scale back hiring and investment to cope. With the effective average tariff rate now at its highest since 1934, analysts are watching for signs of rising inflation and a weakening job market, creating a challenging scenario for Federal Reserve policymakers.
