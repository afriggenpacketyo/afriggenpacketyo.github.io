          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire following escalating tensions since an April attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir, which India blamed on Pakistani-backed militants. The ceasefire was announced by President Trump and confirmed by officials from both countries. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that Vice President JD Vance and he conversed with Indian and Pakistani officials to broker an immediate ceasefire. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked President Trump for his proactive role, while Indian officials reported earlier attacks by Pakistan across India. This agreement marks a potential step towards de-escalation in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an excerpt from his memoir "Who Knew," media executive Barry Diller discusses the importance of instinct in creative and business decision-making, arguing that data and research can be harmful to intuition. Diller recounts experiences from his time at ABC, where he championed made-for-TV movies, emphasizing that predicting public appetite is impossible and that instinct often trumps data. He cites the success of "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker" as examples of projects greenlit based on instinct rather than extensive research. Diller cautions against over-reliance on data, particularly among MBA students, advocating for a balance between structured information and human instinct.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At least seven people have died in Mogadishu, Somalia, after heavy rains caused severe flooding due to an overwhelmed drainage system. The regional administration reports that the death toll could rise as nine houses collapsed and major roads suffered damage, trapping residents and disrupting public transport. The rains, lasting approximately eight hours, left waist-high waters in neighborhoods, forcing people to rooftops and higher ground. Key infrastructure was damaged, temporarily halting operations at Aden Abdulle International Airport, though flights have since resumed. The Somali Disaster Management Agency is assessing the extent of the damage, with warnings of potential flash floods in other regions.</p>

          <p>Google has agreed to pay nearly $1.4 billion to the state of Texas to settle allegations of violating users' data privacy rights, according to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. The settlement resolves two lawsuits accusing Google of unlawfully tracking and collecting users' private data, including movements, searches, voiceprints, and facial geometry. While Google does not admit wrongdoing, the settlement covers allegations related to Chrome's incognito mode, location history on Google Maps, and biometric claims related to Google Photos.

It highlights the challenges of filming the assassination scene and Lee's use of cinematic techniques to convey Malcolm's premonition of his death. The excerpt also mentions cameo appearances by figures who interacted with Malcolm, such as Bobby Seale and Al Sharpton, and the effort to create a haunting and impactful cinematic experience.</p>

          <p>Charles Barkley has voiced strong criticism of the NCAA's management of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals and the transfer portal, calling the organization a "bunch of idiots and fools." Barkley questions the large sums of money being paid to college athletes and the frequency with which they can transfer schools, expressing concerns about the return on investment for NIL donors. He stated he prefers to donate to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and rebuild houses in his hometown, rather than contribute to what he sees as a flawed college athletics system. Barkley doesn't oppose college players getting paid, but he has trouble making sense as to how much money players are making.</p>

          <p>Elana Cohen-Roth, a retired IRS agent from Southern California, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for defrauding an elderly woman in Sonoma County out of $1 million in life savings. Cohen-Roth, who began preparing the victim's taxes in 2013, gained access to her financial information and offered fraudulent "investment opportunities" promising high interest rates with no risk. The scheme, which operated as a Ponzi scheme, collapsed in 2020 when the victim requested her money back. The victim went from owning her own home and having around $1,000,000 in investments to live on, to being financially destitute.</p>

          <p>Climate change is altering bird migration patterns, affecting their ability to feed, breed, and maintain ecosystem balance. Rising global temperatures, extreme weather events, and habitat loss are impacting migratory birds' journeys and behaviors. Changes in ocean acidity affect crustaceans, a vital food source, while warmer temperatures lead some birds to shorten routes or abandon migration altogether, potentially causing conflicts with resident animals. Conservation efforts, including expanding protected areas and creating bird-friendly habitats, are crucial to minimizing risks and ensuring the survival of migratory birds. The extinction of the slender-billed curlew highlights the consequences of failing to adapt to these changes.</p>

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Russia would not be swayed by sanctions and that any ceasefire must not allow Kiev to reposition its forces and must halt Western arms deliveries.</p>

          <p>Billy Evans, the partner of convicted Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, is seeking funding for a new blood-testing company called Haemanthus. The company aims to revolutionize diagnostic testing, initially focusing on pets before progressing to humans, with a device that bears resemblance to Theranos's infamous blood-testing machine. The marketing materials for Haemanthus claim no regulatory oversight, which is being disputed by the USDA. James W. Breyer, an early investor in Facebook, declined to invest in Haemanthus due to concerns about scientific defensibility and clinical utility, citing similar reasons for passing on Theranos.</p>

          <p>California's Channel Islands, often called "California's Galapagos," are home to thousands of marine species thriving in protected waters, but these protections are now under review. The California fish and game commission is considering proposals to either expand or reduce marine protected areas (MPAs) around the islands, which serve as a refuge for diverse species. Scientists and conservationists emphasize the value of preservation, citing the area's economic benefits through ecotourism and its role in sustaining marine life and ecosystems. The review considers factors like sustaining marine life, maintaining recreational use, and minimizing economic loss, with decisions expected next year.</p>

          <p>Financial expert Ric Edelman discusses the impact of new crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the market as Bitcoin surpasses $100,000. Edelman believes that these ETFs provide investors with greater access to the upside of cryptocurrencies, particularly highlighting buffer ETFs and yield ETFs. He notes that crypto is meant to be a long-term investment, similar to the stock market, and should be used to diversify portfolios. However, Edelman cautions against leveraged and inverse bitcoin ETFs, warning that they may not be suitable for retail investors due to their complexity.</p>

The ruling is the broadest against the government overhaul led by Elon Musk's "department of government efficiency" (DOGE).
