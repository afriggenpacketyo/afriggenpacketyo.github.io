The ban has disrupted travel plans and created anxiety for those with family and professional ties to the U.S., with some expressing concerns about the long-term impact on their ability to reunite with loved ones.

          <p>Scientists are aiding the recovery of Yosemite's native turtles by removing invasive bullfrogs from their habitat. American bullfrogs, introduced in the late 1800s, have decimated local wildlife, including Northwestern pond turtle hatchlings. Researchers conducted near-total eradication of bullfrogs from specific bodies of water, resulting in a striking recovery of the pond turtle population. The removal effort also led to the resurgence of other native species, such as snakes and newts, restoring balance to the freshwater ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Asian needle ants, an invasive species with a potentially deadly sting, continue to spread across the United States.

Their sting can cause anaphylactic shock in people allergic to bee and ant stings, prompting experts to urge vigilance and caution. These sneaky ants outcompete native species and disrupt local ecosystems, posing a threat to both human health and the environment.</p>

          <p>Ed Miliband is defending the Labour government's decision to partially reverse its policy on winter fuel payments, expanding eligibility to more than three-quarters of pensioners.

Miliband stated that the government's improved financial situation allowed for the reversal, while maintaining that the wealthiest pensioners should not receive the payment.

The House has passed a bill that would cut $900 billion from health programs, including the ACA, potentially causing 15 million people to lose insurance. Republicans are more likely to be self-employed and live in states that did not expand Medicaid, factors that increase reliance on ACA marketplace coverage.
