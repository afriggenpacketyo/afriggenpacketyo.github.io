During his visit, he is set to announce a significant donation to Children in Need to support work tackling youth violence. The trip has also fueled speculation about a potential meeting with his father, King Charles, amid signs of easing tensions between them.

The victory marks her fourth major singles title and solidifies her dominance in women's tennis.

          <p>The United Nations' postal agency has reported a drastic 81% drop in postal traffic to the United States after the Trump administration eliminated a long-standing tariff exemption for low-value imports. The new rules shift the responsibility of collecting customs duties to postal carriers, many of whom are not equipped for the task. This change has caused major operational disruptions, leading 88 foreign postal operators to suspend some or all services to the US, bringing the global mail network to a near standstill.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have strongly condemned President Donald Trump's recent social media posts threatening to send federal forces to Chicago. The officials labeled the president's actions as authoritarian and intimidating, vowing to resist any such deployment. In response, a White House spokesperson criticized the local leaders' priorities, pointing to the city's crime statistics. The escalating rhetoric comes as the city anticipates increased immigration enforcement actions over the weekend.</p>

          <p>The European Union is set to launch its new digital border system, the Entry/Exit System (EES), this autumn, which will affect non-EU travelers, including those from the UK. The system will replace manual passport stamping by digitally tracking entries and exits from the 29-country Schengen Area. On their first use, travelers will need to register biometric data, such as fingerprints and a facial photo, at automated kiosks. While intended to improve security, concerns have been raised about potential for significant delays at borders like Dover during the initial rollout.</p>

          <p>American AI firm Anthropic has updated its policy to restrict access to its powerful Claude AI models for any entity more than 50% owned by companies based in unsupported regions like China.

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching $1.8 billion, an Alabama woman named Susie Conerly has a unique plan for the winnings: she wants to fire the University of Alabama's head football coach.

DeBoer's buyout is estimated to be around $63 million, a figure well within the potential cash value of the massive lottery prize.</p>

This crucial step towards viable fusion energy was accomplished using a new diagnostic device called "THOR." Fusion power, which mimics the process that fuels the sun, has the potential to provide nearly unlimited energy without the long-lasting nuclear waste or meltdown risks associated with current fission reactors.

Despite the historic achievement, Verstappen remains cautious about his race prospects, acknowledging the strong competition from McLaren, who have often shown superior race pace this season.</p>
