          <p>The Trump administration's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 outlines a 15% funding cut to the Education Department, signaling a commitment to winding down the agency. While Title I funding remains unchanged, the budget consolidates and cuts funding to various K-12 programs, reducing them to a single grant with significantly less funding. Although there appears to be an increase in special education funding, it is essentially flat when accounting for consolidated programs. The budget also proposes cuts to federal Pell Grants, reducing the maximum amount from $7,400 to $5,700, and slashes funding for the Federal Work-Study program, shifting the burden to colleges and universities.
