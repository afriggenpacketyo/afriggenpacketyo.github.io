          <p>South Korea's SK Hynix reported significantly higher-than-expected first-quarter revenue and operating profit, largely due to strong demand for high-bandwidth memory used in AI chipsets.  While revenue dropped 11% quarter-over-quarter, the year-over-year increase was substantial.  The company, however, warned of demand volatility due to macroeconomic uncertainties and potential tariff impacts.  Despite this, SK Hynix anticipates continued growth in AI server demand.</p>

          <p>A federal judge temporarily paused discovery in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia's wrongful deportation.  The pause, agreed upon by both the government and Abrego Garcia's attorneys, follows the Trump administration's request and the judge's previous criticism of the government's slow response to discovery requests.  The case involves Abrego Garcia's deportation to El Salvador despite a court order barring it, and the ongoing dispute centers around the government's justification for his detention.  The judge previously ordered government officials to testify under oath.</p>
