          <p>The price of gold has surged nearly 80% since early 2024, prompting speculation that it could surpass the $4,000 per ounce mark as early as this September. Key factors driving this potential increase include anticipated interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which can make gold a more attractive investment. Additionally, rising inflation and general market uncertainty are causing investors to seek out safe-haven assets, further boosting demand for the precious metal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a late-stage clinical trial, Eli Lilly's experimental oral medication for Type 2 diabetes, orforglipron, demonstrated superior efficacy in lowering blood sugar and promoting weight loss compared to Novo Nordisk's approved pill, Rybelsus. The highest dose of orforglipron reduced blood sugar levels by 2.2% and resulted in an average weight loss of 9.2%, outperforming the results from Novo Nordisk's drug. Eli Lilly plans to seek regulatory approval in 2026, intensifying the competition in the lucrative market for convenient GLP-1 treatments.</p>

The one-hour documentary provides an intimate look at the final years of Osbourne's life, chronicling his return to the UK from Los Angeles and his efforts to perform a farewell concert despite significant health challenges.</p>

          <p>Former President of Ecuador, Lenin Moreno, has dismissed bribery charges against him as a politically motivated "farce." Prosecutors allege that Moreno and his family received part of $76 million in illicit payments from a Chinese state-owned company involved in constructing the Coca Codo Sinclair hydroelectric dam, a major Belt and Road Initiative project. Moreno, now living in Paraguay, claims the accusations are retaliation orchestrated by his predecessor and political rival, Rafael Correa, insisting the case lacks concrete evidence of wrongdoing.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reinstating a more difficult version of the U.S. civics test required for citizenship, a move previously reversed by the Biden administration. Under the new rules, applicants must study 128 questions about U.S. history and government and correctly answer 12 out of 20, an increase from the previous requirement of answering 6 out of 10 from a pool of 100 questions. This change is part of a broader effort to tighten legal immigration processes, which also includes expanded vetting and "neighborhood checks" for applicants.</p>

          <p>The Unite union reports that workers in the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) supply chain are being laid off with reduced or no pay and told to apply for universal credit. This follows a major cyber attack that has halted JLR's production, with disruptions potentially lasting until November. The union is urging the UK government to establish a furlough scheme to protect the thousands of jobs supported by JLR, as many smaller suppliers are financially vulnerable to the extended shutdown.</p>

          <p>Scientific experts are expressing grave concern over what they describe as a systemic assault on science under the Trump administration, affecting public health, climate research, and environmental protection. The article documents hundreds of incidents, including the firing of federal scientists, halting data collection, and censoring research, which critics argue undermines evidence-based policymaking. This trend has led to mass staff cuts at agencies like the CDC and EPA, with some observers warning the loss of expertise could take decades to restore.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Palestinian civilians are fleeing Gaza City as a major Israeli ground offensive intensifies, drawing widespread condemnation from international aid agencies who call the situation "unconscionable." Israel states its objective is to defeat Hamas fighters and free remaining hostages, but the heavy bombardment has created a dire humanitarian crisis. Gaza's health ministry reported that a children's hospital was targeted, and civilians are struggling to evacuate to a designated "humanitarian area" that is already severely overcrowded and undersupplied.</p>

The force has already removed over 1,400 officers since 2022 in its largest-ever clear-out, which was initiated following the murder of Sarah Everard by a serving officer.</p>

While these deals bring Americans home, they also create a dangerous incentive for Russia to detain more Westerners as bargaining chips, eroding long-standing diplomatic norms.</p>
