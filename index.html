          <p>FCC Chair Brendan Carr denies threatening TV networks to pull Jimmy Kimmel's show, claiming his comments were misrepresented. The controversy arose after Carr appeared to pressure affiliates to drop the show, leading major carriers to briefly pre-empt it before public backlash prompted a reversal. Carr now frames the incident as a positive assertion of independence by local broadcasters against national networks, despite criticism from Democrats and free press advocates. The situation has highlighted tensions over media control and political speech.</p>

The airline also reached a deal with a major aircraft lessor for an additional $150 million while planning to reject leases on 27 Airbus aircraft to cut costs. These financial arrangements, which are subject to court approval, are crucial for the airline's continued operation as it navigates high costs and weak demand. The moves are part of a broader restructuring plan to create a more stable and competitive airline.</p>

          <h2>Potential Government Shutdown Unlikely to Halt Most Mortgage Applications</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. government shutdown is expected to have a minimal impact on the majority of mortgage applications, as most are handled by private lenders. However, borrowers seeking government-backed loans through agencies like the FHA, VA, or USDA could experience minor processing delays due to furloughed staff. A more significant issue could arise for homebuyers in flood zones, as a shutdown may disrupt the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, potentially delaying closings. Experts advise that while some hitches are possible, a shutdown is unlikely to be a deal-killer for most prospective homeowners.</p>

          <p>California startup Aetherflux is developing innovative space-based solar farms that use satellites to collect solar power and transmit it to Earth via infrared lasers. The company, led by Robinhood co-founder Baiju Bhatt and backed by investors like Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures, plans its first launch on a SpaceX rocket next year. Initially, Aetherflux is partnering with the U.S. Department of Defense to provide power in remote battlefield locations. The long-term goal is to scale the technology and reduce costs, making it a competitive alternative to traditional energy sources on a broader market.</p>

          <p>A legal dispute has emerged over the control of the 1-800-GAMBLER hotline, a critical resource amid the surge in legal sports betting. The National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG), which has operated the line since 2022, sued to prevent its return to the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey (CCGNJ), which owns the number. The NCPG, backed by the NFL, argues the New Jersey group lacks the resources to manage the national call volume, which has grown significantly. After a court denied the NCPG's request to keep the number, the national organization will revert to a less memorable hotline number.</p>

This year's threat is heightened by a White House directive for agencies to prepare for permanent layoffs, not just temporary furloughs, escalating the stakes for federal workers.

          <p>President Donald Trump suggested that "dangerous cities" like Chicago could serve as "training grounds" for the U.S. military to practice irregular warfare, drawing a sharp rebuke from Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego. Speaking on CNN, Gallego, a Marine Corps veteran, called the president an "idiot" who doesn't understand the military's role or its oath to the Constitution. He asserted that service members would not fire on their fellow citizens and that such an order would be unlawful. Trump's comments were made during a speech to top military officials.</p>

          <p>Following the disruption of a massive telecommunications network that posed a threat to the UN General Assembly, federal agents have discovered an additional 200,000 SIM cards in New Jersey. The sprawling network, believed to have links to Chinese actors, was allegedly used for encrypted communication by foreign governments, organized crime gangs, and drug cartels. The initial seizure included over 100,000 SIM cards capable of sending 30 million texts per minute, powerful enough to potentially disable cell towers. Authorities are conducting a forensic analysis of the seized cards, but no arrests have been made.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Justice Department has filed a civil rights lawsuit against pro-Palestinian groups and activists, employing a law typically used to protect abortion clinics. The suit alleges the defendants violated the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act by disrupting a 2024 event promoting Israeli settlement property sales at a New Jersey synagogue. This marks the first time the federal government has used the FACE Act to protect a house of worship. Critics argue the move is a politically motivated effort to crack down on pro-Palestinian protest.</p>

          <p>Metsera, a weight-loss drugmaker recently acquired by Pfizer in a deal worth up to $7.3 billion, has released encouraging data from mid-stage trials of its lead obesity drug candidate. The injectable treatment, MET-097i, demonstrated weight loss of up to 14.1% on average after 28 weeks, with a favorable side effect profile compared to existing drugs. The company is developing the injection for once-a-month use, which could offer a significant convenience advantage over current weekly treatments. The promising results will allow Metsera to advance to late-stage phase three studies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is reportedly considering adding autism to the list of conditions covered by the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP). This potential move has alarmed public health experts, who warn it would legitimize the thoroughly debunked link between vaccines and autism and could bankrupt the program with a flood of claims. The VICP was created as a no-fault system to compensate for rare, specific vaccine side effects. Critics argue that adding autism would be a purely political decision, undermining vaccine confidence and public health.</p>

          <p>Health insurance premiums for plans on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace are projected to more than double in 2026 if enhanced subsidies are allowed to expire, according to a new KFF analysis. These subsidies, which currently benefit 22 million enrollees, are set to end in 2025 unless Congress acts. The issue is a central point of contention in the ongoing government funding negotiations, with Democrats demanding an extension. Without the subsidies, the average enrollee would see their annual premium increase from $888 to $1,906, a 114% jump. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has been named as a potential member of an international "Board of Peace" to oversee post-war Gaza as part of President Trump's new peace plan. Blair, who has been deeply involved in Middle East diplomacy for decades, is trusted by the Trump administration and has extensive regional contacts. However, his potential role is controversial, with many in the Arab world and beyond viewing him as a divisive figure due to his role in the 2003 Iraq invasion. While some see his experience as an asset, critics argue he lacks credibility with Palestinians.</p>
