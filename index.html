          <p>Actor Jamie Borthwick, who has portrayed Jay Brown on the BBC soap "EastEnders" since 2006, has been permanently dismissed from the show. This decision follows his suspension earlier this year for using a slur against people with disabilities while on the set of "Strictly Come Dancing." The BBC confirmed his departure without commenting on the specifics, while the disability charity Scope urged Borthwick to reflect on his language and educate himself on its impact.</p>

          <p>England defeated Andorra 2-0 in a World Cup qualifier, but the performance under manager Thomas Tuchel has been described as lackluster and a potential regression from the previous era. The victory, secured by an own goal and a header from Declan Rice, keeps England on track for qualification but failed to inspire confidence. Critics noted a lack of ideas and momentum, with thousands of fans leaving the stadium early, raising concerns ahead of a tougher match against Serbia.</p>

          <p>The government of South Sudan has repatriated a Mexican citizen, Jesus Munoz-Gutierrez, who was deported from the United States to the East African nation in July. Munoz-Gutierrez was part of a group of eight men with serious criminal convictions in the U.S. who were sent to third-party countries, a controversial practice by the Trump administration. His return to Mexico was coordinated with the Mexican Embassy in Ethiopia, with South Sudan stating it acted in accordance with international law.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report from Portugal's national transport safety office indicates that the deadly funicular crash in Lisbon was caused by a snapped cable connecting the two carriages. The investigation found that the brakeman's attempt to apply emergency brakes was unsuccessful in preventing the derailment, which killed 16 people. The report notes that the carriage was traveling at approximately 60 km/h (37 mph) when it collided with a building, though the reason for the cable failure is still under investigation.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he knew "nothing about" a New York Times report detailing a covert 2019 SEAL Team 6 mission in North Korea that resulted in the deaths of unarmed civilians. According to the report, which cited numerous anonymous sources, the mission was approved by Trump to plant a surveillance device but was aborted after the SEALs feared discovery. They allegedly opened fire on a North Korean boat, killing the crew who were later found to be unarmed civilians, possibly diving for shellfish.</p>

          <p>The grocery chain Piggly Wiggly is closing multiple stores in states including Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina due to a mix of inflation, decreased demand, and expiring leases. As an independently owned and operated franchise, the chain faces intense competition from larger retailers like Walmart, which command a significant share of the U.S. grocery market. The closures are part of a wider trend affecting the grocery industry, where thin profit margins make smaller chains particularly vulnerable to economic pressures.</p>

Online commentators condemned the display of wealth as "tacky" and out of touch, highlighting the broader controversy surrounding private jets and their disproportionate contribution to climate-damaging pollution. Private jets are known to be an extremely inefficient mode of transport, with studies showing a high percentage of flights are empty "repositioning" trips.</p>

          <p>A new conservation chapter is beginning at California's Point Reyes National Seashore after a settlement led to the buyout of 12 organic dairy and cattle operations. The Nature Conservancy, which financed the deal, is now leading a five-year, multi-million dollar restoration effort on over 16,000 acres of former ranch land. The plan involves using targeted cattle grazing to control invasive plants and restore native grasslands, though the transition has been painful for the multi-generational ranching community.</p>

          <p>The Trump family is shifting its cryptocurrency strategy from flashy promotions like NFTs to more conventional business structures, lending a veneer of legitimacy to their ventures. Eric Trump's crypto-mining company, American Bitcoin, recently went public on the Nasdaq, while another family-co-founded firm, World Liberty Financial, is expanding its stablecoin operations. These moves, which have generated billions in paper wealth for the family, are seen as a way to capitalize on the Trump brand and the presidency through more defensible, corporate-style financial activities.
