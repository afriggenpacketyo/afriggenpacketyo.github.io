          <p>Dan Norris, the Member of Parliament for North East Somerset and Hanham, has been suspended from the Labour Party following his arrest. A party spokesperson confirmed the suspension, stating they were informed of the arrest but could not provide further details due to the ongoing police investigation. The suspension also entails the removal of the party whip, preventing Norris from sitting as a Labour MP in the House of Commons. This action underscores the party's commitment to addressing the situation seriously while respecting the integrity of the legal process.</p>

          <p>House Republican leaders are pushing forward with President Donald Trump's agenda after the Senate passed its version of the budget resolution. Speaker Mike Johnson and his team aim to enact policies focused on deficit reduction, border security, tax cuts, energy dominance, and government efficiency. However, some House conservatives are threatening to oppose the bill due to concerns over spending cuts and mechanisms used to avoid factoring in the cost of extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts. Despite the internal GOP divisions, House leaders insist the Senate's passage allows them to work on their version, aiming for a bill on Trump's desk by May.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes the viral morning routine of fitness influencer Ashton Hall, who wakes up before dawn to engage in a rigid schedule of ice baths, skincare, meditation, and workouts. The piece questions whether this trend reflects a harmless side of hustle culture or a more insidious promotion of regressive ideas about masculinity. It argues that while Hall's approach may seem less overtly misogynistic than that of figures like Andrew Tate, it still reinforces a conservative gender philosophy where men are central and women are submissive. The author warns against dismissing such content as merely silly, suggesting it subtly normalizes patriarchal ideals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists are raising concerns about the formula used by President Donald Trump to calculate tariff rates, arguing that it is based on flawed assumptions. The formula, which determines tariff rates based on a country's trade deficit with the U.S. divided by its exports and then halved, is seen as inflating the actual tariff rates. Experts from the American Enterprise Institute and the Cato Institute suggest that the elasticity rate used in the formula is too low, leading to artificially high tariff rates. Adjusting the elasticity assumptions would result in significantly lower tariff rates for most countries.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors are requesting a sentence of over seven years for former U.S. Representative George Santos, citing his elaborate scheme of fraud and deceit. Santos is accused of defrauding donors, misleading voters, and falsifying campaign finance filings to advance his political career. The sentencing memo details how Santos, along with his former Campaign Treasurer Nancy Marks, fabricated donor contributions and laundered donor money through a fraudulent consulting firm, Redstone Strategies LLC. Santos pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, while his defense attorneys argue for a lighter sentence of no more than two years.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House to discuss the latest military operations in Gaza and the newly announced U.S. tariffs. The meeting occurs against the backdrop of increased Israeli military activity in Gaza, aimed at pressuring Hamas to release hostages, and new security corridors established by Israel. Hamas has warned that Israel's offensive is creating a dangerous situation for the remaining hostages, while Israel faces criticism for its blockade on food and aid to Gaza. The leaders previously met in February when Trump outlined a plan for the U.S. to "take over Gaza."</p>

          <p>Luis Enrique has successfully transformed Paris St-Germain by instilling a philosophy of structure, repetition, and positional discipline, moving away from a team solely reliant on individual stars. Despite initial doubts about coaching a team focused on big names like Neymar and Mbappe, Enrique took the job after the club shifted its focus to team building. He prioritized structure and team cohesion, even challenging star player Mbappe on his defensive duties. Enrique's approach, marked by intensity and a willingness to speak his mind, has led PSG to success, proving his belief that a team with the best structure can outperform a team with just the best players.</p>

          <p>As President Donald Trump's tariffs take effect, some U.S. consumers are rushing to purchase goods before prices increase, but experts caution against going into debt to do so. Economists predict that the tariffs will raise prices for everyday items and potentially lead to a recession. While stocking up on certain items may seem prudent, financial analysts advise consumers to only buy what they can afford and avoid accumulating debt. With many Americans already burdened by debt, experts emphasize the importance of taking a measured approach and considering long-term financial stability over panic buying.</p>

Cruz expressed concern that the tariffs and potential trade retaliation could damage the U.S. economy and cost jobs. He warned that if the U.S. faces a severe recession, voters would punish the party in power, potentially resulting in a Democrat-controlled House and Senate. Despite these concerns, Cruz emphasized his desire for the administration's policies to succeed, albeit with a focus on lowering tariffs both domestically and abroad.</p>

          <p>Economic experts are challenging President Donald Trump's claim that his recently announced tariffs are "reciprocal" and based on sound economic principles. The formula used to calculate the tariffs, dividing a nation's trade deficit with the U.S. by the value of its imports and then halving the result, is viewed as flawed and misleading. Experts argue that this method misrepresents the actual tariff rates and does not align with established economic understanding of trade deficits.

          <p>President Donald Trump's new tariffs, including a 25% hike on goods from South Korea, are threatening the K-beauty industry's affordability and appeal in the United States. With cosmetics becoming a significant part of Korea's exports, the tariffs could impact both Korean companies and American consumers who have embraced K-beauty products for their quality and unique ingredients. Some brands are considering relocating manufacturing to the U.S. to avoid the tariffs, while others are weighing the impact on their long-standing policies of keeping products affordable. The situation tests the strength of the K-beauty brand in America and its ability to withstand price increases.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is temporarily halting shipments of its UK-made cars to the US for a month to assess the impact of Donald Trump’s newly imposed tariffs. The 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks, effective April 3, has prompted JLR to enact short-term actions while developing mid- to longer-term plans. This pause in shipments adds to concerns about the potential impact of tariffs on Britain’s car industry, which relies heavily on exports to the US. Britain is focusing on securing a trade deal with Washington, but the tariff situation presents a significant challenge to the sector.</p>

          <p>Argentinian President Javier Milei doubled down on his support for Donald Trump by attending an event at Mar-a-Lago, even as the world reacted negatively to Trump's new tariffs. Milei, who has implemented a sweeping austerity program in Argentina, sees himself as a strong ally of Trump in the global culture war. While other countries criticized the tariffs, Milei's government downplayed their impact, framing Argentina as receiving preferential treatment. The move highlights Milei's close relationship with Trump and his efforts to secure a $20 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is arguing that a federal judge lacks the authority to order the return of a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Government attorneys are urging an appeals court to suspend the judge's ruling, asserting that it is constitutionally intolerable to force the Executive branch to engage with a foreign power in a certain way. Abrego Garcia, who had been granted protection from deportation, was mistakenly sent to El Salvador despite a previous ruling in his favor. The White House has described the deportation as an "administrative error."</p>
