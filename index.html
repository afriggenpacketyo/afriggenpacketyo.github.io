          <h2>New Biography Explores Jackie Kennedy's Concerns Over Marilyn Monroe</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new biography by J. Randy Taraborrelli claims that while Jackie Kennedy was aware of her husband's infidelities, she viewed his connection to Marilyn Monroe as uniquely threatening. The book alleges Jackie warned President John F. Kennedy that Monroe "could be trouble," prompting her to skip his 1962 birthday celebration where the actress famously sang. However, the author also presents testimony from Monroe's publicist, Pat Newcomb, who disputes the long-rumored affair, suggesting it may have been a figment of Monroe's imagination.</p>

Some market analysts also believe President Trump's tariff actions may ultimately be less severe than his initial threats, though fears of a future downturn persist due to the high valuation of stocks.

          <p>An Apple Valley, California mother, Nauzhae Drake, has given birth to all four of her children on the same date: July 7th.

          <p>Four people, including a husband and wife, have been arrested in Fort White, Florida, on charges of aggravated child abuse involving nine children. The children, aged 7 to 16, were allegedly kept in plywood cages under bunk beds, beaten with canes, and sprayed with vinegar as punishment. An investigation began after a church member raised concerns, revealing that the adopted children in the home were treated unfairly compared to the biological children. All children have since been removed from the home.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Official's Remarks on Ancient Kingdoms Rekindle Historical Sensitivities with South Korea</h2>

          <p>Recent comments by a senior official in China's Jilin province have reignited a long-standing historical dispute with South Korea. The official called for a clear presentation of the history of ancient kingdoms that existed in the region, referring to them by their Chinese names (Fuyu, Gaogouli, Bohai) rather than their Korean ones (Buyeo, Goguryeo, Balhae). This issue touches on sensitive nationalist interpretations of history, as both China and Korea claim these kingdoms as part of their own heritage.</p>
