          <p>Former President Trump has pardoned Paul Walczak, a Florida health care executive, who was recently sentenced to 18 months in prison for tax crimes. Walczak's mother, Elizabeth Fago, played a role in attempting to publicize Ashley Biden’s diary during the 2020 presidential campaign. Fago, a longtime Republican donor, was contacted by someone in possession of the diary, which contained sensitive information about Biden's daughter. The pardon comes shortly after Walczak was ordered to pay nearly $4.4 million in restitution for using the illicit funds to finance a lavish lifestyle.</p>
