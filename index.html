          <p>An alleged leader of Italy's powerful 'ndrangheta mafia, identified as Giuseppe Palermo, has been arrested in Colombia. Palermo was wanted under an Interpol red notice for allegedly overseeing significant cocaine shipments from Latin America to Europe. The coordinated operation involved Colombian, Italian, and British authorities, along with Europol. This arrest highlights the global reach of the 'ndrangheta and ongoing international efforts to dismantle its extensive drug trafficking networks, which are a primary source of cocaine entering Europe.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Twins shortstop Carlos Correa was forced to leave a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates after sustaining an ankle injury during a play at second base. The incident occurred when a sliding runner's head collided with Correa's ankle, causing it to turn awkwardly. The team later announced the injury as a mild ankle sprain, a concerning development for the star player who has a history of injuries. While Correa has not been performing at his typical high standards this season, his absence could still pose a significant challenge for the Twins.</p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek won her first Wimbledon championship in a commanding performance, defeating American Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-0 in just 57 minutes. This historic win marked the first "double bagel" in a Wimbledon women's final since 1911, showcasing Swiatek's mastery on what was once considered her weakest surface. The victory gives the 24-year-old Polish star her sixth Grand Slam title and makes her the youngest woman since Serena Williams to win majors on all three surfaces. Anisimova, playing in her first Grand Slam final, struggled with nerves throughout the match.</p>

          <p>Police in the UK have arrested fifty-five people at protests in London and Cardiff opposing the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. Most arrests were on suspicion of showing support for the banned group, which became a criminal offense under the Terrorism Act. The government proscribed the group following a series of direct-action protests targeting arms companies, including an incident where activists painted military aircraft. Critics, however, argue that the government is misusing terror legislation and question whether the group's actions meet the definition of terrorism.</p>

          <p>Two fathers are initiating a judicial review against the UK government's guidance on smartphones in schools, arguing for a complete ban. They contend that the current policy, which allows headteachers to set their own rules, is unlawful and fails to protect children from dangers like cyberbullying and exposure to harmful content. Citing numerous safeguarding incidents reported by schools, the fathers believe a statutory ban is necessary for child safety. The Department for Education maintains that schools already have the power to ban phones and points to the Online Safety Act for broader online protection.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report into the fatal Air India Flight 171 crash has revealed a puzzling detail from the cockpit voice recorder. Just seconds after takeoff, both of the Boeing 787's fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position, starving the engines of fuel. The recording captures one pilot asking the other why he cut the fuel, with the other denying he did so, leaving the action unexplained. While the switches were moved back to the run position, the engines did not have enough time to recover power before the crash. This finding deepens the mystery surrounding the disaster.</p>

          <p>In response to the ongoing trade war, companies are increasingly utilizing U.S. Customs-sanctioned Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to mitigate the financial impact of tariffs. These designated areas allow businesses to import components and materials duty-free, with taxes only being collected after a finished product enters U.S. commerce. This strategy helps preserve cash flow by delaying or, in the case of re-exported goods, avoiding duty payments entirely.

          <p>An investigation found that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) repeatedly granted appeals to remove buildings at Camp Mystic from its 100-year flood map in the years before a catastrophic flood killed 27 people. These exemptions from the "Special Flood Hazard Area" designation loosened regulations and insurance requirements as the camp expanded in a region known as "flash flood alley." Experts find it disturbing that a camp responsible for children would seek and receive exemptions from basic flood regulations, raising questions about the adequacy of FEMA's mapping and appeals process.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Military experts suggest Russia's recent escalation of drone and missile attacks on Ukraine is a strategic effort to overwhelm air defenses and terrorize the civilian population. This campaign is enabled by a significant expansion in Russia's domestic drone production, reducing its reliance on foreign suppliers like Iran, although it still receives components from China and missiles from North Korea. Many analysts view these intensified strikes as preparation for a potential new summer offensive. The goal is to cripple Ukraine's military-industrial complex and pressure its government by demoralizing the public.</p>

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that while the EU remains ready to negotiate a deal, it will take all necessary steps, including "proportionate countermeasures," if required. Leaders from France, Germany, and the Netherlands echoed this sentiment, calling the U.S. move concerning but emphasizing EU unity and resolve.

          <p>A panel on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" analyzed the Trump administration's approach to federal disaster response, using the recent deadly floods in central Texas as a case study. Panelists noted that while the administration can be effective at mobilizing resources, it often diverges from past presidents' approaches by de-emphasizing personal connection and empathy with victims on the ground. The discussion highlighted a strategy that relies more heavily on state and local officials, scaling back the direct federal role. This reflects a different philosophy on the function of the federal government during emergencies.</p>

This led him to leave a knife sheath at the scene, which contained the DNA evidence that directly led investigators to his arrest.

However, political science experts are skeptical about its potential for success in winning congressional seats. According to the article, historical precedent shows that third parties in the U.S. rarely gain significant power but can succeed by disrupting the political landscape and pressuring the main parties on specific issues. The venture also faces challenges due to Musk's high public unfavorability rating and a lack of a clear party platform.</p>

While NASA's Artemis program still leads on paper with a 2027 target for a crewed landing, it faces significant technical hurdles.
