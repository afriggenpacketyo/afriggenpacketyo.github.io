        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>BP's shares initially surged following reports of potential acquisition talks with Shell, but the gains were later tempered by Shell's denial of any ongoing discussions. The Wall Street Journal initially reported the early-stage talks, leading to a 10% jump in BP's stock price, while Shell's spokesperson dismissed the reports as "market speculation." Sources suggest that if a deal were to materialize, BP would likely be split and sold in pieces to multiple companies rather than being acquired in its entirety by Shell, given its underperformance compared to its rivals. BP has faced challenges in defining its strategic direction over the past five years, particularly in balancing its renewable energy investments with its oil and gas ventures. Optimism surrounding BP's future is mixed, given the conflicting reports and strategic uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite macroeconomic challenges like Middle East tensions and higher tariffs, Rieder remains optimistic about the prospects for stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is suing all 15 judges in Maryland's federal court, challenging their policy of automatically pausing certain immigration cases. The Trump administration argues that the court's standing order, which grants temporary administrative injunctions in cases brought by undocumented immigrants, constitutes judicial overreach. The court implemented the policy to manage a high volume of cases involving detained immigrants seeking to prevent deportation, ensuring the "status quo" is maintained. The lawsuit requests that the judges recuse themselves and transfer the case to another court district. The Trump administration's mass deportation agenda has faced legal challenges from immigrants using U.S. immigration laws.</p>

          <p>President Trump is challenging an early Pentagon intelligence report that suggested limited damage to Iran's nuclear program following U.S. airstrikes, claiming instead that there was "total obliteration" of the facilities. He asserted that additional intelligence and eyewitness accounts support his claim, contradicting the initial assessment that Iran was able to relocate enriched uranium stocks before the strikes. Trump also criticized news reports about the Pentagon's assessment, arguing they demeaned the American pilots who carried out the strikes. While downplaying the need for further negotiations with Iran, Trump suggested that discussions would occur soon and a potential agreement might be reached. The debate centers on the effectiveness of the strikes and the long-term impact on Iran's nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>Emil Bove, a former defense attorney for President Trump and current DOJ official, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding his nomination for a federal judgeship. Bove refuted accusations that he acted as Trump's "henchman," asserting that he stands up for what he believes is right. The hearing was prompted by a whistleblower complaint alleging that Bove advised the DOJ to defy judicial orders related to immigration enforcement. Democrats on the committee expressed frustration over Bove's repeated invocations of privilege to avoid answering questions about his actions at the DOJ, including the dropping of corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The controversy centers on Bove's aggressive enforcement of Trump's political agenda at the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>Voice of America (VOA) reportedly aired President Trump's message to the Iranian people in Farsi during recent military strikes, according to Trump's senior advisor Kari Lake. Lake's testimony suggests a shift in VOA's role from providing broader U.S. policy context to serving as a direct conduit for presidential messaging. This revelation comes shortly after the White House authorized the termination of hundreds of VOA employees, marking the final phase of Trump's efforts to dismantle the broadcasting service. Lake argued that Trump aims to eliminate VOA as an independent agency, claiming it is disrespectful to American taxpayers and suggesting its functions be folded back into the State Department. The situation raises concerns about the independence and objectivity of the broadcasting service.</p>

Marte's mother passed away in a car accident in 2017, and the personal nature of the taunt deeply affected him, with teammates and the manager offering support.

This figure is also 6.3% lower than the sales recorded in May 2024, falling below both the six-month and one-year averages, and the pre-pandemic average of 2019. The decline in sales led to a substantial increase in the supply of new homes, reaching 507,000 units by the end of May, representing a 9.8-month supply, which is the highest level since the summer of 2022. High mortgage rates, which remained near 7% throughout May, contributed to the decrease in affordability and buyer activity, as noted by homebuilders and economists, impacting the housing market.</p>

The panel's decisions on vaccine recommendations are highly influential, affecting which vaccines insurers cover and the public's access. The new chair, Dr. Martin Kulldorff, criticized media scrutiny and defended the panel's critical inquiry.

The space agency said the bedrock below these ridges likely formed when groundwater trickled through the rock, leaving behind minerals that accumulated in cracks and fissures. The ridges, which resemble spiderweb patterns from space, had previously only been observed from orbit. The ridges have small fractures filled with calcium sulfate, left behind by groundwater, which had not been found before in this part of Mount Sharp.</p>

The ruling states that the FAIR Plan's policy, which requires "direct physical loss" defined by "permanent physical changes," is less favorable than the state's Standard Form Fire Insurance Policy. Rex Frazier, president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California, warned that the ruling could lead to increased costs for the FAIR Plan.

          <p>The United States is experiencing a substantial decline in its prison population, projected to fall by roughly 60 percent from its peak in 2009 to approximately 600,000 inmates. This decline is attributed to the aging out of a high-crime generation and a decrease in criminal activity among younger populations. While COVID-19 initially accelerated decarceration efforts, crime spikes in 2020 threatened to reverse this trend, but recent data confirms a continued downward trajectory. Experts recommend policies such as halting prison construction and facilitating compassionate release for elderly and ill inmates to further accelerate this trend, resulting in significant financial savings and societal benefits.</p>

The article emphasizes the importance of paying the full statement balance by the due date every month to avoid interest charges and offers practical tips for maximizing the grace period, such as automating payments, tracking billing cycles, and avoiding cash advances.

          <p>Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez are set to marry in Venice, but the event has faced criticism and protests from local groups. The wedding was initially planned in the center of Venice, but was moved to a less accessible hall outside the center due to potential disruptions. Protest groups, including Greenpeace, are planning demonstrations to highlight the environmental impact of the event, particularly the numerous private jets flying in for the occasion. Emma Brockes questions Bezos's choice of Sánchez, and the aesthetic that many women inside the Maga world seem enthusiastically to have taken up as the norm.</p>

          <p>The UK government's plan to cut working-age welfare by £5bn annually by the end of the decade is facing opposition from Labour MPs. The reforms include making it harder to access Personal Independence Payments (Pip) and cutting incapacity benefits. The government argues these changes are necessary to control rising welfare costs, projecting the number of Pip claimants to increase significantly. Critics argue the cuts will push more people into poverty, with estimates suggesting an additional 250,000 people, including 50,000 children, will be affected by 2030.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government, under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is targeting emulsifiers, substances used in processed foods to create desired textures, as part of a broader effort to remove food additives linked to health concerns. The "Make America Healthy Again" report groups emulsifiers with other additives, suggesting they contribute to chronic health problems, particularly gut health. While emulsifiers serve essential culinary functions by blending ingredients that don't mix well, such as oil and vinegar, concerns are rising about their potential impact on the gut microbiome. The research on emulsifiers' health effects is ongoing, and experts emphasize the need for more comprehensive dietary changes to improve overall health.</p>
