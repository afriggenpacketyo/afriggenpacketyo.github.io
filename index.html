        <h2>Sudan Rejects US Request to Resettle Palestinians from Gaza</h2>

        <p>Sudanese officials rejected a US request to discuss accepting Palestinians displaced under Trump's Gaza plan.  The US and Israel contacted Sudan, Somalia, and Somaliland about resettlement, despite international opposition and practical challenges. Sudanese officials confirmed the request, stating it was immediately rejected. Trump's plan involves permanently displacing Gaza's residents for large-scale reconstruction, a move considered illegal under international law.  Other potential destinations, including Egypt and Jordan, also opposed the plan.  Palestinians and Arab nations have proposed an alternative.</p>
