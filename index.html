        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major wildfire, sparked by a car fire and fanned by strong winds, has reached the edge of Marseille, France's second-largest city. Firefighters are engaged in what the mayor described as "guerrilla warfare" to control the blaze, which has consumed approximately 700 hectares. In response to the "apocalyptic" scene, Marseille Provence airport has been closed, and residents in affected areas have been urged to stay indoors or evacuate. The event is part of a broader pattern of wildfires across a heatwave-stricken Europe, with significant blazes also reported in Spain and Greece, highlighting the region's vulnerability to extreme weather conditions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will send additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to aid in its defense against Russia, reversing a recent pause in shipments. President Trump stated the necessity of the aid, emphasizing that Ukrainians "have to be able to defend themselves" against intense attacks. The decision follows criticism from the president regarding Russia's strikes on Ukrainian cities, which he described as crossing a line. While the White House had previously halted some shipments over concerns about depleting U.S. stockpiles, the new support aims to bolster Ukraine's defenses while diplomatic efforts for a lasting peace continue.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Washington, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he is nominating U.S. President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing their joint efforts, including recent strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. The meeting also focused on a potential 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, with Trump expressing optimism about an agreement. However, Netanyahu reiterated his opposition to an independent Palestinian state, stating that while Palestinians should have self-governance, Israel must retain overall security control. The visit occurs amid ongoing regional conflicts, including deadly Houthi attacks in the Red Sea and the deaths of five Israeli soldiers in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The role of artificial intelligence in education is under scrutiny, with experts questioning if tools like ChatGPT improve or harm knowledge retention. While AI can offer personalized learning experiences that may boost engagement, recent studies suggest over-reliance on it can lead to superficial understanding. Research from the University of Pennsylvania indicates that students using AI for answers showed weaker comprehension compared to those using traditional research methods. The core issue appears to be a reduction in the active engagement and critical thinking necessary for deep learning, prompting a call for a balanced approach where AI supplements, rather than replaces, traditional educational efforts.</p>

Despite visible frustration, the title favorite managed to regain her composure, clinching the next two sets 6-2, 6-4 to secure her spot in the semi-finals. The hard-fought victory, lasting nearly three hours, keeps Sabalenka's hopes alive for her first Wimbledon title, where she will now face American Amanda Anisimova.</p>

          <p>The 2018 murder of Aileen Seiden in a Florida motel room unraveled a complex and violent "throuple" relationship involving herself, Zachary Abell, and Christina Araujo. Investigators connected Seiden's body, found dumped by a highway, to a bloody scene in Room 15 of the Sportsman's Lodge Motel. The investigation revealed a tumultuous dynamic fueled by jealousy, alcohol, and physical abuse among the three. Ultimately, Araujo took a plea deal, testifying that Abell led the fatal beating. Abell's defense argued Araujo was the sole murderer, driven by jealousy. A jury found Abell guilty of second-degree murder, and he was sentenced to life in prison.</p>

          <p>The death toll from the catastrophic flash floods in central Texas has risen to at least 107, with an unknown number of people still missing. Search and rescue teams face difficult conditions, combing through mud and debris as more rain threatens the region, diminishing hopes of finding more survivors. A Christian girls' summer camp, Camp Mystic, confirmed that at least 27 of its campers and staff were among the deceased. The White House has pushed back against claims that budget cuts to the National Weather Service hampered the response, calling the event an "act of God" and stating the agency did its job by issuing timely warnings.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for Taliban Supreme Leader Haibatullah Akhundzada and chief justice Abdul Hakim Haqqani. The court found "reasonable grounds" to believe they have committed crimes against humanity through the systematic persecution of women and girls in Afghanistan since their 2021 takeover. The Taliban regime has imposed severe restrictions, barring girls from education beyond age 12 and excluding women from many jobs, which the UN has likened to "gender apartheid." The Taliban, which does not recognize the ICC's authority, condemned the warrants as hostile, while human rights groups have lauded the move as a step towards justice.</p>

The 48-year-old man was born in a clandestine detention center to activist parents, Graciela Alicia Romero and Raul Eugenio Metz, who were arrested and never seen again. His identity was confirmed through DNA testing after an anonymous tip, allowing him to connect with his older sister, who was raised by their grandparents.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's new budget bill, which includes over $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, is expected to have a varied impact on the pharmaceutical industry. While the cuts will affect millions of Americans' health coverage, their financial effect on drugmakers depends on each company's exposure to the Medicaid market. According to an analysis by Leerink Partners, companies like Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Gilead, which derive a significant portion of their U.S. revenue from Medicaid, may be more affected. Conversely, companies such as Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer have lower exposure. The financial impact is not immediate, as significant cuts are not expected until 2027. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new trend dubbed "revenge saving" is taking hold as economic anxieties cause many Americans, particularly younger generations, to shift from post-pandemic splurging to more aggressive saving. A survey by Intuit Credit Karma found that 44% of Americans have adjusted their financial habits based on their "vibe" about the economy, with many feeling more anxious than a year ago. Financial experts advise that while saving is positive, it should be intentional rather than purely emotional. They recommend strategies like "reverse budgeting," where savings goals are prioritized first, and using separate, appropriate accounts for different goals like emergencies and retirement to build financial security effectively.</p>

The money grows tax-deferred in a diversified stock index fund and can be withdrawn for specific purposes like higher education or a first home purchase after the child turns 18.

This has drawn criticism for appearing to protect powerful individuals and has led to only one person, Ghislaine Maxwell, being imprisoned for what was a vast sex trafficking operation. The article argues that while conspiracy theories should be avoided, it is a fact that many influential people enabled Epstein's crimes, either directly or by looking the other way.

According to a State Department cable, the impostor contacted at least five individuals, including three foreign ministers, a U.S. governor, and a member of Congress, using the Signal messaging app. The goal of the scam was likely to gain access to sensitive information or accounts. The State Department has confirmed it is investigating the incident, which highlights the growing and sophisticated threat of AI-driven impersonation targeting government agencies and powerful officials.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's social media platform, X, has stated that the Indian government ordered it to block 2,355 accounts within the country, including those of the news agency Reuters. X's global government affairs account posted that India's IT Ministry demanded the immediate action without providing justification. This is the latest escalation in an ongoing legal and ideological clash between X and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government over online censorship. X sued the Indian government in March over what it calls unlawful content removal demands, while Musk continues to champion his "free speech absolutist" stance.</p>

          <p>Gregg Wallace has been dismissed as the presenter of the BBC's "MasterChef" following an inquiry into alleged misconduct, with 50 more people now coming forward with fresh claims. The new allegations include accusations of groping and indecent exposure, which Wallace denies. In a statement, Wallace admitted some of his past humor and language were inappropriate but claimed an independent report cleared him of the most serious allegations. The claims, spanning many years and various productions, raise significant questions about safeguarding practices at the BBC and the production companies he worked for, particularly concerning the treatment of junior female staff.</p>

          <p>The UK's state pension "triple lock" policy is projected to cost £15.5 billion annually by 2030, three times the government's initial estimate, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). The triple lock guarantees the state pension rises each year by the highest of inflation, wage growth, or 2.5%. The OBR's report warns that the UK's public finances are in a "vulnerable position," with rising pension costs and recent government U-turns on spending cuts contributing to growing national debt. This long-term pressure suggests the current array of spending promises is unsustainable without changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that Canada's decision to back down from its digital services tax after threats of retaliatory tariffs from the Trump administration represents a blow to national sovereignty and the rule of law. The author contends that digital taxes are a fair and efficient way for countries to ensure that multinational tech giants, who often shift profits to avoid taxation, pay their fair share. President Trump's aggressive tactics, labeling the tax an "attack on our country," are described as ignorant of economics and a use of brute force. Canada's submission is seen as setting a dangerous precedent, undermining international agreements and reinforcing a "law of the jungle" in global trade. (not investment advice)</p>

In the poll, the U.S. was more frequently named as a country's most important ally than China was. However, the U.S. was also more likely to be cited as the greatest threat. In eight countries, including Canada and Indonesia, the United States was the most commonly mentioned threat, compared to just three countries where China was seen as the top threat. This dual perception was particularly stark in nations like Brazil, Canada, and Mexico, where respondents cited the U.S. as both their primary ally and their biggest threat.</p>

The proposal, seen as a compromise, would enable a draft if the "defense situation requires it" and volunteer numbers are insufficient. The plan also aims to make voluntary service more appealing with significantly higher pay, hoping to increase the number of active soldiers and reservists to meet new NATO guidelines. This move comes in response to Europe's changed security landscape following Russia's aggression, and it reopens a debate in Germany, where compulsory military service was suspended in 2011.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of the deadly Texas floods, conspiracy theories blaming "cloud seeding" for the disaster have spread online, amplified by some political figures. The theory suggests that weather modification operations caused or exacerbated the rainfall. However, meteorological experts and scientists have unequivocally debunked this claim, stating it is physically impossible for cloud seeding to create a storm system of that magnitude. Experts explain that cloud seeding can only slightly enhance rainfall in existing clouds and cannot generate the trillions of gallons of water seen in the floods. Any particles from recent operations would have dispersed long before the storm hit.</p>

The White House stated the move is part of a "reciprocal" tariff agenda and that more notices will be sent to other countries shortly.

After comfortably winning the first two sets, Fritz experienced a significant dip in the third and went down a break in the fourth, but he managed to rally and regain his focus. The No. 5 seed overcame the momentum shift and a faulty electronic line-call to win the match in a fourth-set tie-break.
