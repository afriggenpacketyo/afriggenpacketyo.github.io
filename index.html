            <h2>Former FIA CEO Natalie Robyn Voices Concerns Over Leadership Challenges</h2>

            <p>Natalie Robyn, the former CEO of the FIA, has broken her silence to express serious concerns regarding the leadership and direction of the organization under Ben Sulayem. Robyn's criticisms, along with Reid's resignation, highlight growing unease about Sulayem's management style and strategic decisions. One key point of contention is Sulayem's proposal to abandon the 2026 engine rules in Formula 1, a plan that faces opposition from major engine manufacturers. These developments raise questions about Sulayem's future and the upcoming FIA presidential election in December, though insiders suggest his support remains strong. The FIA's attempt to future-proof the sport also clashes with manufacturers' preferences.</p>

            <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated that the company is still assessing the impact of President Trump's tariffs, but he anticipates that third-party sellers on Amazon will likely pass the increased costs on to consumers. Jassy mentioned that Amazon has implemented strategic inventory buys and renegotiated purchase order terms to mitigate price increases. This statement comes as President Trump's administration continues to implement and adjust tariff policies, impacting businesses and consumers alike. The ultimate effect on consumer prices remains to be seen as sellers adapt to the changing trade landscape.</p>

            <p>Global bond yields experienced a sharp reversal following President Trump's announcement of a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, as equity markets rebounded. The U.K. bond market was particularly affected, with yields on 30-year bonds plummeting after a significant spike. Analysts attribute the bond market's shift to a reassessment of monetary policy and profit-taking by leveraged investors. Despite the pause, uncertainty remains regarding future trade deals and China's response, leading to continued market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 2.4% in March, slightly below economists' forecasts, indicating some progress in the Federal Reserve's efforts to control inflation. Lower fuel prices contributed to the easing of inflation, but experts caution that recent and delayed tariffs orchestrated by President Trump could lead to a resurgence later in the year. Analysts anticipate that the Federal Reserve will likely maintain current interest rates at its upcoming meeting in May due to the ongoing inflationary risks. Economists are forecasting a rate reduction at the Fed's June meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits saw a slight increase last week, but the labor market remains generally stable despite the ongoing trade war. Jobless claims filings edged up by 4,000 to 223,000 for the week ending April 5, which is still below analysts' expectations. Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered a proxy for layoffs, and have mostly ping-ponged between 200,000 and 250,000 for the past few years.

            <p>Consumer price inflation eased more than expected in March, with the annual rate falling to 2.4%, down from 2.8% in February, as President Trump prepared to launch tariffs against U.S. trading partners. A decline in energy prices, particularly gasoline, contributed to the tame inflation figures. However, the report comes amid concerns about the potential inflationary impact of tariffs, with Trump announcing a delay in the most aggressive duties while increasing tariffs on China.

While European markets also saw significant gains, Chinese shares experienced more moderate increases due to the continued tariff pressures from both nations.

The top imports from the U.S. in 2023 were oilseeds and grains, followed by oil and gas. Other significant imports include pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, aerospace products, and motor vehicles.

            <p>The Trump administration's tariff policies have generated numerous questions regarding their legality, objectives, and impact on consumers and the economy. Tariffs are legal under WTO rules but can act as a tax on businesses and consumers, potentially raising prices and slowing economic growth. The administration aims to pressure countries into favorable trade deals, encourage domestic manufacturing, and generate federal revenue. Experts debate whether these tariffs will strengthen the U.S. economy in the long term or cause temporary disruption and a potential recession.</p>

            <p>China's Foreign Ministry has condemned President Trump's decision to raise tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%, calling it a move against the world and asserting that it will fail. The ministry stated that Beijing's response will safeguard the Chinese economy and uphold the common interests of the international community. This escalation follows Trump's decision to pause tariffs on other countries while increasing duties on Chinese products. China maintains that it does not want a trade war but will not fear it if it comes their way.</p>

            <p>The world's most popular gadgets, including iPhones, could become more expensive in the US due to President Trump's tariffs on goods imported from China. Analysts estimate that if costs incurred by tariffs are passed onto consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise significantly. Apple is reportedly trying to diversify its supply chains to avoid over-reliance on China, and India may benefit from an iPhone manufacturing boost. Apple has not revealed yet whether they plan to pass on the costs of the tariffs onto consumers in the US and increase prices.</p>

            <p>Indie icons Pulp have announced a new album, More, and shared their first single in almost 24 years, called Spike Island. Frontman Jarvis Cocker said the band was tempted back into the studio by the overwhelming response to their 2023 reunion tour. The new single was inspired by the infamous Stone Roses concert at Spike Island in 1990. The album, More, will be released on June 6 and is dedicated to Pulp's former bassist Steve Mackey, who died in 2023. The video for Spike Island uses AI to animate the cardboard cut-out figures on the cover of Pulp's biggest album, Different Class.</p>

            <p>Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap will be available for £30m this summer due to a relegation release clause, triggered by his club's likely return to the Championship.

Manager Kieran McKenna has accepted that relegation "looks more than likely", making Delap's release clause look like good value.</p>

The department plans to eliminate 2,100 of its 6,500 positions over the next two years through voluntary redundancies, non-replacement of departing staff, and transfers to other departments. These cuts are expected to save £110m annually by 2028. Civil service union Prospect warned that such drastic cuts could negatively impact government service delivery.</p>

            <p>President Trump and Defense Secretary Hegseth are proposing a record US$1 trillion military budget, a significant increase from the US$892 billion allocated this year. This move reflects a long-term strategic plan to boost military deterrence against China. However, observers believe it does not pose an imminent threat to Beijing. The increased budget contrasts with sweeping federal spending cuts ordered since Trump's return to office. This coincides with escalating tariffs, heightening fears of further decoupling between the US and Chinese economies and rising geopolitical risks.</p>
