          <p>Cosmetic company E.l.f. Beauty announced a 30% drop in profits for its fiscal first quarter, attributing the decline to new tariffs on Chinese imports. With about 75% of its products sourced from China, the company is facing significant financial pressure and has withheld its full-year revenue guidance due to the volatile economic environment. Despite the profit fall, E.l.f. exceeded Wall Street's expectations for revenue and adjusted earnings per share, demonstrating some resilience. The company is raising prices and diversifying its supply chain to mitigate the ongoing impact of the trade duties.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, savers are weighing the benefits of different high-yield accounts for a $10,000 investment. A comparison shows that a 6-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) currently offers slightly higher returns than a money market account due to its fixed interest rate. While money market accounts provide more liquidity, their variable rates are expected to decline with anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts. The article concludes that for those prioritizing maximum guaranteed earnings over immediate access to funds, a CD presents a more predictable and potentially more profitable option over the next six months.

          <p>Apple, in conjunction with President Trump, announced an additional $100 billion investment in its U.S. operations over the next four years, bringing its total commitment to $600 billion. The initiative includes a new "American Manufacturing Program" aimed at strengthening its domestic supply chain with partners like Corning, Texas Instruments, and GlobalFoundries. A key part of this expansion is a $2.5 billion investment with Corning to produce all glass for iPhones and Apple Watches in the United States. This move comes as Apple navigates increased tariff pressures and seeks to reshore critical component manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Florida Power & Light (FPL) is seeking approval for a nearly $10 billion rate hike over the next four years, a proposal that could be the largest in U.S. history. The utility argues the increase is necessary to maintain grid reliability, diversify energy sources, and cover costs for new solar and battery storage facilities. However, environmental groups and consumer advocates are pushing back, arguing the hike would place a significant financial burden on residents and disproportionately benefit FPL's shareholders. The Florida Public Service Commission will hold hearings to decide on the proposal, which could raise typical customer bills significantly by 2029.</p>

After an initial $500 fine for comments on TikTok, she was fined $1,500 for further remarks on her podcast where she called the officiating inconsistent. Cunningham acknowledged the difficulty of the referees' job but stood by her critique of what she perceived as obvious missed calls. The incidents follow a period of increased attention on Cunningham after she defended teammate Caitlin Clark during a contentious game.</p>

          <p>An active-duty sergeant, identified as Quornelius Radford, allegedly opened fire on his coworkers at Fort Stewart, Georgia, wounding five soldiers before being subdued by other service members. The suspect used his personal handgun in the attack, and all victims are reported to be in stable condition and expected to recover. Officials stated that the soldiers who tackled the gunman undoubtedly prevented further casualties. The motive for the shooting is still under investigation, but authorities do not believe it is related to terrorism or extremist beliefs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has suspended $584 million in federal research grants for the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), citing allegations of civil rights violations. The freeze on funding from agencies like the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy is tied to claims that the university fostered a hostile environment for Jewish students. UCLA's chancellor warned that the suspension would be "devastating" and halt life-saving research, while the UC system president argued the cuts do nothing to address antisemitism. The move follows a similar action against Columbia University and signals a broader administration strategy toward universities.</p>

The author argues this move, rooted in Kennedy's long-standing and unsubstantiated claims against mRNA technology, is a significant blow to U.S. pandemic preparedness. The piece highlights that mRNA technology was crucial for the rapid development of effective COVID-19 vaccines, saving millions of lives.

This article suggests improving one's attractiveness as a borrower by boosting credit scores and lowering debt-to-income ratios.

Three prominent House Democrats sent a letter to the Secretary of State expressing "grave concern" over the move, calling it a departure from precedent that sends a dangerous signal to Beijing.

          <p>This article explores the dilemma facing Democrats who have long championed independent, nonpartisan redistricting commissions. With Republicans aggressively redrawing maps in states like Texas to secure their House majority, Democrats are finding their good-government principles have put them at a strategic disadvantage. Now, Democrats in blue states like New York and California are considering measures to undo these reforms to counter the GOP's moves, though the process is far more complex than in Republican-controlled states. The situation has forced a reassessment of their long-held stance, with some arguing that the threat of permanent one-party control outweighs the value of independent redistricting.</p>

          <p>The White House has indicated that President Trump is open to a potential meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The development follows what Trump described as "highly productive" talks in Moscow between his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, and President Putin. The meeting was held just days before a Trump-imposed deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine or face further sanctions. While details remain vague, the discussions signal a potential new diplomatic push to end the war, which has been ongoing for over three years.</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams, now 45, is continuing her professional comeback, driven by a deep love for the sport. After a 16-month absence, she recently secured a WTA Tour-level victory and is now competing in the Cincinnati Open. Williams also revealed she has been battling fibroids for years, undergoing major surgery just a year ago, and is using her return to raise awareness about women's health issues. The seven-time Grand Slam champion says she is living life on her own terms and, while focused on the current U.S. swing, has not ruled out continuing to play.</p>

          <p>The city council of Rancho Palos Verdes has voted to permanently ban most new construction across a 715-acre area affected by severe landslide movement. The prohibition, which would affect around 400 homes and 130 vacant lots, aims to ensure public safety following two years of unprecedented ground shifts that have damaged homes and infrastructure. While the ban allows for repairs and like-for-like replacement of existing homes, it has faced opposition from some landowners. City officials emphasized that the decision is a necessary response to the significant and ongoing geological instability in the region.</p>

The incident marks a dangerous escalation in the political standoff over a proposed congressional map that would heavily favor the GOP.

The zoo defended the long-standing practice, stating that it provides a natural diet for animals like the European lynx and ensures nothing goes to waste. While dogs and cats are excluded, the program drew both outrage from those appalled at euthanizing healthy pets and support from others who saw it as a practical approach to animal husbandry.

The blaze, which is France's largest since 1949, has burned an area larger than Paris, killed at least one person, and forced thousands to evacuate. Over 2,000 firefighters are battling the fire, which officials warn could continue for several more days due to drought, high temperatures, and strong winds.

While Apple has been shifting some assembly to countries like India and Vietnam, this new commitment focuses on boosting its U.S.-based suppliers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's policy to revitalize the U.S. shipbuilding industry may conflict with its goal of increasing liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. A new mandate requires a progressively larger percentage of U.S. LNG exports, eventually reaching 15%, to be carried on U.S.-built ships. However, analysts point out that the U.S. currently lacks the capacity to build these specialized, expensive vessels at scale, as the industry has been dormant for decades. This could create a significant bottleneck, potentially hindering the fulfillment of new energy export deals and driving up costs for American energy. (not investment advice)</p>
