          <p>The Uvalde CISD school board has unanimously voted to release investigation records from the 2022 Robb Elementary mass shooting, ending 38 months of legal resistance. This decision follows a Fourth Court of Appeals ruling favoring news outlets seeking transparency regarding law enforcement's criticized response. Victims' families expressed that this long-overdue step is crucial for healing and ensuring such a tragedy never recurs. The board apologized for prior inaction, emphasizing a commitment to rebuilding trust through transparency.</p>

          <p>Over 5.2 million aboveground swimming pools from Bestway, Intex Recreation, and Polygroup are being recalled across the U.S. and Canada due to a serious drowning risk. Compression straps on these pools, sold since 2002, can create footholds for small children, allowing unsupervised access to the water. Nine children aged 22 months to 3 years old have drowned in the U.S. due to this design flaw. Consumers are urged to contact manufacturers for a free repair kit or drain the pools until fixed.</p>

          <p>The White House has excluded The Wall Street Journal from the press pool for President Donald Trump's upcoming trip to Scotland, citing 'fake and defamatory conduct.' This decision follows a WSJ report alleging Trump sent a suggestive birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which Trump has denied and sued the paper over for $10 billion. The White House Correspondents' Association urged the paper's reinstatement, condemning government retaliation against news outlets based on their reporting. This action raises concerns about press freedom and independent media.</p>

          <p>The monthly cost of renting a home in the UK has surged by £221 over the past three years, reaching an average of £1,283, according to property portal Zoopla. This significant increase, driven by high demand and limited supply, mirrors the rise in typical monthly mortgage repayments for homeowners. The pressure has forced some tenants to make job decisions based on local rent costs, and parents are increasingly supporting their adult children with living expenses. While the rate of increase has slowed, affordability remains a major challenge. (not investment advice)</p>

A cockpit voice recording captures one pilot asking why the 'cut-off' occurred, with the other denying it. This action led to total power loss, causing the plane to crash less than a minute after becoming airborne.

Examples from Canada and China indicate significant movement in removing such barriers, while the European Union's focus on defense spending may be hindering similar progress.

Initially, over 160 individuals were reported missing, but most were tourists who had left the area without notifying authorities. Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly confirmed that only three individuals remain unaccounted for. The flash floods tragically killed at least 135 people, primarily in Kerr County, highlighting the rapid and destructive nature of the water. This revision follows a common pattern in disaster aftermaths where initial missing counts are often inflated.</p>
