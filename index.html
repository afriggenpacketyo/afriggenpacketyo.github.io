          <p>A significant cyber-attack has crippled the check-in and baggage systems at several major European airports, including Heathrow and Brussels, leading to a second consecutive day of widespread disruption. The attack targeted the 'Muse' software from Collins Aerospace, forcing airlines to resort to manual processes like pen-and-paper check-ins and causing hundreds of flight delays and cancellations. While the system provider RTX is working to resolve the issue, there is no clear timeline for restoration, and authorities like the UK's National Cyber Security Centre are investigating the incident's full impact.</p>

Despite a strong offensive performance with 517 total yards, the Trojans' victory was complicated by defensive penalties that allowed the Spartans to remain competitive into the fourth quarter. Wide receiver Makai Lemon was a standout player, accounting for over half of the team's passing yards and scoring a crucial late-game touchdown that sealed the win for USC.</p>

          <p>Peter and Barbie Reynolds, a British couple in their 70s and 80s, have been released after nearly eight months of detention by the Taliban in Afghanistan and have returned to the UK. The couple, who had lived in the country for nearly two decades running a charitable training program, were detained in February for allegedly breaking Afghan laws. Their family had lobbied for their release, citing deteriorating health conditions, and expressed immense gratitude upon their reunion, though the couple has indicated a desire to eventually return to their work in Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>A 64-year-old man, Anibal Hernandez-Santana, has been arrested in connection with a drive-by shooting at the ABC10 television station in Sacramento. The suspect allegedly fired at least three rounds into the building's lobby on Friday, causing property damage but no injuries. After initially being arrested by local police and released on bail, Hernandez-Santana was taken back into custody by the FBI on a federal charge. The motive for the attack remains under investigation, and the incident has been condemned by officials as an attack on democracy and press freedom.</p>

As the country's property crisis leaves many commercial and residential buildings unfinished, their opulent sales halls and model apartments provide the perfect backdrop for popular urban romance dramas. This symbiotic relationship provides filmmakers with high-end locations while offering a new, albeit temporary, lease on life for these idle properties, contrasting sharply with the frustrations of homebuyers awaiting their unfinished flats.</p>

          <p>Premier League giants Arsenal and Manchester City are increasingly adopting a more direct, long-ball style of play, a tactic once associated with lower-league teams. This strategic shift is a response to the effectiveness of modern high-pressing defenses, which make building up play with short passes from the back riskier. By utilizing goalkeepers with strong kicking abilities to launch long passes, often targeting tall forwards in wide areas, these top teams can bypass the opposition's press, gain territory, and create unpredictable attacking opportunities, demonstrating a key evolution in elite football tactics.</p>

However, critics, including some Palestinian advocates, view it as a largely symbolic gesture that may not alter the reality of occupation or stop the conflict without being paired with concrete actions like sanctions or boycotts, and it risks a defiant reaction from Israel.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated his administration is actively trying to regain control of Bagram air base in Afghanistan, citing its strategic proximity to China's nuclear weapons development sites. This push has been swiftly rebuffed by both Beijing and the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan, who emphasized respect for Afghan sovereignty. Trump's remarks, made during a press conference in London, have raised concerns that the move could create a new flashpoint in the escalating rivalry between the United States and China, potentially destabilizing the region further.</p>
