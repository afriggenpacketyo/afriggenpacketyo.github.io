          <p>President Trump publicly pressured Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to cut interest rates by a full percentage point, despite a strong jobs report indicating a resilient economy. Trump argued that the cut would provide "rocket fuel" and lower borrowing costs, while also complaining that other global central banks have been lowering rates while the Fed has not. However, markets predict virtually no chance of a rate decrease following the Federal Open Market Committee's next meeting. Analysts worry that Trump's tariffs could cause a spike in inflation, complicating the Fed's decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence advances could significantly alter entry-level jobs for recent college graduates, potentially eliminating positions or reshaping them, according to experts. The CEO of Anthropic predicts AI could cut U.S. entry-level jobs by half within five years, and some companies are already investing heavily in AI to increase efficiency. While some analysts believe economic conditions are also contributing to current job woes, they acknowledge that AI poses a serious risk to white-collar entry-level tasks. Experts suggest that graduates may need to adapt by focusing on problem-solving and analysis skills and learning to use AI tools effectively.</p>

          <p>The U.S. job market showed resilience in May, adding 139,000 jobs, but hiring slowed as businesses expressed concerns about uncertainty related to President Trump's tariff policies.

Exceptions to the law exist for members of the U.S. Military and peace officers while on duty. The decision contrasts with a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which struck down a federal restriction banning firearm sales to those under 21.</p>

Trump responded by saying Musk had "lost his mind" and suggesting the termination of Musk's government contracts and subsidies. The conflict escalated with Musk backing calls for Trump's impeachment and criticizing his tariff policy, while Trump accused Musk of opposing the bill because it would remove tax credits for electric vehicles.

          <p>Suzuki Motor Corp. has temporarily halted production of its Swift compact hatchback due to China's export restrictions on rare-earth elements, marking the first suspension by a Japanese automaker tied to the curbs. The restrictions caused delays in procuring parts that use rare earths. China imposed export controls on seven types of rare-earth minerals in April as retaliation against U.S. tariffs, disrupting production in the United States and Europe. Suzuki plans to partially resume production from June 13 and fully resume from June 16.</p>

          <p>More retailers and food brands are offering products with fewer ingredients due to growing concern around ultra-processed food (UPF). Plant-based brand THIS launched a Super Superfoods range to address consumer hesitation about processed meat replacements.

Some companies simplify formulas and explore new technologies to create less processed products, while others, like ice cream brand Little Moons, maintain complex ingredient lists for product stability.

While President Trump's tariffs on new imported vehicles don't directly impact used car sales, they influence the used car market through changes in new vehicle prices and demand. Demand for used vehicles remains strong due to low inventory levels and consumers holding onto their vehicles longer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent Polish presidential election, narrowly won by Karol Nawrocki, highlights the power of blood-and-soil nationalism in democratic societies. The election was closely contested, with exit polls initially predicting a win for Rafał Trzaskowski, but the final results favored Nawrocki. The language of nationalism, focusing on trauma and victimization, proved more compelling to a significant portion of the population than Trzaskowski's optimistic message of a strong and empathetic Poland. This election underscores how small numbers of voters can decide the nature of the state and the future of democracy.</p>
