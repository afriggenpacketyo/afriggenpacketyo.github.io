          <p>During the ongoing government shutdown, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy expressed serious concern about air traffic controllers taking on second jobs like driving for Uber to make ends meet. He emphasized that he wants controllers focused on their single, high-stress job to ensure aviation safety, acknowledging the immense financial pressure they face while working without pay. The strain on essential workers has contributed to significant flight delays and cancellations, as the department prioritizes safety over operational capacity.</p>

The officers, who worked at the Charing Cross police station, were dismissed with immediate effect after an expedited hearing where the panel chair described their conduct as an "utter disgrace." This action is the first in a series of hearings for ten current or former officers implicated by the undercover report, which has damaged public confidence in the force.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reportedly canceled plans to deploy federal agents for a large-scale immigration operation in San Francisco following a conversation with Mayor Daniel Lurie. The mayor argued that a militarized presence would hinder the city's economic recovery and public safety efforts. The decision came after local and state officials, including California's governor, vowed strong legal challenges against any such deployment, de-escalating a potentially volatile confrontation between federal and local authorities.</p>

          <p>Shares in the French luxury group Kering saw a significant increase after the company reported a narrower sales decline in its third quarter than in the previous period. The improvement was largely attributed to a "sharp sequential improvement" at its flagship brand, Gucci, where sales fell 14% compared to a 25% plunge in the second quarter. The results suggest that the current CEO's turnaround strategy for the fashion giant may be starting to gain traction with consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece contends that such top-down industrial control mimics the state-owned enterprise models that the U.S. has historically opposed, betraying the legacy of American capitalism.
