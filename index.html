          <p>Japan's core inflation rate reached 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023, exceeding economists' expectations and surpassing April's 3.5%. Headline inflation was 3.5%, marking the 38th consecutive month above the Bank of Japan's 2% target. The "core-core" inflation rate, excluding fresh food and energy prices, increased to 3.3% from 3% the previous month, closely monitored by the BOJ. Despite holding rates steady at 0.5% earlier in the week, the central bank acknowledged the continued pass-through of wage increases to selling prices, supporting core inflation; however, the bank anticipates a slowdown in inflation due to an economic deceleration and Japan's GDP shrank 0.2% in the quarter ended March, reflecting declining exports.

          <p>Meta is aggressively pursuing AI talent, recently hiring Daniel Gross, CEO of Ilya Sutskever's Safe Superintelligence, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. Meta previously attempted to acquire Safe Superintelligence, valued at $32 billion, but Sutskever declined the offer. Gross and Friedman will join Meta, working on products under Alexandr Wang, while Meta gains a stake in NFDG, their venture capital firm. This move escalates the AI talent war, with Meta, Google, and OpenAI competing to develop powerful large language models and artificial general intelligence, and Meta has reportedly offered substantial signing bonuses to lure OpenAI employees.</p>

          <p>A listeria outbreak has led to a voluntary recall of ready-to-eat chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals sold at Kroger and Walmart. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service is investigating the outbreak, linking it to products made by FreshRealm, Inc. under the Home Chef and Marketside brands. The FDA reports that 17 illnesses, three deaths, and one fetal loss have been associated with the outbreak across 13 states. Consumers are urged not to consume the recalled products and to either throw them away or return them to the place of purchase.</p>

The JCPOA imposed restrictions on Iranâ€™s nuclear enrichment program in exchange for sanctions relief. President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the deal in 2018, arguing it was defective and did not prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Since then, Iran has reduced its breakout time, and the U.S. has imposed new sanctions.</p>

          <p>Europe is increasingly concerned about China's economic overcapacity, which is seen as a threat to European industries. Decades of overinvestment, state subsidies, and weak domestic consumption in China have created a situation where excess industrial output is being exported to Europe at discounted prices. European governments fear this could decimate industries, lead to job losses, and empower populist parties. The EU is urging Beijing to address these issues or face a backlash similar to that in the United States.</p>
