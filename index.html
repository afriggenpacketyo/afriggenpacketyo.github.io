          <p>Three former Memphis police officers, Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith, were acquitted of all state charges, including second-degree murder, in connection with the 2023 death of Tyre Nichols. The trial centered on the officers' actions during a traffic stop that escalated into violence, leading to Nichols' death from blunt force trauma. Prosecutors argued the officers used excessive force and failed to intervene, while the defense claimed Nichols resisted arrest and blamed another officer for the most violent acts. The jury watched extensive video footage of the incident from multiple angles before reaching their verdict, which resulted in relieved reactions from the defendants and their families.</p>

          <p>Jefferson Griffin, the Republican candidate for North Carolina's state Supreme Court, conceded to Democratic Justice Allison Riggs, ending a six-month effort to overturn the election results.

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has proposed several measures for the FAA to address persistent delays at Newark Liberty International Airport, emphasizing that flights are safe despite the issues. Kirby pointed out that the airport routinely approves more flights per hour than it can handle, especially during peak times. He suggests limiting flights during construction, reinstating slot controls, modernizing the air traffic control system, and fully staffing the air traffic control. The FAA is taking steps to improve communication infrastructure and boost controller staffing, but delays continue to affect travelers, highlighting the urgency of implementing effective solutions.</p>

          <p>New England Village Foods has issued a recall for its 19th Hole Snack Mix due to the undeclared presence of almonds and sesame. The recall affects 5-ounce and 10-ounce containers distributed in New England, New York, and Pennsylvania. The FDA initiated the recall after a customer discovered almonds in packaging that did not list them, and further review revealed sesame was also missing from the 'Contains' statement. Consumers with allergies to almonds or sesame are urged to return the product for a full refund, and production of the snack mix has been suspended while the company investigates the packaging process breakdown.</p>

          <p>As Europe marks 80 years since the end of World War II, questions arise about the U.S.'s commitment to European security, particularly with Donald Trump's stance on NATO. Trump has questioned NATO's security arrangements, which has prompted concerns about the stability of the transatlantic order. Historians note that Europe has neglected its own self-defense while relying on American protection. Some German leaders are advocating for Europe to develop its own independent security policy, but others caution against abandoning close cooperation with the U.S., particularly regarding nuclear deterrence.</p>

          <p>Debt forgiveness can provide relief for individuals struggling with financial burdens, but it's not applicable to all types of debt. Credit card debt, medical debt, and some private student loans and unsecured personal loans may qualify for forgiveness through settlement or assistance programs. However, federal student loans, tax debt (unless through an IRS program), child support, alimony, and secured debt like mortgages and car loans typically do not qualify. It's important to understand which debts are eligible and to seek expert advice to navigate the debt relief process effectively.</p>

While the economy remains solid, the Fed is being cautious due to the potential stagflationary scenario posed by tariffs, which could simultaneously raise prices and slow economic growth.

          <p>A new study reveals that climate change-driven wildfires contributed to approximately 15,000 deaths and $160 billion in economic costs in the U.S. between 2006 and 2020. The research emphasizes the increasing frequency and severity of wildfire smoke events and their impact on mortality, particularly in states like Oregon and California. Researchers focused on deaths linked to exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from wildfire smoke, which can cause both short-term and long-term health issues. While land management practices can help, the study concludes that reducing greenhouse gas emissions is essential to mitigating the problem.</p>

Experts recommend breaking up the task of buying food and supplies into small chunks and shopping for used items at discount stores or yard sales.

          <p>Despite expectations of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, renewing maturing CD accounts can still be a smart financial move. The rate cut trajectory is uncertain, and when they do occur, they are likely to be small, with the potential to lose out on interest-earning opportunities in the interim. High-yield savings accounts may have comparable rates, but they are variable and will likely change when a rate cut is issued. A CD account with a fixed rate ensures continued high returns, regardless of broader rate climate fluctuations.</p>

The strikes caused loud explosions, prompting residents to flee their homes, while security service personnel controlled access to the site. This incident occurred amid escalating tensions between India and Pakistan, with the village of Salamabad also experiencing shelling. The area had been relatively calm since a 2021 ceasefire agreement, but the recent events have heightened uncertainty and fear among the villagers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that he would not consider lowering the United States' 145% tariffs on China to spur trade-war negotiations. This announcement comes before a scheduled meeting between U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart in Switzerland to discuss trade and economic issues. China has expressed its firm opposition to Trump's tariff hikes. Trump emphasized that the U.S. was previously losing a trillion dollars a year and is now not losing anything, highlighting his perspective on the trade situation.</p>

A local shopkeeper reported being jolted awake by loud explosions and described mortar shells landing near a water dam and houses. The incident marks a return to cross-border fire after a ceasefire agreement in 2021 had reduced such attacks, leaving villagers feeling uncertain about their safety.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate, resisting pressure from President Trump to lower borrowing costs as policymakers assess the economic impact of his trade policies. The Fed cited rising economic risks, noting increased uncertainty about the economic outlook and the potential for both higher unemployment and inflation. While the labor market remains solid, economists anticipate that Trump's tariffs will boost inflation, potentially prompting the Fed to cut rates later in the year. The central bank remains in a holding pattern, waiting for clarity amid conflicting economic signals.</p>

Currently, HELOCs are the cheapest way to borrow home equity, with rates lower than home equity loans, personal loans, and credit cards. HELOC rates have been declining, and potential Federal Reserve rate cuts could make them even less expensive.
