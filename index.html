          <p>Small business owner Bobby Djavaheri, who imports kitchen appliances from China, is facing financial strain due to fluctuating tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. After initially being hit with a 145% tariff, which forced him to increase prices, the rate was reduced to 30% following a truce between the U.S. and China. Djavaheri expresses frustration with the inconsistent policies and worries about making a profit this year, while logistics companies are seeing increased demand for facilities that allow businesses to defer tariff payments.

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments on limiting federal courts' ability to issue nationwide injunctions against unconstitutional government actions, specifically regarding President Trump's order to eliminate birthright citizenship.
