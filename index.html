          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced plans to expand the company's robotaxi service area in Austin, Texas, with a Bay Area launch pending regulatory approval. Musk also stated that xAI's chatbot, Grok, will be integrated into Tesla vehicles within the week, following a recent update to the AI model. These developments occur amidst a challenging period for Musk, who faces investor concerns over his public disputes with the Trump administration and a recent decline in Tesla's stock value. The announcement comes as xAI addresses controversy over antisemitic content generated by its chatbot.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Virginia has fallen to fourth place in CNBC's annual "Top States for Business" ranking, its lowest position since 2018, largely due to a weaker economic outlook. The state's heavy reliance on federal employment makes it vulnerable to the Trump administration's plans to cut the federal workforce, which is projected to cause significant job losses. While Governor Glenn Youngkin insists the state has enough private sector job openings to absorb the impact, economists express concern about skill mismatches and a potential ripple effect on the broader economy. This drop marks a significant shift for a state that has historically been a top performer in the rankings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Alaska Ranks Last for Business in 2025 Due to Heavy Reliance on Declining Oil Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 11:00:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alaska has been ranked as the worst state for business in the U.S. for 2025, primarily because of its over-reliance on the oil industry and the recent fall in crude oil prices. This dependency has led to the nation's poorest economic performance in the CNBC study, with sluggish GDP growth and a state budget highly vulnerable to global energy market fluctuations. The state also struggles with significant infrastructure challenges, particularly in broadband access, and a high cost of living. While officials hope a major natural gas project could help diversify the economy, Alaska's current economic fragility places it at the bottom of the national competitiveness rankings.

The state has successfully attracted major investments, including from companies like JetZero and Amazon, contributing to significant job growth and a high rate of in-migration for college-educated workers. Despite its economic strengths and bipartisan support for business, the state faces challenges, including a low ranking for quality of life and potential economic headwinds from federal policy changes and hurricane recovery costs.

          <p>Following President Trump's comments praising Liberian President Joseph Boakai for his "good English," this article explores the deep historical ties between the United States and Liberia that explain the nation's linguistic landscape. English is Liberia's official language, a legacy of its founding in 1822 by freed African-American slaves with support from the American Colonization Society. This connection is reflected in its capital's name, Monrovia, its flag's design, and a culture heavily influenced by African-American heritage. The article highlights that many Liberians found Trump's apparent surprise to be indicative of a broader ignorance about African nations.</p>

Despite physical and psychological barriers, including different pay scales and separate living quarters, the firefighters are slowly bridging divides through shared work and personal stories of trauma.

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has issued a preliminary injunction that blocks President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for infants born in the U.S. to non-citizen or undocumented parents. The judge, Joseph LaPlante, granted class-action status to all infants affected by the order, ruling that the deprivation of citizenship would cause "irreparable harm." The order, signed on the first day of Trump's second term, directed government agencies to deny citizenship documents in such cases. This ruling is expected to be swiftly appealed by the Trump administration, continuing the legal battle over the interpretation of the 14th Amendment.</p>

Red Bull has fallen behind McLaren competitively, and Verstappen has been vocal about his dissatisfaction with the car's balance.

The plea for more air defense comes as Kyiv continues to face daily bombardment from hundreds of drones and missiles, making civilian protection an immediate priority over long-term reconstruction plans. While allies have committed over €10 billion for recovery, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed that such support is meaningless unless the country can defend its skies. The conference highlighted the critical and urgent need for military aid to ensure Ukraine's survival.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's military has publicly debuted its new, U.S.-made M1A2 Abrams tanks during a live-fire military exercise. The demonstration of what are considered some of the world's most powerful tanks comes after more than six months of training and integration into the Taiwanese armed forces. The high-profile display is a clear signal of Taiwan's enhanced defensive capabilities. It occurred concurrently with mainland China conducting its own military maneuvers across the Taiwan Strait, highlighting the escalating military signaling and tensions between the two sides.</p>

          <p>Following the enactment of a Republican bill signed by President Trump, some regional Planned Parenthood affiliates have announced they can no longer accept Medicaid. The new law blocks the healthcare organization from receiving Medicaid funding for one year, a move opponents call a "backdoor abortion ban." However, a federal judge has temporarily blocked the "defunding" provision, creating a confusing and rapidly changing situation for patients and providers. While some affiliates posted notices they were stopping Medicaid services, others are resuming appointments for Medicaid patients after the court order, highlighting the immediate and chaotic impact of the legislation on healthcare access.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has stated that the country's welfare system is too easy to claim and is being exploited, proposing significant restrictions on benefit payments. Her plans include barring most foreign nationals from claiming disability and sickness benefits and preventing people with less severe mental health conditions, like anxiety, from being signed off work. Badenoch also called for a return to mandatory face-to-face assessments for claimants. The Labour Party criticized the proposals, stating the Conservatives had 14 years to reform the system and instead left it broken, while also warning the plan could harm disabled British citizens living abroad.</p>

          <p>In a notable break with his party, former Secretary of State John Kerry said that Democrats made a mistake on immigration policy, allowing the U.S.-Mexico border to be "under siege" during the Biden presidency. Speaking to the BBC, Kerry stated that "Trump was right" about the need to secure the border and that he wished President Biden had been more vocal about enforcing the law. His comments highlight a deep, ongoing debate within the Democratic party over its stance on immigration. The remarks come as the Trump administration pursues aggressive nationwide deportation efforts, which have been met with legal challenges from Democratic officials.</p>

          <p>Whistleblower Erez Reuveni, a former Justice Department attorney, has released text messages and emails to Congress that allegedly show judicial nominee Emil Bove instructing officials to defy a court order. The messages relate to the mistaken deportation of a man to El Salvador, with one text exchange suggesting Bove told a colleague to communicate a "f*** you" to the court's order to return the deportee. Reuveni claims he was fired for questioning these instructions. Bove, a former lawyer for Donald Trump nominated to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, has denied the allegations, but they cast a serious shadow over his confirmation process.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency has arrested four individuals in connection with the recent, disruptive cyber-attacks on retailers M&S and the Co-op. The suspects, three males and one female aged 17 to 20, were arrested on suspicion of blackmail, money laundering, and other computer misuse offenses. The hacks caused significant disruption, leaving some Co-op shelves empty and costing M&S an estimated £300 million in lost profits after criminals stole vast amounts of customer and staff data and deployed ransomware. The arrests mark a significant development in the investigation into the attacks that have severely impacted two of Britain's major retailers.</p>

          <p>Dr. Shoshana Shendelman, a trustee at Columbia University, has publicly called on the school's board to fully comply with the Trump administration's demands regarding antisemitism on campus and Title VI compliance. In a letter, she argued that leadership's failure to decisively address antisemitism has tarnished the university's reputation and led to significant legal and financial consequences. Her call comes after the release of text messages from acting President Claire Shipman that suggested Shendelman be removed from the board. The Department of Education has already canceled $400 million in grants to Columbia, citing its inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.</p>

          <p>Vietnam's government is escalating its efforts to reduce harmful alcohol consumption by approving a plan to raise taxes on alcohol from the current 65% to 90% by 2031. The move is driven by public health concerns, as alcohol is a leading cause of death in the country, and aims to support a zero-tolerance drink-driving policy. This tax hike is also part of a broader strategy to fund the country's ambitious goal of providing universal health insurance coverage as its population ages. The alcohol industry has opposed the measure, warning of a negative impact on sales, which have already been declining in recent years.</p>

The incident occurred in a 7-mile-long wastewater tunnel being constructed as part of the Los Angeles County Sanitation District's Clearwater Project. After the initial collapse trapped 27 workers, four of their colleagues went in to help before becoming trapped themselves. The Los Angeles Fire Department deployed a massive response, including its Urban Search and Rescue teams, and confirmed that none of the rescued workers sustained any visible injuries.

          <p>The Atlantic tropics are currently quiet, with the National Hurricane Center not expecting any storm formation in the next seven days, largely due to Saharan dust and wind shear. However, AccuWeather forecasters are monitoring the northeastern Gulf of Mexico and the waters off the U.S. Southeast coast for potential "homegrown" tropical development between July 15-18. A cold front moving into the area could generate some spin, similar to the setup that formed a previous tropical storm. While the risk is low, and any resulting system would likely be weak, it serves as a reminder that the hurricane season is active.</p>

          <p>The American neo-fascist group Patriot Front has appeared in central Texas, claiming to be providing "disaster relief" following the devastating floods that recently struck the region. In a video, the group's leader, Thomas Rousseau, stated that his "activists" were distributing supplies, but specified they were prioritizing "European peoples." Experts on extremism note that this tactic of exploiting disasters for public relations is common among hate groups, who use it as a ploy to mainstream their white supremacist agenda and recruit new members. The group, founded after the 2017 "Unite the Right" rally, has a history of staging such stunts to whitewash its image.</p>
