          <p>Senate Republicans are urgently working to pass a significant budget bill, central to Donald Trump's agenda, before a July 4th deadline. The 940-page legislation, which extends Trump-era tax cuts, has faced internal division over proposed welfare spending reductions. Recent amendments aim to win over moderate holdouts by increasing funds for rural hospitals and adjusting the cap on state and local tax deductions. However, the bill's cuts to programs like Medicaid remain contentious, with Democrats warning it could leave millions uninsured. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites, descriptions of the damage from the Trump administration have shifted throughout the week, creating uncertainty about the strike's effectiveness. While President Trump and the Defense Secretary initially claimed Iran's program was "obliterated," subsequent intelligence reports and official statements have presented a more nuanced picture, suggesting the setback may only be temporary. The goals of the mission also appeared to be reframed, with an emphasis later placed on achieving a ceasefire with Israel rather than complete destruction of nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of demonstrators, led by students, rallied in Belgrade to demand early parliamentary elections and issued an ultimatum to President Aleksandar Vucic. The protests, which have been ongoing for months, were initially sparked by a fatal rail station collapse blamed on government corruption. President Vucic has rejected the demands, attributing the unrest to foreign influence, while his supporters held a counter-rally. The student-driven movement has vowed to escalate to civil disobedience if snap elections are not called.</p>

          <p>Chrysler is recalling more than 250,000 of its 2022-2025 Pacifica and Voyager vehicles due to a potential defect in the side curtain airbags.

The company, which is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the issue, is urging customers to respond to recall notices.

          <p>Two men have been sentenced for their roles in the 2022 deaths of 53 migrants who were found in an abandoned tractor-trailer in Texas. A federal judge sentenced Felipe Orduna-Torres to life in prison and Armando Gonzales-Garcia to 83 years for the smuggling operation that resulted in the deaths of men, women, and children from suffocation in the sweltering heat. The truck's air conditioning was broken, and the victims had no water. The sentencing brings a measure of justice to one of the deadliest human smuggling tragedies in U.S. history.</p>
