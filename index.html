He asserted that the protesters were "paid insurrectionists" and claimed he would invoke the Insurrection Act if there was an "insurrection", although he struggled to define the term. Trump stated he called Governor Newsom to tell him to "do a better job," but Newsom denied the call ever took place. The deployment of the National Guard and the President's rhetoric have escalated tensions amid ongoing protests related to federal immigration operations in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>A provision in President Trump's tax bill, known as Section 899, could allow the U.S. government to impose taxes on foreign-parented companies and investors from countries deemed to charge "unfair foreign taxes" on U.S. companies. The Global Business Alliance estimates this measure could cost the U.S. 360,000 jobs and $55 billion annually in lost GDP over 10 years. Critics argue the tax contradicts Trump's goal of attracting foreign investment and could lead to political repercussions if key states experience job losses. Supporters claim it protects U.S. interests by providing a tool against countries with tax codes that disadvantage American companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A contributor is urging people to attend "No Kings" protest rallies being held across America, stating that the events happening in Los Angeles with the National Guard are a step towards autocracy. The rallies are scheduled on the same day as President Trump's birthday celebration in Washington, marked by a large military parade. The contributor emphasizes the importance of showing up to these rallies to find hope and be reminded of who they are, likening the experience to a trade where people give hope in exchange for attendance. The rallies will feature peaceful resistance, music, and a sense of community, providing a space for those who are terrified, sad, and exhausted.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s decision to fire all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has raised concerns among health policy experts.

Some experts worry that Kennedy may appoint members sympathetic to his anti-vaccine views, leading to politicized recommendations and potentially eroding U.S. immunization rates.
