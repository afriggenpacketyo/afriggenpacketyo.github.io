          <p>DW Director General Peter Limbourg has called on the Israeli government to protect journalists after a DW news crew was targeted with tear gas by Israeli soldiers in the occupied West Bank. The incident occurred in Ramallah while the crew was documenting the risks faced by media professionals in the region, despite wearing protective gear clearly marked with "PRESS." Limbourg labeled the repeated attacks on DW journalists as "absolutely unacceptable" and a threat to press freedom. This event follows a separate incident in July where another DW team was attacked by Israeli settlers, highlighting ongoing safety concerns for media in the area.</p>

The terminations followed a sit-in at the Redmond, Washington office of company president Brad Smith, organized by the group 'No Azure for Apartheid.' Protesters are demanding Microsoft sever its contract for the Azure cloud platform, which a report alleged is being used by an Israeli military unit for surveillance of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. The company stated the employees' actions were serious violations of policy and created safety concerns, while also launching an investigation into its technology's use.</p>

During the incident, two men entered the home and used bear spray on the rapper's nanny before stealing thousands of dollars in personal items, including a distinctive Seattle Sounders ring. The arrest was made after law enforcement investigated other high-profile burglaries targeting celebrities, leading them to a jewelry store where stolen items were recovered. The suspect is expected to face criminal charges for his involvement in the robbery.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis has officially announced her campaign for a U.S. congressional seat, contingent on California voters approving new district maps in a November special election. The former Secretary of Labor and congresswoman is targeting the redrawn 38th District, which would be left without an incumbent. Solis has already secured a formidable list of endorsements from prominent Democrats, including Mayor Karen Bass and several sitting members of Congress, signaling strong establishment support.

          <p>Montreal-based luxury fashion retailer SSENSE has announced its intention to file for bankruptcy protection, citing significant financial pressure from new U.S. tariffs. The company was particularly affected by the recent elimination of the 'de minimis' exemption, which had allowed for duty-free shipping of packages valued under $800 to the United States. In an email to staff, CEO Rami Atallah explained that tighter liquidity, trade pressures, and the tariff changes created an immediate liquidity crisis. The company plans to continue operations and pay employees while it restructures under creditor protection.</p>

          <p>The UK's Conservative Party is demanding an investigation into Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's tax affairs following reports she may have avoided paying a significant amount in stamp duty. The controversy centers on the 2015 sale of her former council house and the purchase of a flat, with questions raised about which property was her primary residence for tax purposes. Conservative chairman Kevin Hollinrake has written to the prime minister's standards adviser, alleging a potential breach of the ministerial code.

The fossils show that Spicomellus had long, bony spikes fused directly onto its rib bones, a feature never before seen in any other vertebrate species, living or extinct.

          <p>After a decade away from releasing new parody songs, "Weird Al" Yankovic is back with his "Bigger & Weirder" tour, a large-scale production featuring costumes, video screens, and his classic hits. Yankovic explains that he took a break from parodies to explore original pastiches and prove he was "more than just the parody guy," performing smaller, more intimate shows. He attributes the parody hiatus partly to the fragmentation of pop culture, making it harder to identify universally known hits. Now, he is re-embracing the full spectacle of his famous act, complete with an expanded band to replicate his intricate arrangements.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed into law a new congressional map designed to strengthen the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. The mid-decade redistricting effort was pushed by President Donald Trump's administration to help the GOP in the 2026 midterm elections, with experts predicting it could help flip up to five seats. Democrats and voting rights groups have condemned the maps, arguing they unfairly target and marginalize voters of color, and have already filed legal challenges. The move follows a contentious legislative session where Democratic lawmakers left the state in an attempt to block the bill.</p>

          <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has scheduled a special election for a state Senate seat that has been vacant for nine months, a contest that could result in a tied chamber. The 35th Senate District seat was vacated when Democrat Kristen McDonald Rivet was elected to the U.S. House. Democrats currently hold a slim 19-18 majority, and a Republican victory could allow the GOP to block Whitmer's legislative agenda in her final year. The governor had faced criticism for the delay in calling the election, which is now set for May 5, 2026, with a primary on February 3.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is experiencing significant turmoil following the firing of Director Susan Monarez after less than a month in her role. In response, three other top leaders, including the chief medical officer, have resigned in protest. Monarez's attorneys claim she was targeted for refusing to approve "unscientific, reckless directives." Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has appointed his top advisor, Jim O'Neill, as acting director, a move that has drawn concern as O'Neill is not a physician or scientist. The leadership shakeup has prompted calls for congressional oversight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a move to cut $5 billion in foreign aid funds that were previously allocated by Congress for the current fiscal year. The White House is utilizing a rare budgetary maneuver known as a "pocket rescission," which involves requesting to cancel funds so late in the fiscal year that they expire before Congress can act. The proposed cuts target programs including USAID, State Department funds, and international peacekeeping operations. The tactic has drawn criticism from both Democrats and Republicans for circumventing Congress's constitutional power of the purse and could face legal challenges.</p>

          <p>As a new school year begins, generative AI has become a normalized and widely adopted tool for both students and teachers in high school and college. For the first time, graduating seniors will have spent their entire high school or college careers with access to chatbots like ChatGPT. This has led to a state of confusion and a lack of clear rules, creating what some describe as a pedagogical free-for-all. While students use AI for everything from writing essays to completing problem sets, educators are also using it for tasks like generating curricula, raising concerns about the erosion of critical thinking skills.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has canceled the Secret Service detail for former Vice President Kamala Harris, seven months after she left office. While former vice presidents are legally entitled to six months of protection, this period can be extended by presidential directive, which former President Joe Biden had reportedly done for Harris. The move has drawn criticism from California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who called it politically motivated. The White House has not commented on the specific reasons, but the decision comes as the Secret Service faces being overburdened with other protection details.</p>

          <p>The UK Court of Appeal has overturned a High Court injunction that would have forced 138 asylum seekers to leave The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex. The initial injunction was granted to the local council, which argued the hotel's owner breached planning rules by housing the migrants. However, the appellate court found the original ruling was "seriously flawed," as it failed to consider the difficulty of relocating the asylum seekers. The decision is a victory for the government, which feared a precedent that could trigger a wave of similar legal challenges from other councils seeking to block the use of hotels for asylum accommodation.</p>

Discussions focused on enhancing Europe's "strategic autonomy" in defense, advancing joint military projects, and bridging differences on energy policy, including a notable agreement on nuclear power. Despite the positive atmosphere, significant national interests still diverge, and Macron faces a potential no-confidence vote at home that could undermine the commitments made.</p>

          <p>With mortgage refinancing rates remaining high, seniors have several alternative options to tap into their home equity without altering their current home loans. One key option is a reverse mortgage, available to homeowners aged 62 and older, which converts equity into payments without requiring monthly repayments. Other viable methods include home equity loans, which offer fixed rates that have recently declined, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which provide a flexible credit line. These alternatives allow homeowners to leverage their record-high equity levels while preserving their existing low-rate mortgages. (not investment advice)</p>
