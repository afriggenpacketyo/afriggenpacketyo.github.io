        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Statue of Liberty was originally conceived in 1865 to celebrate the end of slavery in the United States, symbolized by the broken chains at her feet, not as a beacon for immigration. It was poet Emma Lazarus's 1883 sonnet, "The New Colossus," that reframed the statue as a "mother of exiles" for fundraising purposes. This new meaning solidified with the opening of Ellis Island in 1892 and was later cemented by President John F. Kennedy's "A Nation of Immigrants," transforming the monument into a powerful, enduring symbol of America's promise to newcomers.</p>

          <p>An Alvarado, Texas police officer was shot in the neck but has since been released from the hospital following an attack outside an ICE detention facility on July 4th. Authorities have taken several armed suspects into custody after they allegedly opened fire on responding officers. A federal source indicated that over a dozen masked individuals, some wearing body armor, vandalized the facility and used fireworks to lure law enforcement to the scene. The Justice Department is closely monitoring the incident, vowing zero tolerance for assaults on federal officers or property.</p>

          <p>Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei appeared in public for the first time since the recent 12-day war with Israel, attending a mourning ceremony but making no public statements. During the conflict, he had remained secluded while President Trump claimed to know his location. Despite U.S. and Israeli strikes that reportedly caused serious damage to Iran's Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz nuclear sites, experts believe the regime remains committed to its nuclear program. Tehran is likely assessing the damage and looking to repair and rebuild its capabilities.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Israel's war in Gaza is causing a collapse of the international system established after World War II, eroding norms from free speech on campuses to the laws of armed conflict. The author points to the West's failure to enforce red lines, such as preventing hospital bombings or the use of starvation as a weapon, as evidence of this breakdown. The piece contends that this hypocrisy, particularly the differential treatment of the Palestinian issue, threatens global stability and militarizes liberal societies against their own citizens who protest the violence.</p>

          <p>Turkey is significantly increasing its political and cultural influence in the Western Balkans, using "soft power" tactics such as funding the construction of large mosques, like the Namazgah mosque in Tirana, Albania. This strategy, termed "infrastructure imperialism" by one expert, extends beyond religion to include major investments in railways, ports, and hotels, often benefiting companies with ties to President Erdogan. This policy is part of a broader Turkish effort to assert itself as a regional power and heir to the Ottoman Empire, projecting an image of modernity and a shared destiny with nations across the Balkans, Caucasus, and Africa.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, "Mark Twain," recounts the author's 1882 return to the Mississippi River, the setting that defined his youth and literary career. Traveling to gather material for "Life on the Mississippi," Twain found the river and its towns profoundly changed, yet his time back in a steamboat's pilot house evoked a powerful sense of nostalgia and belonging. The experience highlighted a central paradox of his life: the more famous and worldly he became, the more he cherished the memory of his untroubled early years as a river pilot, a period he considered his only time of true freedom.</p>

          <p>The new animated film "The King of Kings," based on a Charles Dickens book about the life of Jesus, has become a box office success but fails to achieve its goal of appealing to a broad, secular audience. The movie, which features a star-studded voice cast including Kenneth Branagh and Oscar Isaac, frames the biblical narrative through Dickens telling the story to his son. However, the review argues that its overly serious tone, on-the-nose religious instruction, and lack of compelling character development prevent it from matching the artistic power of films like "The Prince of Egypt," ultimately feeling more like a missed opportunity.</p>

          <h2>German Parliament Report Questions Legal Justification for Israeli and US Strikes on Iran</h2>

          <p>A report from the German parliament's research services has cast "substantial doubt" on the legal justification for the recent Israeli and U.S. military strikes against Iran. Commissioned by a Left Party lawmaker, the report states that most international law experts believe the criteria for self-defense under the UN Charter were not met. To legally justify the action, Israel would have needed to prove an imminent threat of a nuclear attack from Iran, not just the existence of nuclear material. The report concludes that Israel is now obligated to provide a legal justification for its military actions.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Republicans are escalating efforts to disqualify mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day, a practice they claim is illegitimate and feeds conspiracy theories about election fraud. A section of Trump's election-focused executive order directs the attorney general to challenge states that count such ballots, while GOP-led states like Kansas and Utah have passed laws requiring ballots to be received by Election Day. This push aligns with Trump's false claims about the 2020 election and his desire for immediate results, despite election officials affirming the security of the process.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people, dressed in traditional white and red attire, gathered in Pamplona, Spain, for the "chupinazo" rocket launch, officially starting the nine-day San Fermín bull-running festival. The event, made famous by Ernest Hemingway's novel "The Sun Also Rises," draws large crowds of locals and tourists for its daily "encierros." In these controversial runs, participants sprint ahead of six charging bulls through the city's streets to the bullring. The festival is characterized by heavy drinking, dancing, and daily bullfights where the animals are ultimately killed.</p>

          <p>In a tit-for-tat trade measure, China's Ministry of Finance has excluded European Union companies that do not have operations in China from government contracts for medical devices valued over US$6.3 million. The restriction, which took effect immediately, is a response to perceived EU protectionism. China's Ministry of Commerce stated the move was a "last resort" after repeated attempts to resolve differences through dialogue failed. This action signals a further escalation in trade tensions between Beijing and Brussels, impacting a key sector of the European economy.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the 20th anniversary of the G8's Gleneagles summit, lamenting the decline in global commitment to international development and poverty reduction. The author notes that the spirit of the "Make Poverty History" campaign has been eroded by a series of global crises, including the 2008 financial crash, rising nationalism, and Russia's aggression in Ukraine. The article criticizes the UK Labour government for slashing the aid budget, arguing that this move undermines Britain's global reputation and comes at a time when challenges like unsustainable debt in developing countries are intensifying.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods have struck central Texas, resulting in at least 50 deaths and an ongoing search for more than two dozen missing people, many from a children's summer camp. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, overwhelming communities in Kerr, Travis, and other counties. Hundreds of people have been rescued, some from treetops, in a massive response involving state and federal agencies. Officials were shocked by the flood's ferocity, which far exceeded forecasts and has left a trail of devastation that will take a long time to clean up and rebuild.</p>

The 26-year-old, who has signed a five-year contract, is the club's second major summer signing and is seen as a key addition to bolster their midfield. The article details the long-running pursuit of the player, revealing that Arsenal had secured an agreement in principle a year prior, fending off interest from Liverpool and navigating concerns about a potential move to Real Madrid.

          <p>This opinion article argues that ranked-choice voting (RCV) was a major winner in the New York City mayoral primary, enabling the victory of long-shot progressive candidate Zohran Mamdani. The author contends that RCV incentivized a more positive, coalition-building campaign, allowing multiple progressive candidates to run without acting as spoilers for one another. Instead of forcing early consolidation, the system gave Mamdani time to build momentum and appeal to a broad base of voters. The high turnout and positive voter feedback suggest that RCV empowers voters and can lead to more engaging, issue-focused elections.</p>

          <p>Right-wing influencer Laura Loomer has emerged as a powerful, if unofficial, adviser to President Trump on national security, using her direct access to push for ideological purges within the administration. Loomer, who has promoted conspiracy theories, reportedly provided Trump with a list of staffers she deemed disloyal, leading to several firings at the National Security Council and even the removal of the NSA director. Her influence highlights the MAGA movement's fealty to Trump over consistent ideology, as demonstrated by her strong support for the recent strike on Iran, a move she defends as "America First."</p>

          <p>China's minimal influence during the recent exchange of fire between Iran and Israel demonstrates that it is not yet ready to be a global superpower or a key security provider in the Middle East. Despite its economic partnerships and reliance on the region's oil, Beijing was unable to play a significant mediating role. The article argues that China's relationships, even with partners like Iran, are limited by its own business interests, its inability to project military power, and its reluctance to form binding alliances. Consequently, the United States remains the indispensable political and strategic power in the region.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s initiative to determine the cause of autism is causing alarm among leading researchers, who say he is ignoring decades of scientific progress. Kennedy has dismissed genetic research as a "dead end" and is pursuing his long-held, disproven theory linking autism to environmental toxins, particularly vaccines. His rhetoric, which frames autism as a tragedy, has been criticized for stigmatizing autistic people. This approach, combined with funding cuts, is reportedly undermining established research and creating fear among parents of autistic children about government data collection.</p>

          <p>The American flag represents a complicated symbol for many Black Americans, embodying both a nation they helped build and a history of oppression enacted under its banner. This article explores this dynamic, noting how Black service members have historically fought for a country that treated them as second-class citizens. In modern times, a new generation of Black artists, like Beyoncé, is seen as reclaiming the flag, signaling a sense of ownership, progress, and belonging. This reclamation is complex, as it coexists with the flag's use by nationalist groups and the ongoing struggle for racial equality in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A federal advisory committee has recommended that flu shots be made without thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative that has been a long-standing target of vaccine safety critics. Though the vast majority of flu vaccines are already thimerosal-free, the move by the newly appointed committee under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has raised concerns among some public health experts. They note that numerous scientific studies have discredited any link between thimerosal and autism, and that the preservative safely prevents contamination in multi-dose vials, which are a practical option for some health centers.</p>
