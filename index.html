Streets in Paramount, California, saw clashes between federal immigration officials and protesters, with tear gas and flash-bang grenades used. The raids and subsequent protests highlight the ongoing tensions surrounding immigration enforcement policies in the region. This deployment signifies a heightened federal response to quell the unrest. Optimism is low as the event has already transpired.</p>

          <p>Immigration operations by ICE in Los Angeles led to numerous arrests and large protests throughout the city. Raids occurred in the Westlake District, downtown L.A., and South L.A., resulting in the arrest of 118 people this week, including 44 during Friday's operations. Protests erupted in Paramount, where demonstrators blocked traffic, set fires, and clashed with law enforcement, who used non-lethal munitions. The situation prompted responses from government officials, including Governor Newsom, who deployed additional California Highway Patrol units to maintain safety, reflecting the deep divisions over immigration policy and enforcement. The community is fractured due to the immigration operations.</p>

The incident marks a rare assassination attempt on a high-profile political figure in Colombia, reminiscent of the violence seen during the era of drug lord Pablo Escobar.
