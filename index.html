            <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has kept its key lending rates unchanged, signaling a focus on stabilizing the yuan amidst ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. The decision follows strong economic data, including better-than-expected GDP growth and retail sales figures. Economists suggest the PBOC's move provides room for future adjustments based on economic performance. The Chinese yuan appreciated slightly following the announcement, reflecting market confidence in the country's economic stability.</p>

            <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has decided to keep its loan prime rates unchanged, reflecting the country's current focus on stabilizing the yuan amidst ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. This decision comes in light of surprisingly strong economic data, including a 5.4% year-on-year GDP increase in the first quarter, as well as robust retail sales and industrial output figures for March. The steady rates provide the PBOC with flexibility, suggesting potential rate cuts may occur if economic data softens in the future, especially after the impact of U.S. tariffs is fully assessed. The Chinese yuan saw a slight appreciation following the announcement.</p>

This trend is attracting high-profile scientists, including those who previously worked at institutions like MIT, back to China as research funding in the U.S. faces cuts.

The airport cites ATC restrictions in Europe as a contributing factor and is implementing plans to improve on-time performance in 2025.

            <p>Women protesters in Guinea-Bissau attacked a Chinese-run mining site in the northwest of the country, setting fire to equipment in response to the mining of zircon. The protesters claimed their actions were due to the authorities' failure to address their complaints that the mining activity was damaging their farms and local environment. Several women and a village leader were arrested following the protest at Nhiquin, where Chinese companies have been operating since 2022. The interior minister confirmed the destruction of facilities at the site, expressing irritation at the damage.</p>

            <p>American-style restaurants in Beijing are removing U.S. beef from their menus due to the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China. Retaliatory tariffs have made American beef unaffordable, prompting restaurants like Home Plate BBQ to switch to Australian beef. The restaurant chain, which previously sourced all its beef from the U.S., is now using Australian M5 beef and Canadian pork ribs. This shift reflects the broader impact of the trade war on various goods, with Australian suppliers looking to fill the gap left by the decline in U.S. exports.</p>

Texas prosecutors opted not to pursue the death penalty, influenced by the wishes of the majority of victims' relatives who seek closure. Crusius has already been sentenced to 90 consecutive life terms at the federal level for hate crimes and weapons charges.</p>

The proposal comes amid international scrutiny over El Salvador's detention of deportees, including a U.S. citizen, in a "mega-prison."

Without congressional action to allocate additional funds, these individuals face the prospect of returning to the streets or abusive situations. The program was initially intended to provide assistance until the end of the decade, but the rising cost of rent has accelerated its depletion.</p>
