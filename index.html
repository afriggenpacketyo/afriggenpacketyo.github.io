            <h2>Expert Predicts Tariffs Will Boost Secondhand Clothing Market</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-21 00:01:59 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>According to an industry expert, new tariffs are expected to drive consumers toward the secondhand clothing market. As tariffs increase the cost of new clothing, budget-conscious shoppers may seek more affordable alternatives in the resale sector. This shift could benefit businesses specializing in used apparel, potentially leading to growth in the secondhand market as consumers adapt to the changing economic landscape. The trend reflects a broader consumer response to rising prices and a growing interest in sustainable consumption practices.</p>

            <p>Paul Taylor argues that while Donald Trump's policies present challenges for Europe, they also create an opportunity for European leaders to strengthen integration. He suggests completing the capital markets union, striking trade deals globally, developing common defense capabilities, assisting Ukraine, building international coalitions for democracy, expanding economic partnerships, and attracting US scientists. By seizing these opportunities, Europe can reduce reliance on the US and China while fostering its own growth and influence on the global stage. Germany's new leadership, in partnership with France and Poland, is poised to drive this integration forward.</p>

            <p>China has issued a warning that Trump's trade tactics, characterized as attempting to trade away other countries' interests for temporary gains, will ultimately backfire. The Ministry of Commerce stated that China will firmly oppose and retaliate against any efforts to pressure trading partners into limiting trade with Beijing in exchange for tariff exemptions. The spokesperson emphasized that such actions violate international norms and represent economic hegemony disguised as fairness. China vowed to defend its rights and interests, asserting its determination and capability to counter any measures that harm its economic standing.</p>

            <p>A nine-year-old boy tragically died after becoming trapped between rocks at a New South Wales beach, bringing the total drowning toll in Australia to seven over the Easter weekend. Most of the deaths were attributed to strong swells that swept people into the ocean from rocky areas. Authorities reported two additional individuals still missing, exacerbating the already devastating situation. Surf Life Saving NSW CEO Steven Pearce described the weekend as the "worst" on record for drownings during the Easter long weekend, highlighting the profound impact on what should have been a joyous and religious occasion.</p>

            <p>Alessandro Paredes, a 19-year-old Venezuelan migrant, spoke from a detention center in Texas after his deportation was temporarily blocked by a Supreme Court order. He claims he and others were "forced to sign a paper" stating they are part of a gang. The White House defended its actions, asserting the administration's right to remove terrorist illegal aliens. Paredes' mother denies the allegation that her son is a member of TdA and fears he will be deported to El Salvador, a country he has never known.</p>

The firm's global investment strategy team projects an effective tax rate between 10% and 20%, significantly higher than the 2% at the start of the year. JPMorgan recommends that investors consider structured notes and hedge funds in diversified portfolios to navigate the volatile environment. Structured notes can provide defensive exposure to stocks and deliver income, while hedge funds can exploit market mispricings. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Season 2 of "The Last of Us" has sparked debate among viewers, particularly regarding the death of a central character. While the show expands on the game's storytelling, some plot detours feel awkwardly inserted, and the overall tone has shifted towards unrelenting cheerlessness. The season explores fractured bonds and the cyclical nature of violence, but critics argue that the show's limited imagination and focus on undiluted pain have made it a punishing watch. Despite glimmers of ingenuity, the series struggles to balance its exploration of grief with the larger emotional journey of its characters.</p>

The author argues that China recognizes the US's strategic goal is to strangle China's economic rise, not just rebalance trade. Key to China's response is resolving the fragmentation of its domestic market. While fiscal stimulus could provide near-term relief, the long-term solution lies in strengthening internal economic structures.</p>
