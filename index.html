          <p>European stock markets are poised for a mixed opening as investors evaluate the significant impact of the Trump administration's new $100,000 H-1B visa application fee. This abrupt policy change, effective immediately, aims to protect American jobs and further crack down on immigration, leaving major tech firms, reliant on these visas, scrambling to adjust recruitment plans. India has notably criticized the measure, citing potential humanitarian consequences for families. Concurrently, Asia-Pacific markets also traded mixed, absorbing China's central bank's decision to keep its loan prime rates unchanged for the fourth consecutive month, a move in line with market expectations. This interplay of U.S. immigration policy and Asian monetary decisions creates a complex and uncertain global economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's National Meteorological Center has issued a severe warning that Super Typhoon Ragasa is expected to make landfall along the coastal areas from Shanwei in Guangdong province to Wenchang in Hainan on Wednesday. The powerful storm is forecast to bring heavy torrential rain, with some regions potentially receiving up to 280mm (11 inches) of precipitation between Tuesday and Thursday, prompting widespread alerts. Guangdong province, which was recently hit by Typhoon Mitag, has already issued a series of warnings and advised extensive preventive measures. These actions are crucial as the region braces for the strong winds and heavy downpours, aiming to mitigate potential disaster and protect its populace.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands gathered at State Farm Stadium in Arizona for a memorial service honoring conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot on September 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University. President Donald Trump and other leading conservative figures, including Vice President JD Vance, hailed Kirk as a "martyr" and "warrior" for the MAGA movement and Christian faith, pledging to continue his organization's influence. His widow, Erika Kirk, delivered a poignant speech where she publicly forgave the alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson, emphasizing that "the answer to hate is not hate" and urging a return to faith. The event underscored Kirk's profound impact and the ongoing political shifts in the U.S.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A DW article explores the complex relationship between the birth control pill and women's sex drive, highlighting diverse experiences where some women report a significant drop in libido. Studies indicate that around 15% of participants experienced decreased desire, possibly due to the pill's effect on testosterone by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which binds to free testosterone. While the pill offers sexual autonomy and can even boost libido for some by alleviating pregnancy worries, the article emphasizes the need for better information from doctors and less stigma around women's health. Ultimately, libido is a multifaceted phenomenon, influenced by hormonal, psychological, relational, and social factors, making a universal conclusion challenging.</p>

          <p>Former Deputy Prime Minister Sir Nick Clegg has criticized Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, calling the "endless knee-bending" "slightly cringey" and urging Starmer to "speak up" for British values. Speaking at the Liberal Democrat conference, Clegg argued that the government's pursuit of a trade deal with Trump stems from a "miscalculation" that the UK doesn't have to choose between the US and the EU, which he dismissed as "rubbish on stilts." He also condemned tech billionaire Elon Musk's recent comments to protesters as an "outrageous intrusion into our sovereignty," highlighting concerns about growing dependence on US technology. Clegg's remarks reflect broader anxieties about UK foreign policy direction.</p>

          <p>Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has approved plans for a £2.2bn privately-financed second runway at London Gatwick Airport, a move aimed at boosting economic growth and "getting Britain building again." The project involves relocating the existing Northern Runway by 12 meters to bring it into regular use, potentially increasing annual flights from 280,000 to 389,000 by the late 2030s, and passenger numbers to 80 million. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves lauded the creation of "thousands of jobs and billions in investment," the plan faces strong opposition from environmental campaigners like the Green Party, who deem it a "disaster for the climate crisis," raising concerns about air pollution, noise, and climate emissions. Gatwick has agreed to stricter noise controls and public transport targets to mitigate impacts.</p>

          <p>World Athletics President Sebastian Coe suggests the global calendar for Olympic sports may need "re-engineering" due to the escalating challenges posed by climate change, following athletes' struggles with searing temperatures and stifling humidity in Tokyo. Research indicates 70% of athletes report climate impact on their training and competition programs, prompting serious consideration for holding endurance events separately or at different times of the year to protect athlete safety and performance. Despite these environmental concerns, Coe asserts the sport is in "good shape" with strong athlete performances and broader appeal, planning an inaugural Ultimate Championships in Budapest in 2026. This new event aims to test innovative ideas and ensure the sport remains engaging and athlete-focused, with ongoing discussions about increasing prize money.</p>

Prosecutors rested their case after seven days, detailing Routh's alleged weeks-long plot to kill Trump and a confrontation with a Secret Service agent who spotted him aiming a rifle. Routh, who has pleaded not guilty to multiple charges including attempted assassination and firearm violations, previously told the judge his court-appointed defenders were "afraid of him." The trial, which has progressed faster than anticipated due to Routh's short cross-examinations, is expected to move to closing arguments and jury deliberation shortly, potentially sending him to prison for life.</p>

DRPLA, previously thought to be mainly of Japanese origin, presents significant challenges in diagnosis due to its rarity and varying symptoms, including memory loss, impaired body movement, and seizures.

Despite NOAA's initial prediction for a busier-than-usual season, hurricane activity has been quieter than anticipated so far this year, with only one of the previous six named storms making U.S. landfall.</p>

          <p>Thousands of people have been evacuated in the Philippines as the nation braces for Super Typhoon Ragasa, described by regional authorities as potentially "catastrophic." The storm, packing 230km/h (143mph) wind gusts, is forecast to make landfall over sparsely populated northern islands on Monday before heading west towards southern China. Philippine authorities warn of a "high risk of life-threatening storm surge" exceeding 3 meters (10ft), alongside widespread flooding, landslides, and damage to homes and infrastructure. Schools and government offices are shut in affected areas, including Manila, while Hong Kong and Taiwan are also preparing for severe weather, with Hong Kong planning to halt all passenger flights for 36 hours. The region is already reeling from recent monsoon flooding.</p>

          <p>An article explains China's "five-year plan" as a top-level roadmap guiding the nation's social and economic development over five-year periods. Adopted from the Soviet Union, these plans, implemented every five years since 1953 (with a brief hiatus from 1963-1965), set both quantitative development goals across different sectors and strategic priorities for important industries. They have been instrumental in China's remarkable transformation from extreme poverty to a technological powerhouse and the world's second-largest economy over more than seven decades. The continuous use of this planning model underscores its foundational importance to Beijing's long-term economic strategy and governance, shaping the country's trajectory.</p>

          <p>Officials are issuing warnings about "Reggie," a solitary male bottlenose dolphin in England, whose increasingly "boisterous" interactions with swimmers are causing concern and changing his natural behavior. Originally seen as playful, Reggie's behavior has escalated, with reports of him pushing women underwater, prompting experts to caution against human interaction. Marine Connection co-founder Liz Sandeman warns that as the young, half-ton dolphin grows, his unintentional harm could become serious for both him and people, describing the situation as "dangerous." Authorities emphasize that human habituation leads to dolphins losing natural wariness, risking injury or aggression, and urge the public to maintain distance, never swimming with or feeding them, to protect both human safety and wildlife well-being.</p>

Burnt out from the "agency monster," she quit her job in late 2019 without a plan, later finding opportunity during the COVID-19 pandemic as companies sought leaner solutions. Fractional work, where professionals contribute part-time to multiple businesses, offered her greater autonomy and fulfillment, allowing her to escape burnout and choose clients. De Foe, who now answers to multiple CEOs while being her own, advocates for this model, especially in services-based businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's central bank kept its one-year and five-year loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged for the fourth consecutive month, despite the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent 25-basis-point rate cut. This decision aligns with economists' expectations that Chinese authorities would hold off on major stimulus measures, even as a string of economic data underscores signs of fatigue in the economy. August saw retail sales slow to 3.4%, industrial output growth ease to its weakest level since last year, and consumer prices fall more than expected, with wholesale price deflation persisting for nearly three years. The real estate slump also worsened, and export growth slowed, indicating significant challenges for China's economic momentum in the third quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's GJ-11 "Sharp Sword" UAV, an advanced uncrewed system, is being adapted for crucial roles in intelligent warfare, particularly for naval deployment. Recent images of a variant, possibly the naval GJ-21, display visible folding hinges on its wings, strongly suggesting its design for deployment on aircraft carriers or amphibious assault ships. This significant design change, combined with its appearance on the emblem of China's first Type 076 amphibious landing ship—informally known as a "drone carrier"—indicates the GJ-11 could be the world's first and only operational ship-based stealth combat drone. This development highlights China's rapid advancements in military technology and its expanding strategic naval capabilities.</p>

Experts explain that music "lights up" multiple parts of the brain, aiding memory recall and reducing anxiety and psychological pain, even for unconscious individuals, as hearing is often the last sense to go. Charities like Marie Curie emphasize music's role in creating shared experiences and a sense of normality, also providing lasting comfort to those grieving after a loved one's passing.</p>
