          <p>The UK Home Secretary is preparing to ban Palestine Action, effectively designating it as a terrorist organization, after activists broke into RAF Brize Norton and vandalized military planes. A written statement will be presented to Parliament on Monday, and new legislation will be enacted to make membership in the group illegal. This decision follows a security review of military bases across the UK. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has condemned the group's actions as disgraceful acts of vandalism.

Interim CEO Ron Sargent noted that customers are buying more promotional and private-label products, opting for larger pack sizes, and reducing discretionary purchases. Despite facing competition from Walmart and Costco, Kroger is focusing on cost management and simplifying promotions to cater to value-minded shoppers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Offer in Compromise (OIC) is an agreement with the IRS allowing taxpayers to settle their tax debt for a lower amount than what they owe. The IRS considers a taxpayer's ability to pay, income, expenses, and asset equity to determine eligibility. To apply, taxpayers must complete Form 656 and detailed financial statements, along with providing supporting documentation. The IRS has a specific formula for calculating the minimum offer amount, and the review process can take several months. It's crucial to be honest about your finances, as the IRS thoroughly investigates each application, and mistakes or misrepresentations can lead to rejection. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve maintaining stable interest rates, credit card interest rates are continuing to climb, reaching the highest levels since December. The average APR is now just over 20%, with new cards averaging around 24.3%. Experts suggest that card issuers are increasing APRs to mitigate risks associated with borrowers falling behind on payments, as well as responding to increased consumer demand for credit amid economic uncertainty. Consumers who carry a balance from month to month are most affected by these high rates, and even potential Fed rate cuts may not provide significant relief. (not investment advice)</p>

Federal undergraduate loan rates are decreasing to 6.39% for the 2025-26 academic year, offering some relief. To get the best rates, experts recommend starting with federal loans, shopping around among private lenders, optimizing your credit profile, and using a cosigner if possible. Taking advantage of rate discounts and considering shorter repayment terms can also lead to lower rates. By preparing and comparing options, students can minimize their borrowing costs.

          <p>More than 50 community and religious leaders in Los Angeles have signed a petition calling on the Dodgers to publicly oppose ICE raids. The petition emphasizes the importance of protecting families and supporting community organizations that aid immigrants. This action follows a delay in the Dodgers' planned announcement of assistance to immigrant communities after federal agents attempted to use Dodger Stadium's parking lots for processing. The leaders urge the team to issue a statement affirming the importance of families and ensuring that Dodgers' property is not used to support immigration enforcement. The Dodgers have faced increasing pressure to address the immigration raids happening around the city.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing the highest number of measles cases in a single year since 2019, with over 1,200 confirmed infections across 34 states and the District of Columbia.

Health officials attribute the rise to lower vaccination rates, with only 93% of kindergarteners vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year. Experts emphasize the importance of vaccination to achieve herd immunity and prevent severe complications, including brain swelling and death. HHS Secretary Robert F.

          <p>President Donald Trump has called for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the 2020 election, reiterating his baseless claims of widespread fraud. Trump's post is part of an effort to undermine the legitimacy of President Biden's presidency. Trump directed his administration to investigate Biden’s actions as president, alleging aides masked his predecessor’s “cognitive decline.” Despite numerous court rulings and investigations finding no evidence of fraud, Trump continues to assert that the election was stolen.

          <p>Nancy Pexton, 69, has been charged with the murder of her 69-year-old sister, Jennifer Abbott, who was found stabbed in her north London home. Abbott was discovered by her niece and neighbors after family members had not heard from her for several days. A post-mortem examination revealed that Abbott died from sharp force trauma. Police are investigating whether Abbott's death is linked to a missing diamond-encrusted Rolex watch. Pexton has been remanded in custody and is due to appear at the Old Bailey on June 24.</p>
