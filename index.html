          <p>The Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary organization, announced its departure from Mali after assisting the Malian junta in regaining control over regional centers.

          <p>The Norwegian Refugee Council reports that Cameroon is facing one of the world's most neglected displacement crises, marked by a significant disparity between the severity of the situation and the political, media, and financial attention it receives. More than 1.1 million people are internally displaced, alongside 480,000 refugees from neighboring countries, particularly the Central African Republic. Cameroon is grappling with two major conflicts: a civil war in the western regions and destabilization in the Lake Chad region due to Islamist militants.

          <p>A federal judge approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow colleges and universities to directly pay their athletes. The settlement permits each school to share up to $20.5 million with athletes over the next year and $2.7 billion over the next decade to former players previously barred from such revenue. Payouts will be determined by sport and career length, with potential earnings reaching nearly $135,000 for most football and men's basketball players. This decision marks a significant shift in college sports, addressing antitrust concerns and compensation rules dating back to 2016.</p>

Countries with longer, healthier lives often have governments and cultures that normalize healthy living through affordable nutritious food, clean air policies, and preventive healthcare.

          <p>Arrests for illegal work in the UK have increased significantly as police target employers who exploit undocumented migrants. Immigration officers arrested over 6,400 people in the past year during raids at businesses, a 51% increase from the previous year. These businesses often subject migrants to squalid conditions, illegal working hours, and below-minimum wages. The government is cracking down on illegal migration and tightening work visa regulations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge approved a landmark settlement in the House v. NCAA case, paving the way for colleges to directly pay athletes for the first time. Starting this fall, schools in the NCAA's top division can compensate athletes, capped at $20.5 million per school, and $2.75 billion will be paid to former athletes who were not allowed to earn money. The agreement signifies a major shift away from the tradition of amateurism in college sports. A third-party clearinghouse will review licensing agreements for “fair market value”.</p>
