          <p>Two Chinese biotechnology startups, Innovent and BeOne, are projected to become profitable in 2025, marking a significant milestone for the country's biotech industry. This shift indicates a maturation from reliance on investor funding to generating value through new products, such as Innovent's successful weight-loss drug mazdutide. According to market analysis, this development reflects the growing strength and self-sufficiency of China's pharmaceutical sector. The success of these firms, which listed in Hong Kong under rules allowing pre-profit companies, signals a new era for the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

The miners became trapped after a tunnel collapse triggered by a 4.2 magnitude tremor, which also killed one other person initially. State-run mining company Codelco has suspended operations at the affected tunnel and announced an investigation involving international experts to determine the cause of the tragedy.

The map could create up to five new GOP-leaning districts, a move Democrats are calling a "rigged system." Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has called for the lawmakers to be arrested and returned, while Illinois Governor JB Pritzker is reportedly providing support to the Democrats who have fled to his state. This tactic aims to run out the clock on the special legislative session.</p>

          <p>A riot at the Taxpan prison in the Mexican state of Veracruz has left seven inmates dead and eleven others injured, according to regional authorities. The unrest, which involved fires within the facility, was reportedly sparked by inmate anger over extortion and abuse by members of the Grupo Sombra criminal organization. This incident highlights ongoing issues within Mexico's prison system, including overcrowding and the significant influence of cartels and gangs. Security forces have since intervened to restore order at the facility.</p>

          <p>Israel's National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited and prayed at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound, a site holy to both Jews and Muslims, breaking a long-standing agreement. This act was labeled an "unacceptable provocation" by Jordan, the site's custodian, and drew sharp criticism from Palestinian leaders. The Israeli prime minister's office issued a statement affirming that the status quo, which allows Jewish visitation but not prayer, has not changed. The visit has significantly heightened regional tensions over the sensitive holy site in East Jerusalem.</p>

          <p>Drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine, Chinese aerospace engineers have proposed a significant technological upgrade for military drones to dramatically increase their survival rates against missile attacks. The concept involves fitting drones with side-mounted rocket boosters, enabling them to perform high-G "terminal evasion" maneuvers in the final moments before impact. Digital simulations showed this system could boost a drone's ability to survive to nearly 90 percent. This innovation reflects a focus on developing more resilient and effective unmanned aerial systems.</p>

This outlook has weakened the U.S. dollar but failed to prevent a slide in equities, with analysts noting that multiple economic indicators now point to below-potential growth.

          <p>Prominent economist Jeffrey Sachs has warned that persistent U.S. sabre-rattling against China could become a self-fulfilling prophecy leading to conflict. In an interview, Sachs argued that while a trade truce may hold due to mutual economic interests, the underlying friction initiated by the U.S. will continue. He advised China to focus its export growth on developing markets rather than the U.S. and Europe, which he sees as remaining untrustworthy partners. Sachs emphasized that rationality is needed to manage the relationship and avoid escalation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight bound for Munich experienced an engine failure shortly after departing from Washington Dulles International Airport, prompting the pilot to declare a mayday emergency. The Boeing 787 was ascending when the left engine failed, forcing an immediate return to the airport. The aircraft landed safely, and none of the 219 passengers or 11 crew members were injured. The flight was subsequently canceled, and the airline worked to arrange alternative travel for the affected customers while investigating the mechanical issue.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending a large ash plume miles into the sky. The eruption occurred just days after a powerful 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of the peninsula. Scientists are exploring the connection, suggesting that while the quake likely did not cause the eruption directly, its seismic waves may have triggered an already-volatile system. The area is sparsely populated, and officials have stated there is no immediate threat to any communities.</p>

          <p>Following the acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel, the U.S. government has secured unique governance rights, which President Trump has termed a "golden share." This national security agreement, negotiated by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), gives the president veto power over major company decisions like factory closures or salary changes. While a true golden share involves equity, this arrangement grants the U.S. government outsized control without ownership, reflecting a broader trend of using national security reviews to influence business operations in critical industries.

Officials pointed to downward revisions in previous months' data as justification, while Trump claimed the numbers were "rigged." The move has drawn sharp criticism from economists and former officials, who warn it undermines the credibility of government data and sets a dangerous precedent. Critics argue the administration is "shooting the messenger" and attempting to "cook the books" to avoid accountability for its economic policies. (not investment advice)</p>
