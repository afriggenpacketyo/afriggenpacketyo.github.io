          <p>More than 90 nations, including Japan and Britain, have united at a U.N. preparatory meeting to emphasize the importance of preserving memories of the devastation caused by the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Led by Japan, the joint statement coincides with the 80th anniversary of the bombings and highlights the indispensable role of atomic bomb survivors' testimonies in disarmament education. The statement warns that firsthand accounts are becoming increasingly rare, urging NPT members to ensure these stories are preserved for future generations. The document was presented during the third session of the preparatory committee for the 2026 NPT review conference at the U.N. headquarters in New York, recognizing the slow progress of nuclear disarmament among nuclear weapon states. The overall sentiment underscores the urgency of disarmament education and adaptation to modern communication technologies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party achieved a narrow victory in a parliamentary special election in Runcorn and Helsby, signaling a potential shift in British politics. Sarah Pochin, Reform‚Äôs candidate, won by a mere six votes, seizing a seat previously held by Labour. The incumbent was forced to resign after being convicted of assault. This outcome, the tightest in modern history, may indicate Reform's growing influence, as the party aims to secure hundreds of municipal seats in concurrent mayoral and local council elections across England. The results could challenge the dominance of both Labour and Conservative parties, potentially leading to a more polarized political landscape.</p>

          <p>Comedian and actor Russell Brand attended a London court for the initial phase of criminal proceedings regarding multiple charges of sexual assault, including two counts of sexual assault. The charges relate to alleged offenses between 1999 and 2005 involving four women, with accusations including unwanted touching and indecent assault. Brand has denied all charges, asserting that he has never engaged in nonconsensual activity and looks forward to defending himself in court. The hearing was largely procedural, referring the case to a higher court, with a plea hearing expected in about a month, though the actual trial may not begin for a year due to judicial backlogs.</p>

          <p>Sir John Curtice highlights that the Reform party is emerging as a significant challenger to the Conservative and Labour parties in British politics. Early results from local council elections indicate substantial gains for Reform, with the party securing a considerable percentage of the vote. Andrea Jenkyns, a former Tory minister, convincingly won the mayoral position of Greater Lincolnshire, marking a notable victory for Reform. While Reform's gains have primarily impacted the Conservative party, support for Labour has also declined since the general election. Curtice notes that narrow wins and losses were prevalent, suggesting a fragmented political landscape where no single party dominates.</p>

          <p>China is showing signs of easing its unofficial ban on K-pop acts, potentially signaling a strategic shift to revitalize domestic demand and foster regional goodwill.

K-pop group Epex is scheduled to perform in Fuzhou, marking the first concert by an all-Korean idol group in mainland China since 2016. The move is part of China's broader strategy to stimulate discretionary spending in tourism, hospitality, and local commerce by promoting cultural events. This shift could benefit K-pop stocks and deepen cultural engagement in Asia.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas has permanently prohibited the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans deemed criminals from the Southern District of Texas. Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr. ruled that the White House's use of the statute was illegal, rejecting the attempt to apply the 18th-century wartime law to modern-day immigration policy. The ruling states that the act, intended for times of declared war or military invasion, was improperly invoked based on claims about the Tren de Aragua gang.

          <p>Apple is shifting production of most iPhones and other devices bound for the US away from China, in response to tariffs imposed by President Trump. CEO Tim Cook stated that the majority of iPhones sold in the US will be made in India, while Vietnam will become a major production hub for iPads and Apple Watches. This shift comes as Apple estimates that US import taxes could add approximately $900 million to its costs in the current quarter. The move is part of a broader trend among firms responding to shifts in global trade triggered by Washington's trade policies.</p>

          <p>Ed Martin Jr., President Trump‚Äôs nominee for top prosecutor in Washington D.C., faces challenges in the Senate due to his conservative activism and defense of Capitol rioters. Martin's nomination has drawn opposition from veterans of the U.S. Attorney's office, and Democrats are calling for a hearing to question him. Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee have also expressed concerns, seeking more time to review his record. Martin's appointment has been controversial due to his firing or demotion of veteran attorneys and his past representation of Capitol riot defendants. The nomination is testing Republican party loyalties and facing significant obstacles.</p>
