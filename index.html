        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Comedian Jay Leno recently reflected on his approach to political humor during his tenure on "The Tonight Show," emphasizing his strategy of balancing jokes between Democrats and Republicans to appeal to the entire audience. He contrasted this with the current late-night landscape, which he believes often caters to only half the country by adopting a strong partisan stance. Leno suggested that comedy should serve as an escape from life's pressures and unite people through humor, rather than dividing them with political lectures.</p>

          <p>The upcoming third round of trade talks between the United States and China will be held in Stockholm, Sweden, marking a continued trend of selecting neutral European venues for high-stakes negotiations. This choice, following meetings in Geneva and London, is seen as a move to create a more level playing field compared to previous dialogues held during the Trump administration's trade war. According to analysts, Sweden's selection highlights the country's international reputation for fostering dialogue and cooperation between global powers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fan Chunli, a 50-year-old comedian from rural China, has become a national sensation for her stand-up routines that draw humor from her experiences with an abusive ex-husband and patriarchal norms. Her performances have resonated deeply with audiences but have also attracted negative attention from some government officials, who warned that such jokes "provoke" gender conflict. Fan's rise highlights both the growing appetite for social commentary in China and the government's sensitivity to feminist discourse, which it often views as a destabilizing influence.</p>

          <p>Four people, including a husband and wife, have been arrested in Fort White, Florida, on charges of aggravated child abuse involving nine children. Authorities allege the children, aged 7 to 16, were subjected to horrific treatment, including being kept in plywood cages under bunk beds, beaten with canes, and sprayed with vinegar. The investigation began after a church member raised concerns, revealing that adopted children were treated unfairly and were allegedly coached to lie about the abuse.</p>

          <p>Comments from a senior official in China's Jilin province have raised historical tensions with South Korea over the interpretation of ancient kingdoms that existed in the region. The official called for a clear explanation of the history of the Fuyu, Gaogouli, and Bohai kingdoms as part of China's history, territories known in Korea as Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Balhae. This contested view of history has long been a sensitive point in bilateral relations, as both nations lay claim to the cultural and historical legacy of these ancient states.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Authorities Increasingly Suppress News of Mass Attacks, Prompting Online Complaints</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 23:21:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Chinese government has expanded its information control to include the suppression of news about mass casualty attacks, such as those involving vehicles or knives. In several recent incidents, official reports have been minimal or non-existent, and related photos and discussions have been scrubbed from the internet, a significant shift from past practices. This censorship, likely intended to prevent copycat crimes, has prompted pushback from some citizens online who are demanding more transparency and truth about these violent events.</p>
