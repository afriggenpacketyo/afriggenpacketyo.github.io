          <p>A group of Yale University classmates has penned a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, urging him to reconsider his role in the Trump administration, claiming it is leading the United States towards authoritarianism. The letter, signed by over 140 members of the Yale Class of 1984, cites concerns over actions they deem unconstitutional, such as attacks on independent media and the seizure of personal data. Bessent responded by defending his service to the American people and criticizing the letter writers for undermining President Trump.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department, under Attorney General Pam Bondi, has reversed a Biden-era policy that protected journalists from subpoenas and compelled testimony in leak investigations. Bondi stated that the change is necessary to prevent federal employees from leaking sensitive information. This decision marks a return to a more aggressive approach to leak investigations, similar to those used during the Trump and Obama administrations. Press freedom advocates have criticized the move, arguing it will harm the public's ability to learn about important issues.</p>

          <p>Sources report that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's Pentagon office implemented a system allowing him to access Signal messages, an encrypted messaging app, which bypasses standard Defense Department security protocols. A monitor in Hegseth's office was set up to provide remote access to his personal cellphone's Signal app and text messages, even within a sensitive compartmentalized information facility (SCIF) where cellphones are prohibited. Critics argue this poses a security risk, while a Defense Department spokesperson denies the existence of a "dirty line" and the current use of Signal within Hegseth's office.</p>

          <p>California is projected to exhaust its current license plate sequence by 2026, prompting the DMV to introduce a new format starting next year. The new sequence will consist of three numbers, followed by three letters, and then one number. The accelerated depletion of the current sequence is attributed to an increase in new vehicle registrations, driven by concerns that President Trump's trade policies will lead to higher car prices. The California New Car Dealers Assn. reported an 8.3% increase in new vehicle registrations in the first quarter of 2025.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has drafted a counteroffer to a White House peace proposal, suggesting potential compromises to end the war with Russia. The plan includes provisions for a European security contingent backed by the United States and the use of frozen Russian assets for reconstruction. While the plan does not explicitly demand the return of all seized territory or NATO membership, it still presents potential obstacles for the Kremlin. President Trump traveled to Rome for Pope Francis's funeral, while President Zelensky's attendance depended on the situation in Ukraine.</p>
