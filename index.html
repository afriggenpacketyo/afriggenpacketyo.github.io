          <p>Honeywell is proceeding with the first stage of its plan to split into three separate companies by spinning off its Solstice Advanced Materials unit. Shareholders will receive one share of the new company, which will trade under the ticker SOLS, for every four Honeywell shares they own. The move follows pressure from activist investor Elliott Management, which argued that a simplified structure would unlock more value. The article details the financial profile of Solstice, a specialty chemicals business with nearly $4 billion in sales, noting its strong margins but recent stagnation in growth.

The decision follows renewed scrutiny of his connection to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and allegations made in a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre. While Andrew has consistently denied any wrongdoing and settled a lawsuit with Giuffre in 2022, he stated the ongoing accusations are a distraction from the work of the monarchy.</p>

          <p>Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli visited the White House and gave an impromptu performance for President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. A video shared by a White House aide shows Bocelli singing along to a recording of his famous song "Time to Say Goodbye."

          <p>Seven well-preserved skeletons discovered in a well in modern-day Croatia have been identified as Roman soldiers from 1,700 years ago. The remains were found in the ancient Roman city of Mursa and appear to have been placed in a mass grave shortly after death. Isotope and DNA analyses revealed the men were not local to the region and subsisted on a diet of grains and vegetables. Evidence of injuries, including puncture wounds, suggests they were likely killed in a battle or skirmish around 260 C.E.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has described a Russian proposal for Elon Musk's Boring Company to construct an undersea rail tunnel connecting Russia and Alaska as "interesting" and said he would consider it. The idea was pitched by a Russian investment envoy, who suggested the 70-mile link could be built for a fraction of traditional costs using Musk's technology. The proposal followed a phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, during which they planned a future meeting to discuss the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Identify Fixed Annuities as Safest Option in Current Economic Climate</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 14:38:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid market volatility and shifting interest rates, financial experts suggest that fixed annuities are currently the safest annuity option for retirement planning. Unlike variable annuities tied to market performance, fixed annuities offer a guaranteed interest rate for a set period, protecting the principal investment from downturns. With current rates in the 5% to 6% range, they provide stable, predictable returns, making them an attractive choice for investors prioritizing security over high growth. The article also discusses other options like MYGAs and SPIAs for different retirement goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities in Sacramento County have launched an investigation after nearly 100 stolen, unused ballots for the upcoming special election on Proposition 50 were found in a homeless encampment. The ballots, which will decide a congressional redistricting measure, were discovered among a large quantity of other mail, likely stolen from residential mailboxes. County officials have voided the recovered ballots and mailed new ones to the affected voters, but no arrests have been made as the encampment was vacant when deputies arrived.</p>

          <p>The ongoing government shutdown has not seen the formation of a bipartisan negotiating group, or "gang," which has helped resolve past legislative stalemates. Democratic lawmakers state that a primary obstacle is their profound lack of trust in President Donald Trump, fearing he would reject any deal reached between rank-and-file members of Congress. Republicans maintain that no negotiations can occur until Democrats agree to a stopgap bill to reopen the government, but Democrats are demanding an "ironclad path" on policy issues before doing so.</p>

The toad secretes a potent psychoactive toxin, 5-MeO-DMT, and some people are reportedly licking the amphibians to experience a psychedelic high. The Banner Poison Control and Drug Information Center has cautioned that ingesting the toxin can cause severe illness or death in both humans and pets.

While the stock market has driven utility shares to a two-decade high on speculation of massive growth, energy executives and regulators caution that the projected demand may be overstated.

The plaintiffs argue that they would not have purchased the premium-priced shoes, which can cost up to $180, had they known about the issue, and that the company has unfairly dismissed complaints as normal wear and tear.</p>

          <p>While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut its key interest rate on October 29, mortgage rates could potentially fall before the official announcement. Historical patterns show that mortgage rates often decline in anticipation of a Fed cut, as lenders price in the expected change ahead of time. For example, rates dropped to multi-year lows just before Fed cuts in September 2024 and September 2025. Homebuyers and those looking to refinance are advised to prepare by improving their credit and monitoring the market daily to capitalize on any short-term opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece criticizes the partisan relativism that excuses such behavior, such as jokes about sexual assault, and calls for a defense of universal moral values against this degradation.</p>
