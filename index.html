          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to South Korea is being interpreted by experts as a carefully calibrated, symbolic step aimed at resetting strained bilateral ties, despite low expectations for immediate major breakthroughs. His previous visit in 2014 marked a high point, culminating in a free-trade agreement, but relations have since deteriorated. A significant point of contention was Beijing's omission of "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" from a 2024 joint statement, which raised doubts about arms reduction prospects. This article underscores the ongoing diplomatic efforts to mend a relationship that has experienced considerable shifts and challenges, emphasizing the cautious optimism surrounding this engagement.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries officially endorsed Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor, a significant boost for the Democratic assemblyman ahead of early voting. Jeffries praised Mamdani's focus on affordability and commitment to all New Yorkers, despite Mamdani's Democratic socialist affiliation drawing criticism from Republicans. This endorsement follows others from high-profile Democrats like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, positioning Mamdani as a strong frontrunner against opponent Andrew Cuomo, who also secured an endorsement from outgoing Mayor Eric Adams. The article also notes the Knicks' legal action against Mamdani for using a modified team logo in an ad.</p>

          <p>Officers shot at a U-Haul truck reversing towards law enforcement personnel outside the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda, amidst protests against a planned immigration enforcement surge. The driver, who was wounded in the stomach, was later taken into custody after a mental health evaluation, with two individuals sustaining non-life-threatening injuries. The incident occurred after a day of demonstrations against the anticipated Border Patrol operation, which President Trump later announced was canceled for San Francisco and subsequently the entire Bay Area. The article highlights the volatile nature of the protests, which also involved flash bangs and smoke grenades earlier in the day.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Queen Mother Sirikit has died at the age of 93 in a Bangkok hospital, following a blood infection, having been largely absent from public life due to declining health. She was the wife of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who passed away in 2016, and their marriage spanned almost seven decades. Born in 1932, Sirikit met her distant cousin, the future King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in Paris, marrying him in 1950. Her birthday, August 12, is celebrated as Thailand's National Mother's Day, honoring her as the "Mother of the Thai Nation."</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the U.S. of "fabricating a war" following the deployment of the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier towards the Caribbean. This move is part of an escalating U.S. military presence, which Washington claims targets drug traffickers, having already conducted ten airstrikes against alleged narco-terrorists. Maduro, a longtime critic of Trump, views these actions as an intimidation campaign aimed at destabilizing his government and achieving regime change.

          <p>The U.S. military is deploying the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier and its strike group to the Southern Command region off South America, significantly escalating its military presence. This move is part of the Trump administration's intensified campaign against drug trafficking, which has already involved ten rapid strikes on suspected narcotics vessels, resulting in at least 43 deaths. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth likened the anti-drug efforts to the war on terror, stating targets would be "hunted down, and killed."

A 2025 study suggests droughts can increase West Nile virus risk by concentrating infected mosquitos and birds around limited water sources, accelerating transmission.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of UK MPs on the Treasury Select Committee has strongly advised Chancellor Rachel Reeves against cutting the cash ISA tax-free allowance in the upcoming Budget. They argue such a cut is unlikely to effectively promote an investment culture and would be ill-timed. Reeves is reportedly considering reducing the cash ISA limit from £20,000 to £10,000 to encourage investment, as she faces a significant budget shortfall. However, the committee, along with banks and consumer campaigners, believes this move would be detrimental, especially given the £360 billion held in cash ISAs across the country.

          <p>A quiet shift is occurring in UK driving, with one in three cars now automatic, and a quarter of driving tests taken in automatic vehicles. This trend is driven by the impending 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales, as electric vehicles are automatic. New drivers face a dilemma: manual licenses allow driving any car, while automatic licenses restrict them. Many would-be automatic learners struggle with a lack of instructors and higher costs. The article explores these factors, noting that despite the perception of easier automatic tests, manual tests actually have a higher pass rate, and challenges the stigma around automatic-only licenses.</p>
