          <p>Approximately 3,200 Boeing defense workers have gone on strike after rejecting a proposed four-year labor agreement. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) stated the walkout is about respect and dignity, as members who build fighter jets seek a contract reflecting their skills. Boeing expressed disappointment, noting its offer included significant wage growth and addressed scheduling concerns. The company has activated a contingency plan to continue operations with non-striking employees.</p>

          <p>Writing for The Guardian, Timothy Garton Ash asserts that the Democratic party's decision to stand by Joe Biden as a candidate, despite clear signs of his age and declining public approval, was a critical error. He argues that most Americans saw the issue, but the party establishment and liberal commentariat failed to act, ultimately paving the way for Donald Trump's return. The article calls for the party to learn from this, listen to voters, and empower its younger generation of leaders to avoid repeating past mistakes.</p>

          <p>This article provides an inside look at Manchester United's 2025 pre-season tour, evaluating the changes under new manager Ruben Amorim. It details his coaching philosophy, which emphasizes player responsibility, tactical adjustments like a fluid three-man defense, and more intense, disguised fitness training. While noting positive signs in player morale and on-field invention, the piece questions whether these "green shoots" will translate into real progress or prove to be another false dawn once the competitive season begins.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic legislators has fled Texas to deny Republicans the necessary quorum to vote on a new congressional map heavily favoring the GOP. The Democrats accuse Governor Greg Abbott of prioritizing a "Trump gerrymander" over urgent matters like flood relief. In response, Abbott has threatened to use a legal opinion to remove the absent lawmakers from office if they do not return. The move escalates a political showdown over redistricting ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) confirmed the tragedy, noting most victims were Ethiopian nationals using the perilous migration route to seek work in Gulf states. The incident highlights the extreme dangers faced by migrants, as smugglers often use unsafe vessels, contributing to thousands of deaths along this route in recent years.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes Manchester City's strategic hiring of Pep Lijnders, Jürgen Klopp's former assistant, as a key move for the upcoming season. The author suggests this appointment indicates that manager Pep Guardiola may be planning a significant tactical shift away from his traditional possession-based "positional play." The club's recent signings, who excel at direct dribbling and fast breaks, further support the theory that City is adapting to a more transitional, high-octane style of football to counter modern Premier League trends.</p>
