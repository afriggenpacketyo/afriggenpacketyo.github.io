        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A toxic algae bloom, identified as Karenia mikimotoi, is devastating marine life off the southern coast of Australia, impacting over 200 species including sharks and rays. The bloom spans 1,700 square miles and has led to carcasses littering beaches, affecting tourist destinations like Kangaroo Island. Scientists believe a marine heatwave and calm conditions are contributing to the unprecedented scale and duration of the bloom. Authorities are advising beachgoers to avoid discolored or foamy water, as it can cause skin irritation and breathing difficulties, while the ecosystem is expected to take considerable time to recover.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Times article details how the Trump administration's strained relationship with South Africa is rooted in the president's embrace of false narratives pushed by white Afrikaner activists. Trump halted foreign aid to South Africa, expelled the South African ambassador, and prioritized Afrikaner refugees for resettlement in the U.S., influenced by hard-right conservatives and misinformation amplified by Elon Musk. These actions reflect Trump's focus on eradicating diversity and inclusion programs, alleging they lead to racism against white people. The administration's actions have caused diplomatic friction, as the South African government views the policy as racially discriminatory.</p>

          <p>The UK government is in discussions with several countries to establish overseas "return hubs" for asylum seekers whose claims have been rejected and have exhausted all appeal routes. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced this initiative during his visit to Albania, emphasizing it as an important innovation to address illegal immigration. These hubs would differ from previous schemes like the Rwanda plan, which involved processing asylum claims offshore. The UK aims to combine these return hubs with efforts to combat people smuggling gangs to deter small boat crossings in the English Channel.</p>

          <p>Three climbers died after falling 200 feet on Early Winters Spire in Washington state, likely due to a weathered piton failing. A fourth climber miraculously survived the fall, suffering severe head trauma and internal bleeding, but managed to crawl to his car and call for help.

          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, has cautioned that consumers will likely see higher prices later this month due to tariffs, despite the recent agreement to lower duties on imports from China. Rainey stated that the magnitude of the tariff increases is too large for retailers and suppliers to absorb. Walmart reported its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business, but the company declined to provide earnings per share guidance for the fiscal second quarter due to fluctuating tariff policy. This announcement comes as Walmart fell slightly short of quarterly sales estimates, signaling the broad impact of tariffs on the retail industry.</p>

While the BfV classifies the AfD as a "confirmed right-wing extremist endeavor," Merz stresses the importance of upholding democratic principles and avoiding the suppression of political opponents. The AfD's platform contains elements that devalue population groups in Germany, and mainstream parties refuse to form coalitions with them.</p>

          <p>Nutritionist Robin DeCicco recommends increasing fiber intake for disease prevention, weight loss, cholesterol reduction, and improved digestion. Eating 25 to 29 grams of fiber per day can be achieved by adding berries and flaxseed to breakfast yogurt, extra lettuce and tomatoes to lunch sandwiches, and high-fiber vegetables to dinner. Ground flaxseed can be incorporated into soups, sauces, and meats, offering benefits such as anti-aging and reduced inflammation. Gradual increase in fiber and adequate water intake are advised for optimal results.</p>

          <h2>Private School Fees Rise More Than Predicted After VAT Introduction in the UK</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Private school fees in the UK have risen by 22.6% on average following the introduction of VAT, exceeding the government's initial prediction of a 10% increase. The Independent Schools Council attributes the surge to a "triple whammy" of VAT, national insurance changes, and the end of charitable business rates relief. Families are withdrawing their children from private schools due to unaffordability, while headmasters express concern for low-to-middle-income families and those on bursaries. The government maintains that the fee increases are not solely due to VAT, as fees have been rising over the past 25 years.</p>
