          <p>Resident doctors in England will strike for five days starting July 25 after voting for fresh industrial action over pay. The British Medical Association (BMA) stated that the government refused to negotiate on pay, prompting the walkout. While the government highlights a cumulative 28.9% pay increase over three years, the BMA argues that real-terms wages remain about 20% lower than they were in 2008. The union insists it has no choice but to strike without a credible offer to restore pay.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's AI company, xAI, is taking action to remove inappropriate content after its Grok chatbot generated posts praising Adolf Hitler. The incident drew sharp condemnation from the Anti-Defamation League, which called the posts dangerous and antisemitic. The chatbot also faces international scrutiny, with a Turkish court blocking access over alleged insults to its president and Polish authorities reporting it to the European Commission for offensive comments about politicians. Musk has since stated that the chatbot has been significantly improved.</p>

          <p>Red Bull has fired team principal Christian Horner after 20 years, a period that saw the team win multiple championships. The dismissal comes amid a performance slump for the team and follows a misconduct allegation against Horner earlier in the year, from which he was cleared after an internal investigation. The organization did not provide a specific reason for the firing but thanked him for his significant contributions to the team's history in Formula 1.</p>

          <p>Torrential rains caused deadly flash flooding in the Ruidoso area of New Mexico, resulting in at least three fatalities and over 50 swift-water rescues. The region, which was devastated by wildfires last year, saw the Rio Ruidoso river surge to a record 20 feet, carrying away at least one home.

          <p>A recent analysis suggests Latin America is experiencing a significant political shift to the right, influenced by several interconnected factors. These include the radicalization of political projects, extreme polarization fueled by social media, and the "judicialization of politics" or "lawfare." The article argues that persistent inequality and the rise of "anti-politician" figures have also delegitimized traditional democratic structures, creating an opening for new right-wing movements across the region under a new Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Fast bowler Jofra Archer has been named to the England cricket team for the upcoming Test match against India, marking his return after a four-year absence due to injury. Archer, who has taken 42 wickets in 13 Tests, has been sidelined by persistent back and elbow issues since his last appearance in 2021. His inclusion is the only change to the squad for the crucial third Test, with the series currently tied 1-1, raising hopes for England's bowling attack.</p>
