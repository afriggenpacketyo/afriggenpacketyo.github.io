          <p>Columbia University's acting President Claire Shipman was met with boos and chants of "free Mahmoud" during the school's graduation ceremony. Students were protesting the detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate student detained by immigration authorities. Khalil, a Syrian-born legal U.S. resident, was a vocal member of student-led protests against the war in Gaza. The Trump administration has argued he should be deported due to alleged adverse foreign policy consequences and immigration fraud, claims his lawyers dispute. Shipman, who took over after the previous president resigned following criticism over handling protests and antisemitism allegations, acknowledged the frustration and emphasized the university's tradition of free speech.</p>

          <p>A New York Times analysis examines the trajectory of the U.S. national debt, projecting it to surpass the record set after World War II. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the debt will reach 117% of the economy's size by 2034 without changes to existing law. Proposed Republican tax and spending bills could widen the gap, potentially reaching 129% of the economy. Rising interest rates increase the cost of borrowing, while economists worry about the long-term consequences of high debt levels, such as hindering the nation's ability to respond to future crises.

Guardiola expressed dissatisfaction with leaving several senior players out of the recent match against Bournemouth. He emphasized his desire to work with a smaller, more cohesive group, stating it is "impossible for my soul" to leave players consistently on the sidelines. Guardiola's stance follows a January spending spree after key injuries and suggests potential summer exits to reduce the squad size.</p>

The article highlights the case of Representative LaMonica McIver, charged with assaulting federal agents during an oversight visit to an immigrant detention facility. The author argues the charges appear politically motivated, given Trump's history of using the Justice Department for retribution. The piece contrasts this with the administration's lenient treatment of January 6th rioters and warns that these actions threaten the foundations of American democracy.</p>

          <p>Apple has approved the return of Fortnite to the U.S. App Store, five years after it was removed for bypassing Apple's payment system. Epic Games updated the game to take payments directly, leading to a legal battle. A recent court ruling favored Epic, allowing apps to link out for payments without Apple's commission. Fortnite had to pass Apple's App Review process to return. The ruling has prompted other app makers to add links to purchase content directly.</p>

          <p>Medical experts discuss prostate cancer screening guidelines in light of former President Biden's diagnosis. Guidelines advise against screening after age 70, but some men continue testing in consultation with their doctors. Experts emphasize that even with regular screening, aggressive cancers can develop undetected. The PSA test is not perfect, and fast-growing cancers can arise between screenings or not be detected by the PSA. The article highlights the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening.</p>
