          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake has struck eastern Afghanistan, resulting in the deaths of at least 622 people and injuring over 1,300. The quake, centered near the city of Jalalabad in Kunar and Nangarhar provinces, caused widespread destruction, leveling numerous villages. Rescue operations are underway, with the Taliban government, the U.N., and the Afghan Red Crescent mobilizing teams to provide emergency assistance to the affected areas. The shallow depth of the earthquake is noted as a key factor in the significant damage caused by the tremor.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Aston Villa is actively exploring a potential deal to sign winger Jadon Sancho from Manchester United. The 25-year-old has been out of favor at United, having spent the last 18 months on loan at Borussia Dortmund and Chelsea. Previous interest from Italian clubs Roma and Juventus did not materialize into a move for the English attacker. Sources indicate that any potential transfer for Sancho would be separate from Manchester United's ongoing interest in Villa's goalkeeper, Emiliano Martinez.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans to tighten the rules for migrants granted asylum who wish to bring their family members to the country. The new criteria will include more stringent English language requirements and proof of sufficient funds to support family members. This policy shift is part of a broader overhaul of what the government calls a "broken" asylum system, aiming to reduce the reliance on hotels for housing migrants. The Conservative opposition has criticized the move as a "tiny tweak" that fails to address the larger issue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese technology giant Alibaba reported better-than-expected net income for its fiscal first quarter, largely driven by a 26% year-on-year revenue increase in its cloud computing division. This growth is attributed to robust demand for artificial intelligence services, with AI-related product revenue seeing triple-digit growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. While overall company revenue slightly missed forecasts, the strong performance of the cloud unit and a revival in its e-commerce business have been positively received by investors. The company continues to invest heavily in competitive areas like instant commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

This development strengthens Novo Nordisk's position in the highly competitive market for weight management medications, driving positive movement in European stock markets.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The final stage of England's largest-ever expansion of government-funded childcare support has launched, offering working parents 30 hours of subsidized care per week for children aged nine months to four years. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed it as a "landmark moment" that will provide significant financial relief to families. However, the rollout is facing challenges, as parents report long waiting lists and nurseries struggle with staff shortages to meet the surging demand. The sector estimates it needs an additional 35,000 staff members to fully deliver the promised places.</p>

          <p>Scotland's national rail operator, ScotRail, has permanently abolished peak-time fares, meaning passengers will no longer face higher prices for traveling during busy weekday rush hours. The policy, championed by the Scottish Greens and announced by First Minister John Swinney, aims to make train travel more affordable and encourage commuters to switch from cars to public transport. This move will result in significant savings for passengers, with some key routes like Edinburgh to Glasgow seeing ticket prices reduced by nearly 50 percent following a previous pilot scheme.</p>

          <p>Scientists from Tarim University have discovered brine shrimp, an ancient species dating back 400 million years, in a highly saline water source within the Taklamakan Desert in Xinjiang. These shrimp, also known as Artemia, are extremely tolerant of salt and are widely used in aquaculture as feed. The discovery suggests that the region has the natural conditions suitable for cultivating salt-tolerant organisms. Researchers will now conduct laboratory studies to determine if it is a new species and explore its potential for commercial aquaculture development.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping is analyzed as a significant geopolitical move, spurred in part by recent U.S. tariffs on Indian imports. The article suggests that while the two leaders are working to normalize relations, major roadblocks remain, including unresolved border disputes and a large trade deficit favoring China. India's policy of "strategic autonomy" is being tested as it navigates its relationships with China, Russia, and the U.S. The outcome will heavily influence regional stability and India's position in various international forums like the Quad.</p>

          <p>Following Inter Miami's 3-0 loss to the Seattle Sounders in the Leagues Cup final, striker Luis Suárez was involved in a series of confrontations. After an initial altercation with Sounders midfielder Obed Vargas, Suárez was filmed spitting on a member of the Seattle staff, Gene Ramirez, during a larger melee involving players and personnel from both teams. The incident is the latest in a career marked by controversy for the Uruguayan forward. The MLS has previously issued multi-game suspensions for similar actions, potentially sidelining Suárez for crucial upcoming league matches.</p>

Prescott stated that while he didn't initially think a trade would happen, he "wasn't surprised" given how personal the contract negotiations between Parsons and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones appeared to become. Parsons secured a record-breaking four-year, $188 million deal with the Packers after the trade. Prescott mentioned he is glad there is a resolution to the tension and that he exchanged messages wishing Parsons good luck.</p>

          <p>After President Donald Trump revoked former Vice President Kamala Harris's extended Secret Service protection, California Governor Gavin Newsom has reportedly arranged for state-level security for her. The California Highway Patrol is expected to take over protection for Harris, whose federal detail was terminated just days before she is set to begin a nationwide book tour. Trump's move is seen by critics as a vindictive political act against a former rival. Governor Newsom's office stated that the safety of public officials should not be subject to "erratic, vindictive political impulses."</p>

          <p>Factory activity across much of Asia contracted in August, with private surveys indicating that U.S. tariffs are taking a significant toll on the region's manufacturing sector. Export-heavy economies such as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan all saw manufacturing activity shrink, reflecting weakened demand and growing economic headwinds. This trend overshadowed a surprisingly positive manufacturing report from China, which showed a slight expansion. Analysts express concern that the impact of the tariffs will intensify, putting continued pressure on policymakers to support their fragile economic recoveries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has issued an order temporarily blocking the Trump administration from deporting hundreds of unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala. The emergency injunction was granted after lawyers argued the children would face risks of abuse and persecution if returned, and that the government was attempting to bypass legal protections afforded to them. The judge's order came as deportation flights were reportedly being prepared in Texas. The administration contended it was repatriating the children for family reunification at the request of the Guatemalan government, a claim disputed by advocates.</p>
