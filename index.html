            <p>Former Los Angeles Councilmember Kevin de León faces an $18,750 ethics fine for voting on council decisions where he had a financial interest and failing to disclose income. The ethics report cites votes benefiting the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and USC shortly after he received income from them. De León failed to disclose over $100,000 in income from the AIDS Healthcare Foundation before taking office. The Ethics Commission considered his cooperation and lack of prior violations, but noted a serious pattern of conduct.</p>

The gang's operations, including extortion, drug trafficking, and kidnapping, have contributed to Venezuela's migrant crisis and spread fear in neighboring countries. While the gang's influence within Venezuela has diminished, its notoriety has grown in the U.S., where it has been used to justify stricter immigration policies and deportations, despite concerns about due process and potential misidentification.</p>

The ACLU challenged the deportations, citing concerns that individuals were not given the chance to argue their case in court. The White House defended the administration's actions, claiming the detainees were "foreign terrorists". The act, previously used during wartime, allows for the detention and removal of citizens from "enemy" nations, but the Supreme Court has ruled that they must be given a chance to challenge their removal.</p>

The FAIR Plan, overwhelmed by increasing wildfire risks, is facing financial strain, leading to potential surcharges for all California homeowners.</p>

The case raises questions about the effectiveness of VioGén in protecting women from domestic violence, with critics suggesting it may lead police to abdicate decision-making to an algorithm. An independent audit revealed that many women murdered by their partners had previously been assessed as low risk by the system. There are calls for greater transparency and oversight of the algorithm to ensure it accurately identifies and protects women at risk.</p>

            <p>Despite Russian President Vladimir Putin announcing an "Easter truce," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reported continued Russian attacks. Putin claimed the truce would last until the end of Sunday and that Russian forces should be prepared to respond to any violations. Zelensky said Kyiv would adhere to the truce but accused Moscow of breaking it, adding that some areas had become quieter. The UK responded by saying that Putin needed to show that he was serious about ending the invasion.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportation of Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act, which allows the president to detain and deport natives of "enemy" nations. The ACLU sued to stop the removal, arguing the detainees had not been able to contest their cases in court. The White House defended the actions, while the challenge by the ACLU said the Venezuelans detained had been given notices about their imminent deportation in English, despite one detainee only speaking Spanish.</p>
