          <p>President Trump stated he is seeking a "real end" to Iran's nuclear program, not just a ceasefire with Israel, while speaking to reporters on Air Force One after cutting short his G7 visit. He emphasized that Iran should completely abandon its nuclear ambitions. Trump also mentioned he would be in the White House Situation Room Tuesday to monitor developments in the Middle East and insisted Iran knows not to harm U.S. troops. He suggested that Israel would not be slowing down its attacks on Iran and hoped Iran's nuclear program would be eliminated long before any need for U.S. intervention. The situation remains tense as Trump focuses on a long-term resolution. Optimism regarding a peaceful resolution in the short term remains low.</p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates National Guard rescued the crew of an oil tanker, the Adalynn, after it collided with another tanker, the Front Eagle, in the Strait of Hormuz. The incident, described as a navigational one and not security-related by British maritime security firm Ambrey, led to a fire on the deck of the Front Eagle. The Strait of Hormuz is a vital maritime entry point for Persian Gulf oil, and the collision has raised concerns amidst escalating regional tensions between Israel and Iran. Frontline, the company managing the Front Eagle, is cooperating with authorities as emergency response efforts continue. The incident underscores the vulnerability of this critical shipping lane.</p>

          <p>President Trump departed the G7 summit early to address the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, following a social media warning for Iranians to evacuate Tehran. Meanwhile, Vance Boelter faces federal and state murder charges for allegedly killing a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband, and wounding another lawmaker and his wife. Separately, Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family reached a $7.4 billion settlement with all 50 states over the company's marketing of opioids, including a provision allowing individuals harmed by OxyContin to pursue civil lawsuits against the Sackler family. The settlement aims to address the harm caused by the opioid epidemic.</p>

          <p>Wendy Thomas's tip led to the arrest of Vance Boelter, the suspect in the shooting of Minnesota lawmakers, after she saw him in a field near Green Isle. Boelter is accused of killing a state lawmaker and her husband and wounding another lawmaker and his wife, allegedly impersonating a police officer during the attacks. Officials say Boelter possessed firearms and a list of 45 elected officials, though a motive remains unclear. In response, Minnesota state Sen. Scott Dribble and Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan called for a reduction in divisive political rhetoric and urged elected officials to display humanity and reach across the aisle.</p>

          <p>Technology experts are questioning the Trump Organization's claim that its proposed $499 gold Trump phone can be manufactured entirely in the United States. Industry analysts suggest it is "virtually impossible" to source all-American components for the handset. Ethics concerns have also been raised regarding the venture, with some suggesting the phone is another way for President Trump to profit while in office. The Trump family has not specified which company would manufacture the phone, but Eric Trump implied that initial models might not be fully manufactured in the U.S. The project faces significant supply chain and manufacturing challenges.</p>

          <p>Conservatives have criticized American Federation of Teachers (AFT) chief Randi Weingarten following her animated "No Kings Day" speech targeting President Donald Trump and her departure from the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Weingarten declined the DNC's offer to stay on as an at-large member, citing disagreement with the party's direction, and her exit follows that of another union official and former Vice Chair David Hogg. Critics have slammed Weingarten's leadership of AFT, particularly her role in school closures during the pandemic, while some view her resignation as a sign of divisions within the Democratic Party. The "No Kings Day" protests coincided with Trump's military parade in Washington, D.C.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Apple in China: The Capture of the World's Greatest Company," explores how Apple's partnership with Foxconn revolutionized manufacturing in China. Apple's influence helped China transition from low-end manufacturing to producing cutting-edge technology, with Apple investing billions and training millions of Chinese workers. By 2009, virtually all of Apple's products were made in mainland China, marking a significant shift in global manufacturing. The book raises questions about whether Apple inadvertently contributed to China's geopolitical rise and dependence on authoritarian government.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to slow the pace of its government bond-buying reduction beyond next year, while maintaining current interest rates, reflecting a cautious approach to normalizing monetary policy amidst trade and economic uncertainties. Governor Kazuo Ueda expressed concerns about the outlook for Japan's economy due to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff hikes, noting that downside risks now outweigh upside ones for growth and prices. The BOJ will reduce debt buying by Â¥200 billion per quarter from April 2026, down from the current Â¥400 billion. The central bank is monitoring the economic impact of Trump's tariffs, particularly on the auto sector, and will review the pace of bond purchase reductions if needed to avoid market turbulence.

A study shows extreme drought periods have increased over the last 40 years, affecting areas like northern Chile and the southwestern US. Different types of drought, including meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological, each present unique challenges. The Mediterranean island of Cyprus is experiencing both agricultural and hydrological drought, with scarce rain leading to empty reservoirs and at-risk harvests.

          <p>Residents of Minnesota are experiencing a mix of grief and relief following the capture of Vance Boelter, the suspect in the killings of Melissa and Mark Hortman. The Hoffmans, also victims of Boelter's alleged attacks, expressed gratitude to law enforcement and emphasized the lack of place for political violence. Community members are mourning the loss of the Hortmans, particularly Melissa's contributions as a lawmaker, and seeking ways to honor their legacy. While the arrest provides a sense of closure, concerns remain about the rise in political violence and the need to address divisive rhetoric.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces reportedly killed 51 Palestinians and injured over 200 near an aid distribution site in southern Gaza, according to witnesses and rescuers. The incident occurred near a World Food Programme (WFP) site in Khan Younis, where thousands were gathering for flour distribution. Witnesses claim Israeli drones fired missiles, followed by shelling from an Israeli tank. The Israeli military stated it is reviewing the incident, noting a gathering near an aid distribution truck and proximity to IDF troops. The UN human rights chief has called for an investigation into shootings near aid sites, accusing Israel of weaponizing food.</p>

She said that the biggest challenges originate from China's accession to the WTO in 2001. Von der Leyen's comments set the stage for a showdown at the EU-China Summit in Beijing next month.</p>

One measure would raise the minimum wage for all workers in the city to $30 by July 2028, while the other would require a public vote on the construction of large hotels or major hotel expansions and "event centers." The union's move is a response to an effort by a coalition of businesses to overturn a city ordinance hiking the minimum wage of hotel and airport workers.

          <p>Despite evidence to the contrary, President Trump is pursuing mass deportations, driven by an apocalyptic vision and a desire to instill terror, not economic benefit. Studies show that illegal immigrants contribute positively to the economy, filling jobs that U.S. citizens don't typically take. Past deportation efforts, such as Operation Wetback, failed to halt illegal immigration and instead emboldened employers to exploit workers. Trump's seeming softening towards certain industries highlights his awareness of the economic disruptions caused by deportations, yet his rhetoric aims to create fear and control. The historical precedent suggests that mass deportations are a stopgap measure that ultimately fails to address the underlying issues.</p>

Similarly, declining religious affiliation reduces young people's sense of purpose and community connection. A bleak worldview, often reinforced by dystopian literature and social media, exacerbates anxiety and depression, particularly among girls. Rising cannabis use, sometimes used for self-medication, can also contribute to mental health issues. Addressing the crisis requires fostering purpose, meaning, and independence in young people.</p>
