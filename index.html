        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that a wide range of tariffs implemented by Donald Trump are illegal, stating the president overstepped his authority. The 7-4 decision argues that the power to set levies is a core congressional power, not one granted to the president under emergency economic acts. The ruling, which affects tariffs on most countries as well as specific ones for China, Canada, and Mexico, is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court, creating a major legal challenge to Trump's economic policies.</p>

          <p>Data reveals that live-fire military training has caused hundreds of wildfires across the UK since 2023, creating significant environmental and safety challenges. Firefighting efforts are often complicated by the presence of unexploded ordnance, some dating back to World War II, which makes the areas too dangerous for crews to enter. While the Ministry of Defence states it has robust safety policies, local residents are calling for stricter measures, including banning live-fire drills during the driest months to prevent further destruction.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans in the U.S. The court ruled that the administration likely acted unlawfully, as the governing statute does not permit the Homeland Security secretary to unilaterally vacate a prior extension of TPS. This decision upholds a lower court's injunction, emphasizing that Congress designed the TPS program to be insulated from shifting electoral politics, providing stability for those fleeing crisis.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned reported plans by the Trump administration to send military forces to Chicago, labeling the potential move an "invasion." Pritzker stated his office has not been consulted and suggested the deployment is politically motivated rather than a genuine effort to address crime. The White House dismissed the governor's concerns, escalating the conflict between state and federal authorities over the use of military personnel for domestic law enforcement, a tactic previously employed in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B has taken the stand in a civil trial where she is accused of assaulting a security guard in 2018, an allegation she denies. Her animated testimony and sharp responses to questions about the incident, as well as her wigs and fingernails, have gone viral on social media, with many users comparing the proceedings to a comedy sketch. The case centers on a verbal altercation outside a doctor's office, with the plaintiff claiming it became physical, while Cardi B insists she feared for her unborn child's safety and did not touch the guard.</p>

          <p>A high-stakes battle over California's congressional maps is intensifying, with millions of dollars in television ads set to air across the state. The ads target Proposition 50, a special-election ballot measure that would set aside the current independent commission-drawn boundaries in an effort to create more Democratic-leaning districts. This move is part of a national partisan "redistricting arms race," with opponents framing it as a political power grab, while supporters argue it's necessary to counter Republican gerrymandering in other states.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled $4.9 billion in foreign aid funding that was previously approved by Congress, affecting 15 international programs. The White House utilized a rare "pocket rescission" procedure to bypass congressional approval, a move last used nearly 50 years ago and criticized by some lawmakers as illegal. The cuts primarily target USAID and UN peacekeeping missions, drawing sharp condemnation from Democrats who warn the action undermines legislative authority and increases the risk of a future government shutdown.</p>

          <p>A new study from Stanford Medicine reveals that young children diagnosed with ADHD are frequently prescribed medication without first trying behavioral interventions, contrary to clinical guidelines. The research, which analyzed nearly 10,000 health records, found that 42% of diagnosed children aged 3 to 5 were prescribed drugs within just 30 days of their diagnosis. Experts warn that while medication can be helpful, behavioral therapy should be the first line of treatment for this age group due to potential side effects and the high likelihood of families discontinuing the medication.</p>

          <p>Texas has enacted a new congressional map designed to create five additional safe Republican seats, with four of them being Hispanic-majority districts. This strategy represents a significant gamble by the GOP, testing whether the party's recent inroads with Latino voters can be solidified into long-term electoral advantages. While Republican leaders express confidence, some polls suggest Latino support for the GOP may be softening due to economic and immigration policies, making the outcome of this gerrymander uncertain.</p>

          <p>Pennsylvania State Representative Malcolm Kenyatta is undertaking a 105-mile, five-day solo march from Philadelphia to the state capitol in Harrisburg. His protest aims to draw attention to severe budget cuts facing the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (Septa), which he attributes to inaction by the Republican-led state legislature. Kenyatta argues that the funding crisis, which is already impacting services for students and workers, is a result of misplaced priorities. He frames his march as part of a "time-honored American tradition" of protest.</p>

          <p>A San Bernardino man who publicly protested after a U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer shot at his truck has now been arrested and charged with assaulting federal officers. His attorneys claim the pre-dawn raid on his home, involving an armored vehicle, was an act of intimidation for speaking out. Federal authorities allege he tried to run them down during the initial stop, a claim his lawyers say is contradicted by video evidence. The man has since been transferred into ICE custody, escalating the conflict.</p>

          <p>Residents of Mexico City are protesting against the dramatic rise in rental prices and the displacement of locals, fueled by an influx of foreign tourists and remote workers. Demonstrators in trendy neighborhoods like Condesa argue that the proliferation of short-term lets is forcing long-term residents out and altering the cultural fabric of their communities. The protests, some of which have turned confrontational with chants of "Gringos out!", highlight the growing social tensions as economic pressures from gentrification reach a boiling point.</p>

          <p>It was a difficult day for American men's tennis at the US Open, with two top contenders eliminated in quick succession. Sixth-seed Ben Shelton was forced to retire from his third-round match due to a shoulder injury while leading, marking the first retirement of his career. Shortly after, seventeenth-seed Frances Tiafoe was defeated in a straight-sets upset by a German qualifier. These losses significantly diminish the home country's chances of ending its 22-year drought for a men's Grand Slam singles champion.</p>
