        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman indicated she would support an interest rate cut at the Fed's next policy meeting in July, contingent on inflation pressures remaining muted. Speaking in Prague, Bowman echoed sentiments from fellow Governor Christopher Waller, suggesting that President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to significantly impact prices, thus opening the door for lower rates. She emphasized the importance of bringing the policy rate closer to its neutral setting to sustain a healthy labor market, while closely monitoring economic conditions as administration policies and financial markets evolve. Economists had initially feared Trump's tariffs would spike inflation, but measures have shown little impact so far, and Trump has softened his stance, opening negotiations with trading partners.

          <p>Jasmine Black, a 48-year-old experienced skydiver with over 160 jumps, died in Georgia after her main parachute collided with another skydiver's gear near Thomaston Upson County Airport. The preliminary investigation suggests that Black attempted a "cutaway" maneuver, disconnecting her malfunctioning main parachute, but her emergency chute failed to deploy due to the low altitude. The Upson County Sheriff's Office and the Federal Aviation Administration are investigating the incident, which occurred during a jump with Skydive Atlanta. This company was also involved in a similar fatal skydiving accident in 2020, where a tandem jump resulted in the death of an 18-year-old woman and her instructor due to a parachute malfunction.</p>

          <p>The joint US-Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities are viewed as a reflection of a failing strategy based on pressure and destabilization, with critics suggesting it's a desperate attempt to force regime change and support Israeli dominance. While the strikes caused damage, Iran's missile response and preparedness indicate the limitations of military action. Experts argue that Iran's nuclear program is a strategic tool for deterrence and leverage, and that diplomacy remains the only viable solution. The article advocates for a reassessment of US policy, prioritizing regional equilibrium over unconditional support for Israel and focusing on long-term US interests.</p>

          <p>Emma Raducanu commended Wimbledon for preventing a man who had been stalking her from purchasing tickets to the championships. The All England Club's security measures identified the man, who had followed Raducanu to four tournaments in February, and blocked his attempt to enter the public ballot. Raducanu expressed gratitude for the notification and police contact, acknowledging that she is not the first athlete to experience such issues. The man had previously been given a restraining order by Dubai police, and his name was circulated among tennis authorities.</p>

          <p>President Trump demanded that "everyone" keep oil prices down to avoid playing "into the hands of the enemy" amid escalating conflict in the Middle East following U.S. strikes on Iran. He urged the Department of Energy to increase drilling. U.S. crude oil prices declined slightly following Trump's statement. The message comes after U.S. bombings of Iranian nuclear sites, raising concerns about potential disruptions to energy supplies and a spike in global oil prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The US bombing of Iran's nuclear sites, supported by Israel, is analyzed as driven by political opportunity rather than an imminent nuclear threat. The article argues that Iran's perceived weakness, both internally and regionally, has created an opportunity to eliminate the Iran-led Axis of Resistance and establish Israeli regional dominance. Despite claims of Iran's nuclear ambitions, intelligence assessments suggest it was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon. The real threat, according to the author, is Iran's independent foreign policy and ideological opposition to Israeli and American policy in the region.</p>

Iran could also attempt to disrupt oil passage through the Strait of Hormuz, impacting global energy markets.

          <p>Police are appealing for information after an 18th-century violin worth more than £150,000 was stolen from The Marquess Tavern in Islington, north London. The instrument, which belonged to a member of London's Philharmonia Orchestra, was allegedly stolen on February 18. The violin, made by Lorenzo Carcassi in Florence in 1740, was on long-term loan to the victim from a businessman. The violinist was eating dinner in the pub when the instrument was snatched from next to him.</p>
