        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Honda Motor's first-quarter operating profit fell by half, significantly missing analyst expectations due to the impact of U.S. auto tariffs and a strengthening yen. Despite this, the company's revenue exceeded forecasts, and it raised its full-year profit outlook, anticipating a weaker yen and a smaller-than-expected impact from the tariffs. The report highlights the broader struggles of Japanese automakers like Nissan and Toyota, which are facing similar trade-related pressures and have resorted to price cuts to maintain U.S. market share.

          <p>The BBC has begun airing a new series of MasterChef that was filmed before its hosts, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were fired following an investigation into misconduct allegations. The decision to broadcast the pre-recorded season has faced backlash from some groups, but the BBC stated it was "the right thing to do" for the contestants. The new episodes have reportedly been re-edited to reduce the hosts' on-screen presence and banter, and one contestant was removed at her own request following the controversy surrounding the presenters.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An economic think tank, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr), has warned that UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves must implement "a moderate but sustained increase in taxes" to cover a projected £41.2 billion shortfall in public finances. The report suggests that without tax hikes, the government will fail to meet its self-imposed borrowing rules, creating a "trilemma" between its spending commitments, tax promises, and fiscal targets. Niesr's recommendations include reforming council tax and extending the freeze on income tax thresholds to stabilize the UK's finances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores how Premier League teams could strategically revolutionize throw-ins, a largely untapped aspect of modern football. Referencing the iconic long throws of Stoke City's Rory Delap, it questions why more teams haven't developed specialized throw-in tactics, especially since the set-piece is not subject to the offside rule. The analysis suggests that with dedicated training and a shift in mindset, throw-ins could be treated like corners, with complex set plays, decoy runs, and direct attacks on goal, transforming them from simple restarts into potent offensive weapons.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant strategic shift, U.S. artificial intelligence firm OpenAI has launched two new open-source AI models, GPT-OSS-120b and GPT-OSS-20b. CEO Sam Altman described the release as a major development, positioning the models as highly capable and usable alternatives in a field where Chinese companies have recently gained prominence with their own open-source offerings. This move marks a return to OpenAI's origins and is seen as a direct challenge to the growing global popularity of Chinese models, such as Alibaba's Qwen family, though analysts note China still leads in the quantity of available models.</p>

          <p>Ion Iliescu, who became Romania's first freely elected president after the 1989 overthrow of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, has died at the age of 95. Iliescu seized power during the bloody revolution, a move that remains controversial, with many questioning his role in the violence that followed Ceausescu's fall. During his multiple terms as president, he established what he called an "original democracy," but was also responsible for violently suppressing opposition protests by bringing miners to Bucharest, a dark chapter known as the "mineriads." His legacy is complex, marked by both a transition toward democracy and the lingering shadows of his authoritarian tactics.</p>

          <p>According to a new report from the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the Great Barrier Reef has suffered its largest-ever annual loss of live coral cover. The decline is attributed to a severe and widespread mass bleaching event in early 2024, driven by unprecedented levels of ocean heat stress linked to climate change. Scientists observed that the northern and southern regions were hit hardest, with coral cover dropping by as much as one-third, indicating that the world's largest reef system is an ecosystem under significant stress and experiencing increased volatility.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes the significant difficulties athletes face when attempting to transition from other sports, particularly rugby, to the NFL, highlighted by Welsh star Louis Rees-Zammit's recent return to rugby. Key obstacles include the immense complexity of learning an NFL playbook, which one former player described as more difficult than studying for law exams. Another major hurdle is the 'planet theory,' which posits that only a rare few possess the unique combination of size and athleticism for certain positions, making it easier for linemen to transition than for skill position players who face a much larger pool of established talent.</p>

          <p>China is facing a shortage of available rockets, creating a potential bottleneck as it races to build satellite internet constellations to rival SpaceX's Starlink. This scarcity is highlighting a divide between national projects like Guo Wang, which has secured multiple recent launches on state-owned Long March rockets, and locally-backed initiatives like Shanghai's Qianfan. To keep its project on schedule, Qianfan is now turning to private rocket companies, issuing a large tender for seven launches to deploy 94 satellites by early next year, indicating a growing reliance on the commercial sector.</p>

          <p>An alleged attempted carjacking and assault on a former staffer of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in Washington, D.C., has prompted a strong reaction from President Trump. Two 15-year-olds were arrested in connection with the incident, where the former staffer was reportedly assaulted by a group of teenagers. In response to the event, President Trump criticized the city's crime rate as "totally out of control" and threatened to use his executive powers to "FEDERALIZE this City" if local authorities do not improve public safety.</p>

Kennedy stated the decision was a shift toward "safer, broader vaccine strategies," such as whole-virus vaccines. The move has drawn sharp criticism from infectious disease experts, who described it as a dangerous decision that undermines pandemic preparedness and disregards the proven safety and effectiveness of mRNA technology.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has filed a lawsuit with the state's Supreme Court to remove Democratic State Representative Gene Wu from office, labeling him the "ringleader" of a legislative walkout. Dozens of Democratic lawmakers fled the state to deny a quorum and block a vote on a controversial Republican-led redistricting plan. Abbott's petition argues that Wu and the other absent Democrats have abandoned their official duties, justifying their removal from office, escalating the high-stakes political showdown over the state's congressional maps.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has arrested and charged two Chinese nationals in California for illegally exporting millions of dollars' worth of sensitive technology, including Nvidia's advanced H100 AI chips, to China.

          <p>A recent national poll suggests that Latino voters who supported President Trump in 2024 are not guaranteed to vote for Republican congressional candidates in the 2026 midterm elections. The survey, conducted by Equis, found a significant drop in intended Republican support for Congress compared to presidential votes, with a quarter of pro-Trump Latinos being uncertain or not planning to vote Republican. This potential erosion of support could pose a challenge for the GOP, particularly as it aims to gain seats through controversial redistricting plans in states like Texas.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered the civil arrest of Democratic lawmakers who left the state to block a vote on a Republican-drawn congressional redistricting map. The Democrats' departure broke the legislative quorum, halting all business in the House and prompting the Republican speaker to issue warrants for their arrest to compel their return. This escalating standoff is centered on a GOP plan, backed by President Trump, to create five new Republican-leaning congressional seats ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, a move Democrats are fighting with this last-resort constitutional tool.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of a medium-security state prison in Norco by fall 2026. The decision is driven by a significant decline in the state's overall inmate population and is expected to save the state $150 million annually. The facility, which houses nearly 2,800 inmates, will not release prisoners early but will transfer them to other institutions, while the state will attempt to reassign the 1,200 staff members. The prison's site was originally a luxury resort, and local officials hope it may one day be restored to its former glory.</p>
