          <p>Singapore's economy demonstrated robust growth in the second quarter of 2025, expanding by 4.3% year-over-year and beating economists' forecasts. The manufacturing sector was a primary driver of this acceleration, growing by 5.5% despite making up only 17% of the nation's economy. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, highlighting significant uncertainties and downside risks from global trade tensions, particularly U.S. tariff policies. The country's central bank had previously loosened monetary policy due to these external risks, presenting a mixed picture for future decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a FIBA U18 Women’s EuroBasket game, 17-year-old French player Alicia Tournebize created a viral moment by performing a powerful dunk against Belgium. The 6-foot-4 athlete stole the ball and completed the dunk in transition during the fourth quarter, contributing to France's 72-47 victory and a third-place finish in the tournament. Tournebize, who had previously made history as the first French woman to dunk in a competitive game, scored 19 points and secured 12 rebounds.

          <h2>Proposed Federal Cuts to Public Broadcasting Raise Concerns for Rural American Communities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 21:15:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A proposal to rescind $1.1 billion in federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is facing a crucial Senate vote, championed by President Trump who alleges media bias. While outlets like NPR and PBS would be affected, over 70% of the funding supports local stations, many of which are in rural areas and serve as the sole news source. Reporters and some Republican senators, like Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, argue these stations provide essential, life-saving information, particularly during emergencies in remote regions. The potential cuts have sparked a debate over the role of public media and its impact on communities in "news deserts."</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department is investigating the disappearance of a Colt M4 assault rifle from a squad car's trunk in South L.A. The weapon, along with five fully loaded magazines containing 30 rounds each, was noticed missing on Saturday night. Authorities have released the deputies' four-mile travel route, hoping the public can provide information or surveillance footage to help locate the missing firearm. An internal investigation is also underway to determine if departmental procedures were followed correctly, while the department stresses the public safety risk posed by the unaccounted-for weapon.</p>

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported the fighting occurred in the predominantly Druze city of Sweida, with the dead including 27 Druze individuals and 10 Bedouins. The violence, reportedly sparked by a wave of kidnappings, marks a significant escalation in a long-running feud between the two groups.

Additionally, a record number of penalty fare notices were issued on the London Overground. TfL stated that fare evasion is not a victimless crime, as it deprives the transit system of vital funds for investment, and it aims to reduce the evasion rate to 1.5% by 2030.

          <p>Banyan Group founder Kwon Ping Ho, a 30-year veteran of the luxury hotel industry, observes that modern tourists have vastly different expectations than previous generations. He states that younger travelers, already jaded with conventional tourism, are seeking unique, out-of-the-way experiences that allow for deeper interaction with local communities. This contrasts with the checklist-style sightseeing of the past. Ho also notes a shift toward what he calls "rainbow tourism," with a more diverse, global clientele from developing nations traveling worldwide, creating a multifaceted and dynamic industry far different from the primarily Western-centric tourism of three decades ago.</p>

This strategy aims to expedite military aid by moving equipment from closer European countries rather than directly from U.S. factories. The meeting comes as the Trump administration faces bipartisan pressure to enact legislation imposing heavy sanctions on Russia's economy and its international supporters. The plan, described by Senator Lindsey Graham as a "sledgehammer," would grant the president authority to impose tariffs up to 500% on countries aiding Russia's war effort.

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, known for his "illiberal democracy" and admired by some global conservative figures, is facing a significant political challenge from within his own former circle. Peter Magyar, once an insider, has emerged as a popular opposition figure, capitalizing on a government scandal and public discontent with the state of hospitals, schools, and the economy. While Orban has long maintained power by targeting liberal values, Magyar's center-right Tisza party is now polling ahead of Orban's Fidesz party.

          <p>A severe, prolonged drought in northern Mexico is intensifying a long-running water dispute with the United States. Under an 81-year-old treaty, Mexico is required to send water to the U.S. from the Rio Grande, but it is currently in arrears due to critically low reservoir levels in states like Chihuahua. The Trump administration has threatened tariffs if Mexico doesn't fulfill its obligations, while Mexican farmers argue they cannot give water they don't have. The conflict highlights issues of agricultural inefficiency and the outdated nature of the treaty in the face of modern climate change and population growth.</p>

          <p>Chelsea secured the FIFA Club World Cup title with a stunning 3-0 victory over Paris Saint-Germain, driven by a remarkable performance from Cole Palmer. The 23-year-old scored two brilliant first-half goals and provided an assist for a third by João Pedro, overwhelming the European champions before halftime. Coach Enzo Maresca's game plan effectively neutralized PSG, and the win crowns a successful first season for him, which also included a Conference League title and Champions League qualification. The victory was marred slightly by a post-match brawl and President Trump being booed during the trophy ceremony.</p>

          <p>Buckingham Palace has confirmed that President Donald Trump will make a second state visit to the United Kingdom from September 17-19, where he will be hosted by King Charles III at Windsor Castle. This marks an unprecedented invitation, as no other American president has received two state visits, a move widely seen as a strategic effort by the UK government to maintain strong diplomatic ties. The visit, which will include a full ceremonial welcome and state banquet, comes as Prime Minister Keir Starmer seeks to influence Trump on issues like the war in Ukraine and US tariffs on UK exports.</p>

          <p>The FIFA Club World Cup final between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain was marked by a pre-match and halftime spectacle more akin to an American Super Bowl than a traditional European football match. The event in New Jersey featured a military flyover, fireworks, a red carpet for celebrities, and performances by Robbie Williams and Coldplay's Chris Martin. US President Donald Trump was a prominent guest, appearing on the field for the post-match ceremony. This blend of high-stakes soccer with grand-scale American entertainment highlights FIFA's strategy for the expanded tournament, creating a unique and perhaps polarizing experience for global football fans.</p>

          <p>The White House is defending a new 50% tariff on Brazil, citing a broad strategy to onshore production and reduce what it calls a national security risk posed by a massive trade deficit. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett argued the move is part of a collective global strategy, even though the U.S. currently runs a trade surplus with Brazil. The justification for the tariff also referenced a criminal case against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a political ally of President Trump. The administration also defended imposing tariffs on copper, stating it is a vital metal for national defense. (not investment advice)</p>

The rapper appeared on stage early and acknowledged the strict 21:30 curfew, performing a rushed medley of his hits. The short set was a stark contrast to his previous two nights at the festival, which were significantly longer and featured numerous special guests. The abrupt ending, coupled with the mysterious removal of a second planned Drake set from the day's schedule, left many attendees feeling shortchanged and frustrated by the truncated performance.</p>

          <p>Italy's Jannik Sinner has won his first Wimbledon men's singles championship, defeating two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz of Spain. After losing the first set, the 23-year-old Sinner rallied to win the next three, sealing his victory with a powerful 137 mph ace. The win is a significant turnaround for Sinner, who lost a grueling five-set match to Alcaraz at the French Open just over a month ago. In his victory speech, Sinner acknowledged that processing the tough loss in Paris was a key reason he was able to persevere and achieve his dream of winning the prestigious tournament.</p>

The victory was emotionally significant for the 23-year-old Italian, who also overcame an elbow injury during the tournament and a doping ban earlier in the year to claim the world number one ranking and the coveted trophy.</p>

The house, a cherished gathering place for nearly 60 years, was inundated with water and mud, and the family lacked flood insurance due to its high cost. This personal story highlights a broader issue, as only 2% of residents in hard-hit Kerr County have flood insurance. Despite the financial strain and the increasing frequency of such disasters, the family's deep emotional connection to the property is driving their decision to restore their home.</p>

          <p>A Senate committee report has blamed the U.S. Secret Service for a "cascade of preventable failures" leading to the assassination attempt on Donald Trump at a rally last summer. The report highlights a lack of structured communication as the greatest contributor, noting that information about the shooter was not relayed to Trump's security detail in time. It also identified organizational mistakes, such as a countersniper team having an obstructed view of the shooter's location. The Secret Service stated it has implemented reforms following the incident, including disciplining six employees, though the committee noted no one was fired.</p>

When Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies arrived at the scene, the dogs were blocking the entrance to the yard, preventing paramedics from reaching the victim. A deputy was forced to shoot and kill one of the pit bulls to allow medical personnel to access the man, who was then transported to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. The victim's identity has not been released, and it is unclear if he was a resident of the home. Animal control took four other dogs from the property.</p>
