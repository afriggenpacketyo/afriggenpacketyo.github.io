          <p>Televangelist Jimmy Swaggart, 90, is in critical condition after suffering a cardiac arrest at his home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. His son, Donnie Swaggart, reported that he and his brother administered chest compressions before EMTs arrived, managing to revive his heartbeat before transporting him to the hospital. Swaggart, founder of Jimmy Swaggart Ministries and the Family Worship Center, gained notoriety in 1988 for a scandal involving a sex worker, leading to his defrocking by the Assemblies of God, though he continued to preach. He is also the cousin of the late rock and roll legend Jerry Lee Lewis, and one of Lewis' final records was a gospel album he recorded with Jimmy Swaggart that was released just a few months before Lewis' death. The article reports that Swaggart remains in the ICU under close medical care. </p>

Authorities are trying to determine if the two men were appointed by protest organizers, volunteered, or were self-appointed, noting that neither has law enforcement experience. The protest, organized by 50501, drew an estimated 10,000 people, and police state there was no indication of organized security in the event's permit. </p>

          <p>G7 leaders convened to discuss global trade amidst tensions stemming from President Trump's tariffs and unilateral approaches. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney emphasized the need for cooperation and economic prosperity in a divided world, though Trump reiterated his desire to include Russia in the group and floated the idea of including China. The summit was overshadowed by escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, prompting Trump to leave early. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stressed the importance of a free, fair, and rules-based economic order and maintaining the multilateral free trade regime, and stability in the Indo-Pacific region is expected to be a key point of alignment among leaders. </p>

          <p>SK Hynix shares have reached a two-decade high following reports that SK Group plans to construct South Korea's largest AI data center in partnership with Amazon Web Services. The company's shares have already surged nearly 50% this year due to the AI boom, and the project is reportedly led by SK Telecom and SK Broadband, with support from SK Hynix. SK Hynix is a leading supplier of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and has become a leader in high bandwidth memory used in artificial intelligence servers, supplying to clients such as Nvidia.

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump have made little progress in resolving tariff disputes during their summit, raising doubts about a swift agreement to protect Japan's auto sector. Ishiba emphasized the need for a mutually beneficial deal and stated that ministerial talks will continue, but the two countries remain divided on key aspects. The United States has granted Japan a 90-day reprieve from tariffs, but Ishiba did not confirm whether an extension was discussed, while Japan urges the U.S. to reconsider its tariff policy, particularly the 25% tariff on autos. Despite the ongoing discussions, Ishiba maintains that Japan will not rush into a deal that compromises its national interests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani made his highly anticipated pitching debut for the Los Angeles Dodgers, marking his return to the mound after undergoing Tommy John surgery in September 2023. Ohtani pitched one inning, allowing one run on two hits while reaching 100 mph with his fastball, receiving a standing ovation as he took the mound. Initially, the Dodgers planned to delay Ohtani's pitching return until after the All-Star break, but Ohtani expressed concerns about the toll of simulated sessions on his body. Moving forward, Ohtani is expected to pitch once per week, gradually increasing his workload as the season progresses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House of Commons is set to debate a law change aimed at decriminalizing abortion, with two Labour MPs, Tonia Antoniazzi and Stella Creasy, proposing rival amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill. Antoniazzi's amendment seeks to prevent the investigation, arrest, prosecution, or imprisonment of women who terminate their own pregnancies, arguing that investigations are dehumanizing and prolonged. Her amendment would maintain punishments for medical professionals and violent partners who end a pregnancy outside of the existing law, while Stella Creasy's amendment offers a different approach. Current law in England and Wales permits abortion up to 24 weeks and beyond in certain circumstances, subject to approval by two doctors.</p>

          <p>The number of Americans aged 55 and older experiencing homelessness is increasing, with over 140,000 individuals in this age group currently unhoused, a number projected to triple by 2030. This aging homeless population often faces complex chronic medical conditions and vulnerabilities, and homelessness is frequently triggered by events like the death of a spouse, job loss, or mounting medical issues. Experts highlight the impact on healthcare systems, as older homeless individuals are hospitalized at high rates and often lack support for discharge, leading to nursing home placements. There are concerns about the potential impact of rising costs and cuts to government programs like Medicaid on seniors experiencing homelessness.</p>

          <p>Japan, known for its pacifist constitution, is shifting its focus toward the global arms export market, aiming to deepen ties with allies and enhance the interoperability of its forces. This move is driven more by security concerns than by profiting from rising global arms demand, and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has signaled a sharper focus on the defense sector. By exporting arms, Japan can standardize maintenance processes and create joint training opportunities, and the country also seeks to develop its defense industrial base, which has been struggling. The country has largely purchased weapons from the U.S., such as the F-35 fighter jets and SPY-7 radar systems, which has led to severe situations among the defense industry based in Japan.</p>

          <p>The Senate Finance Committee's version of President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" has created a potential clash with the House, as some Senate Republicans raise concerns about key provisions. Senators are objecting to changes to Medicaid provider taxes, while the House is warning the Senate to stick closely to its plan or risk defections. Key sticking points include the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, Medicaid work requirements, and the size of the child tax credit, and some senators have conditioned their support on certain proposals. Republicans are using reconciliation to try to pass the bill with a simple majority.</p>

          <p>The Society of Radiographers (SoR) is warning that patients filming their medical treatment for TikTok or Instagram could pose risks to themselves and NHS staff. The union's annual conference revealed that an increasing number of patients are videoing procedures without permission, which can distract staff and compromise patient privacy. Sharing such material online risks publicizing private medical data of others in the same area, and NHS staff may feel uncomfortable and anxious.

          <p>California lawmakers have proposed a bill to ban law enforcement officers from concealing their faces while on duty, with exceptions for SWAT teams and medical reasons. The bill, prompted by concerns about masked federal officers during immigration raids, aims to increase transparency and accountability, and encourage officers to wear identification. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has criticized the proposal, arguing it endangers law enforcement officers by identifying them and subjecting them to retaliation. The bill is being offered as an amendment to a housing measure, and it's unclear if it would affect undercover or plainclothes officers.</p>

Labrot said his concerns grew as Musk's public antics became more political and more controversial, which has resulted in the company struggling to maintain customer enthusiasm.
