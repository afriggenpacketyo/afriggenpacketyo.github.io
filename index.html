          <p>Oracle's shares experienced an 8% increase in extended trading after the company released its fiscal fourth-quarter results, surpassing Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.70 against an expected $1.64, and revenue reached $15.9 billion, exceeding the projected $15.59 billion. Oracle anticipates cloud infrastructure revenue to rise by over 70% in fiscal year 2026, which is a significant jump from the 52% growth seen this past quarter. The company is also benefiting from Chinese online retailer Temu moving its infrastructure to Oracle's cloud. Optimism stems from strong financial performance and future growth projections in the cloud sector. </p>

          <p>The Justice Department has reinforced President Trump's authority to mobilize the National Guard in California, dismissing Governor Newsom's lawsuit as a "crass political stunt." The administration contends that Trump has no obligation to consult with Newsom before federalizing the National Guard, citing the president's role as commander in chief. This legal battle arises from Trump's invocation of 10 U.S.C. Â§ 12406, which permits the deployment of the National Guard in cases of "rebellion or danger of a rebellion." Republican attorneys general have sided with Trump, accusing California of excusing lawlessness, while Newsom argues the immigration protests do not constitute a rebellion.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has appointed eight new members to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a crucial panel advising the CDC.

Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and FDA vaccine advisor, criticized the appointments, suggesting the public will receive lower-quality advice compared to the previous committee, as the new members will likely shift vaccine policy and availability. </p>

          <p>Oil prices rose more than 4% due to escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran, with President Trump expressing doubts about reaching a nuclear deal. The U.S. is preparing a partial embassy evacuation in Iraq, and the military authorized the voluntary departure of troops' dependents from the Middle East. The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations warned of increased regional tensions that could lead to military activity. Iran's defense minister cautioned that U.S. bases in the region are within reach of their military. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's declaration that the trade war with China is "done" and tariffs will remain at 55%, logistics and retail industry executives warn that the damage to the supply chain and the U.S. economy will persist. They argue that the existing tariffs will put companies and jobs at risk, with consumers ultimately bearing the cost. While Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested extending tariff pauses for countries negotiating in good faith, concerns about consumer demand and potential recession linger. Freight carriers focused on trade between the U.S. and the EU are also worried about tariff uncertainty and its impact on exports and imports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>TikTok star Khaby Lame has departed the US after being detained by immigration officials for overstaying his visa. Lame, known for his silent videos, was detained in Las Vegas and subsequently left the country voluntarily. This voluntary departure allows him to avoid a deportation order, which could prevent him from returning to the US for up to a decade. Lame's deportation highlights the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration, with ICE detentions reaching record highs. </p>

          <p>President Trump has stated that Chinese students are welcome at U.S. colleges and universities, seemingly reversing a recent policy that threatened to revoke their visas. This announcement, made as part of a brief outline of a trade deal with China, contrasts with earlier suggestions from Secretary of State Marco Rubio to increase vetting and potentially revoke visas for Chinese students. The potential policy shift has caused uncertainty at universities, which rely on international students for tuition revenue and campus diversity. Experts suggest that this reversal may be a negotiation tactic or reflect the importance of educating Chinese students in American values.</p>

The three-judge panel hearing the case acknowledged its extraordinary nature and is expected to issue a written opinion later.
