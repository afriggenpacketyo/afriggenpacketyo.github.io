          <p>The Trump administration is ending funding for a broad range of HIV vaccine research, asserting that current approaches are sufficient to combat the virus. This decision will shutter major research efforts at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute and the Scripps Research Institute. HHS claims this will maximize the impact of taxpayer dollars and ensure proper oversight, with critical HIV/AIDS programs continuing under a new agency. However, scientists warn that this move will set back HIV vaccine research by perhaps a decade, despite recent breakthroughs in the field.</p>

          <p>Norway is seeking to curb the excesses of the "russebuss," a tradition where school leavers party for weeks in rented buses before exams. Concerns have grown over heavy drinking, drug use, sleep deprivation, and exclusion due to high costs. Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store has intervened, and the Minister of Education aims to shift celebrations to the post-exam period. The goal is to reduce negative impacts on teenagers' well-being and grades, promoting a more inclusive graduation celebration.</p>
