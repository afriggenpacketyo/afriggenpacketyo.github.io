          <p>Israel's recent attacks on Iran aim to destabilize the regime and potentially trigger a popular uprising leading to regime change.  Beyond targeting nuclear capabilities, the strikes killed several high-ranking Iranian military officials.

          <p>Following Israeli airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities and military leaders, Iran launched a retaliatory missile attack on Israel.  The attacks caused damage and injuries in Tel Aviv, despite Israel's Iron Dome defense system intercepting many missiles.  The U.S. reportedly assisted Israel in intercepting some missiles, while President Trump urged Iran to negotiate to prevent further escalation.  The conflict significantly increases the risk of a broader regional war.</p>
