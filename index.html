          <p>A shooting incident at Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire, on Saturday night left multiple individuals injured, with at least one critically. Authorities initially reported two armed suspects but later confirmed, through surveillance footage, that a single shooter was involved and is now in custody, assuring the public there is no ongoing threat. The event prompted a shelter-in-place order in neighboring Dunstable, Massachusetts, and emergency services transported patients to area hospitals. The Nashua Police Department has established a unification site and continues its active investigation into the circumstances.</p>

          <p>British artist Morrissey canceled two US shows in Massachusetts and Connecticut after receiving a credible death threat ahead of a concert in Ottawa, Canada. A 26-year-old man was released on bail for allegedly uttering the threat against the singer, whose real name is Steven Morrissey. The incident, confirmed by a statement from the Boston venue, led to cancellations out of an abundance of caution for the artist's safety. Morrissey, known for his outspoken views, had previously canceled Canadian tours in protest of the seal hunt.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point, a move that initially sent stocks to record highs. However, long-term bond traders reacted by "selling the news," driving down bond prices and increasing yields. This rise in longer-term rates, including those for mortgages, suggests investor concern that the Fed might be overlooking persistent inflation above its 2% target, despite the central bank citing a softening labor market for its "risk management" cut. Experts warn that bond market reactions indicate a desire for more significant economic distress before long-term yields truly decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy issued a stern warning to Chicago and Boston, stating their transit systems risk losing federal support if they fail to improve safety amidst rising violence. Duffy condemned the "failure" to protect riders and workers, citing several violent incidents on the CTA and MBTA, and criticized "cashless bail" policies. He mandated both agencies submit reports within 14 days detailing safety measures, crime reduction strategies, and funding sources for 2025-2026. This action follows similar warnings to other major cities, emphasizing the administration's focus on public safety on transportation.</p>

          <p>Over a decade after Agnes Wanjiru, a 21-year-old Kenyan mother, was murdered, a Kenyan court has issued an arrest warrant for a UK national, allegedly a British soldier. Wanjiru's body was found in a septic tank near the Lions Court Hotel in 2012, after she was last seen with white men, some identified as soldiers. This potential extradition would mark a significant step towards justice for her family and friends, who have long campaigned for accountability. The case has highlighted broader issues of mistreatment of Kenyan women by British soldiers and institutional cover-ups.</p>

          <p>Evelyn Palla is reportedly set to become the first female CEO of Germany's national rail operator, Deutsche Bahn. Transport Minister Patrick Schneider is expected to announce the appointment, alongside broader plans for the company, on Monday. Palla, 52, who joined Deutsche Bahn in 2019 and previously led its regional subsidiary, will replace Richard Lutz, who was dismissed last month. Her appointment comes as the state-owned company faces significant challenges, including widespread delays and cancellations, prompting a government-led restructuring effort to modernize Germany's transport infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A cyber-attack on an electronic check-in and baggage system caused significant delays at Heathrow and several other European airports, including Brussels and Berlin. The disruption, affecting software provided by Collins Aerospace, led to manual check-in processes and hundreds of flight delays and cancellations. While British Airways used a backup system, many other airlines were impacted, causing long queues and missed connections for passengers. The National Cyber Security Centre and European Commission are monitoring the situation, working to resolve the issue and support affected travelers amidst ongoing investigations into the attack's origin.</p>

          <p>A right-wing, anti-immigration demonstration in The Hague, Netherlands, escalated into violence and chaos on Saturday, weeks before a general election. Rioters clashed with police, who deployed tear gas and water cannons, and vandalized an office of the centrist D66 political party. Around 1,500 anti-immigration protesters blocked a major highway, and a police car was torched. Caretaker Prime Minister Dick Schoof and right-wing leader Geert Wilders condemned the "shameless violence," which occurred amidst heightened political tensions following the collapse of the governing coalition over migration policies.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has warned California, New York, and Illinois that their refusal to honor ICE detainers could lead to federal lawsuits and funding cuts. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons accused these "sanctuary states" of obstructing immigration enforcement, claiming their policies release "criminal aliens" into communities. The states argue that ICE detainers are voluntary requests and that compliance could expose local authorities to liability for erroneous detentions. This escalation highlights the ongoing clash between the Trump administration's strict immigration policies and states asserting their sovereignty, with supporters of sanctuary laws emphasizing trust between police and immigrant communities.</p>

The MSNBC report claims Homan promised to help secure government contracts in the border security industry during Trump's second term.

However, more research is needed, and caution is advised regarding potential side effects and the importance of medical consultation for kidney conditions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and other prominent Republican figures are set to attend a memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Arizona, with heightened security measures in place. The event at State Farm Stadium, organized by Turning Point USA, is expected to draw over 100,000 attendees and will feature "TSA-level screening." The tight security follows Kirk's shooting death and an incident where an armed man was arrested at the stadium for impersonating law enforcement. The memorial occurs amidst deep political divisions in the US, with differing views on Kirk's legacy and the implications of his death.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced new restrictions for journalists, requiring them to agree not to disclose unauthorized information or risk losing their credentials and access to the facility. These changes, which also limit journalists' movement within the building, follow a series of recent leaks. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth stated the press does not "run the Pentagon" and must follow rules to protect national security and sensitive information. While the department asserts its commitment to transparency, press organizations view these measures as a significant curtailment of journalistic freedom and an attempt to control information.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers in Oklahoma have introduced legislation requiring all public universities to construct "Charlie Kirk Memorial Plazas," featuring a statue of the assassinated activist and signage proclaiming him a "modern civil rights leader." The bill, sponsored by Senators Shane Jett and Dana Prieto, mandates specific statue designs and threatens monthly fines for non-compliance, alongside automatic expulsion for vandalism. This proposal has drawn criticism, including from Martin Luther King III, who rejected comparisons to his father, highlighting Kirk's controversial past comments on race and gender.

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard revoked the security clearances of 37 individuals, including top CIA deputies and congressional staffers, without prior notification to the White House. This move caused significant internal consternation and deepened animosity between Gabbard and the CIA. A senior intelligence official claimed Gabbard was executing President Trump's directive to remove those involved in "politicization or weaponization of intelligence" related to the 2016 Russia assessments. However, White House advisers expressed frustration over the lack of transparency and potential separation-of-powers issues, viewing the episode as a blunder despite Gabbard's apparent alignment with Trump's agenda.</p>

Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that Oracle, led by Trump ally Larry Ellison, would manage data and privacy. This development follows the US's efforts to address national security concerns regarding the video-sharing app's Chinese ownership. While President Trump expressed approval, China's Commerce Ministry offered a less clear statement, welcoming negotiations but emphasizing compliance with Chinese laws.

          <p>President Donald Trump issued a stark warning to Afghanistan, threatening "bad things" if the country does not return control of the Bagram air base to the United States. Trump, who has expressed interest in regaining the base since its 2021 withdrawal, hinted at potential military action, though he declined to elaborate. Afghan officials have opposed a revived US presence, and experts caution that re-occupying the sprawling airfield would be complex, requiring significant troops and air defenses. The demand reflects Trump's broader interest in acquiring territories and sites, while raising concerns about potential international conflict.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed the "No Secret Police Act," banning law enforcement officers from wearing masks on duty, with exceptions for riot gear, medical masks, and undercover work. Newsom framed the law as a response to increased immigration enforcement by masked federal agents operating without clear identification, which he called a sign of "growing authoritarianism." While the law's enforceability on federal agents remains unclear, it applies to local agencies and aims to increase accountability and transparency. The move has drawn strong opposition from California law enforcement groups, who argue it endangers officers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ended the U.S. Department of Agriculture's annual Household Food Security Report, labeling it "overly politicized" and "rife with inaccuracies." This decision follows recent legislation signed by President Trump that significantly reduced food aid, with estimates suggesting 3 million people would lose food stamp eligibility. Critics argue that discontinuing the report deliberately hinders the ability to measure hunger and assess the impact of these cuts. They view it as a tactic to manipulate data, especially after a Census Bureau report indicated a slight dip in poverty rates before Trump took office.</p>

          <p>President Trump's executive order adds a steep $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa applications, a dramatic overhaul impacting tech and other companies reliant on highly skilled foreign workers. The new fee, a one-time charge for future applicants, has prompted major tech firms like Amazon and Microsoft to advise current H-1B holders to remain in the US. While the administration claims it prevents abuse and protects American workers, critics argue it will shrink the talent pipeline, hinder innovation, and incentivize companies to shift jobs overseas. This policy move challenges the tech industry's efforts to cultivate favor with the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision follows conditions set in July for Israel to agree to a ceasefire and commit to a two-state solution, which Downing Street acknowledges are unlikely to be met. While ministers cite a moral responsibility due to worsening humanitarian conditions in Gaza and settlement expansion, the move has drawn fierce criticism from the Israeli government and hostage families, who view it as rewarding terrorism.
