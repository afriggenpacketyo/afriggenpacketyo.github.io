          <p>UK newspapers focus on Chancellor Rachel Reeves' private warnings that tax increases are necessary following the abandonment of welfare reforms, a statement more direct than her public comments. The Daily Express speculates these rises could target middle earners to address a substantial fiscal gap. In other news, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson advises Conservatives to disregard the rise of Reform UK, while current Prime Minister Keir Starmer receives mixed reviews on his first year, with critics pointing to policy U-turns and mistakes.</p>

          <p>In a Club World Cup quarter-final, 18-year-old Brazilian phenom Estevao Willian scored a remarkable goal for Palmeiras against his future club, Chelsea. Despite his efforts, a late own goal secured a 2-1 victory for the London-based team, advancing them to the semi-finals. Chelsea's manager and players expressed excitement about the young talent's potential, with the deal reportedly worth up to £52 million. The match marked an emotional farewell for Estevao from his Brazilian club.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's current administration, led by President Lai Ching-te, is navigating a sensitive historical issue regarding the country's World War II legacy. Critics accuse the government of honoring the Republic of China's (ROC) wartime victory while intentionally downplaying its historical roots on the Chinese mainland before 1949. This approach aligns with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's emphasis on a distinct Taiwanese identity, separate from the legacy of the Kuomintang (KMT) government that retreated to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War.</p>

          <p>This commentary article posits that common analogies for Donald Trump's leadership style are limited by Eurocentrism and suggests a more fitting comparison is to cold war-era dictators in Africa. The author points to parallels such as the arbitrary renaming of landmarks, using military force against domestic protests, and theatrical economic policies that harm the nation. The piece argues that the U.S. historically supported such regimes, and now, disturbingly, appears to be emulating some of their authoritarian characteristics at home.</p>

Policy experts note this provides some relief but is misleadingly framed as a repeal of the tax on benefits. The deduction applies to all income, not just Social Security, and will not benefit low-income seniors who already pay no federal tax. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy reveals that the financial benefits of the new Republican tax bill are not distributed evenly among the nation's wealthiest households. The top 1% in states with no personal income tax, such as Wyoming, South Dakota, and Texas, stand to gain the most, with average tax cuts exceeding $100,000. This is because they benefit from provisions like lower income tax rates and business breaks without being negatively impacted by the bill's cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions.

          <p>The newly signed Republican tax and spending package introduces sweeping changes that will significantly affect Americans' finances, primarily by making the 2017 tax cuts permanent. The legislation increases the standard deduction, child tax credit, and the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, while also adding new breaks for seniors, tip income, and overtime pay. However, the bill is funded in part by deep cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid and food stamps, which critics argue will harm the nation's lowest earners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A feature article details the pivotal, behind-the-scenes role of Bishara Bahbah, a Palestinian-American economics professor, in the Gaza ceasefire and hostage negotiations. After being contacted by Hamas in April due to his perceived influence with the Trump administration, Dr. Bahbah has been operating from Qatar as an unofficial backchannel. He is credited with helping to build trust between the parties, which contributed to the "good faith" release of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander in May, demonstrating the effectiveness of this unconventional diplomatic track.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has voiced strong support for a decade-old idea from Warren Buffett to curb the national deficit, reposting a clip of the proposal with the comment "100% This is the way." Buffett's plan, stated in 2011, was to pass a law making all sitting members of Congress ineligible for reelection if the federal deficit exceeds 3% of GDP. The idea's resurgence, amplified by Musk and Republican Senator Mike Lee, taps into public frustration over government spending and a lack of political accountability for the nation's ballooning debt.

Zoo experts entrusted them with one of two eggs laid by another pair to improve the survival chances for both hatchlings. This event highlights both the commonality of same-sex pairings in the penguin world and the success of the zoo's international breeding program for Humboldt penguins, which are listed as a vulnerable and at-risk species.</p>

Demonstrators, including local activists and politicians, marched from City Hall to the federal building, criticizing the aggressive tactics of ICE and the deployment of the National Guard. The protest highlighted the widespread fear within the community and the growing political tensions between local California leaders and the federal government over immigration policy.</p>
