          <h2>UK Economy Experiences Unexpected Contraction in May</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's economy unexpectedly contracted by 0.1% in May, marking the second consecutive month of decline against economists' predictions of slight growth. According to the Office for National Statistics, the downturn was primarily driven by a fall in the production sector, with notable weakness in oil and gas extraction, car manufacturing, and pharmaceuticals. While the services sector saw some growth, particularly in legal services, this was offset by very weak retail sales, indicating continued economic pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Anticipation for the Wimbledon semifinal between Novak Djokovic and Jannik Sinner is tempered by injury concerns for both top players. Djokovic, 38, canceled a practice session after an awkward fall in his quarter-final, raising questions about his physical readiness for the high-stakes match. Similarly, world number one Sinner is managing a right elbow injury sustained earlier in the tournament, despite stating he would be "100% fit." These fitness uncertainties add a layer of drama to the highly awaited clash between the seasoned champion and the young star.</p>

          <p>The recent OPEC seminar, held at Vienna's historic Hofburg palace, brought together global energy leaders, including ministers and CEOs from major oil companies, to discuss the state of the market and investment. The lavish event was contrasted by protests held nearby, where demonstrators called for an oil embargo and voiced support for Gaza, highlighting geopolitical tensions influencing the energy sector. Key figures like Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman addressed the conference, while notable absences included ministers from Russia and Iran, with the latter participating via video link.</p>

          <p>Actor Ewan McGregor's request to replace the roof on his historic £2 million mansion in Scotland has been denied by the Perth and Kinross Council. His proposal sought to substitute the "beyond repair" lead roof with a modern Sarnafil membrane, citing issues with leaks and the risk of lead theft. However, the council determined that the proposed materials and methods would not preserve the building's special architectural interest and character. This decision presents a setback for the actor's efforts to renovate the 18th-century property he purchased in 2023.</p>

          <p>Tensions flared in Ventura County, California, after federal agents, including U.S. Border Patrol, executed a warrant at a marijuana facility, leading to a confrontation with protesters. Authorities deployed crowd-control measures like tear gas and less-lethal rounds, resulting in multiple injuries and hospitalizations. The incident drew sharp criticism from Governor Gavin Newsom, who condemned the "militaristic raids." In response, federal officials stated that ten unaccompanied migrant juveniles were discovered at the farm, prompting an investigation into potential child labor violations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to impose a 35% tariff on all goods imported from Canada, set to take effect on August 1.

          <p>The U.S. State Department is initiating a significant workforce reduction, planning to cut its domestic staff by around 15 percent, which amounts to approximately 1,800 positions. The layoffs are part of a sweeping reorganization plan by the Trump administration aimed at streamlining the department and eliminating what it calls "non-core functions." While officials state the goal is to create a more efficient bureaucracy, critics and employee unions have expressed deep concern that the cuts could weaken American diplomatic efforts and demoralize personnel.

          <p>The UK's advanced F-35 fighter jet program is being undermined by significant delays, cost overruns, and personnel shortages, according to a report from the National Audit Office (NAO). The public spending watchdog warned that these issues are compromising Britain's warfighting capability, despite the aircraft's technological superiority. The NAO noted a "disappointing return" on the £11 billion already invested and projected that the program's total cost could be more than three times the Ministry of Defence's initial estimate, urging a prioritization of resources.</p>

          <p>The United States is becoming a less attractive travel destination for a majority of Southeast Asians, according to a recent survey of 6,000 travelers from the region. The primary concerns cited were not costs, but rather potential discrimination, gun violence, and actions by the Trump administration. While nearly 80% of respondents said the U.S. is losing its appeal, interest remains relatively strong in countries like Vietnam and the Philippines, which have large diaspora communities in America. The findings suggest a complex shift in travel sentiment influenced by social and political factors.</p>

During the hearing, the judge expressed skepticism about the government's defense, noting a lack of specific evidence to justify the arrests and refuting claims of racial profiling.
