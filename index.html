          <p>Following the Pittsburgh Pirates' decision to fire manager Derek Shelton after a disappointing 12-26 start, rookie pitcher Paul Skenes expressed that he "wasn't shocked" by the move, acknowledging the team's poor record warranted accountability. Skenes also noted that a managerial change alone might not resolve the underlying issues, emphasizing the need for improved player performance. While acknowledging Shelton's hard work and sacrifice, Pirates' management deemed a change necessary to address the team's frustrating start to the season. Don Kelly was named as Shelton’s replacement as the Pirates seek to turn their season around.</p>

          <p>Shortly after a U.S.-brokered ceasefire between India and Pakistan, India accused Pakistan of violating the agreement with explosions in India-administered Kashmir. While Indian officials claimed their army was retaliating for a border intrusion, Pakistan denied the violation, accusing India of breaches in some areas. The ceasefire, announced by President Trump after mediation efforts led by the U.S., followed weeks of escalating clashes triggered by a tourist massacre, which India blamed on Pakistan. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that talks between senior officials of both countries would continue at a neutral site.</p>

          <p>President Trump's pursuit of personal profits through cryptocurrency ventures, including his meme coin $TRUMP, is jeopardizing bipartisan efforts to pass crypto legislation. Lawmakers rejected the GENIUS Act, a bill meant to establish federal rules for stablecoins, due to concerns about conflicts of interest arising from Trump's involvement in digital assets. Democrats have voiced concerns about the potential for individuals to curry favor with the president by purchasing his cryptocurrencies.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is under pressure to navigate conflicting economic signals, including volatile policy and tariff threats, while facing demands from President Trump for interest rate cuts. Economists suggest that Powell's cautious approach of maintaining current rates may be the most prudent course of action given the uncertainty, but risks being labeled "Too Late" by the president. Recent economic data presents a mixed picture, with surveys indicating heightened concerns in manufacturing and service sectors, while consumer sentiment has declined. The Fed's reluctance to make pre-emptive rate cuts, despite these concerns, reflects the challenges of balancing growth and inflation amidst unpredictable policy decisions.</p>

          <p>Southern California is experiencing a surprise heat wave in May, with record highs recorded in some areas. However, the heat wave is expected to break Saturday evening, with cooler temperatures forecast for Mother's Day. The National Weather Service predicts a return to more typical May conditions early next week, with fog and even drizzle possible. Meteorologists emphasize that this type of extreme heat is unusual for this time of year, as the region typically experiences mild weather in May.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is implementing measures to encourage undocumented immigrants to self-deport, including offering financial incentives and streamlining the departure process. President Trump has ordered the Department of Homeland Security to add 20,000 officers to enforce deportation policies. The administration has also called for local and state law enforcement to assist with border enforcement. These efforts come as some of the administration's other deportation methods have faced legal challenges and been blocked by federal courts.</p>

          <p>Leaders from Britain, France, Germany, and Poland visited Ukraine and announced that Russia would face significant sanctions if President Putin refuses to agree to a 30-day ceasefire. The European effort, coordinated with the White House, calls for a truce to begin on Monday, and is intended to demonstrate a united front against Russian aggression. Ukrainian officials have expressed readiness for a full and unconditional ceasefire, but Russia has so far insisted that military aid to Ukraine from Western nations must first cease.

          <p>The FDA has approved the first at-home tool for cervical cancer screening in the United States, offering a more convenient alternative to the traditional Pap smear. The device, developed by Teal Health, involves a self-collected vaginal sample that is mailed to a lab for HPV testing. Studies have shown that at-home screening is as effective as in-office screening and is preferred by many women. The approval aims to increase screening rates and reduce the number of cervical cancer cases and deaths, particularly among underserved populations.</p>
