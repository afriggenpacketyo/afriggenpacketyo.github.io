          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Investing in Critical Mineral Companies to Reduce Reliance on China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 08:51:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is exploring investments in critical mineral companies to decrease U.S. dependence on imports, particularly from China, according to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. He suggested using a sovereign wealth fund to invest in domestic miners focused on extracting and processing these minerals. This move is in response to China's export controls on rare earth elements, implemented as retaliation for U.S. tariffs. Burgum also proposed a sovereign risk insurance fund to protect companies investing in approved projects from political changes and stockpiling key minerals to counter China's market dumping.

          <p>Despite China's move to potentially lift retaliatory sanctions on EU lawmakers, the European Union asserts it will maintain sanctions on Chinese officials over alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang. The EU cites a lack of observed improvements in the human rights situation in the region as the reason for its continued stance. This tit-for-tat sanctioning began in March 2021, when the EU joined other countries in imposing visa bans and asset freezes on Chinese officials due to concerns over the treatment of Uygurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities. The EU's diplomatic arm spokeswoman stated that the council maintains the China/Xinjiang-related designations, showing the EU's commitment to holding China accountable for human rights issues. </p>

          <p>U.S. applications for unemployment benefits experienced a slight increase last week, signaling that businesses are generally retaining their employees despite concerns about a potential economic downturn. The Labor Department reported that jobless claim applications rose by 6,000 to 222,000 for the week ending April 19, which is slightly above analysts' forecasts. Despite some signs of weakening in the past year, the labor market remains relatively strong, with numerous job openings and comparatively few layoffs.

          <p>A federal judge granted the Justice Department an additional week to provide information regarding the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a deported migrant suspected of MS-13 affiliation. Judge Paula Xinis criticized the administration's lawyers for obstructing the legal process by failing to provide daily status updates and asserting unsubstantiated claims of privilege. Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador, but both a federal district court and the Supreme Court have ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the U.S. for proper deportation proceedings. The case has become a point of contention between Democrats and Republicans, with some lawmakers advocating for his return.</p>

This diplomatic effort is crucial for Ukraine as it seeks international legitimacy amid wavering US support, with Trump having criticized Zelenskyy and paused military aid. For South Africa, the visit is equally important as it faces pressure from the Trump administration, prompting both nations to seek new allies.</p>

          <p>Procter & Gamble reported mixed quarterly results, citing weaker demand and subsequently lowered its outlook for the current quarter. CEO Jon Moeller stated that price increases are "likely" due to tariffs, which are inherently inflationary, and indicated that the company is also exploring sourcing options. The company also cited a consumer slowdown, new tariffs and the company's plans to invest back into its brands during a period of uncertainty as the reasons for its slashed outlook. Uncertainty around tariffs, the political environment and other factors resulted in "a more nervous consumer" pulling back in the last two months of the quarter, CFO Andre Schulten said on the company's call with media.</p>

The development is seen as a direct response to China's growing military capabilities. If Japan develops this type of weapon and deploys it, it will mean that Japan is beginning to pursue an offensive strategy, and the threat posed to other countries and the region will be rather serious.</p>
