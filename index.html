          <p>China Evergrande, the world's most indebted property developer, will be delisted from the Hong Kong stock exchange. The company failed to meet the requirements to resume trading after its shares were suspended in January 2024, following a court-ordered liquidation. This marks a significant moment in China's ongoing property crisis, ending the 16-year public trading history of a company that once symbolized the country's real estate boom. The developer's default in 2021 on over $300 billion in liabilities triggered widespread fears of financial contagion.</p>

          <p>The number of migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats has exceeded 50,000 since the Labour party took office in the UK last summer. Home Office data confirmed the milestone after 474 arrivals on Monday, a figure that has intensified political debate. The government highlighted a new "one in, one out" returns deal with France as a deterrent, while the opposition Conservative Party criticized Labour for what it calls a failure to secure the nation's borders. This development presents a significant challenge to the government's pledge to dismantle people-smuggling operations.</p>

          <p>A US-brokered peace declaration between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which includes plans for a transit corridor named the "Trump Route," has elicited a mixed and cautious response from Iran. While Tehran officially welcomes peace, it is wary of increasing US influence in the South Caucasus, a region of strategic importance. The corridor, connecting Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave through Armenian territory, could diminish Iran's regional influence and create a new trade route to Europe that bypasses it. Iranian officials have issued conflicting statements, reflecting internal debate on how to navigate this significant geopolitical shift.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is projected to strengthen into the season's first hurricane later this week. Originating near the Cabo Verde islands, where it caused deadly flooding, the storm is currently moving west but does not pose an immediate threat to the United States. Early models suggest Erin could intensify into a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean. Forecasters note there is still uncertainty regarding its long-term path, but most projections show it turning northwestward into the open ocean.</p>

          <p>Foreign policy experts are cautioning that President Trump may be walking into a diplomatic trap with his upcoming one-on-one summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska. The meeting, intended to discuss an end to the war in Ukraine, comes as Putin faces military setbacks and economic pressure. Critics, including former officials, fear that Trump's desire for a deal could lead him to accept Putin's maximalist terms, which are unacceptable to Ukraine. This could isolate Kyiv and potentially lead Trump to withdraw support if Ukraine rejects a one-sided agreement brokered by the two leaders.</p>

Betro, disguised in a niqab, attempted to shoot the victim at point-blank range, but her gun jammed, allowing him to escape unharmed. After nearly five years on the run, she was extradited from Armenia and now faces sentencing.</p>

          <p>Shares of Circle Internet Group, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, rose significantly after its first quarterly earnings report as a public company. The firm reported a 53% year-over-year revenue increase to $658.1 million, driven by a 90% growth in USDC circulation. Despite posting a net loss due to IPO-related charges, the strong revenue growth reflects rising institutional interest in stablecoins, bolstered by a more favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration. Circle also announced plans for a new blockchain, Arc, designed for stablecoin payments and capital markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index for July showed a 2.7% annual increase, slightly below economists' forecasts of 2.8%, indicating that inflation remains relatively contained.

The report comes amid close scrutiny of the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs and political pressure on the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

          <p>For retirees who must take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from their retirement accounts but do not need the funds for living expenses, financial advisors suggest several smart strategies. Options include reinvesting the money in a tax-efficient brokerage account, often using exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to minimize annual tax liabilities. Another popular choice is making a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which allows a direct transfer to a nonprofit, satisfying the RMD requirement without increasing taxable income. Additionally, the funds can be used for legacy planning, such as contributing to a 529 college savings plan for grandchildren. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The ongoing excavation of a mass grave in Chemmani, northern Sri Lanka, has unearthed 140 skeletons, including those of children, intensifying calls from the Tamil community for international oversight. The discovery has reopened deep wounds from the country's civil war, which ended in 2009, as many families are still searching for relatives who disappeared. Activists and victims' families express a profound lack of faith in domestic justice mechanisms, citing years of intimidation and slow progress. The UN has acknowledged these concerns, highlighting that Sri Lankans have looked outside the country for credible accountability processes.</p>

          <p>In his first 100 days, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has been defined by surprising policy shifts, a strong focus on foreign affairs, and emerging coalition tensions. After a difficult election to the chancellorship, Merz's government lifted strict debt rules to fund military and infrastructure spending, a reversal of a key campaign promise. He has been highly active on the world stage, visiting Ukraine and the US, while his government has also tightened border controls to curb irregular immigration. A recent crisis over the appointment of a constitutional court judge has exposed the first major cracks in his governing coalition.</p>

          <p>Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel has confirmed that he recently obtained Italian citizenship, providing himself with a potential exit plan from the United States. Speaking on a podcast, Kimmel stated that the political situation under President Trump is "so much worse" than anticipated, prompting him to secure dual citizenship. His action follows other celebrities who have left the U.S. following the 2024 election. Kimmel, a frequent and vocal critic of Trump on his show, explained the move as a reaction to the current political climate, while also emphasizing that the door should remain open for Trump supporters to change their minds.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite labeling China a major threat earlier in the year, President Trump has recently adopted a more lenient trade stance toward Beijing, extending a tariff pause while imposing steeper penalties on allies like India. Analysts suggest several factors are at play, including a desire to avoid a tariff spike during the crucial holiday retail season and to buy time for broader trade negotiations. China's dominance in rare earths and its willingness to endure a trade war give it significant leverage. Trump's focus on other pressing issues, such as the Ukraine conflict and domestic politics, may also contribute to this strategic shift.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent op-ed, former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken advocated for the recognition of a Palestinian state, framing it as a strategic rebuke to Hamas rather than a reward. He argued that while returning hostages and ending the war are immediate priorities, a credible political path toward Palestinian self-determination is essential for long-term stability and for securing support from Arab nations. Blinken proposed that recognition should be conditional, based on a demilitarized state that rejects terrorism and recognizes Israel's right to exist. He suggested a three-year timeline for Palestinians to meet these conditions, overseen by the UN Security Council.</p>

          <p>Beijing has launched an anti-dumping investigation into pea starch imported from Canada, a move seen as the latest retaliation against Canadian tariffs on Chinese steel. China's Ministry of Commerce stated the probe was requested by its domestic industry, which claims a surge in dumped Canadian products has caused financial harm. Canada is a major supplier of peas to China, and the investigation adds to a series of trade disputes between the two nations. China also announced it would begin collecting anti-dumping deposits on Canadian canola oil and a type of industrial rubber, escalating trade tensions.</p>

          <p>A Vox article argues against the prevailing nostalgia for the 1990s, presenting data to show that the present day is superior in several key aspects. It points out that the 1990s had significantly higher rates of violent crime and murder in the U.S. compared to today. Globally, extreme poverty was far more widespread, and the HIV/AIDS pandemic was a much deadlier crisis. The article also highlights increased social tolerance, as seen in the widespread acceptance of same-sex marriage and interracial relationships, and higher educational attainment rates today, challenging the notion of the '90s as "the good old days."</p>

          <p>School records for the gunman in the 2022 Uvalde, Texas, mass shooting, released after a lengthy legal battle, reveal a stark decline from a promising start to a troubled adolescence. Initially described as a "motivated thinker" in kindergarten, Salvador Ramos later faced multiple suspensions for bullying and harassment in middle school and was failing nearly all classes by high school. He withdrew from school seven months before the attack due to poor academic performance and attendance. The documents provide a more detailed timeline of the shooter's downward spiral, which culminated in the murder of 19 children and two teachers.</p>

Nowinski, who co-founded the UNITE Brain Bank, explained the process of procuring brains for posthumous CTE diagnosis and the challenges in linking the disease directly to violent acts. He noted that while the NFL has made some safety changes, the media and lower levels of football have not kept pace, and public discussion of CTE has receded. The brain bank continues to be a critical resource for understanding the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma.</p>

This has led to the termination of numerous research grants and the dismantling of global health initiatives like USAID.

          <p>Despite a temporary tariff truce between the US and China, the ongoing trade dispute is expected to continue altering global shipping patterns for the remainder of the year. Analysts predict that US import volumes from China will see a full-year decline, keeping pressure on transpacific freight rates, which have already fallen for nine consecutive weeks. Shipping giant Maersk reported a 35% year-on-year drop in its China-US container volumes for the second quarter. This decline in North American imports is being offset by strong growth in trade with Europe, Latin America, and other regions as China diversifies its trade partnerships.</p>
