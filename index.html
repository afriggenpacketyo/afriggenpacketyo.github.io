          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed increased optimism about quantum computing, stating that it is reaching an inflection point. During his keynote speech at Nvidia's GTC Paris developer conference, Huang noted that quantum computers are nearing the ability to solve real-world problems in the coming years. He also acknowledged the growing quantum computing community in Europe, highlighting his meeting with French quantum startup Pasqal. Quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) to process large volumes of data, potentially leading to breakthroughs in medicine, science, and finance. The current progress indicates a promising future for quantum computing applications.</p>

          <p>Representative Michael Rulli introduced a bill to establish a Border Enforcement Trust Fund using federal excise taxes on gambling to provide Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) with emergency funding. The proposed legislation would redirect approximately $300 million annually from the U.S. Treasury's general fund. Rulli stated that the fund could assist the Trump administration in addressing situations like the anti-immigration enforcement protests in Los Angeles. The Department of Homeland Security has also requested additional billions for ICE, which Rulli's bill aims to support; however, the bill faces challenges in the Senate, where Democratic support is needed.</p>

          <p>China's military has criticized Japan for testing new long-range anti-ship and hypersonic missiles, claiming it undermines regional security. A commentary in the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army Daily stated that the missiles' extended range violates the pacifist constitution that restricts Japan's Self-Defence Forces from possessing offensive weapons. The missile tests were part of an annual live-fire drill near Mount Fuji. The deployment of upgraded Type 12 surface-to-ship missiles and hypersonic Hyper Velocity Gliding Projectile (HVGP) in Kyushu and possibly Hokkaido is viewed by China as a move towards 'first strike capabilities.'</p>

          <p>iFlytek, a Chinese voice recognition solution provider, admits that using domestically produced semiconductors could extend the development of artificial intelligence (AI) models by three months. Chairman Liu Qingfeng stated that this delay is due to the need for additional computing resources compared to using Nvidia chips. iFlytek has been using domestic chips like Huawei's Ascend 910B to mitigate the risk of losing access to imported chips, as the company is on the U.S. Entity List. Despite the delays, Liu noted that the training efficiency of the Ascend 910B has improved significantly when benchmarked against Nvidia's A800.</p>

Tuchel, who signed an 18-month contract, has had limited time to make significant changes, leading to questions about the team's identity and playing style.

The challenged laws included prohibitions against telehealth prescriptions for abortion medication, a 24-hour waiting period, and mandatory ultrasound options.

          <p>Recent data indicates that while the unemployment rate in the U.S. remains relatively low at 4.2% in May, job seekers are facing extended periods of unemployment. The job-finding rate has declined, and the quits rate is also down, reflecting a "low hiring, low firing" environment. The number of long-term unemployed workers remains high, with many leaving the labor force altogether. The U-6 rate, which includes marginally attached workers and those employed part-time for economic reasons, remains elevated at 7.8%, highlighting broader issues within the labor market. Some industries, like marketing and software development, are experiencing fewer opportunities.</p>

          <p>New guidelines from the Chinese government may allow companies listed in Hong Kong to pursue secondary share listings in Shenzhen, potentially boosting fundraising and encouraging more Hong Kong share offerings. These guidelines would enable mainland companies with Hong Kong-listed shares (H shares) to issue yuan-denominated shares (A shares) on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. This reverses the existing A + H pathway, which allows mainland-listed companies to add dual listings in Hong Kong. The new opportunity could diversify fundraising options for businesses in the Greater Bay Area and attract more businesses to list in Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has halted its loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts across the border to North Korea in an effort to 'restore trust' between the two countries. This decision comes after the election of new President Lee Jae-myung, who campaigned on improving inter-Korean relations. North Korea has historically viewed these broadcasts as an act of war and has threatened to retaliate. The broadcasts, which included news and information about democracy, had been paused for six years but resumed last year in response to North Korea's balloon campaign. Organizations advocating for North Korean human rights have criticized the suspension, while residents along the border have welcomed the move.</p>

          <p>Austria is observing three days of national mourning following a mass shooting at a high school in Graz, where a 21-year-old gunman killed 10 people before committing suicide.

          <p>The Trump administration's budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 aims to consolidate the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act's grant program with 17 other programs and significantly reduce funding.
