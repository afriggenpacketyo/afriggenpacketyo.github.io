          <p>A mass shooting at the Taste of the City Lounge in Brooklyn's Crown Heights neighborhood has left three men dead and nine others wounded. The New York City Police Department is actively searching for up to four gunmen believed to be involved in what they suspect is gang-related violence. Authorities recovered at least 42 shell casings from the scene and are urging any witnesses to provide information, as the city mobilizes a plan to prevent potential retaliatory shootings. This incident marks the city's second deadly mass shooting in less than a month.</p>

          <p>Two of China's largest drug manufacturers, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals and Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group, are projected to report substantial profit increases for the first half of the year. This anticipated growth is primarily driven by the successful introduction of new, innovative drugs and increased revenue generated from technology licensing deals. Analysts predict Hengrui's net profit could surge by as much as 40%, reflecting the company's strategic pivot from generic drugs toward more novel treatments, which is reshaping its revenue structure.

          <p>The Green Party in the United Kingdom is currently in the midst of a leadership contest that highlights a significant strategic divide within the party. Deputy leader Zack Polanski is advocating for a bold, anti-elite "eco-populism" to connect with voter anger, contrasting with the more moderate, broad-appeal approach of current co-leader Adrian Ramsay and MP Ellie Chowns. Following record success in the last general election, the party must decide whether to adopt a more radical stance to potentially replace Labour as the primary party of the left or to continue its proven strategy of intensive local campaigning. The outcome will shape the party's direction ahead of the next election.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a historically low birth rate, a demographic trend that mirrors challenges already faced by countries like Japan. Recent CDC data indicates the total fertility rate in the U.S. is 1.6 children per woman, well below the 2.1 needed for natural population replacement. This decline is largely driven by fewer births among women under 30, including a significant drop in teenage pregnancies, which experts view as a success in family planning. However, the long-term trend raises economic concerns about supporting an aging population, prompting discussions about policies to encourage childbirth, such as financial incentives and improved childcare infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Japan is facing a severe demographic crisis, with its population shrinking for 15 consecutive years and on track to halve by the end of the century. The country's fertility rate has hit an all-time low, and marriage rates are the lowest since 1917, creating significant economic and social challenges, including labor shortages and a strained social security system. The government has implemented initiatives like a city-run dating app and shortened workweeks to encourage family formation, but these have had little impact. Some politicians advocate for revitalizing rural areas to create more family-friendly environments as a potential long-term solution to the crisis.</p>

          <p>Decades after the September 11th attacks, the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner continues its solemn work, successfully identifying more victims using advanced DNA technology. This ongoing effort recently led to the first-time identification of remains belonging to John Niven, a victim from the South Tower, bringing a form of closure to his family after 22 years. Scientists use cryogenic grinders and new chemical processes to extract viable DNA from bone fragments that were severely damaged by fire, fuel, and other elements at Ground Zero. Despite the passage of time, about 40% of the victims remain unidentified, but the medical examiner's office remains committed to its promise to identify as many as possible.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm after briefly reaching Category 5 intensity.

          <p>Air Canada has suspended its plans to resume operations after the union representing its flight attendants announced it would defy a government-ordered mandate to return to work. The Canada Industrial Relations Board (CIRB) had ordered an end to the strike, but the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) declared its members would not comply, calling the order unconstitutional. The union is demanding that flight attendants be paid for time spent on the ground between flights, a key sticking point in negotiations. The continued strike has resulted in the suspension of approximately 700 daily flights, affecting over 100,000 passengers.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police are investigating allegations of drug-related offenses connected to the popular BBC show 'Strictly Come Dancing.' The investigation follows a report in The Sun newspaper alleging drug use by two unnamed stars associated with the program, which was said to be widely discussed among the cast and crew. The BBC had already launched its own internal probe, hiring a law firm to assist, before referring the matter to the police. While the long-running show has faced controversies before, this marks the first time police have been involved in allegations linked to it.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite statewide tourism numbers remaining steady, local businesses in some Florida beach cities are reporting a significant downturn, with some calling their towns "ghost towns" this summer. The slump is attributed to changing travel patterns and squeezed consumer budgets, as persistent inflation and economic uncertainty lead Americans to spend less on travel. While overall visitor arrivals may be stable, reduced spending on items like lodging, airfare, and local attractions is impacting the bottom line for many businesses. For savvy travelers, this downturn could present an opportunity for discounts and deals in traditionally popular destinations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams are facing mounting uncertainty regarding the health of quarterback Matthew Stafford, whose persistent back issue has prevented him from participating in any team practices during training camp. Initially downplayed by Coach Sean McVay, the situation has become more concerning as the season opener approaches, with the team providing few updates on his condition. In Stafford's absence, backup quarterbacks Jimmy Garoppolo and Stetson Bennett have been taking first-team snaps. The 37-year-old quarterback's availability is crucial for the team's Super Bowl aspirations, and his prolonged absence casts doubt on their prospects for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Texas Democratic lawmakers who left the state to block a Republican-led redistricting plan are now starting to return, signaling a potential end to their weeks-long standoff. The legislators fled to deny the GOP a quorum in the state House, successfully derailing an initial special session called by Governor Greg Abbott. With a new special session underway, Democrats are returning on their own timelines, which could provide Republicans with the numbers needed to pass the controversial maps. The move follows a counter-effort by California Democrats to redraw their own maps in response to the Texas GOP's push.</p>

Despite initial challenges with bureaucracy and integrating into a close-knit local culture, they have embraced the new environment, noting benefits like a lower cost of living and excellent public healthcare. The move was facilitated by the shift to remote work, allowing them to pursue a long-held dream of living abroad.</p>
