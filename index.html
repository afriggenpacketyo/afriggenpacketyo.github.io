          <p>Heavy rainfall in Mokwa, Nigeria, has caused severe flooding, resulting in at least 151 deaths and displacing over 3,000 people.

President Bola Tinubu has directed the activation of the national emergency response center to provide assistance. Residents are mourning their losses and awaiting news of missing loved ones while assessing the extensive damage to the town, a major trading hub.

          <p>Consumers are taking a more cautious approach to summer vacations due to trade tensions and recession fears, leading to reduced spending plans, according to a Deloitte report. While more people plan to travel compared to last year, they are cutting back on in-destination spending, opting for cheaper lodging, and choosing to drive instead of fly. Travel costs have generally decreased, with lower hotel rates, rental car costs, and airfares, yet inflation is impacting overall spending. Flexibility in travel dates, destinations, and transportation can further help travelers save money this summer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jewish organizers are increasingly confronting President Trump's administration, criticizing the exploitation of antisemitism to justify repressive policies. They argue that these policies, including funding cuts to universities and the detention of pro-Palestinian students, do not represent Jewish values. Jewish students, faculty, and alumni are leading protests, writing letters, and denouncing what they see as the exclusion of Jewish perspectives critical of Israel from the national conversation. They invoke their Jewishness to challenge the administration's actions and defend the principles of free speech and academic freedom.</p>

          <p>Denmark's decision to raise its retirement age to 70 has sparked discussion about whether the U.S. might follow suit, though experts say such a move could be problematic.

Experts also note that phasing in a higher retirement age would take time to produce savings, while the Social Security Administration faces immediate funding needs.

          <p>This Atlantic article argues that President Donald Trump and the MAGA movement represent a departure from traditional constitutional conservatism. The author contends that Trump's administration exhibits a disdain for laws, procedures, and the Constitution, seeking to empower the federal government for personal and political gain. The piece criticizes Trump's actions, such as granting clemency to January 6th rioters and using the government to target political opponents, as evidence of a shift towards authoritarianism. The author expresses concern that the Republican Party, once a champion of limited government and individual liberty, has been transformed into a vehicle for abuse of power and vengeance.</p>
