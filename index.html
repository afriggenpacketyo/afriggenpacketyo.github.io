          <p>China's Foreign Affairs Ministry has strongly condemned a new proposal by Mexico to increase tariffs by up to 50 percent on certain imports, a move Beijing views as targeting its products. The Mexican government, led by President Claudia Sheinbaum, argues the tariffs are essential to protect local jobs in key sectors like automobiles and steel, affecting about $52 billion in imports. This action comes amid increasing pressure from the United States for its allies to adopt a more confrontational trade stance towards China, highlighting growing global economic tensions.</p>

          <p>Nadine Menendez, wife of convicted former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, has been sentenced to 54 months in federal prison for her role in a bribery scheme that involved accepting cash, gold bars, and a luxury car. During the sentencing, she tearfully blamed her husband, describing him as a manipulative figure who put her in an illegal position, though she accepted accountability for her actions. The judge acknowledged her health issues and difficult past but emphasized the need for deterrence, calling her a central participant in the corruption scandal.</p>

          <p>Following the downing of Russian drones in Polish airspace, a wave of disinformation and fake content has spread online, which Polish officials label as Russian propaganda aimed at destabilizing the nation. Pro-Kremlin media outlets are falsely claiming a lack of evidence for the incursion, while some viral videos purporting to show the attack have been debunked as footage from the video game "Arma 3." This article examines and verifies several claims, highlighting the ongoing information war that accompanies military provocations and the challenge of discerning fact from fiction.</p>

          <p>A detailed report explores the complex parallel economies operating within the global prison system, where governments, private corporations, and organized crime all profit from incarceration. While nations spend billions on a growing prison population, private firms earn revenue from outsourced services like food and telecommunications, often at highly inflated prices. Inside, gangs run lucrative contraband empires, and inmates engage in an underground market where items like ramen noodles become currency, all while earning pennies per hour for institutional labor.</p>

          <p>Several NATO members, including the Netherlands and the Czech Republic, are deploying additional troops and air defense systems to Poland in response to an "unprecedented" incursion by Russian drones. The incident, which saw multiple drones shot down over Polish territory, has prompted Warsaw to request a UN Security Council meeting and is being viewed by European leaders as a deliberate provocation. This military reinforcement underscores the heightened state of alert along NATO's eastern flank as Russia and Belarus begin their Zapad 2025 military exercises.</p>

          <p>U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has dismissed Peter Mandelson, the British ambassador to the United States, following the release of new documents detailing his close relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The documents included a letter in which Mandelson referred to Epstein as his "best pal" and suggested his first conviction was wrongful. The Foreign Office stated this new information revealed a relationship "materially different" from what was known at the time of his appointment, leading to his immediate withdrawal from the diplomatic post.</p>

          <p>A French parliamentary commission has recommended a ban on social media access for children under 15 and a "digital curfew" for those aged 15 to 18, following an inquiry into the effects of platforms like TikTok. The report described the video-sharing app as a "production line of distress," accusing it of knowingly exposing young users to harmful and addictive content. These proposals, which also include a ban on mobile phones in schools, reflect a growing movement in Europe to impose stricter regulations to protect minors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The English Football Association has charged Chelsea FC with 74 rule breaches related to payments made to agents between 2009 and 2022, during the ownership of Roman Abramovich. The investigation, which focuses on deals involving players like Eden Hazard and Willian, was initiated after the club's new ownership group self-reported potentially incomplete financial records. While sanctions could include fines or a transfer ban, the club's cooperation is expected to be a mitigating factor as the Premier League's separate investigation continues.</p>
