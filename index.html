        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>BBC News understands that "MasterChef" presenter Gregg Wallace has been fired following an inquiry into alleged misconduct. The dismissal comes as 50 more individuals have brought forward new claims, including accusations of groping and indecent exposure, which Wallace denies. An independent report commissioned by the show's production company is expected soon, though Wallace claims it has cleared him of the most serious allegations while admitting to inappropriate language. The new claims, spanning various shows and settings, have intensified scrutiny of the BBC's safeguarding practices and duty of care.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's state pension triple lock policy is projected to cost £15.5 billion annually by 2030, three times the original estimate, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). This policy ensures the state pension rises each year in line with the highest of inflation, wage growth, or 2.5%. The OBR's report highlights the UK's "vulnerable" public finances, exacerbated by recent government U-turns on spending cuts and rising debt. The rising cost is attributed to inflation volatility and an increasing number of pensioners, placing long-term pressure on public spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The killing of Bruno, a 7-year-old police bloodhound credited with finding nine people during his career, has caused widespread outrage in Italy and prompted a criminal investigation. The dog was found dead after being fed food laced with nails, an act his trainer, Arcangelo Caressa, believes was a targeted attack against him for his work rescuing dogs from illegal fights. Premier Giorgia Meloni condemned the killing as "vile," and lawmakers have filed a complaint under a new, stricter animal cruelty law. The incident has highlighted the dog's heroic service and sparked calls for severe punishment for the perpetrators.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Texas, which have killed at least 109 people, were caused by a confluence of factors, including the region's natural geography and a powerful weather system fueled by moisture from a former tropical storm.

Officials are facing scrutiny over the timing and effectiveness of emergency warnings, as search efforts continue for dozens of missing people amid the widespread devastation.</p>

The proposed bill would allow the government, with parliamentary approval, to draft conscripts if a defense situation requires a rapid increase in armed forces personnel. This model is seen as a compromise, stopping short of the full compulsory service suspended in 2011 but creating a framework for emergencies. The plan also aims to make voluntary service more attractive with significantly higher pay to boost the number of active soldiers and reservists.</p>

However, meteorological experts have unequivocally debunked these claims, stating it is physically impossible for the weather modification technique to create a storm of such magnitude. Scientists explain that cloud seeding can only slightly enhance rainfall in existing clouds, not generate massive weather systems or the trillions of gallons of water seen in the floods.

          <p>A recent Supreme Court decision limiting the power of lower courts to issue universal injunctions has advanced President Trump's goal of ending birthright citizenship. While the policy itself, which seeks to deny automatic citizenship to children of noncitizens born in the U.S., remains legally contested, the ruling could allow it to take effect temporarily in some jurisdictions. The high court barred Trump's executive order from activation for 30 days, prompting legal challenges to be refiled as class-action lawsuits. The underlying constitutional debate over the 14th Amendment is expected to eventually return to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>An Australian jury has convicted Erin Patterson on three counts of murder and one of attempted murder for intentionally poisoning her family members with a meal containing toxic death cap mushrooms. The 2023 incident resulted in the deaths of three relatives after they consumed a home-cooked lunch she prepared. Prosecutors argued she knowingly served the poisonous fungi, while Patterson's defense claimed it was an accidental mix-up with foraged mushrooms, a story the jury did not find credible. Death cap mushrooms contain a potent toxin that causes catastrophic liver failure and is not destroyed by cooking.</p>

          <p>A year after his Conservative Party's significant election defeat, former U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser. Sunak, who previously worked at the investment bank in the early 2000s before entering politics, will advise the firm's global clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. His appointment was delayed by a government watchdog for one year after he left his ministerial role due to potential conflicts of interest. Sunak, who remains a Member of Parliament, will donate his pay from the new role to his numeracy-focused charity.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has issued a security alert after an "unknown actor" used artificial intelligence to impersonate Secretary of State Marco Rubio. According to a department-wide cable, the impersonator created a Signal account and contacted at least five high-level individuals, including foreign ministers and a member of Congress. The actor used the account to leave AI-generated voicemails and send text messages in an attempt to engage with the targets. The State Department has confirmed it is aware of the incident and is conducting an investigation into the sophisticated impersonation attempt.</p>

          <p>India's suspension of the 64-year-old Indus Waters Treaty has plunged Pakistan's already precarious water situation into deeper uncertainty. The treaty, which governs the sharing of the Indus River network, has survived previous wars, but India put it on hold following a militant attack in Kashmir. Pakistan, an arid country heavily dependent on the Indus for agriculture and power, accuses India of "weaponizing water" and has warned that any attempt to divert water would be considered an act of war. The standoff over the crucial water-sharing agreement has become a new flashpoint, threatening regional stability.</p>

          <p>A firearms officer, PC Zachary Marsden, has testified in court that his actions were "professional" during an incident at Manchester Airport that led to a violent altercation. Two brothers, Mohammed Amaaz and Muhammad Amaad, are on trial for allegedly assaulting three officers who were attempting to arrest Mr. Amaaz for headbutting another person. The defense counsel argued that the officer used unlawful and disproportionate force, prompting the brothers to act in self-defense.

Rollins stated the administration's goal is a 100% American workforce, suggesting that automation and shifting people from government aid programs could fill labor gaps.

          <p>In a significant policy shift, the IRS has indicated in a federal court filing that churches and other houses of worship can endorse political candidates without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. This move effectively reverses a 70-year-old interpretation of the Johnson Amendment, which has barred such political activity by non-profits. The filing was part of a proposed settlement in a lawsuit brought by religious groups who argued the rule violated their First Amendment rights. The change aligns with a long-standing goal of President Donald Trump to repeal the amendment.</p>

          <p>A monthly survey from the New York Federal Reserve indicates that consumer fears of a sharp inflation spike due to tariffs have subsided. In June, respondents' expectation for inflation one year from now fell to 3%, the same level as in January before the Trump administration's major tariff announcements. This marks a retreat from a peak of 3.6% reached in March and April, suggesting that a more conciliatory U.S. approach to trade negotiations has eased public concern. While the overall inflation outlook softened, expectations for price increases in specific areas like medical care and rent remain high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the New York City mayoral primary victory of Zohran Mamdani, an advocate for Palestinian rights, as a lesson in coalition-building for the political left. His success was partly due to a cross-endorsement with Brad Lander, a self-described "progressive Zionist," an alliance that defied ideological purity tests. Instead of hiding their differences on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, they focused on shared local goals, persuading their respective bases to support each other. This strategy suggests a path forward for Democrats to build broader coalitions by prioritizing common ground.</p>

While the government is pushing for a "one in, one out" returns deal, where the UK would return a migrant for every asylum seeker it accepts with family ties, it remains a complex negotiation.
