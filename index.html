          <p>The article reports that over 52,000 Palestinians have died in Gaza as Israel continues its offensive following the end of a ceasefire with Hamas. The offensive, initiated in March, includes daily strikes and a tightened blockade, leading to severe shortages of food and medicine for the territory's 2 million residents. Hamas has stated it will only release remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire, and a full Israeli withdrawal. Additionally, Israeli jets struck Beirut's southern suburbs, targeting Hezbollah facilities, prompting condemnation from the Lebanese presidency. Optimism score: 10</p>

          <p>Former National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan expressed cautious optimism following the meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. Sullivan said the meeting gave him "the first sliver of hope" he has had in a while as it relates to the current administration's approach to the war in Ukraine. He has been critical of Trump's approach, saying it gave Putin U.S. recognition of Crimea and the president has given Putin a promise that Ukraine will not be part of NATO. Sullivan hopes Trump is recognizing that Putin is not leading him to a ceasefire. Optimism score: 40</p>
