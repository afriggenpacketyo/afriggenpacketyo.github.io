          <p>The Scottish Parliament is set to vote on a bill that would legalize assisted dying for terminally ill adults. This marks the third time the parliament has considered such legislation. The bill proposes that individuals with a terminal illness, deemed mentally fit by two doctors, could request medical assistance to end their lives. The vote is a free vote, meaning members are not instructed by their parties. If passed, the bill will proceed to further stages for amendments and final approval, however if the bill is not backed it will fall completely.</p>

          <p>German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has banned the far-right group "Kingdom of Germany," accusing it of attempting to establish a "counter-state" within the country. Police conducted raids across seven German states, resulting in multiple arrests, including the group's self-declared monarch, Peter Fitzek. The group, which reportedly has around 6,000 members, denies the legitimacy of Germany's post-World War II Federal Republic and has been known to print its own passports and driver's licenses.

          <p>Honda Motor Co. reported a substantial 76% decline in operating profit for the fourth quarter, falling short of earnings estimates due to the impact of U.S. tariffs.

In response, Honda plans to implement recovery measures and explore growth opportunities, while also shifting its dividend policy to focus on dividend on equity.</p>

The fires are being treated as suspicious, and police are investigating whether they are linked, as there was damage to the entrance of Mr. Starmerâ€™s family home, which is rented out to tenants. The police are also looking into a car fire on May 8 in the same street and a small fire on Sunday at the front door of a house converted into apartments in Islington, north London, at a property that is also linked to Mr. Starmer.</p>

          <p>The article explores the potential for public transport to replace cars in urban areas, focusing on efforts to reduce traffic congestion, air pollution, and carbon emissions. Cities like Jakarta and Tallinn are implementing strategies such as free public transport and bus rapid transit systems to encourage citizens to switch from cars. However, psychological factors such as status, comfort, and safety play a significant role in people's travel choices. To incentivize the use of public transport, cities need to improve the quality, reliability, and convenience of buses and trains, while also disincentivizing car ownership through levies and redesigning urban infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A 21-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life, following fires at properties linked to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Counter-terrorism police are leading the probe and are treating the fires as suspicious, investigating whether they are linked. The first fire under investigation happened on Thursday, when firefighters were called to a small car fire on the same street as the prime minister's home. The third took place at the Kentish Town property. There was damage to the property's entrance but nobody was hurt.</p>

          <p>Addiction experts are warning that proposed cuts to addiction funding by Congress will lead to more overdose deaths. A letter signed by over 300 physicians, harm reduction workers, and researchers was delivered to Congress, highlighting the "dire consequences" of these cuts. The letter points to the White House budget for 2026, which proposes slashing billions of dollars from key agencies. Experts are concerned that addiction recovery programs in rural areas and poor urban neighborhoods could be particularly hard hit, reversing the progress made in reducing overdose deaths in 2024.</p>

The mid-term election results were not favorable for Marcos, potentially weakening his administration. The Marcos-Duterte relationship has deteriorated, with impeachment proceedings against Duterte and criminal charges filed against her. The election results cast doubt on the plan to incapacitate Sara Duterte by impeaching her, with impeachment requiring two thirds of the 24-seat senate to vote for it.</p>
