          <p>Alphabet, Google's parent company, is contributing $22 million towards the construction of a new White House ballroom as part of a legal settlement with Donald Trump over his ban from YouTube. This contribution covers nearly ten percent of the project's estimated $250 million cost, which Trump insists will be privately funded by donors and not taxpayers. The project has sparked public controversy and questions about its funding sources, particularly after demolition began on parts of the historic East Wing to make way for the new structure.</p>

          <p>Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley delivered a marathon speech on the Senate floor, speaking for over 21 hours to protest the policies of the Trump administration. He specifically criticized the administration's deportation efforts, the use of the National Guard in American cities like Portland, and what he termed the 'weaponization' of the Justice Department. Merkley described the moment as the 'biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War,' using the extended speech to draw attention to actions he believes are undermining the Constitution.</p>

          <p>The National Hockey League has announced a first-of-its-kind, multi-year licensing deal with prediction markets Kalshi and Polymarket, giving them access to official league data and logos. This move signals a deeper integration of sports leagues with event-trading platforms, which are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The deal has drawn criticism from groups like the American Gaming Association, who argue these platforms amount to unregulated gambling, while the NHL views it as an opportunity to engage a new audience.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News poll reveals that California voters' positions on Proposition 50, a state redistricting measure, are heavily influenced by national politics. Support for the proposition is largely driven by a desire to oppose the Trump administration, which a majority of Californians feel treats their state unfairly. Conversely, those who view the measure as a state-level issue tend to oppose it, fearing it will shift power from rural areas to cities. This dynamic has pushed the 'yes' vote into the lead within the heavily Democratic state.</p>

          <p>According to a master jeweler, the thieves who stole approximately $102 million worth of jewels from the Louvre will find it extremely difficult to sell their loot. If the historic pieces are dismantled, their value could plummet by as much as 90%, as the individual stones and metals are worth far less. The expert noted that the global market for fine jewelry is a small, interconnected network, and dealers worldwide are now aware of the stolen items, whose unique characteristics act like DNA, making them easily identifiable.</p>

This series of lethal strikes has raised the total death toll to at least 34 and has drawn criticism from some lawmakers who question the legal and constitutional basis for the military actions.</p>

          <h2>Liberal Democrat Leader Calls for Prince Andrew to Face MPs Over Royal Lodge Lease</h2>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has called for Prince Andrew to be questioned by a parliamentary committee regarding his lease of Royal Lodge from the Crown Estate. The demand for scrutiny follows reports that the 75-year lease agreement allows the prince to pay only a token annual rent in exchange for large upfront payments, an arrangement that has been criticized as a 'rotten deal' for taxpayers. This adds to the pressure on Prince Andrew, who has already stepped back from royal duties over his links to Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

          <p>The director of the Louvre, Laurence des Cars, has publicly admitted to significant security failures that allowed thieves to steal €88 million worth of French crown jewels. Speaking to French senators, she revealed that the museum's perimeter CCTV was 'aging' and that the only camera monitoring the thieves' entry point was facing the wrong direction. Des Cars stated, 'We failed these jewels,' and acknowledged that she had previously warned about obsolete equipment and staff cuts, taking full responsibility for the 'terrible failure' at the museum.</p>

          <p>The Republican-led legislature in North Carolina has passed a new congressional map that redraws a key Democratic-held district to make it significantly more favorable to the GOP. This move is part of a national Republican strategy to use redistricting to bolster their chances of maintaining control of the U.S. House in the upcoming midterm elections. Because the state's Democratic governor lacks the power to veto a standalone map, the new boundaries are expected to be implemented unless blocked by legal challenges from voting rights advocates.</p>

          <p>After two consecutive quarters of year-over-year revenue declines, Tesla is expected to report a return to growth in its third-quarter earnings, with analysts forecasting a 4.7% increase. This outlook comes despite challenges such as the expiration of federal EV tax credits, which pulled some sales forward, and a sales slump in Europe. Investors will be closely watching for CEO Elon Musk's commentary on the progress of the company's Robotaxi service, the rollout of lower-cost models, and the adoption of its driver assistance systems in key overseas markets.

          <p>This article analyzes how Russia has adopted and repurposed American 'soft power' tactics, historically used by agencies like USAID to promote democracy, to instead advance its own authoritarian agenda. The Kremlin now operates its own foundations and state-funded NGOs to promote Russian culture, sanitize its global image, and foster pro-Russian sentiment in other countries, particularly in occupied Ukrainian territories. This strategy represents a deliberate effort to mimic and subvert the very tools Washington once used to counter Moscow's influence during the Cold War.</p>

The claim is for compensation related to the federal investigations into his role in the January 6 insurrection and his handling of classified documents. The decision to approve this taxpayer-funded payment rests with his own DOJ leadership, including his former criminal defense lawyer, creating what ethics experts describe as a fundamental and blatant conflict of interest that amounts to presidential extortion.</p>

For example, some medications were associated with an average weight gain of four pounds, while others were linked to an average loss of five and a half pounds. The findings underscore the importance of tailoring antidepressant treatment to individual patient health profiles and preferences.</p>
