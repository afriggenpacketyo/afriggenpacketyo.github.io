        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron's stock experienced a drop following the announcement of a more than 30% decline in net income, which fell to $3.5 billion, or $2 per share, from $5.5 billion, or $2.97 per share, in the same period last year. The decline is attributed to a steep decrease in oil prices, with U.S. crude oil prices falling approximately 18% this year. Capital expenditures also saw a reduction of about 5%, totaling $3.9 billion, down from $4.1 billion the previous year, but the company returned $6.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

          <p>Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) has imposed a fine of 530 million euros ($601.3 million) on TikTok for violating the EU's GDPR data protection law. The fine is a result of TikTok's transferring of European user data to China without ensuring an equivalent level of protection as guaranteed within the EU. The DPC has ordered TikTok to rectify its data processing practices within six months and cautioned that transfers to China would be suspended if compliance is not achieved within the stipulated timeframe. The regulator also found that TikTok had provided inaccurate information during the inquiry regarding the storage of European users' data on servers in China.</p>

          <p>According to the article, United Nations officials report a surge in civilian deaths and injuries in Ukraine since cease-fire talks began in February, with Russian strikes intensifying on cities. The first months of this year have been deadlier than the same period last year, with the rate of civilian deaths rising further in April, as Russia opened new offensives and targeted civilian areas. While cease-fire talks are underway, both sides are jockeying for military advantage, contributing to increased casualties, and the attacks have displaced approximately 40,000 Ukrainians from their homes, adding to the already significant number of displaced persons within the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Scottish government has decided to postpone the planned legislation to criminalize misogyny until after next year's Holyrood election, citing insufficient time to draft a law that aligns with a recent Supreme Court judgement on the definition of a woman. Instead, the government intends to amend existing hate crime legislation to include protections based on sex. Additionally, legislation to end conversion therapy will not be pursued this term, with the government hoping for a UK-wide solution to the issue.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is implementing policies aligned with Project 2025, a conservative manifesto aimed at consolidating power in the executive branch and dismantling government programs. The actions, which include personnel changes, budget cuts, and policy reversals, are reminiscent of ideas laid out in the project, with key figures from the project now holding prominent positions in the administration. The administration has taken action to end diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, deport undocumented immigrants, and restrict border crossings.</p>

          <p>A research study on Alzheimer's disease, led by Dr. Charles DeCarli at UC Davis, was initially terminated due to the Trump administration's decision to cut funding for scientific research.
