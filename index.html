          <h2>Trump Expresses Disinterest in Speaking with Musk After Recent Criticism</h2>

          <p>President Trump, in a phone interview, downplayed his recent exchange with Elon Musk, stating he was "not particularly" interested in speaking with him. This follows Musk's criticism of Trump's policies. Trump indicated that while Musk desires to converse, he is currently unwilling to engage. The remarks suggest a cooling of relations between the two figures after Musk's public disapproval of Trump's proposed tax bill, indicating a possible rift in their previously amicable relationship. Optimism remains low as the fallout continues to unfold.</p>

          <p>Federal judges have recently issued several rulings against the Trump administration, blocking actions such as the deportation of a Boulder attack suspect's family and halting moves to close Job Corps centers. These rulings come after White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt criticized the judicial branch for allegedly abusing its power to block President Trump's executive authority. Cases included blocking the deportation of a suspect's family, unsealing records in a migrant case, and halting funding cuts to local governments and AmeriCorps. The rulings highlight ongoing tensions between the judiciary and the executive branch.</p>

          <p>Despite conciliatory words exchanged between Presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump in a phone call signaling a potential thaw in China-U.S. tensions, Chinese manufacturers remain cautious. Exhausted by policy shifts and disillusioned by Trump's volatility, many are delaying major decisions until clearer signals emerge. The leaders discussed trade relations, rare earth exports, and overseas students, but manufacturers are hesitant to make long-term decisions based on Trump's words alone.

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's order curtailing foreign students at Harvard. The same judge also extended her block on another attempt by the administration to stop the university from issuing student visas. Harvard argued that the administration failed to back up claims that the students posed a threat to national security. The ruling provides relief for international students and challenges the administration's policies.</p>

          <p>China sought to portray a call between Xi Jinping and President Trump as an appeal from one strongman leader to another to run a tight ship and stay on course. Xiâ€™s message to Trump was to rein in the hawks trying to derail the truce. The article suggests that China is attempting to stabilize relations by appealing directly to Trump's leadership.</p>
