          <p>This Fox News opinion piece argues that media coverage of NPR's lawsuit against Donald Trump over defunding attempts is biased, failing to acknowledge NPR's alleged lack of objectivity. The author claims NPR's lawyers arrogantly argue that the First Amendment requires conservatives to fund speech they oppose. The piece cites instances of perceived liberal bias in NPR's reporting, such as interviews with Harvard's president and celebrations of NPR's "founding mothers." The author asserts that NPR's claim of being nonpartisan is false, highlighting a report that found a vast majority of NPR news employees registered as Democrats. The article is biased and does not accurately represent the views of NPR. Optimism score is not applicable to this article. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Employees at the U.S. Department of Energy are raising alarms about budget cuts and deregulations, warning that these measures will undermine the department's ability to function effectively and lead to increased energy costs for consumers. They report that Trump's policies, including the repeal of energy tax credits, could raise household energy costs by as much as 7% by 2035. The cuts have also led to a mass exodus of experienced employees, creating a drain on resources and expertise within the agency. A former senior official predicts these actions will increase prices for consumers and make the U.S. less competitive internationally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Georgia's $900 billion economy is being affected in diverse ways by Donald Trump's tariffs, with some industries facing crises while others see potential for profit. Wine distributors are struggling with shipping delays and uncertainty, while the film industry faces confusion over proposed tariffs on foreign-produced films. The state's ports are experiencing strong volumes but anticipate a decrease, and some manufacturers believe they are insulated from international competition. The unpredictability is causing volatility, which is damaging to businesses that rely on stable markets and prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A rare gold lobster, named Calvin, was rescued from being cooked at a restaurant in Charlestown, Rhode Island, after a cook recognized its unique genetic mutation. This mutation, occurring in approximately one in 30 million lobsters, results in a yellowish-orange shell. The restaurant donated Calvin to the Biomes Marine Biology Center in North Kingstown, where it is now on display. The center's director noted that such lobsters are often mistaken for more common orange ones, and would turn red if cooked like typical lobsters, however Calvin was saved from such a fate and now has the opportunity to impress visitors.</p>

De Ligt, being Dutch, appreciates the straightforwardness, viewing it as a positive trait given the Dutch reputation for blunt speaking, which he believes fosters a beneficial environment for the team. </p>

          <p>England fast bowler Jamie Overton will miss the remainder of the one-day international series against the West Indies after fracturing his little finger. The injury occurred while Overton was attempting to take a return catch during the first match at Edgbaston. Although he initially left the field for treatment, he returned to bowl and managed to take three wickets before the severity of the injury was fully assessed. Overton is expected to be sidelined for approximately a month, which also means he will miss the subsequent T20 series against the West Indies; Matthew Potts has replaced Overton in the England XI.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio is accused of making false statements regarding the impact of the Trump administration's dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Rubio claimed that the cuts had not resulted in any deaths, a statement challenged by reports of individuals who died due to the shutdown of American humanitarian aid. The author shares the story of Evan Anzoo, a 5-year-old boy with H.I.V. in South Sudan, whose life was sustained by American aid through PEPFAR. The author argues that cutting such aid has dire consequences and refutes Rubio's claims. </p>

          <p>The National Weather Service is entering the Atlantic hurricane season with significant staffing gaps, raising concerns among meteorologists about the agency's ability to provide accurate and timely forecasts. The shortages stem from President Trump's initiative to reduce government spending, which has led to the departure of approximately 550 Weather Service employees. This has resulted in limited hours at regional forecast offices and widespread vacancies in key roles, potentially hindering the agency's ability to effectively respond to severe weather events. Former Weather Service directors have warned of potentially catastrophic consequences and "needless loss of life" if resources are not replenished. </p>

Vanasse argues that while physical fitness is important for combat arms, lethality extends beyond physical capabilities to include tactical skills, decision-making, and leadership. She responds to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's claim that women don't belong in combat by highlighting the accomplishments of women who have served and asserting that standards were never lowered for them. </p>

          <p>Jewish students, faculty, and alumni are increasingly challenging the Trump administration's use of antisemitism allegations to justify repressive policies on college campuses. They argue that these policies do not represent their Jewish values and that they are being excluded from the national conversation about antisemitism. These Jewish organizers are protesting the war in Gaza, defending detained students, and condemning the exploitation of antisemitism for political gain. They invoke their Jewishness to emphasize their opposition to the repressive measures and to reclaim their identity from those who use it to justify authoritarianism. </p>

          <p>Denmark is raising its retirement age to 70, prompting experts to consider whether the U.S. may follow suit. While some propose raising the U.S. retirement age to reflect current life expectancies, retirement experts say this may not be a viable solution due to income inequality. Denmark's move "sends a signal" to work longer, and the U.S. government is looking for ways to cut costs to help resolve the issue, raising the retirement age could be on the menu.

The author contends that Trump and his supporters disregard laws, procedures, and the Constitution, and seek to empower the federal government to reward allies and punish opponents. The author asserts that Trump's administration is a thugocracy, and the Republican Party has abandoned its former principles in favor of abusing power and seeking vengeance.

The survey, conducted by Project Recovery, found that half of the homeowners are unwilling to wait more than three years to rebuild. The top concern of displaced homeowners was about the lack of leadership to get it done, rather than affordability, although many homeowners are indeed worried that they wonâ€™t have enough money to rebuild the way they want. The report outlines a plan to get homes rebuilt within three years, but it requires close cooperation between builders and public officials. </p>

They warn that these regulations could increase costs and allow producers to unilaterally determine which products are subject to the law.
