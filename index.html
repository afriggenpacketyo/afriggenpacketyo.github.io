          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service has recalled over 90,000 pounds of frozen breakfast burritos and wraps due to potential listeria contamination. These products, manufactured by M.C.I. Foods, were distributed to students nationwide through federally-funded school meal programs. While there are no confirmed reports of illness, the recall was initiated after routine testing by the manufacturer detected listeria in egg ingredients from an external supplier. Health officials urge institutions to discard the affected products, as listeria infection can cause serious illness, particularly in vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip market is being challenged by its largest customers, including Amazon, Google, Meta, and OpenAI, who are increasingly designing their own custom chips. These tech giants are developing in-house silicon to reduce costs, optimize performance for their specific software, and decrease reliance on a single supplier. While Nvidia currently holds the majority of the market, analysts predict that custom chips from these companies could account for a significant share by 2028. This trend presents a long-term competitive threat that could impact Nvidia's substantial profit margins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a statement on social media, former President Donald Trump announced he would stop all U.S. financial aid and subsidies to Colombia, accusing the country's president, Gustavo Petro, of failing to curb cocaine production. Trump referred to Petro as a "drug leader" and claimed that U.S. payments intended to combat drug trafficking were a "rip-off." He warned that if Colombia did not shut down its "killing fields," the United States would intervene directly. The remarks escalate recent tensions, which have included the revocation of Petro's U.S. visa.</p>

The 20-year-old landed five quadruple jumps in his free skate, solidifying his status as a top contender in men's figure skating. His victory extends an unbeaten streak that has lasted nearly two years, achieved even without attempting his signature quadruple axel. The event in Angers, France, is the first of six in the Grand Prix series leading up to the Final in December.</p>

          <p>A meticulously planned robbery took place at the Louvre Museum in Paris, where thieves stole priceless crown jewels in a matter of minutes shortly after the museum opened. The masked perpetrators reportedly used a mechanical ladder to access a first-floor balcony and cut through glass to enter the Galerie d'Apollon. They calmly smashed display cases before escaping on scooters, prompting a full evacuation and closure of the world's most visited museum. French officials have described the stolen items as having "incalculable" value and noted the professional nature of the crime.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson stood by his comments labeling nationwide "No Kings" protests against former President Donald Trump as "hate America" rallies. In a television interview, Johnson clarified that his criticism was aimed at the "hateful messages" of the protesters rather than the Democratic Party as a whole, citing what he described as violent rhetoric. He also defended his decision not to immediately swear in a newly elected Democratic representative, citing precedent set by former Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The Speaker argued the protests' branding was ironic, stating that Trump's actions do not resemble those of a king.</p>

This development follows Prince Andrew's recent decision to relinquish his titles amid ongoing scrutiny of his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

          <p>A commentary by Charles M. Blow addresses the severe crisis facing local news in the United States, with over 3,200 print newspapers having closed since 2005. The article notes that newsroom employment has plummeted by 60% since 2000, creating "news deserts" across the country. This decline affects not only accountability journalism but also the community-building "small j" journalism of local events and announcements. The loss of these outlets is linked to increased political polarization, as local news often serves as a unifying force by reminding residents of their shared community interests.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the United States of "murder" and violating his country's sovereignty following a U.S. military strike on a boat in Colombian territorial waters. Petro stated the vessel was a fishing boat that was adrift with a distress signal due to engine failure, and that the strike killed a Colombian fisherman with no ties to the drug trade. This accusation comes amid heightened tensions after former U.S. President Trump defended recent strikes in the Caribbean as targeting "drug-carrying" vessels and called Petro an "illegal drug leader."</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance celebrated the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton, California, at an event featuring a live artillery demonstration that drew criticism from the state's governor. During his speech, Vance, a Marine veteran, praised his time in the service and used the platform to attack Democrats for the government shutdown. He also criticized previous military diversity initiatives, aligning with the Trump administration's focus on eliminating what he termed "woke" aspects of the military. The vice president's office dismissed safety concerns raised by Governor Gavin Newsom over the live-fire exercise.</p>

          <p>An opinion article praises two federal district court judges in Portland and Chicago for blocking former President Donald Trump's attempts to deploy National Guard troops to their cities. The judges are commended for having the courage to rule that Trump's rationale for the deployments, which described the cities as "war-ravaged," was "untethered to the facts." The author contrasts their actions with what is described as the Supreme Court's deference to Trump, arguing these lower court judges spoke truth to power. The article warns that allowing such deployments would be a significant step toward normalizing martial law.</p>

          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has suggested that the government is considering a cut to the 5% Value Added Tax (VAT) on household energy bills to address the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. While he did not confirm the move ahead of the Chancellor's November Budget, he acknowledged that the government is "looking at all of these issues." The proposal comes as the government faces pressure to reduce energy costs, which have remained high since the 2021 price spike. Scrapping the VAT could save the average household approximately £86 per year, according to estimates.</p>

          <p>Legal specialists and former prosecutors suggest that the federal indictment against former national security adviser John Bolton for allegedly mishandling classified information is fundamentally different from cases against other Trump critics like James Comey. While the timing has raised questions about political motivation, experts note that the evidence and procedures used to indict Bolton may indicate a stronger, more serious case. The charges focus on conduct that allegedly occurred over a significant period. To secure a conviction, the government will need to prove Bolton knowingly transferred classified information to an unauthorized individual.</p>

This has sparked concerns among consumer and environmental groups about rising utility bills for residential customers and an increased reliance on fossil fuels.

This year's enrollment coincides with a federal government shutdown, which could cause delays in accessing information from official channels like the 1-800-Medicare helpline.
