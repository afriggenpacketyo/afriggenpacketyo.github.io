          <p>Three large wildfires are burning north of Duluth, Minnesota, with crews also battling blazes in Manitoba and Ontario, Canada. The fires have consumed approximately 30,000 acres, with the Munger Shaw Fire nearly contained while the Jenkins Creek and Camp House Road fires continue to pose a threat. The Camp House Road Fire has destroyed dozens of structures, including homes and cabins, and is 40% contained. Donations are being accepted through the Head of the Lakes United Way and United Way Northeastern Minnesota to support relief efforts for affected community members. Relevant context is that wildfires are becoming increasingly common due to climate change and dry conditions.</p>

          <p>China has accused the United States of undermining preliminary trade agreements after the U.S. issued an industry warning against using Chinese chips, specifically those from Huawei. A spokesperson for China's Commerce Ministry stated that the U.S. Commerce Department's guidance was "discriminatory" and "market distorting," demanding that the U.S. correct its mistakes. The U.S. Commerce Department had warned of the risks associated with using PRC advanced-computing ICs, citing potential violations of U.S. export controls. This guidance was issued shortly after a "China trade deal" was announced following high-level talks in Geneva.</p>

The ruling Democratic Alliance, led by Prime Minister Luís Montenegro, has refused to ally with Chega.

          <p>Britain and the European Union have struck a deal aimed at boosting security cooperation and reducing trade barriers introduced by Brexit. The agreement includes a new defense partnership and reduced checks on food and drink. British people will be allowed to use electronic gates in Europe when crossing borders, and traveling with pets will be easier. The deal also allows European boats access to U.K. fishing waters until June 30, 2038, and includes plans for a new program to allow young Europeans to travel and work in Britain and vice versa.</p>

The president began speaking with Putin at some point after 10 a.m. ET, and will speak with Zelenskyy when the call concludes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new UK-EU deal aims to reset the relationship between the UK and the EU, potentially boosting economic growth. The agreement reduces trade barriers, particularly for foodstuffs, by simplifying certification and checks. While the government claims this agreement will be worth £8.9bn to the UK by 2040, it only recoups a small fraction of the GDP lost due to Brexit. The key concession made by the UK was an extension to the agreement on fisheries by 12 years, which has drawn criticism from some fishing communities.</p>

Messi felt a pass from an Orlando City defender to their goalkeeper should have been ruled an intentional backpass, but the referee did not make the call, leading to Orlando's first goal.</p>

          <p>President Trump’s tariffs on auto parts are causing job losses in Windsor, Ontario, the heart of Canada's auto-parts industry. The tariffs have unleashed widespread anxiety, particularly among the smaller parts makers who lack the financial cushion of larger automakers. While automakers are unlikely to abandon their assembly plants, there is growing concern that tariffs will devastate parts makers. The U.S. trade rules come with complicated regulations on how tariffs are imposed, based, among other things, on whether they meet the requirements of a North American trade agreement.</p>

          <p>The European Union has scaled back its forecast for economic growth in 2025 due to trade uncertainty stemming from President Trump’s tariffs. The European Commission now expects the gross domestic product of the euro area to grow by just 0.9 percent, down from 1.3 percent. Germany's economy is expected to stagnate, with exports declining 1.9 percent. The commission noted that a de-escalation of trade tensions with the U.S. could lead to stronger growth, and increased spending on armaments and the military could help spur more growth across Europe.</p>
