        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court ruled against Texas in its challenge to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval of a plan to store nuclear waste in the state. Justice Kavanaugh stated that Texas did not have standing to sue since it wasn't a party in the licensing proceeding. The ruling reverses a lower court decision but does not address the commission's authority to license private companies for offsite nuclear waste storage. The case highlights the ongoing political challenges of nuclear waste disposal, with spent fuel remaining radioactive for thousands of years, and the decision does not indicate whether the commission is right or wrong on the merits of the case, only that the state of Texas could not sue.</p>

          <p>Data from the CDC indicates a concerning increase in fall-related deaths among Americans aged 65 and older. The death rate from falls has risen significantly between 2003 and 2023, especially for those aged 85 and older. Experts recommend staying physically active, fall-proofing homes by removing hazards, using assistive devices, wearing sensible shoes, and addressing health issues like vision and hearing changes to help prevent falls. Taking proactive measures can significantly reduce the risk of falls and improve the safety and well-being of older adults.</p>

          <p>A British woman, Yvonne Ford, died from rabies after being scratched by a puppy during a holiday in Morocco. Although the incident occurred in February, she only began experiencing symptoms, including headache and loss of motor skills, two weeks prior to her death. Health officials emphasize that rabies cannot be transmitted between humans, but close contacts and healthcare workers are being assessed and offered vaccinations as a precaution. This tragic case highlights the importance of seeking immediate medical attention after any animal bite or scratch, especially when traveling abroad, and the need to vaccinate pets against rabies.</p>

This "senior bonus" is in lieu of eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits and would be available to individuals with incomes up to $75,000 and married couples filing jointly with incomes up to $150,000. The deduction phases out at a rate of 6% for incomes above these thresholds and would be in place for tax years 2025 through 2028. Both chambers must agree on the bill before it is sent to the president to sign, with a version of the senior deduction expected to be included. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oil analysts are struggling to predict how the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran will affect oil prices. Israel's recent attack on Iran's military and nuclear infrastructure has led to increased warfare between the two countries.

          <p>Purchasing a $500,000 annuity at age 65 can provide a significant and reliable income stream during retirement. Monthly payouts vary based on factors such as gender, payout structure (single or joint life), and prevailing interest rates. Current estimates suggest a 65-year-old male could receive around $3,269 per month, while a female of the same age might receive approximately $3,151 per month. The type of annuity, payout features, and inflation protection also influence the monthly income, so it is important to compare quotes from multiple insurance companies before making a decision.

          <p>A new report indicates that Massachusetts taxpayers are projected to spend $1 billion on the state's emergency shelter program in FY25, largely due to the influx of migrant families. The state has already spent $830 million, accommodating over 4,000 families with shelter, food, education, and legal aid, costing approximately $3,496 per week per family. While the state aims to reduce the caseload and close all hotel shelters by the end of the year, critics argue that taxpayers are burdened by this broken system, even though the influx of new migrants has all but ended given border crossings are at historic lows.</p>

          <p>Following a WTA report detailing abuse against nearly 500 female tennis players, Coco Gauff is calling on social media companies to take more action against online abusers. Gauff described the abuse she receives as "gross," including death threats and racist comments. The WTA is urging the gambling industry to take action, but Gauff emphasizes the need for social media platforms to get involved by banning abusive accounts and preventing users from creating new accounts after being blocked. Gauff also accepted an apology from Aryna Sabalenka after Sabalenka's comments following her defeat to Gauff in the French Open final.</p>

This deployment comes amid ongoing strikes between Israel and Iran following Israel's operation to destroy Tehran's nuclear program.

          <p>Despite producing more food than ever, global harvests are concentrated in a few regions, many of which are projected to experience significant declines due to climate change. A new study indicates that key staple crops could see an 11.2% decline by the end of the century under a moderate emissions scenario, even with adaptation efforts. This decline in food production could lead to more food insecurity, especially as extreme weather events increasingly disrupt harvests. Although some cooler regions may see larger harvests, the overall impact is expected to raise food prices and exacerbate global hunger.</p>

          <p>FreshRealm is recalling pre-made chicken fettuccine alfredo meals sold at Kroger and Walmart due to potential listeria contamination. The recalled products include Marketside Grilled Chicken Alfredo and Home Chef Heat & Eat Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo, with specific best-by dates. The chicken dishes could be linked to a possible outbreak strain of listeria, associated with illnesses, deaths, and fetal loss. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them and to either throw them away or return them to the place of purchase.</p>
