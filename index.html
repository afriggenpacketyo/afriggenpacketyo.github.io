          <p>China has responded to President Trump's accusations of violating the Geneva trade agreement by claiming that the U.S. is undermining the deal through export restrictions and visa revocations. A Chinese commerce department spokesperson stated that Beijing would take measures to protect its interests if the U.S. continues to damage them. Stephen Olson from the Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore noted that Beijing is comfortable taking a firm stance in these negotiations, understanding that any deal with the U.S. will only provide short-term relief. Trump had accused China of totally violating its agreement with the U.S. in a social media post, leading to heightened trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

Witnesses reported that Soliman yelled "Free Palestine" during the attack, which occurred on the eve of the Jewish holiday Shavuot.

The Mongolian-born Hakuho, now known as elder Miyagino, will hold a press conference upon his return from Mongolia. The Miyagino stable has been closed since April 2024 after a protege was found to have physically abused junior wrestlers, leading to the transfer of wrestlers and elders to the Isegahama stable indefinitely. Hakuho retired from competition in September 2021 after winning 1,187 matches, more than any other wrestler in sumo's history.</p>

          <p>Investigative journalist Christo Grozev, known for unmasking Russian spies and exposing the plot to poison Aleksei Navalny, became a target of President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin enlisted a disgraced finance executive, who had been recruited by Russian intelligence, to track and kill Grozev. However, the team hired by the financier was apprehended, and the financier now resides in Moscow, facing the consequences of his failed mission. Justice Nicholas Hilliard of the Central Criminal Court in London sentenced six Bulgarian nationals to prison for their involvement in the plot to kill Grozev, underscoring the ongoing threat posed by the Kremlin's efforts to silence its opponents.</p>

          <p>A Japanese social media personality known as Entertainer Orihara, has been arrested for allegedly extorting a man out of 3 million yen ($21,000) in exchange for removing his private details from the internet, Tokyo police said Monday. Yuki Azuma, 29, is known for exposing apparent secrets of famous people on social media. He allegedly uploaded the personal information and headshot of a 30-year-old man to X, formerly Twitter, and extorted the money from him at a Tokyo restaurant in October last year.</p>

          <p>Catherine Hilda Duleep Singh, a British-born Sikh princess, openly lived in a same-sex relationship in 1900s Germany and used her privilege and resources to help Jewish families flee Nazism. Her actions, often unacknowledged, involved writing letters of recommendation, providing financial support, and guaranteeing immigration documents. During the Nazi regime, Catherine helped several Jewish individuals and families escape persecution in Germany and start over in Britain. Her legacy is being recognized through a forthcoming Kensington Palace exhibition and a biography detailing her extraordinary contributions.</p>

          <p>The US defense sector relies on China for critical minerals essential to advanced weapon systems, but as Beijing tightens export restrictions, the Pentagon's military readiness and supply chain security are at risk.

Beijing has imposed export controls on gallium, germanium, and antimony, affecting American military end users. These restrictions could impact the production and maintenance of essential military equipment.</p>

          <p>A new book, The Family Dynamic, explores how sibling relationships influence life trajectories, considering factors like birth order and individual achievements. While eldest children may score higher on cognitive tests, sibling influence extends beyond simple archetypes, impacting personal choices and emotional development. Age gaps between siblings can further complicate these dynamics, with younger siblings learning from the experiences of their older siblings. Siblings act as vivid mirrors, reflecting both the best and worst traits, fostering self-awareness and challenging flaws.</p>

Despite limited diplomatic progress, the fighting on the ground continues unabated. He has been showing signs of frustration over the process, suggesting that he is prepared to "just back away" and allow the fighting to continue if the two leaders can't make progress soon.</p>

The Polish election was closely watched in Europe, the United States and battling Eastern European neighbors Russia and Ukraine as it raises questions over the solidity of Warsaw's future alignment with Brussels and Kyiv.

The odour frequently affects Lybrook Elementary School, where Amari and around 70 other Navajo students attend classes.

State regulators have installed only 20 permanent air monitors, most in areas without oil or gas production.

The six people injured were between the ages of 67 and 88, police said, and their injuries ranged from minor to “very serious”. Colorado governor Jared Polis said that he is “closely monitoring” the situation, adding: “My thoughts go out to the people who have been injured and impacted by this heinous act of terror.
