          <p>The Tennessee Titans selected Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, fulfilling weeks of predictions by football analysts. Ward's selection marks the third consecutive year a quarterback has been chosen first overall, highlighting the position's significance in the league. The Jacksonville Jaguars traded up to secure Colorado's Travis Hunter, a two-way player, while the draft overall emphasized offensive and defensive lines, with seven of the first 12 picks being linemen. The draft was held in Green Bay, Wisconsin, for the first time, adding to the event's unique atmosphere. 80</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that Reed Bank, a contested area in the South China Sea with substantial gas and oil reserves, could become a future flashpoint between China and the Philippines. The risk increases if Manila proceeds with unilateral resource exploration to secure its energy needs. However, factors such as the Philippines' limited development capabilities and upcoming elections could postpone the escalation. Both China and the Philippines have sought joint development, but exploration has been stalled due to ongoing tensions and sovereignty disputes. 50</p>

          <p>Faustin Nsabumukunzi, a Rwandan beekeeper living in the Hamptons, was arrested on charges of immigration fraud for allegedly concealing his participation in the Rwandan genocide.

He allegedly lied about his involvement when seeking refugee status and later citizenship in the United States.

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that China could build its soft power in Africa by developing a non-governmental organization (NGO) model tailored to its unique context. While China has heavily invested in infrastructure projects through state-led initiatives, Western countries have cultivated extensive NGO networks. The author argues that NGOs can foster community ties, provide social services, and address policy gaps, thereby improving China's public image. This approach could help counter narratives of China as a neocolonial power and strengthen human connections across the continent. 70</p>

          <p>San Francisco is moving towards adopting a "recovery first" drug policy that prioritizes abstinence, amidst concerns over drug overdose deaths and public drug use. Supervisor Matt Dorsey amended the proposal to clarify that harm reduction strategies remain critical, but the primary goal is long-term remission of substance use disorders. The proposal has sparked debate between those who support harm reduction and those who believe abstinence-based treatment is necessary to break the cycle of addiction. The Board of Supervisors is expected to vote on the proposal next month. 60</p>

          <p>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is facing renewed scrutiny, but the attacks may be less about him and more about broader political agendas within the Trump administration. Previous attempts to derail Hegseth's nomination failed, and recent controversies, such as the "Signalgate" group chat leak, highlight internal divisions on foreign policy, particularly regarding Iran. The cashiering of officials close to Hegseth suggests a commitment to addressing leaks, while reactions to these firings reveal ongoing tensions between Iran hawks and doves within the administration. 50</p>
