        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tyler Robinson, 22, has been arrested in connection with the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, apprehended swiftly after his father recognized him from distributed photographs and convinced him to surrender. Authorities recovered a high-powered Mauser rifle and found bullet casings engraved with provocative messages like "Hey fascist! CATCH!" at the scene. Robinson's phone also contained messages detailing the rifle's disposal and his change of clothes, indicating premeditation. Governor Spencer Cox noted Robinson's recent political radicalization, with law enforcement on scene within minutes and the suspect caught within 33 hours of the assassination.</p>

          <p>Influential conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot at Utah Valley University during his "American Comeback" tour, sparking widespread shock and anger across the political spectrum. Authorities quickly launched a massive manhunt, releasing photos and video of a person of interest and recovering a high-powered rifle used in the attack. President Trump later announced a suspect was in custody, identified as Tyler Robinson, and called for the death penalty, highlighting the deep political divisions in the country. Kirk, co-founder of Turning Point USA, was a prominent right-wing media personality and Trump ally, whose assassination has intensified debates on political violence and polarization in the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The widespread adoption of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Zepbound is significantly impacting the apparel industry, creating what some call the "Ozempic effect." Resale stores are reporting a surge in larger sizes and increased demand for smaller garments, necessitating store reconfigurations. While some retailers are reducing extended sizes on racks, experts caution against abandoning the plus-size market, which remains largely underserved. The long-term effects on the clothing industry depend on drug accessibility and sustained demand, but for now, a noticeable shift in consumer sizing preferences is evident, particularly with larger sizes moving to clearance.</p>

          <p>Tech giants like Apple, Google, and Meta are rapidly advancing towards creating real-time universal translator devices, moving science fiction concepts into reality. Apple's new AirPods Pro 3 feature Live Translation for multiple languages, allowing simultaneous two-way conversation, while Google's Pixel 10 offers Voice Translate, preserving speaker inflections. Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses also provide translation via speakers and phone transcription. These innovations, spurred by generative AI advancements, promise to reshape industries like translation, but also raise questions about job displacement and the accuracy and linguistic nuance of purpose-built devices versus integrated tech offerings.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry made a surprise visit to Kyiv, Ukraine, to support wounded service members and highlight the ongoing conflict, following an unexpected reunion with his father, King Charles, in London. This marks his second trip to Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion, aiming to "humanize" those affected and prevent desensitization to the war, with a schedule that includes meeting veterans and the Ukrainian Prime Minister. The London meeting with King Charles, their first in over a year amidst the King's cancer diagnosis, signals a potential thaw in royal family relations. Harry expressed a desire for reconciliation, acknowledging the King's health and the need to mend family ties.</p>

          <p>The UK Prime Minister is facing significant anger from Labour MPs following the appointment and swift sacking of Peter Mandelson as US ambassador due to his known links with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Critics argue Mandelson should never have been appointed, with some MPs expressing concerns about the Prime Minister's leadership and the party's direction after a chaotic week. The controversy, compounded by a recent cabinet resignation, has led to calls for transparency regarding the vetting process and demands to release relevant documents. This situation has created a "dangerous atmosphere" among Labour MPs, raising questions about the government's judgment and stability.</p>

          <p>Luxury furniture retailer RH's shares declined after it missed second-quarter revenue expectations and significantly lowered its full-year outlook, citing an additional $30 million hit from tariffs. The company now projects lower full-year revenues and adjusted earnings margins, further delaying its Fall Interiors Sourcebook. CEO Gary Friedman highlighted uncertainty from President Trump's threat of new furniture tariffs, aimed at bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., despite the current lack of domestic capacity for high-quality production. RH is adapting by shifting operations out of China and seeking alternative manufacturing, but the ongoing tariff discussions create a challenging environment. (not investment advice)</p>

Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services, accusing him of rejecting fundamental principles of modern science, not just vaccines.

Kennedy's promotion of false claims about vaccines, HIV/AIDS, and COVID-19, including assertions that vaccines cause autism, are deemed dangerous and life-threatening.

          <p>The UN Security Council, with the rare backing of the United States, has condemned Israel's strikes on a residential compound in Doha, Qatar, which targeted senior Hamas members. While the statement did not directly name Israel, the US support is notable given its traditional role in blocking actions against its ally. Qatar, a key mediator in Israel-Gaza negotiations and a close US ally, requested the emergency meeting, with its Prime Minister expressing outrage and questioning future diplomatic engagement. Israel defended its actions, asserting "no sanctuary for terrorists," but the incident has shocked the region, leading to UAE summoning the Israeli ambassador, and raising concerns about diplomatic efforts and regional stability.</p>

          <p>Netflix's "KPop Demon Hunters" has become the platform's most-watched film, captivating audiences with its vibrant animation, catchy songs, and unique narrative that flips the traditional artist-fan relationship. The movie depicts a K-pop girl group, Huntrix, whose demon-hunting powers are directly fueled by their fans' adoration, literally transforming love into a superpower. While celebrating fandom's positive force, the article notes the film also subtly critiques the sometimes-parasitic aspects of the K-pop industry, where artists are constantly catering to fan demands in an "unsustainable race for attention." The film cleverly appeals to both new and devoted K-pop fans with its self-aware humor and engaging premise.</p>

The ECB plans to reduce the number of T20 Blast games and is considering changes to Championship cricket to prioritize player welfare and prevent burnout. Thompson acknowledged that current scheduling constraints, due to existing TV rights deals, mean significant changes, like creating gaps around The Hundred tournament, may have to wait until 2028.</p>

While Mumbai ranks safest, Delhi is among the least secure. Sociologists argue that technical solutions like CCTV are insufficient; true safety requires integrating social understanding, such as preserving informal markets that provide "eyes on the streets." Deep-rooted patriarchal norms, which limit women's public presence and lead to victim-blaming, also contribute significantly to the problem. Experts advocate for inter-disciplinary, participatory urban planning involving diverse female voices to create truly inclusive and safe cities.</p>

However, US President Donald Trump's "less unequivocal" response, with a cryptic social media post and suggestion of a "mistake," has left allies questioning the US commitment to Article 5, NATO's collective defense pledge. Experts believe Russia's incursion was a deliberate probe to test NATO's resolve and deepen divisions between the US and Europe.
