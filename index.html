          <p>Australia has granted asylum to Ted Hui, a prominent pro-democracy activist who fled Hong Kong following the 2019 protests. Hui, who faced multiple criminal charges and had a police bounty on him, confirmed that he and his family received protection from the Australian government. In a statement, he expressed gratitude but also profound sadness about being a political refugee unable to return to his hometown. He urged Australia to continue advocating for other activists who remain imprisoned in Hong Kong, highlighting the ongoing struggle for democratic freedoms.</p>

          <p>The British Horseracing Authority has announced an unprecedented strike, canceling all races scheduled for September 10th to protest a proposed government tax hike on betting. The industry is campaigning against a plan to increase the remote gambling tax, which they argue would be catastrophic for the sport's finances. An economic analysis cited by the BHA predicts a potential revenue loss of £330 million and the endangerment of nearly 3,000 jobs in the first year alone. This action represents the first time the sport has voluntarily halted races in opposition to government policy.</p>

          <p>A new judicial interpretation in China is intensifying scrutiny on companies that evade social insurance contributions, inadvertently boosting the employment of retirees. Businesses are increasingly hiring older workers because they are not required to pay these contributions for them, a trend highlighted by recruitment notices from McDonald's. This has sparked widespread concern among younger generations, who fear that their job opportunities will diminish as companies favor retirees. The policy aims to address the nation's pension crisis but is creating new tensions in the job market.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has defended the decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist group, stating its activities go beyond legitimate protest. She cited incidents of alleged violent disorder and aggravated burglary for which the group claimed responsibility, noting the Crown Prosecution Service assessed these charges as having a "terrorism connection." Her comments come as the Metropolitan Police announced that an additional 60 individuals will be prosecuted for supporting the group. Since the ban, over 700 people have been arrested in connection with the organization, which primarily targets arms companies.</p>

          <p>Music legend Billy Joel is closing his Long Island motorcycle shop, 20th Century Cycles, and auctioning his personal collection after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). The 76-year-old singer revealed the brain disorder affects his vision, hearing, and balance, which also prompted him to cancel all tour dates for the next two years. The shop, which opened in 2010, served as a space to showcase his collection of over 75 vintage bikes and became a popular local landmark. Joel's decision stems from his ongoing recovery and medical advice to refrain from certain activities.</p>

          <p>New Zealand's national rugby team, the All Blacks, has returned to the top of the world rankings for the first time in four years after defeating Argentina 41-24. The victory in their Rugby Championship opener saw them replace South Africa as the number one team. Despite a strong second-half comeback attempt from Argentina's Pumas, New Zealand sealed the win with two late tries from substitute Samisoni Taukei'aho. The win extends New Zealand's undefeated record against Argentina on Argentinian soil to 15 matches.</p>

          <p>The Republican-led states of West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio have announced the deployment of hundreds of National Guard members to Washington D.C. This action supports the Trump administration's federal intervention aimed at addressing crime and homelessness in the capital. The move has been met with protests from demonstrators who label it a "fascist takeover" and an unconstitutional power play. Critics and local officials argue the intervention is an overreach, especially as city data indicates violent crime is lower than during Trump's first term.</p>

          <p>More than 2,500 migrants have successfully crossed the English Channel in small boats in the 11 days since the UK's new "one in, one out" returns agreement with France was initiated. The pilot scheme proposes that for every migrant returned to France, the UK will accept one with a strong asylum case, but no removals have yet occurred. Meanwhile, concerns are growing over people smugglers using larger, more dangerous vessels, with reports of a "mega dinghy" capable of holding over 100 people.

          <p>In an opinion piece, the author explores how her perception of Renaissance art transformed from youthful indifference to profound connection through life experience. She contrasts her early dismissal of religious paintings with later, more mature encounters with works by artists like Caravaggio and Fra Angelico, which resonated deeply after personal trauma and motherhood. The article suggests that understanding the emotional complexity of such art requires a level of life experience that allows one to move past cynicism and embrace earnestness. It posits that being moved by art is linked to being moved by the pain of others.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is preparing for a challenging visit to Washington for peace talks with President Donald Trump. The meeting is fraught with tension, following Trump's recent summit with Vladimir Putin where he seemed to abandon the key demand for an unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine. Zelenskyy is in a difficult position, needing to appear as a willing participant in negotiations to avoid being portrayed as an obstacle to peace. However, there are significant fears in Kyiv that he is heading into a diplomatic ambush where he could be pressured into conceding more territory to Russia.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Doctors Report Significant Increase in Tick-Related Emergency Room Visits</h2>

          <p>Doctors across the United States are reporting a notable surge in emergency room visits related to tick bites this summer, prompting public health warnings. According to CDC data, May saw the highest rate of such visits since 2019, a trend that experts attribute partly to environmental changes like warmer temperatures and increased humidity, which expand tick habitats. This rise in human-tick encounters increases the risk of tick-borne illnesses, such as Lyme disease. Health officials are emphasizing the importance of preventative measures, including using insect repellent and conducting thorough body checks after spending time outdoors.</p>

          <h2>"Zombie Hunter" Killer's Defense Argued His Mother's Abuse Created a Monster</h2>

          <p>During the trial of Bryan Patrick Miller, convicted of the 1990s Phoenix "canal murders," his defense team argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity. They claimed that extreme physical and psychological abuse by his mother throughout his childhood caused Miller to develop dissociative amnesia. This condition, they argued, created a violent alter ego that committed the murders, leaving Miller with no memory of the events. A note he wrote as a teen detailed a plan to abduct, sexually assault, murder and dismember a woman. While the judge acknowledged the proof of childhood abuse, she rejected the insanity defense and sentenced him to death.</p>
