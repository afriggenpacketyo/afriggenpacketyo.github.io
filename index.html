            <p>Aix-Marseille University in France has received nearly 300 applications for its 'Safe Place For Science' program, designed to provide refuge for scientists affected by funding cuts in the United States. The program offers a stimulating environment for researchers to freely pursue their work. Of the eligible applicants, 135 are American, with backgrounds from prestigious institutions like Johns Hopkins and Yale. This initiative reflects a broader trend of European institutions capitalizing on potential 'brain drain' from the U.S. due to research funding rollbacks.</p>

            <p>As Iran and the U.S. prepare for a second round of nuclear talks in Rome, hopes for de-escalation are tempered by military threats and mixed messages from both sides. While Iran insists it returned to the table due to the U.S. limiting its demands to nuclear issues, the threat of military action seems to have played a role. Reaching a deal remains uncertain, with disagreements on uranium enrichment and verification processes. The talks occur amid a flurry of diplomatic activity, including visits between Saudi Arabia, Russia, and IAEA officials, reflecting the complex geopolitical landscape.</p>

            <p>The acting commissioner of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is being replaced after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent complained that the leader of the agency had been installed without his knowledge and at the behest of Elon Musk, the New York Times reported. Bessent believed that Musk had done an end run around him to get Gary Shapley installed as the interim head of the IRS, even though the tax collection agency reports to Bessent, the newspaper said.</p>

            <p>Layoffs of support staff at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are raising concerns about the safety of the food and drug supply. While inspectors themselves were spared from job cuts, the loss of support staff who handle travel arrangements and reimbursements could hinder their ability to conduct inspections of factories both domestically and internationally. This comes at a time when the FDA was already struggling to meet its inspection goals, potentially increasing the risk of manufacturing problems and recalls.</p>

            <p>The United States is experiencing a surge in measles cases, recording the highest number in a single year since 2019, with the number continuing to grow, CDC data shows. A significant outbreak in West Texas is driving the increase, and infections have been confirmed in at least 24 states. Health officials emphasize the importance of vaccination, as measles is highly contagious and can lead to severe complications, particularly in unvaccinated individuals. The increase in cases is attributed to lower vaccination rates.</p>

            <p>A federal court has blocked the Trump administration's effort to terminate a large number of staff at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The ruling comes after the administration moved to lay off approximately 1,500 of the agency's 1,700 employees, prompting concerns about potential violations of existing judicial orders. The move has been criticized as an attempt to dismantle the agency and benefit Elon Musk's financial services platform, X Money.</p>

            <p>Attorneys for several Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas are warning that their clients are at 'imminent risk' of deportation to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. This comes after a federal judge denied a request for a temporary restraining order, and ICE officers allegedly informed detainees that they were being sent to El Salvador. The ACLU has filed a new emergency application for a temporary restraining order, citing reports that clients were told to sign papers and accused of being members of Tren de Aragua.</p>

His remains, previously unidentified, were recovered from Omaha Beach and interred at a U.S. Military Cemetery. Advances in DNA analysis allowed scientists to finally identify the remains as belonging to Thornton, and he will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery.</p>
