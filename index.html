          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, it remains one of the costliest and deadliest storms in U.S. history, leading to nearly 1,400 deaths. The catastrophe was severely exacerbated when the levee system in New Orleans failed, flooding at least 80% of the city and creating a massive humanitarian crisis. The federal government's response was widely criticized as slow and inadequate, leaving thousands stranded for days without aid. Decades later, communities like the Lower Ninth Ward have yet to fully recover, still facing significant infrastructure and resource deficits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the wake of a tragic school shooting in Minneapolis that killed two children, a national debate has reignited over how to prevent such violence. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated his department is investigating potential links between mass tragedies and prescription drugs, as well as the nation's broader mental health crisis. Conversely, crime prevention experts like John Lott argue that shooters target gun-free zones to maximize media attention and that hardening these soft targets is crucial. Democratic lawmakers have renewed calls for stricter gun control measures, highlighting the deep divisions in proposed solutions.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology giant Alibaba reported better-than-expected net income for its fiscal first quarter, causing its U.S.-listed stock to climb 10%. The strong performance was primarily fueled by a 26% year-over-year revenue increase in its cloud computing division, which has seen robust demand for its artificial intelligence services. While overall revenue slightly missed forecasts, investors were encouraged by the cloud unit's acceleration and continued recovery in its e-commerce business. The company continues to invest heavily in competitive areas like instant commerce, which has impacted profitability in its core retail division. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A boat carrying approximately 160 migrants, primarily from Gambia and Senegal, has capsized off the coast of Mauritania, resulting in at least 69 confirmed deaths. The vessel was en route to Spain's Canary Islands, an increasingly common but perilous migration route across the Atlantic. According to a coastguard official, the boat overturned when passengers moved to one side after spotting coastal lights. This tragedy highlights the dangers of the journey, which saw nearly 47,000 arrivals last year and an estimated 9,000 deaths, according to a Spanish non-governmental organization.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially ended the 'de minimis' trade exemption, a provision that allowed shipments valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free. This sudden policy change is expected to cause significant disruption for global retailers and supply chains, which had increasingly designed their business models around the exemption. Companies from Tapestry to Lululemon, as well as countless small businesses on platforms like Etsy, now face new tariffs that will increase costs.

          <p>Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has clarified his recent post-match comments that fueled speculation about his future, stating they were a product of his emotional reaction to a surprising defeat.

He has since explained that such emotional outbursts are part of his passionate management style, admitting that in moments of frustration he can feel like he wants to quit or that he hates his players, just as he feels immense love for them after a victory.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's legal team has asked a federal judge to deny Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's request for a temporary restraining order to block her firing. The administration argues that the president has the authority to remove a Fed governor for cause and that the allegations of mortgage misrepresentation against Cook are sufficient grounds. In a separate filing, the Federal Reserve Board took no position on the matter but urged the court to issue a prompt ruling to resolve the dispute. This legal showdown represents a significant test of the president's power to influence the historically independent central bank.</p>

This could encode existing health disparities into the algorithms that will guide future medical diagnoses and treatments.

          <p>As the Federal Reserve signals potential interest rate cuts, savers looking for high-yield Certificates of Deposit (CDs) may need to act strategically. While the peak rates of over 6% are gone, it is still possible to find CDs with rates around 4.50%. To find these competitive rates, experts suggest considering online-only banks, which typically offer higher yields due to lower overhead costs. It is also recommended to utilize online marketplace sites to easily compare offers from multiple institutions. Currently, short-term CDs of one year or less are generally providing the highest annual percentage yields in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, rose to a 2.9% annual rate in July, its highest level since February. This uptick suggests that President Trump's tariffs may be contributing to rising prices within the U.S. economy. While overall inflation held steady at a 2.6% annual rate, the increase in the core metric, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, indicates persistent underlying price pressures. The figures show that inflation remains well above the central bank's 2% target, complicating its decisions on future interest rate adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's foreign ministry has strongly condemned a visit by U.S. senators Roger Wicker and Deb Fischer to Taiwan, labeling it a serious violation of the "one-China principle." A ministry spokesman stated that the visit, which included a meeting with Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te, undermines China's sovereignty and sends a dangerously wrong signal to what it calls "separatist forces." Beijing has urged Washington to cease all official exchanges with Taiwan and stop creating tensions in the region. The U.S. officially recognizes the one-China policy but maintains unofficial relations with Taiwan and is legally bound to provide it with defensive arms.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's effort to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from her post is facing a critical legal challenge that could ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court. Cook has sued the president, arguing his attempt to fire her is illegal and based on pretextual allegations, and is seeking a temporary restraining order to block her dismissal. The case highlights Trump's broader campaign to exert political control over the historically independent central bank, where he has been frustrated by a lack of interest rate cuts. Firing Cook would allow Trump to nominate a replacement, potentially shifting the balance of power on the Fed's board.</p>

          <p>A new Rutgers-Eagleton poll indicates that Republican Jack Ciattarelli holds an edge with independent voters in the New Jersey governor's race, despite nearly half of all voters in the state opposing the MAGA movement. Among independents who support the movement, 73% back Ciattarelli, while 67% of anti-MAGA independents favor Democrat Mikie Sherrill. The poll suggests that Ciattarelli's alignment with the national MAGA brand is resonating with a crucial segment of the electorate. Independent voters are a key demographic in the election, and their leanings could be decisive in the November contest.</p>

This article reviews the book, reflecting on how the internet and music blogs like Pitchfork fueled the genre's explosion, creating a movement defined by musical complexity and a departure from polished pop. While the term "indie" eventually became a lifestyle brand, its core values of authentic self-expression and sonic exploration went on to influence a generation of listeners and even shape the direction of mainstream pop music.</p>

          <p>The UK government proceeded with the largest reorganization of English councils in decades without commissioning its own independent analysis of the potential costs, the BBC has learned. The Ministry of Local Government based its estimate of £2.9 billion in savings on a 2020 report from a lobbying group, the County Council Network (CCN). However, the CCN has since revised its analysis, now warning that some reorganization scenarios could result in no savings and might even cost taxpayers hundreds of millions. Critics have called it astonishing that the government would embark on such a massive reform without up-to-date, independent financial evidence.</p>

          <p>President Trump's elimination of the 'de minimis' trade rule, which allowed duty-free imports under $800, is creating a significant financial and logistical crisis for small and medium-sized businesses. Customs experts warn that these companies, which relied heavily on the exemption for global e-commerce, now face new tariffs and complex compliance requirements that could erode their thin profit margins. The sudden change has already prompted several foreign postal services, including those in the UK and Japan, to suspend shipments to the U.S. This disruption is expected to lead to higher costs and significant operational challenges for smaller enterprises.

          <p>India's economy expanded at an annual rate of 7.8% in the April-June quarter, surpassing economists' forecasts of 6.7% growth. The strong performance was driven by the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors. However, some underlying indicators point to a potential slowdown, as nominal GDP growth, which does not account for inflation, has decreased. Economists note that a soft inflation deflator played a role in boosting the real GDP figure. The robust growth comes as the country faces economic headwinds, including the recent implementation of steep U.S. tariffs on Indian imports. (not investment advice)</p>
