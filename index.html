          <p>The Buss family has reportedly agreed to sell a majority stake in the Los Angeles Lakers to businessman Mark Walter, valuing the team at $10 billion, which would set a new record for NBA valuations. Jeanie Buss will retain a minority stake and her position as governor. Walter, CEO of Guggenheim Partners, also owns the Los Angeles Dodgers, WNBA's Sparks, and Cadillac's forthcoming Formula 1 team. Former Lakers legend Magic Johnson praised the deal, noting Walter's suitability to continue the Lakers' legacy of winning. The Lakers finished the 2025 season as the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference and have won 11 NBA titles since the Buss family took over. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sidestepped direct questions before Congress regarding the possibility of the US actively joining Israel against Iran. Hegseth stated that the final decision rests with President Trump, and his role is to provide the White House with options. He declined to specify whether those options included the use of "bunker buster" bombs requested by Israel to disrupt Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities. The prospect of American military involvement is a consequential decision for Trump, potentially altering the balance of power in the Middle East and conflicting with some of his political allies.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reportedly approved attack plans for Iran but is waiting to see if Iran will discuss ending its nuclear program. The plans, presented in a Situation Room meeting, include potential strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, particularly the underground Fordo facility. Trump stated that "all options remain on the table" and that he would make a final decision at the last moment due to the changing nature of war. He also pushed back on MAGA voices urging non-intervention, reiterating his stance that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.

While the central bank anticipates inflation to worsen, it still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year, as initially forecasted in March. Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited solid labor market conditions and economic growth but acknowledged uncertainty due to the Trump administration's tariffs.

This divergence highlights the limits of Trump's approach to appointments, where he chose Gabbard, known for her opposition to American intervention, despite her skepticism of the intelligence agencies.

Trump is engaging the MAGA base with Vice President JD Vance to gauge their reaction to potential strikes. The president has also been briefed on security at U.S. Army bases, which could be vulnerable to Iranian retaliation. This consideration comes as Israelis discovered they did not eliminate all Iranian air defenses as previously thought.</p>

          <p>FreshRealm is recalling pre-made chicken fettuccine alfredo meals sold at Kroger and Walmart due to possible listeria contamination. The recalled products have establishment numbers "EST. P-50784," "EST. P-47770," or "EST. P-47718" printed on the packaging. The chicken dishes could be linked to a possible outbreak strain of listeria associated with three deaths and one fetal loss. Seventeen people in 13 states have also gotten sick. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them and should throw them away or return them to the place of purchase.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi used his first conversation with U.S. President Donald Trump since the conflict between India and Pakistan to express his frustration with Trump's claims that he played a significant role in brokering a ceasefire. Modi "clearly conveyed" to Trump that the U.S. played no role in the mediation. Trump has repeatedly claimed the U.S. played a significant role in de-escalating tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi. The disagreement likely stems from Trump's decision to host Pakistan's chief of Army Staff for lunch at the White House.</p>

Researchers assessed addiction with a standardized questionnaire and evaluated suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

          <p>Social Security is projected to deplete its trust funds by 2034, a year sooner than previously forecast, potentially requiring a 20% cut to monthly benefits. The new projection is partly due to increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act, which boosted benefits for millions of retirees. Lawmakers need to act quickly to shore up the program, either by raising more revenue or cutting benefits. The current average Social Security benefit for a retiree is $1,976, meaning a 19% reduction would take their monthly check down to about $1,600. (not investment advice)</p>
