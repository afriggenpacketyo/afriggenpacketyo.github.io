          <p>The jury in Sean "Diddy" Combs's federal trial in New York has reached a partial verdict on four of five counts but remains deadlocked on the most serious charge of racketeering. The judge has instructed the jurors to continue deliberations, employing a controversial "Allen charge" to encourage a unanimous decision. The trial, which has spanned two months and included testimony from 34 witnesses, accuses the hip-hop mogul of sex trafficking and other serious crimes. A verdict on the racketeering charge is proving difficult as it requires prosecutors to prove Combs established a coordinated criminal enterprise.</p>

          <p>The United States has paused certain weapons shipments to Ukraine, including air defense missiles and precision munitions, following a Pentagon review of domestic military stockpiles. The White House stated the decision was made to prioritize American interests and readiness, a move that comes amid an intensification of the war by Russia. This policy shift under the Trump administration has raised concerns about Ukraine's ability to defend against escalating Russian aerial attacks.

          <p>Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is reportedly exploring a significant strategic change for the company's chip manufacturing business, potentially ceasing to market its 18A process to external clients. This move aims to refocus resources on the next-generation 14A technology, where Intel believes it can better compete with rival TSMC for major customers like Apple and Nvidia. The shift away from the costly 18A process, a cornerstone of the previous CEO's plan, could result in a substantial financial write-off as the company works to revive its business.

The updated drills will simulate a full-spectrum attack, from "grey zone" pressure to urban warfare, and will include air-raid warnings and critical infrastructure protection.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has experienced a significant political setback, being forced into a U-turn on planned changes to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) welfare program. Facing a large-scale rebellion from his own Labour MPs, Starmer had to abandon the proposed reforms, drawing comparisons to the chaotic parliamentary defeats of previous administrations despite his large majority. The climbdown has reportedly caused deep frustration within the government and the party, with some questioning the chancellor's future and suggesting tax rises are now inevitable.

The ruling stated that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem acted unlawfully by not following the congressionally mandated process for reviewing conditions in Haiti before ending the program. The judge found that the interests of the Haitian TPS holders in remaining in the U.S. outweigh potential harm to the government.

The drop is partly attributed to a public feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump over the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." Musk criticized the bill for increasing the national debt and cutting support for renewable energy and electric vehicles, which could negatively impact Tesla's business. In response, Trump suggested that government contracts held by Musk's companies could be at risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Diocese of Fresno has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, citing the financial strain of managing 153 clergy sexual abuse claims. Bishop Joseph V. Brennan stated that bankruptcy is the only way to fairly handle the claims while allowing the diocese's ministry to continue. However, attorneys for the survivors have criticized the move as a delay tactic designed to shield the church from full accountability and force victims into a lengthy, property-focused legal process. The lawsuits stem from a California law that temporarily lifted the statute of limitations for civil sexual assault claims.</p>

          <p>Parts of England are officially in a drought, and other regions across the UK are at risk following the country's sixth-driest spring since 1836. Abnormally low rainfall has led to depleted river flows and reservoir levels, particularly in northern and eastern England. While some western areas saw rain in June, long-term forecasts predict continued dry conditions, increasing strain on water supplies for farms, homes, and the environment. Experts note that climate change is exacerbating the issue by increasing evaporation, prompting calls for new infrastructure and water conservation measures to build resilience.</p>

          <h2>Profile of Sean Feucht, the Christian Rocker Influential in MAGA Politics</h2>

          <p>Christian rock musician Sean Feucht has become a prominent and influential figure within the MAGA movement, advocating for a fusion of church and state. He tours the country holding large rallies that blend worship music with right-wing political sermons, promoting a Christian nationalist ideology and gaining access to top Republicans. Feucht is associated with the New Apostolic Reformation, a movement that seeks to have Christians control all major spheres of society, including government. Despite his growing influence, he is also facing allegations of financial misconduct from former staffers, which he has denied.</p>

          <h2>GOP Spending Bill Provision Aims to Block Medicaid Funding for Abortion Clinics</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 18:23:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A provision within the Republican-led spending bill would block abortion providers like Planned Parenthood from receiving any Medicaid reimbursements for one year. This would apply nationwide to non-abortion services such as cancer screenings and STI testing, which are currently covered. Critics argue this would have a devastating impact, potentially forcing many clinics to close or severely limit services, thereby reducing healthcare access, particularly in states where abortion remains legal. Proponents of the measure view it as a major victory in their decades-long effort to defund organizations that provide abortions.</p>
