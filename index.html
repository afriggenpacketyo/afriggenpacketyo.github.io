        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fan enthusiasm for the Prime Video series "The Summer I Turned Pretty" has escalated into online hostility, prompting the cast and network to address the issue. The intense debate over the main character's romantic choices has led to bullying and threats directed at the actors, blurring the lines between fiction and reality. A board-certified psychiatrist explains this behavior as a symptom of parasocial relationships, where fans form one-sided bonds with media figures. This phenomenon, amplified by social media's anonymity, may indicate a broader societal void and a longing for genuine human connection.</p>

          <p>Algerian Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelif is legally challenging World Boxing's mandate requiring gender testing for eligibility in its competitions. The mandate followed controversy during the Paris Olympics, where Khelif's victory sparked debate. Her appeal, filed with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), seeks to allow her to compete in the upcoming World Boxing Championships without undergoing the test. Khelif and Taiwanese fighter Lin Yu-ting were central to the gender eligibility furor at the games, drawing commentary from prominent public figures.</p>

Parubiy was a key figure in Ukraine's pro-European movements and a vocal supporter of Ukrainian independence, making his murder a politically charged event amid the ongoing war with Russia.</p>

Investors will be closely watching several jobs reports, including Friday's nonfarm payroll data, for signs of economic cooling that could influence the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rate cuts. Additionally, quarterly results from Salesforce and Broadcom will provide further insight into the health of the enterprise software and AI chip industries. The recent court ruling against Trump's tariffs is also expected to be a significant topic of discussion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The aircraft carrying European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen experienced significant GPS jamming, suspected to be Russian interference, as it approached Bulgaria. While the plane landed safely, the incident has been framed by the EU as another example of Russia's hostile actions intended to create instability. This event has reinforced the bloc's commitment to enhancing its defense capabilities and continuing its support for Ukraine. Such GPS interference has become increasingly common in regions bordering Russia, posing a growing risk to aviation safety.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a bilateral meeting, emphasizing their deepening ties at a time when India faces new U.S. tariffs. The meeting occurred on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in China, focusing on trade, energy, and regional stability. This diplomatic engagement is significant as it follows President Trump's imposition of steep tariffs on Indian imports in retaliation for India's continued purchase of discounted Russian oil. The discussion highlights India's strategic balancing act between its longstanding partnership with Russia and its relations with the United States.</p>

          <p>Iconic American apparel company Levi's has warned that rising anti-American sentiment, potentially fueled by President Trump's tariff policies, could negatively impact its brand in the United Kingdom. In its UK financial filings, the company listed this as a key risk, suggesting shoppers might increasingly favor national or European products. This marks one of the first instances of a major U.S. brand openly acknowledging the potential commercial fallout from the current administration's trade policies. The concern is contextualized by reports of consumer boycotts of American goods in other countries like Canada.</p>

          <p>ScotRail, Scotland's national train operator, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, a move that has lowered ticket prices and prompted discussions about whether the rest of the UK could follow. The decision reflects changes in travel patterns since the pandemic, with reduced commuter rush-hour demand creating more capacity. While passengers welcome cheaper travel, experts are divided on the broader implications, with some warning of potential overcrowding on busy routes or overall price increases to compensate for lost revenue. The UK government has indicated a desire to reform England's complex fare system as it moves toward nationalizing rail services.</p>

          <p>A recent trade truce between the European Union and the United States is under threat after President Trump warned of new tariffs targeting Europe's digital services taxes and technology regulations. The Trump administration argues that EU policies, such as the Digital Services Act, unfairly discriminate against American tech giants like Google and Amazon. This renewed tension has caught EU policymakers off guard, forcing them to consider response strategies, including the potential use of a new Anti-Coercion Instrument. The dispute highlights the ongoing friction between U.S. commercial interests and the EU's push for greater regulatory sovereignty in the digital sphere.</p>

His new single, "Slow & Easy," reunites him with the Dirty Heads, with whom he first found success on the 2010 hit "Lay Me Down."

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority by using emergency powers to impose sweeping tariffs on most of the country's trading partners. The court found that the president's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to justify the duties was not intended by Congress to grant unlimited tariff authority. However, the ruling will not take immediate effect, giving the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court. The decision represents a significant legal challenge to one of the president's core economic policies and could impact future trade negotiations.</p>

Of the injured, 18 are children, with several reported to be in critical condition. The attack, which occurred at the beginning of the school year, is being investigated by the FBI as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that the Trump administration's stringent immigration enforcement policies could significantly harm California's $4 trillion economy, which relies heavily on immigrant labor. Key sectors such as agriculture, construction, and hospitality are particularly vulnerable.

Proponents of the policies argue that they create jobs for U.S. citizens, but industry leaders warn of severe worker shortages in essential roles that American-born workers are often unwilling to fill.</p>
