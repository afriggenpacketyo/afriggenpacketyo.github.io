          <p>Following the assassination of founder Charlie Kirk, Turning Point USA has reported a massive surge in interest for new campus chapters. A spokesperson for the conservative youth organization stated they received over 32,000 inquiries within 48 hours, a dramatic increase compared to their existing chapter count. This response is being interpreted by supporters as a galvanizing moment for the movement, suggesting Kirk's vision will expand much faster than anticipated. The organization vows to continue its mission, viewing the surge as a pivotal moment in its history.</p>

The British company stated that JD.com sought to proceed only on "materially revised" terms, which were not in the best interest of Sainsbury's shareholders. Despite the termination of the deal, Sainsbury's reaffirmed its financial outlook, maintaining its projection to deliver around £1 billion in underlying operating profit for the 2025-2026 fiscal year.</p>

While authorities have not confirmed a direct motive, they are exploring how the suspect may have been radicalized through "dark places of the internet." Investigators are gathering information from the suspect's friends and family, as he is reportedly not cooperating with the investigation.

He is the first Jamaican man to secure a global 100m title since Usain Bolt's last victory nine years ago, a win celebrated by Bolt himself in the stands. Seville, who trains with Bolt's former coach, delivered a personal best time of 9.77 seconds to lead a Jamaican one-two finish. This victory fulfills long-held expectations and signals a potential new era of dominance for Jamaica in men's sprinting.</p>

          <p>The suspect accused of assassinating conservative activist Charlie Kirk, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, has been booked on an aggravated murder charge in Utah. This charge, under Utah law, could potentially carry the death penalty. Robinson also faces charges of obstruction of justice and felony discharge of a firearm. According to officials, Robinson is not cooperating with investigators, who are still working to determine a motive for what they describe as a targeted attack. Formal charges are expected to be filed by Tuesday, with the Department of Justice also anticipated to file separate federal charges.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, University of Chicago professor Robert Pape described the U.S. as being in a "watershed moment" of "violent populism," characterized by a rising tide of political violence from both the right and the left. Pape cited his research showing increased support among Americans for using force to achieve political goals, linking this trend to major social and demographic shifts. He argued that the nation's transition to a white-minority democracy is a root cause of the current radicalization, with the internet acting as an accelerant. Pape urged political leaders to condemn violence collectively to de-escalate the situation.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has maintained its perfect start to the Premier League season by securing four consecutive wins, all decided by goals scored in the final minutes of the matches.

The most recent example came against Burnley, where a Mohamed Salah penalty in the final seconds of stoppage time secured a 1-0 win. This resilience demonstrates the team's strong mentality and is creating a psychological advantage, as opponents now anticipate Liverpool's capacity to score until the final whistle.</p>

Financial institutions are also concerned because BNPL usage is often not reported to credit bureaus, creating what one expert calls a "giant black hole" in a consumer's credit profile.

          <p>In a bipartisan appearance, Senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and James Lankford (R-OK) both identified the internet and social media as major contributors to the rise of political extremism in the United States. Speaking after the assassination of Charlie Kirk, they argued that online algorithms push users toward the most extreme and angry content, accelerating division and radicalization. Senator Coons called the internet an "accelerant" that is driving the country apart, while Senator Lankford noted that civil discourse is often drowned out by online vitriol. Both senators advocated for legislative action, such as the Kids Online Safety Act, to mitigate some of the harms caused by online platforms.</p>

          <p>American sprinter Melissa Jefferson-Wooden has won her first world title in the women's 100m with a dominant performance at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo. The 24-year-old clocked a time of 10.61 seconds, a new championship record that also makes her the fourth-fastest woman in history. Her victory concludes a remarkable season in which she has significantly improved her personal best after an injury-affected 2024.

          <h2>Historian Jon Meacham Analyzes Historical Context of Current Political Violence in America</h2>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jon Meacham has described the current state of American democracy as a "dangerous place," linking the recent rise in political violence to historical periods of existential tension. He argues that violence erupts when there is no common agreement on fundamental questions of national identity, such as who is included in "We the people." Meacham asserts that the assassination of Charlie Kirk is a symptom of a broader debate over not just the means, but the very purpose of politics. He urges leaders to draw lessons from history, reminding citizens that the nation's covenant is based on peaceful contention, not violent conflict.</p>

          <p>Following a large protest in London organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has declared that the British flag will not be surrendered to those who use it as a symbol of division and fear. The "Unite the Kingdom" march drew over 150,000 people and resulted in clashes with a smaller counter-protest, leading to 26 police injuries and 24 arrests. Starmer emphasized that the flag represents the nation's diversity and tolerance, and that intimidation on British streets will not be accepted. The event also drew criticism after tech billionaire Elon Musk addressed the crowd via video link.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece argues that the American culture of tipping has become excessive and that the government's new "no tax on tips" law will only exacerbate the issue. The author contends that instead of creating complex and temporary tax deductions for tipped workers, the focus should be on ensuring employers pay a living wage. The article criticizes the list of eligible workers for the tax benefit, questioning why some professions are included while essential workers like teachers are not. Ultimately, the author advocates for abolishing tipping altogether, aligning the U.S. with practices in many other parts of the world.</p>

          <p>A local official in Johnson County, Iowa, is defying a directive from the state's Republican governor to fly flags at half-staff in honor of the assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Jon Green, the Democratic chair of the county's board of supervisors, stated that while he condemns the killing, he will not bestow honors upon a man whose rhetoric he believes was divisive and harmful to marginalized communities. Green's decision has drawn criticism from Governor Kim Reynolds but has been supported by another Democratic supervisor on the board. The act of defiance highlights the deep political divisions surrounding Kirk's legacy in the wake of his death.</p>
