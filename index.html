          <p>Vice President JD Vance suggested that the U.S. could withdraw support from Ukraine if peace talks with Russia stall, a statement that experts believe could encourage Russian President Vladimir Putin to obstruct progress in negotiations. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cautioned that the U.S. stepping aside would only benefit Russia. Experts suggest that a better approach would be to increase economic and military pressure on Russia if Putin rejects compromise. Vance's remarks came just before a high-stakes phone call between President Trump and Putin, underscoring Vance's influence on foreign policy, and he has previously clashed with Zelenskyy on the path forward. </p>

          <p>Ten inmates escaped from an Orleans Parish jail, sparking a massive manhunt involving over 200 law enforcement officers.

Surveillance footage captured the inmates fleeing the building and climbing a fence.

          <p>Texas lawmakers advanced a bill to clarify medical exceptions under the state's restrictive abortion law, bringing the proposal closer to becoming law. The bill specifies that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment and defines a "life-threatening" condition as one capable of causing death. While the changes do not expand abortion access or include exceptions for rape or incest, supporters say the bill aims to avoid confusion among doctors. The bill passed 129-6 and needs a final procedural vote before reaching the governor. </p>

Bouie suggests that the movement's vision is a reactionary one, obsessed with heavy industry and defense-oriented technology, while rejecting liberal universalism and ethical progress.

          <p>President Trump confronted South Africa‚Äôs president, Cyril Ramaphosa, about land seizures from white farmers, falsely accusing the government of systemic persecution. However, Trump himself has used eminent domain to take land for his border wall. In 2019, Trump told aides to ‚Äútake the land‚Äù to accelerate construction. His administration filed over 110 lawsuits against landowners in Texas. This highlights Trump's willingness to use government-sanctioned land grabs while criticizing similar actions overseas. </p>

          <p>Republicans are pressing for a House vote on a bill that would enact President Trump‚Äôs agenda, including tax cuts and increased military spending, financed by cuts to health, nutrition, education, and clean energy programs. Major portions of the package remain unresolved due to Republican divisions over Medicaid cuts and tax plan details. The bill faces opposition from both moderate and conservative Republicans, making its passage uncertain. If passed, the bill would cut taxes by roughly $3.8 trillion and cause 8.6 million more Americans to be uninsured. </p>
