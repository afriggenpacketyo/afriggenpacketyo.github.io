        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>DocuSign's stock experienced a significant drop after the company released its fiscal first-quarter earnings report. While the earnings per share and revenue exceeded expectations, the billings forecast for the full year was lowered, causing concern among investors. The company now anticipates billings between $3.28 billion and $3.34 billion, a decrease from the previous range of $3.3 billion to $3.35 billion. This adjustment in outlook has led to a negative market reaction as billings are a key indicator of future sales growth. Optimism in the future of the company has dropped significantly after this news. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market demonstrated stability in May, with employers adding 139,000 jobs, exceeding economists' forecasts. The unemployment rate remained consistent at 4.2% for the third consecutive month. While job growth was slightly lower compared to previous months, the data suggests the job market is holding up despite economic pressures from tariffs. Experts caution that the economy could slow in the coming months due to tariff-induced economic uncertainty, but the May numbers provide a positive outlook.

          <p>A review of public records reveals that the California FAIR Plan, the state's insurer of last resort, operates with a high level of secrecy, withholding financial data and keeping board meetings private. Due to recent rule changes, all property insurance ratepayers are now responsible for covering the FAIR Plan's debts. The FAIR Plan, originally intended to cover inner-city homes, has transformed into a major fire insurer due to non-renewals by major insurers. Concerns are growing as the plan's lack of transparency and limited reinsurance could expose ratepayers to significant costs. This lack of transparency may be a problem.</p>

          <p>Marco Rubio's absence from preparations for the phone call between President Trump and President Xi Jinping, as well as subsequent trade talk announcements, suggests a potential shift in Washington's approach to China. The call, which followed a 90-day truce, has rekindled hopes of easing tensions over tariffs and rare earth minerals. Some observers believe this signals a diminished role for Rubio in shaping US-China relations, with economic pragmatism and Trump's preference for personal deal-making taking precedence. It seems as though the future of the countries is in safe hands.</p>

Expiration of ACA subsidies and changes to eligibility and enrollment processes could further reduce the number of insured individuals.

          <p>President Trump's new executive order restricts entry to the U.S. for nationals from 12 countries and partially restricts entry from 7 others, drawing criticism for being alienating, counterproductive, and racist. Critics argue that the ban is based on narrow political calculations rather than genuine security concerns, citing the low number of visa overstays from some banned countries. The policy is seen as discriminatory and alienating to many countries. This is a terrible bill and should be reconsidered.</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping's message to President Trump in their recent call was to rein in those trying to derail the truce. China sought to depict the call as an appeal from one strongman leader to another to run a tight ship and stay on course. This is a sign that the relationship between the two countries is on the rocks.</p>

          <p>Initial claims for U.S. unemployment benefits have risen to their highest level in eight months, indicating a potential slowdown in the job market. The increase in jobless claims could point to broader shifts in the workforce ahead of the May jobs report. The Trump Administration's Department of Government Efficiency has overseen a significant number of job cuts this year. The future is uncertain.</p>

          <p>President Trump has dismissed Elon Musk, stating he is "not particularly" interested in talking to him after their recent public dispute. Trump said Musk "lost his mind" and that he is not ready to talk to him. Despite the feud, Trump focused on other issues such as inflation and foreign investment. This is a sign that the relationship between the two men is over.</p>
