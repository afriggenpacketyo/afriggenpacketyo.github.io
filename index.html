            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is under scrutiny for allegedly sharing details of a planned U.S. airstrike in Yemen via a second Signal chat group. Sources indicate the chat included his wife, brother, and personal attorney, raising concerns about the handling of sensitive military information. This incident follows previous reports of Hegseth sharing similar details on a separate Signal chat that inadvertently included a journalist, prompting criticism from Democratic senators who are calling for his resignation and an investigation into his conduct. The Pentagon's independent inspector general is evaluating Hegseth's use of the Signal app to determine if DoD policies were followed. Optimism score: 10</p>

            <p>China has cautioned nations against yielding to U.S. pressure in trade negotiations amidst ongoing tariff disputes. A Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson emphasized that appeasement would not secure peace and urged countries to uphold international trade rules. This warning comes in response to reports that the U.S. intends to leverage tariff negotiations to compel countries to restrict trade with China, as Trump has imposed hefty tariffs on Chinese imports. Japan doesn't want to choose between America and the People's Republic of China, but may have to.</p>

            <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has offered to repatriate 252 Venezuelan deportees imprisoned in his country in exchange for Venezuela releasing an equal number of political prisoners. Bukele addressed Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro on social media, suggesting a humanitarian agreement to swap the deportees, accused by the U.S. of gang membership, for political prisoners held by Venezuela. Maduro has condemned the U.S. deportations as "kidnapping" and "massive abuse" of human rights. The US Supreme Court has ordered Washington to pause the deportation of another group of alleged Venezuelan gang members.</p>

            <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has maintained its key lending rates steady, with the 1-year and 5-year Loan Prime Rates (LPR) remaining unchanged. This decision reflects the PBOC's focus on stabilizing the yuan amidst ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. The move comes after China reported better-than-expected economic data, including a 5.4% GDP growth in the first quarter, providing room for the central bank to keep rates consistent. Following the announcement, the Chinese yuan traded flat against the dollar, indicating market stability.</p>

            <p>Season 2 of The Last of Us deviates from the game's storytelling, particularly in depicting Joel's death, which is more graphic and drawn out. While Season 1 focused on building bonds in impossible circumstances, Season 2 explores the fracturing of those bonds and the cyclical nature of violence. The show's plot detours feel awkwardly inserted, and the unrelenting cheerlessness makes it a punishing watch, lacking the elegant insights of the first season. Subsequent episodes include glimmers of ingenuity, but the show's limited imagination becomes more glaring the longer it goes on.</p>

The jet, painted with Xiamen Airlines livery, was one of several waiting for final work and delivery at Boeing's Zhoushan completion center. Trump this month raised baseline tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, prompting China to impose a 125% tariff on U.S. goods, making the delivery of a new 737 MAX economically unviable for the Chinese airline. Confusion over changing tariffs could leave many aircraft deliveries in limbo.</p>

A marriage agency in Tokyo has facilitated over 300 such unions in the past decade. One couple, Satsuki and Minato, entered a friendship marriage after meeting online, prioritizing companionship and shared values over romantic or sexual attraction; Satsuki is attracted to women, while Minato is sexually attracted to men. Experts suggest this trend reflects the limited recognition of same-sex marriage and the societal pressure to conform to traditional family structures.</p>

            <p>Despite government initiatives to expand access to affordable childcare in England, many parents still face significant challenges in finding nursery places, particularly in deprived areas. The rollout of "free hours" has not been the panacea many had hoped for, with experts concerned about a widening gap between those eligible for funded hours and those missing out. Private nurseries are facing increased operating costs, and staffing shortages remain a problem. The government is doubling its spending on childcare, but the system is under strain, requiring the right staff and enough places to make it work effectively.</p>

            <p>Studies show men visit doctors less frequently than women, often delaying medical help until symptoms become severe, potentially impacting their health outcomes. Factors contributing to this include societal pressure to "tough it out," concerns about appearing weak, and appointment systems that don't accommodate working patterns. Women are more integrated into the healthcare system, organizing family healthcare and seeking appointments related to menstruation or pregnancy.
