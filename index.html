          <p>A Mexican Navy sailboat, the Cuauhtemoc, carrying 277 people, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge, leading to two deaths and 19 injuries, some critical, according to authorities. The incident occurred around 8:30 p.m. after the ship reportedly lost power and mechanical function, causing it to drift into the bridge pillar. Cellphone videos captured the collision, showing crew members dangling from the masts. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the crash, and preliminary findings suggest a mechanical issue with the sailboat. The bridge was temporarily closed but has since reopened after inspections revealed no structural damage.</p>

          <h2>Democratic Governors Propose Curbing Health Care for Unauthorized Immigrants</h2>

          <p>Democratic governors in states offering health insurance coverage to immigrants without legal status are proposing rollbacks due to budget constraints. California's Governor Newsom wants to freeze new enrollments and charge a monthly premium, while Minnesota's proposal involves stripping state health insurance coverage for adults without authorization. These actions come as Congress considers reducing state Medicaid funds for states offering such coverage. The governors face pushback from their own parties, who argue for finding budget cuts elsewhere. Experts note that providing regular care is more cost-effective than emergency room visits for the uninsured.</p>

          <p>Bryan Woolis, previously known as Brian Wallace, has been identified ten years after dying in a car crash in Walthamstow, London, thanks to the work of a South Yorkshire officer. Insp Nik Dodsworth took up the case after learning of Woolis's possible links to Sheffield and used old case files to find a partial DNA match. He then found the online obituary of Woolis's father, which led him to Woolis's sister. Locate International is now working to secure a new headstone for Woolis with the correct spelling of his name.</p>
