          <p>Relatives of those killed in the Air India Flight 171 crash are expressing their grief and demanding full accountability after a preliminary report was released. The granddaughter of one victim described the report as incomplete, stating she cannot find peace until the root cause is determined and those responsible are identified. The report found that the fuel supply to the Boeing 787's engines was cut off shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, leading to the crash that killed all 260 people on board. Families are calling for more transparency, including the release of cockpit audio recordings.</p>

          <p>Germany has progressed to the next round of Euro 2025, but a chaotic 4-3 loss to Sweden has exposed serious defensive vulnerabilities. After taking an early lead, the German defense collapsed, conceding three goals in rapid succession, including a penalty after a red card. Coach Christian Wück acknowledged the team's poor performance and the need to address these issues, which were also evident in earlier group stage matches. The team is now facing scrutiny over personnel choices and tactical setup ahead of the crucial knockout stages.</p>

          <p>A new book, "2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America," delves into the factors that led to Donald Trump's second term. The authors, sourcing from key political figures, argue that the outcome was not inevitable and was shaped by institutional failures and public frustration. The book chronicles the missteps of the Biden-Harris campaign, internal Democratic party conflicts, and how Trump's legal troubles paradoxically strengthened his support base. It presents a narrative of an election that has pushed the United States closer toward autocracy.</p>

          <p>An Avro Lancaster bomber, one of only two airworthy in the world, made a precautionary landing after experiencing an engine problem during a families' day event in Lincolnshire. The crew of the historic Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) aircraft diagnosed unusual engine behavior and safely returned to its base at RAF Coningsby. Black smoke was seen coming from one of the plane's four engines before it issued a general emergency alert. No one was injured, and the RAF has launched an investigation into the incident.</p>

          <p>FIFA President Gianni Infantino has stated that the 2026 World Cup will make greater use of indoor, air-conditioned stadiums for daytime games to address concerns about extreme heat. This comes after players described conditions at the current Club World Cup in the U.S. as "very dangerous." The plan is to schedule more matches in the four host cities with indoor venues—Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Vancouver—during the hottest parts of the day. Infantino also declared the revamped 32-team Club World Cup a major financial success for the organization.</p>

          <p>A rumored family vacation to Disneyland by Vice President JD Vance prompted a large, impromptu protest in Anaheim on Friday. The protest was fueled by anger over the administration's immigration policies, including recent ICE raids in nearby communities. Local officials expressed concern over the timing of the visit, given the current political climate. While the Vice President's office did not confirm the trip was for leisure, online footage later appeared to show Vance and his children inside the park, highlighting the intense political polarization surrounding the administration.</p>

          <p>A single mother in South Carolina, Nykia Hamilton, has drawn public attention after a viral video showed her running an entire Burger King restaurant by herself for over 12 hours. Hamilton described taking orders, cooking, cleaning, and managing the drive-thru alone, a situation she says happens frequently due to chronic understaffing. The story highlights the broader labor shortages and difficult working conditions faced by many in the fast-food industry. In response, Burger King stated that its policy requires more than one employee per shift and it is investigating the franchise location.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's renewed campaign of tariff threats against major U.S. trading partners, the stock market has remained resilient, with major indices near all-time highs. Analysts suggest that investors have become more accustomed to the president's negotiation tactics and are less prone to panic than they were during previous trade disputes. The market's focus appears to be on other factors, such as the potential for deregulation and the significant economic growth driven by advancements in artificial intelligence, which are seen as outweighing the immediate risks of the tariff rhetoric.

He is accused of overseeing vast cocaine shipments from Latin America to Europe and was wanted under an Interpol red notice. The capture was the result of a coordinated operation involving Colombian, Italian, and British authorities, along with Europol. Palermo is believed to be a key figure in controlling illegal drug trafficking routes, and his arrest is a significant blow to one of the world's most secretive criminal organizations.</p>

          <p>The Wahlburgers restaurant chain has closed 79 locations this year, but the company's CEO has clarified the context behind the numbers. The closures are primarily due to the end of a franchise agreement with the Hy-Vee grocery store chain, which involved small food court kiosks rather than full-service restaurants. CEO Randy Sharpe stated the move is about focusing on "quality, not quantity" and that the kiosks were not significant revenue drivers. The company is also refreshing its brand by updating its menu with new, summer-inspired items.</p>

Instead of addressing the families' concerns, Trump called the reporter an "evil person" for asking such a question and insisted that everyone involved had done an "incredible job." The exchange, which has since gone viral, is drawing criticism for its lack of empathy and for deflecting from questions about the effectiveness of the disaster response that could have potentially saved lives.</p>

          <p>Two fathers in England are launching a campaign for a judicial review of government guidance on smartphones in schools, aiming for a complete ban. They argue the current policy, which leaves the decision to headteachers, is unlawful and fails to protect children from harmful content, cyberbullying, and predators. The campaigners have sent a formal letter to the Education Secretary, signaling their intent to take legal action. The Department for Education responded that schools already have the power to ban phones and that the Online Safety Act provides additional protections.</p>
