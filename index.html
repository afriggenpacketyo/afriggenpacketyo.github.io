          <p>A devastating flash flood in Central Texas has resulted in at least 78 fatalities, with search and rescue operations transitioning to recovery efforts. Dozens of people remain missing, including a group of young girls and a counselor from Camp Mystic, a summer camp that was overwhelmed when the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in 45 minutes. The federal government has declared an emergency, but questions are being raised about the adequacy and timing of local warnings and the impact of federal budget cuts on weather forecasting services. The community is grappling with the immense loss and destruction.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the recurring issues plaguing England's Test cricket team under Ben Stokes, highlighting a pattern of brilliant victories followed by heavy defeats. The team's inconsistency, exemplified by a recent thrashing from India after a sensational win, prevents them from achieving sustained greatness. Key problems identified include the feast-or-famine form of batters like Ollie Pope and Zak Crawley, and the high economy rate of spinner Shoaib Bashir. Until these familiar issues are addressed, the team's progress toward becoming a top-ranked side remains stalled.</p>

          <p>Wimbledon organizers have issued an apology after its electronic line-calling system was mistakenly deactivated during a fourth-round match, leading to three missed calls in a single game. The error occurred during the match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal, with one particularly crucial missed call potentially costing Pavlyuchenkova the game. While the chair umpire did not overrule, Pavlyuchenkova ultimately won the match, but the incident has sparked debate about the role of umpires and the potential need for video reviews in tennis. The All England Club has reviewed its processes to prevent future human errors.</p>

          <p>India defeated England by a commanding 336 runs in the second Test at Edgbaston, leveling the five-match series at 1-1. Despite a resilient 88 from England's Jamie Smith, the host's batting lineup could not withstand India's superb bowling attack. Indian bowler Akash Deep was the star performer, taking six wickets in the second innings for a total of ten in the match, sealing a famous victory for the tourists. The result serves as a reality check for England and sets up a highly anticipated continuation of the series at Lord's.</p>

          <p>A federal jury has acquitted music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs of the most serious charges against him, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, which could have resulted in a life sentence. His defense team successfully argued that while Combs was a jealous and abusive partner, his actions did not constitute sex trafficking. Combs was, however, convicted on lesser prostitution-related charges and remains in custody pending sentencing. His lawyer stated that fellow inmates gave Combs a standing ovation upon his return to jail after the verdict was announced.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris claimed an emotional first home victory at a chaotic, rain-affected British Grand Prix. Norris inherited the lead after his teammate Oscar Piastri, who had led for much of the race, was handed a 10-second penalty for erratic driving during a safety-car restart. In a remarkable drive, Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg secured his first-ever F1 podium, finishing third after starting 19th on the grid. The dramatic race, held in front of a record crowd, narrows the gap in the drivers' championship and provides a memorable day for British motorsport.</p>

          <p>A senior officer in Hamas's security forces has reportedly stated that the group has lost approximately 80% of its control over the Gaza Strip. In voice messages shared with the BBC, the anonymous officer described a collapse of Hamas's command structure due to Israeli strikes, leading to a security vacuum being filled by armed clans and criminal gangs. The officer claimed that most of the group's leadership is dead and that its ability to govern or maintain order has disintegrated. This internal perspective suggests a significant weakening of Hamas's power amid the ongoing conflict with Israel.</p>

          <p>On the second anniversary of a tragic crash at a Wimbledon school, the parents of the two eight-year-old girls killed say they are still waiting for answers. Nuria Sajjad and Selena Lau died when a Land Rover crashed into an end-of-term tea party at The Study Preparatory School in July 2023. While the driver was initially not charged after reportedly suffering an epileptic seizure, the police investigation was reopened in January on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. At a memorial event, the grieving families expressed their commitment to uncovering the truth and holding someone accountable for the loss of their daughters.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has deported eight men, who had served prison sentences for crimes including murder and sexual assault, to South Sudan after a contentious legal battle. Only one of the men is a South Sudanese national; the others are from countries that reportedly refused to accept them. The deportation proceeded after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court's ruling that would have granted the men due process hearings. The move is part of a broader Trump administration effort to expand deportations to third-party countries, a policy that raises concerns given the instability and danger in destinations like South Sudan.</p>
