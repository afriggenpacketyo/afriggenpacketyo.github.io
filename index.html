          <p>Thousands gathered in Tehran for a state funeral commemorating dozens of senior military officials, journalists, and a nuclear scientist killed in recent Israeli attacks. Among the approximately 60 individuals honored were top commanders from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), including Chief of Staff Mohammed Bagheri and Commander-in-Chief Hossein Salami. The ceremony was attended by Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and other senior government figures. The strikes, which Israel claims were aimed at preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear threat, have significantly escalated tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has indicated that Tehran is prepared to resume nuclear talks with the United States, contingent on a change in tone from Washington. Araghchi called on U.S. President Donald Trump to adopt a more respectful approach towards Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, suggesting that goodwill and respect are prerequisites for productive dialogue. This development follows a period of stalled negotiations, which were interrupted by Israeli and U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities amid claims that Tehran is pursuing nuclear weapons under the guise of a civilian program.</p>

          <p>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has issued an urgent call for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, describing the humanitarian situation as having reached "horrific proportions." He highlighted the severe scarcity of food aid and essential supplies, which is putting the lives of newborns at extreme risk. While acknowledging the recent Israel-Iran truce as a positive development, Guterres condemned the killing of civilians at aid distribution points within Gaza. His appeal underscores the dire need for a cessation of hostilities to allow for critical humanitarian assistance to reach the beleaguered population.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has affirmed that the U.S. would "absolutely" consider ordering further military strikes on Iran if intelligence suggests Tehran is still capable of enriching uranium to weapons-grade levels. Following recent U.S. and Israeli attacks, Trump also stated his support for international inspections of Iran's nuclear sites by the IAEA or another respected body. This comes as Iran's parliament voted to suspend cooperation with the IAEA, accusing it of failing to condemn the strikes. The situation highlights the deep distrust and ongoing tensions surrounding Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p>

          <p>The Iran-backed Houthi militia in Yemen has claimed responsibility for launching a ballistic missile targeting what it described as a "sensitive Israeli site" in Beersheba, southern Israel. The group stated the attack was a response to Israel's ongoing military offensive in Gaza and an act of support for the Palestinian people. Shortly before the Houthi announcement, the Israeli military reported that its air defense systems had likely intercepted a surface-to-surface missile approaching from the Red Sea area. This incident is the latest in a series of Houthi attacks on Israeli and Red Sea targets since the Gaza war began.</p>

          <p>Qatari mediators, alongside officials from Washington and Cairo, are actively working to broker a new truce between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. A spokesperson for Qatar's foreign ministry stated that the recent ceasefire between Iran and Israel has created a "window of opportunity" and momentum for restarting negotiations. The diplomatic push aims to leverage this new dynamic, with hopes that pressure from the United States could be instrumental in achieving a breakthrough.

          <p>The head of the UN's nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has stated that Iran retains the capacity to restart uranium enrichment for a potential bomb within "a matter of months." He clarified that recent U.S. and Israeli strikes caused severe but not total damage to Iran's nuclear facilities, contradicting claims that the program was completely destroyed. This assessment suggests that Iran's industrial and technological capabilities remain largely intact, allowing for a potential resumption of nuclear activities if desired. The situation remains tense as Iran has suspended cooperation with the IAEA, while diplomatic solutions are still being sought.</p>

The defense conceded that Woodward killed Bernstein but argued it was not premeditated. After a six-year legal process, the verdict brings a form of justice for Bernstein's family, who have since founded a kindness movement called "BlazeItForward" to counter the hate that led to their son's death.</p>

          <p>The French state has led a significant investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, aiming to establish a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. This move, which makes the French state the largest shareholder, is part of a broader push for Europe's technological sovereignty in the space sector. However, experts are skeptical about Eutelsat's ability to challenge Starlink's dominance in the near future, citing the massive disparity in satellite constellation size, manufacturing capacity, and launch access. Eutelsat's OneWeb arm operates 650 satellites, compared to Starlink's more than 7,600. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a turbulent first six months marked by trade disputes and geopolitical shocks, global markets are bracing for continued uncertainty in the second half of the year. Analysts note that political events are heavily influencing market behavior, with the VIX volatility index spiking earlier in the year. This week, attention will shift to monetary policy as central bankers convene at the ECB Forum in Portugal. With ongoing pressure on the U.S. Federal Reserve and concerns about a worsening macroeconomic backdrop, experts from firms like Goldman Sachs anticipate higher equity volatility in the coming months.

          <p>Quemoy, an island group administered by Taipei but located less than 10 kilometers from mainland China, serves as a unique case study in the cross-strait relationship. Once a heavily militarized front line, the island has transformed into a quiet community caught between two political systems. Despite its strategic location, on-the-ground observations reveal the limitations of influence from both Beijing and Taipei. While Taipei once promoted it as a model of its governance, and still views it as a deterrent, the island's unique position highlights the complex and often indirect nature of the ongoing geopolitical standoff.</p>

          <h2>Elon Musk Renews Criticism of Trump's Spending Bill, Warning of Job Losses</h2>

          <p>Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has reiterated his strong opposition to President Trump's major spending and tax cut bill, arguing it will "destroy millions of jobs." In a series of posts on X, Musk claimed the legislation provides handouts to past industries while harming future ones, calling it "political suicide for the Republican Party." This renews a recent conflict between Musk and the Trump administration, which he briefly served. Musk's public criticism adds another layer of complexity for Republican leaders as they struggle to unify their party to pass the bill. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of anti-government protesters rallied in Belgrade, Serbia, demanding an early election and an end to President Aleksandar Vucic's rule, leading to clashes with riot police. The student-led demonstrations, the largest in recent months, saw police use tear gas and stun grenades, resulting in dozens of arrests. President Vucic has accused the protesters of being part of a foreign plot to destabilize the country and has so far refused calls for a snap election. The protests began last December following a deadly building collapse, which demonstrators blame on government corruption.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters marched through Venice to oppose the lavish wedding celebrations of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez. Activists and residents argue that the extravagant event highlights the exploitation of the city, which already suffers from extreme overtourism, high housing costs, and environmental fragility. Demonstrators carried banners with slogans like "Kisses Yes, Bezos No," contrasting the billionaire's opulent party with the precarious conditions faced by local Venetians. Critics dismissed Bezos' recent donation to Venetian environmental groups as an attempt to appease anger over the controversial nuptials.</p>
