          <p>Cardiac arrests in U.S. workplaces are increasing, with over 10,000 incidents occurring annually, highlighting a critical gap in preparedness among both workers and employers. Unlike Damar Hamlin, who received immediate treatment during an NFL game, most workplaces lack adequate resources and training to address cardiac emergencies effectively. American Heart Association data reveals that 70% of Americans feel unable to act during such emergencies, contributing to a 90% fatality rate in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests where CPR is not immediately administered. The AHA, in collaboration with Hamlin, is working to improve survivability rates through increased awareness and training, noting a rise in bystander confidence to perform CPR since Hamlin's incident.</p>

          <p>Democratic Representative Gerry Connolly of Virginia has died at the age of 75 after battling esophageal cancer. Connolly, who served in Congress since 2008, was known for his advocacy on behalf of federal employees in his district and was the top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. He stepped down from his leadership role due to his cancer's return.

          <p>The Trump administration has requested an emergency injunction from the U.S. Supreme Court to halt proceedings in a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) case involving the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

The administration is claiming executive privilege, asserting that DOGE, as a presidential advisory board, is exempt from FOIA regulations.

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is planning to limit future COVID-19 shots to individuals over 65 or those with high-risk conditions, marking a significant shift in policy. This change would apply to updated versions of the vaccine, with FDA officials arguing that annual booster shots are not worth the risk for healthy individuals. The FDA plans to impose these restrictions unless vaccine makers conduct newer and lengthy placebo-controlled trials. Experts caution that lengthy trials may result in vaccines that are no longer effective against circulating variants, while others worry about barriers for those who want to protect vulnerable family members.</p>

          <p>The UK has revealed a "malicious cyber campaign" orchestrated by a Russian military unit targeting organizations providing foreign assistance to Ukraine. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), in collaboration with allies, identified GRU Unit 26165 (also known as Fancy Bear) as the perpetrator, targeting both public and private entities since 2022. The team used various hacking techniques to access networks, including internet-connected cameras at Ukrainian borders to monitor aid shipments.

          <p>A recent inflation surprise indicates that the economic outlook may be gloomier than previously thought, with the UK experiencing the highest inflation in a year, driven by rising energy and water bills. While pay rises are outpacing price increases for many workers, concerns remain about persistent price pressures in services like restaurant meals. Economists suggest that inflation could inch up further in the coming months before falling back, potentially limiting the Bank of England's ability to cut interest rates. Factors such as US trade policies and global commodity prices could influence future inflation trends, making it an uncertain and painful situation for households whose incomes are not keeping pace.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department, under the Trump administration, is ending investigations into the police departments of Louisville, Kentucky, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, reversing course on accountability measures initiated during the Biden administration. The decision includes dismissing lawsuits and retracting findings of unconstitutional violations. The Trump administration argues that the proposed consent decrees subjected the departments to overly broad terms and would have led to years of micromanagement. These investigations began following the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, leading to findings of civil rights violations by both departments.</p>

With limited overtaking opportunities, the race classification often remains unchanged from start to finish, leading to criticism from drivers.
