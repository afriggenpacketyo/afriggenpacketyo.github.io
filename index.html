          <p>The U.S. government recorded an unexpected budget surplus of $27 billion in June, a significant shift from the previous month's deficit. This positive turn was largely driven by a substantial 301% year-over-year increase in customs duties, following the implementation of new tariffs. Despite the monthly surplus, the fiscal year-to-date deficit remains at $1.34 trillion, with rising interest payments on the national debt continuing to be a major expense for the government.

          <p>The current season of "Love Island USA" is proving to be a cultural phenomenon, though it notably lacks genuine romantic connections, leading some to call it "Situationship Island." This article argues that the show serves as a portrait of Gen Z's dating habits, characterized by emotional guardedness, a lack of relationship experience, and anxiety about direct communication. The contestants' cautious and often surface-level interactions mirror a generation that grew up online and may be more familiar with performed romance than the real thing.</p>

          <p>Lord Ian Blair, who led London's Metropolitan Police as commissioner from 2005 to 2008, has passed away at the age of 72. His tenure was marked by significant events, most notably the 7/7 London bombings in 2005 and the subsequent mistaken shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes by police. Despite being cleared of personal wrongdoing in the shooting, the incident led to sustained pressure that culminated in his resignation in 2008 after losing the support of then-Mayor Boris Johnson.</p>

          <p>Missouri's Republican governor, Mike Kehoe, has signed a bill repealing a paid sick leave law that was approved by voters just eight months ago. The law, which also included inflation-linked minimum wage adjustments, was a top target for the state's largest business group, which argued it was a burdensome mandate. Workers' rights advocates, who had campaigned for years for the measure, called the repeal a "betrayal" to families who will again have to choose between their health and a paycheck.</p>

          <p>A new pilot project in England will allow GP surgeries to offer services like career coaching and exercise classes to help patients on sick leave return to the workforce more quickly. The initiative aims to reduce the number of "fit notes" that declare people unfit for work by providing a plan for recovery and re-entry. The government is funding the scheme to change the focus from what patients cannot do to how they can be supported, amid concerns over the 2.8 million people out of the workforce due to health conditions.</p>

          <p>Two women, one in her 90s and another in her 80s, have died after a car crashed into their care home following a police chase in Sunderland. A BMW, which had been reported stolen, smashed into Highcliffe Care Home at about 21:40 BST on Wednesday. The women died on Thursday after being moved to other care homes. Eight Highcliffe residents were taken to hospital. Two men, both 21, who were previously arrested in connection with the crash have been rearrested on suspicion of manslaughter. Northumbria Police said the BMW had been reported stolen from the Fenham area of Newcastle earlier that evening. The force said it would now consider whether the crash had contributed to the women's deaths. Following the police pursuit, a mandatory referral has been made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. Ch Supt Mark Hall said the force would continue to support the families of those who died. "This is an extremely sad development and all of our thoughts are with the family and loved ones of everyone affected," he said. The eight other residents injured in the crash at the care home were taken to hospital with injuries not thought to be life-threatening. All but one have since been discharged. Carol Wilson, whose husband was taken to another care home in County Durham, said she could not "believe her eyes" when she saw the damage. "The whole top floor has caved in," she said. One woman, who lives nearby, told the BBC her daughter heard a "huge bang" late in the evening. "I wasn't in at the time. It was awful to see the residents getting moved late last night," she said. Kaye Farish, who also lives nearby, described it as "devastating for the whole area because we all know someone who lives there or works there". She added: "It's a lovely home. My father-in-law used to go in for respite care, the staff are exceptional. My thoughts are with the families. It's heartbreaking." A spokesperson for Avery Healthcare, which manages the home in the north of the city, said: "We are deeply saddened by the incident at our home in Sunderland and our thoughts are with all those affected. "We are committed to supporting our residents, their families, and our dedicated staff during this incredibly difficult time. "We are immensely grateful for the compassion and professionalism our teams have shown and continue to show." Follow BBC Sunderland on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram. More on this story</p>

While they offer essential flexibility in an uncertain economy, savers should be aware that the best rates are typically found at online-only banks, which may be a drawback for those who prefer in-person banking.
