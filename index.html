          <p>Two reports commissioned by Harvard University detail pervasive antisemitism and anti-Muslim bias on campus.  The antisemitism report highlights incidents before and after the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, noting bias in certain academic programs. A separate report on anti-Muslim bias reveals widespread alienation among Muslim students, with many fearing repercussions for expressing their views.  Harvard's president apologized and outlined actions to combat bigotry, mirroring demands from the Trump administration's antisemitism task force.</p>

          <p>Miriam Haley, a former television production assistant, testified in Harvey Weinstein's retrial, detailing her alleged sexual assault by Weinstein nearly 20 years ago.  Her testimony is a key moment in the retrial, which follows the overturning of Weinstein's previous conviction.  Haley's account, shared publicly before the #MeToo movement, alleges Weinstein used his power to coerce women into sexual encounters.

          <p>The Trump administration dismissed scientists working on the National Climate Assessment, a comprehensive report on climate change's impact on the U.S.  This action threatens to curtail climate science and limit public access to crucial information on sea-level rise, extreme weather, and other climate-related issues.

          <p>The Pentagon held only one formal news briefing in the first 100 days of Trump's second term, despite promises of increased transparency. This contrasts sharply with the higher number of briefings held by the White House and State Department, as well as the Pentagon under the previous administration.  The limited briefings hinder public understanding of military operations, particularly the ongoing air campaign in Yemen, and raise concerns about accountability and trust in the Defense Department.</p>
