          <p>Donald Trump has stated he may obstruct the Washington Commanders' plan to build a new stadium unless the NFL team changes its name back to the Redskins. He made the demand on social media, also calling for the Cleveland Guardians to revert to their previous name, claiming widespread support from Indigenous people without evidence. The threat's legal standing is unclear, as Congress has already approved the land transfer for the stadium project, which is currently under consideration by the D.C. Council.</p>

          <p>Canada is experiencing a significant measles outbreak, with over 3,800 cases in 2025, placing it among the top 10 countries globally for outbreaks. The spread, particularly severe in Alberta and Ontario, is linked to low vaccination rates, fueled by misinformation that gained traction during the COVID-19 pandemic. While some clusters are within specific communities like Low German-speaking Mennonites, health officials note a broader trend of vaccine hesitancy across the country. Experts stress that increasing MMR vaccination rates is the only effective way to contain the highly contagious virus.</p>

          <p>Scott Turner, the current Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and a former player for the Washington Redskins, has publicly supported Donald Trump's call for the Washington Commanders to revert to their previous name. Turner, who played for the team in the 1990s, stated on social media that he was drafted by the Redskins, not the Commanders, and believes it's time to bring the name back. His endorsement adds another voice to the renewed controversy, although the current team owner has indicated no intention of changing the name again.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns over approaching tariff deadlines, this article argues that several positive factors are currently bolstering the stock market. These include strong corporate earnings, various tax relief measures in President Trump's proposed economic bill, and significant business investment in R&D and construction. The analysis also points to massive infrastructure needs for data centers and the electric grid, increased bank lending capacity, and a resurgence in the U.S. energy sector as reasons for optimism. These elements could fuel an economic boom, counteracting negative pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has warned that individuals retiring in 2050 are projected to be worse off than today's pensioners unless action is taken to increase retirement savings. To address this, the Department for Work and Pensions is reviving the Pensions Commission to find solutions, as nearly half of working-age adults are not contributing to a private pension. The analysis highlights significant disparities, with low earners, the self-employed, women, and certain ethnic groups being far less likely to save adequately for retirement. The commission will aim to build a national consensus on a new savings strategy.</p>

          <p>This article details how alcohol consumption, even in moderate amounts, increases the risk of developing oral cancer. Experts explain that alcohol is a classified carcinogen that damages cells and DNA, promotes chronic inflammation, and can lead to nutrient deficiencies by impairing the body's ability to absorb essential vitamins. The breakdown of alcohol produces acetaldehyde, a toxic chemical that further heightens the risk. To mitigate this, the article suggests reducing alcohol intake, quitting tobacco, maintaining good oral hygiene, and consuming a diet rich in fruits and vegetables.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals that public support for President Trump's deportation program has fallen, with a majority now believing it targets more than just dangerous criminals. This shift comes as seven in ten Americans say the administration is not doing enough to lower prices, which remains their top economic concern. The poll also indicates that most disapprove of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," viewing it as primarily benefiting the wealthy. These findings suggest a growing disconnect between the priorities of Trump's political base and the broader American public.</p>

Despite the significant setback, which analysts predicted could force his resignation, Ishiba has stated he has no plans to quit, citing the need to focus on trade negotiations. The election results reflect voter frustration over rising prices, a string of political scandals, and the looming threat of U.S. tariffs. The loss undermines the coalition's influence and could lead to political instability within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.</p>

The article argues that building major infrastructure on a "small, highly populated, property-owning, democratic island" creates unique challenges, as political compromises and addressing individual petitions dramatically drove up costs and altered the original design with numerous expensive tunnels.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to close the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development (ORD), the agency's main scientific research arm. The ORD provides the foundational science for regulations on a wide range of environmental hazards, from toxic chemicals to water pollution. The EPA states the move, part of a broader 23% staff reduction, will save money and allow it to add scientific experts directly to its program offices. Critics, however, condemn the decision as a "travesty" that will cripple the agency's ability to use the best available science to protect public health.</p>

          <p>Coldplay frontman Chris Martin humorously warned his audience in Wisconsin to "do your makeup now" before the band's "Jumbotron Song," where cameras feature crowd members on large screens. This follows a viral incident at a previous show where a man and woman, later identified as a tech CEO and his HR chief, were caught on camera cuddling and quickly separated, sparking affair allegations. The CEO has since resigned from his company, which launched an investigation into the matter. The incident has become a source of widespread internet memes and discussion.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Emphasizes Teaching "Self-Connection" as the Most Crucial Life Skill</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 families argues that the single most important skill to teach a child is "self-connection"—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and needs. The article explains that dismissing a child's feelings with phrases like "you're okay" can erode their self-trust over time, leading to anxiety and insecurity. To foster this skill, parents are advised to validate emotions, allow for age-appropriate choices, and model their own emotional regulation. This approach helps build resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence that protects long-term mental health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, discusses the precarious position of American companies operating in China. He notes that while an extension of the current tariff pause is almost certain, the diplomatic discussions between the two nations have been almost entirely focused on tariffs, ignoring broader business concerns. Stein suggests a potential path toward de-escalation could involve the U.S. reciprocating China's recent move to restrict fentanyl precursors by lowering some tariffs. The business community remains worried about the lack of progress on non-tariff barriers and other systemic issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died after a fatal accident involving an MRI machine on Long Island, New York. The man, who was reportedly wearing a 20-pound metal chain used for weight training, entered the MRI room without permission while the machine was active. The powerful magnetic field pulled him into the machine, causing a "medical episode" that led to his death a day later. The incident is under investigation and serves as a tragic reminder of the dangers posed by metal objects near MRI machines, which create extremely strong magnetic fields.</p>

The author points to the potential forced sale of the Chinese-owned Darwin Port as a key example of self-sabotage. While Chinese media focused on the positive aspects of the visit, the piece contends that such actions send a contradictory message to Chinese investors, making them question whether Australia is a reliable place for business.

Bass argued the subsequent deployment of the National Guard and Marines was an unnecessary misuse of taxpayer money.
