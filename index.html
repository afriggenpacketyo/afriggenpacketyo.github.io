            <h2>China Appoints New Trade Envoy Amid Tariff Tensions with the US</h2>

            <p>China has appointed Li Chenggang, a former WTO ambassador, as its new trade envoy amidst escalating trade tensions with the United States. This shift comes as Beijing expresses strong opposition to US tariff policies, which they view as a serious threat to the global economic order. While some experts suggest this move could signal a desire to break the impasse in trade negotiations, others believe it may simply be a routine promotion. Despite US levies, China's GDP grew by 5.4% in the first quarter, exceeding expectations, showcasing the resilience of the Chinese economy.</p>

            <p>ASML, a Dutch semiconductor equipment giant, experienced a 6% share drop after reporting lower-than-expected net bookings, a key indicator of order demand.

Detained migrants will be handed over to civilian law enforcement agencies, raising legal questions about the military's role in border security.</p>

            <p>The US Treasury market experienced an unusual sell-off amid market turmoil caused by President Trump's tariffs, leading to a surge in Treasury yields. With recession fears mounting, the sell-off raises questions about who was selling and why. China, a major foreign creditor, is suspected of weaponizing its Treasury holdings by selling them and converting the proceeds into Euros. Japan's life insurers are also flagged as potential sellers, while hedge funds and 'bond vigilantes' are also considered as possible contributors to the sell-off (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>Experts warn that electricity infrastructure and utility costs are undergoing structural changes due to AI-driven demand for data centers. Consumers in the US could face higher utility bills as the sector shifts costs, while residents in the UK may experience higher wholesale prices due to electricity market reforms favoring data centers harnessing renewable energy. Harvard Electricity Law Initiative suggests tighter oversight over special contracts or eliminating them, opting for existing tariff practices. Excessive development of energy infrastructure and zonal pricing could also affect utility prices (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>Conservationists are warning that some of the UK's rarest wildlife is being pushed closer to extinction due to intense grass fires. Endangered species like hen harriers and water voles are threatened as wildfires destroy their habitats. A record dry spell and high temperatures have contributed to the fires, which have burned a large area across the UK. Conservation charities are calling for government funding to restore peat bogs and better monitoring of controlled burns to protect wildlife and the environment.</p>

            <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Colorado Rockies on Jackie Robinson Day, improving their record on this commemorative day to 17-4. The victory was attributed to patient at-bats and outstanding defensive plays.

The team made several key defensive plays to strand runners and support spot starter Landon Knack.</p>

            <p>The European Union is engaging with China more actively, potentially as a result of President Trump’s strained relationship with Europe. Top-level visits, constructive video calls, and a repopulated diplomatic calendar indicate a shift. The EU is planning a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing and restarting negotiations to end a dispute over tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles. This uptick in bilateral relations raises questions about whether the EU is pivoting towards China.</p>

            <p>President Trump's defiance of a court order to facilitate the return of a deported Maryland resident has raised concerns about a potential constitutional crisis. The Supreme Court had ordered the administration to facilitate the return of Armando Abrego Garcia, but the administration has shown no intention of complying. Experts are divided on whether this constitutes a constitutional crisis, but some argue that it undermines the separation of powers and the rule of law. Democrats in Congress have expressed alarm, accusing Trump of authoritarian behavior.</p>

            <p>The Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) has issued a cease and desist order against Google for unfair trade practices related to search services on Android devices. The JFTC found that Google violated Japan's anti-monopoly law by requiring Android device manufacturers to prioritize its own search apps and services through licensing agreements. The company required manufacturers to preinstall and prominently feature Google Search and Chrome, and exclude rival search services as a condition of its advertising revenue-sharing model. This action aligns with similar crackdowns on tech firms in the UK and the US.</p>
