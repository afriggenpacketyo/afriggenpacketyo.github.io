          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed southeast of Bermuda, following Hurricane Erin. As of Saturday afternoon, Fernand was located about 405 miles south-southeast of Bermuda with sustained winds of 40 mph and moving north at 10 mph. The National Hurricane Center forecasts Fernand to remain over the open ocean, potentially strengthening into a hurricane by Monday before weakening on Tuesday. The NOAA predicts an above-normal hurricane season with 13 to 18 named storms this year. (not investment advice)</p>

Dowman came off the bench in the 64th minute, showcasing his talent and winning a penalty. Manager Mikel Arteta praised Dowman's maturity, hunger, and the academy's role in his development. Dowman's talent has been evident, having trained with the first team since he was 14 and played for England Under-17s, and he may see more opportunities due to injuries within the team.</p>

The EU is facing pressure to respond to the escalating situation, with some calling for a tougher stance toward President Aleksandar Vucic's government. The EU has called for de-escalation and investigation into the use of force. Strategic interests and economic ties between the EU and Serbia could influence Brussels' approach to the situation, with the EU offering economic incentives tied to reforms.</p>

          <p>Société Générale strategist Albert Edwards warns of a tech stock bubble amid high valuations, noting that the tech sector now makes up 37% of the total US market. Edwards highlights a falling free cash flow yield in the tech sector and rising long-term government bond yields. He argues that rising bond yields have historically weighed on stock valuations, and it's only a matter of time before that happens again. The ratio of 10-year Treasury yields to the market's dividend yield has climbed to dot-com era levels. (not investment advice)</p>
