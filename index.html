          <p>China is preparing for its 80th anniversary Victory Day parade, aiming to showcase the strength and unity of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) by 2027, a key goal for its military modernization. This significant display of military progress is, however, currently overshadowed by recent corruption allegations, including the removal of a former navy chief of staff for "serious violations." President Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized the determination to create a fighting force "capable of winning wars." The upcoming parade will feature the latest weapons and a new generation of commanders, offering crucial insights into the PLA's readiness and the impact of its internal challenges on its broader strategic ambitions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's drastic cuts to USAID have triggered a chaotic "fire sale" of U.S. government-purchased humanitarian aid, including essential items like mosquito nets, medical equipment, and textbooks. Typically, these leftover goods are methodically distributed to other projects or local partners, but now millions of dollars' worth of equipment is being auctioned at extreme losses or simply abandoned due to canceled projects and staff terminations. This unprecedented closeout, conducted with little guidance, risks taxpayer-funded assets going to waste or falling into the wrong hands. A recent study in The Lancet suggests this American pullback from humanitarian aid could lead to over 14 million additional deaths by 2030, highlighting severe global implications.</p>

CEO Todd McKinnon stated that economic conditions proved "much better than we thought," leading the company to raise its fiscal 2026 forecast. Despite some contract restructuring with U.S. government agencies, renewals across the federal sector remained strong, reflecting the critical nature of Okta's solutions. The company also announced the acquisition of Israeli startup Axiom Security and anticipates future growth from managing artificial intelligence agent identities and expanding software suite sales, signaling robust business momentum.

          <p>A 36-year-old Texas man, Bratton Dean Wilkinson, was arrested in Dallas for allegedly making bomb threats against an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility. Wilkinson reportedly approached security officers, displayed what he claimed was a "detonator" on his wrist, and asserted he had a bomb in his backpack, prompting a facility-wide shelter-in-place. This serious security incident occurs amidst a reported 1,000% increase in assaults against ICE officials since the beginning of the Trump administration, influencing how agents train and prepare for operations. Federal charges are now being considered against Wilkinson, highlighting escalating tensions surrounding immigration enforcement.</p>

This intervention, echoed by the White House's "Go woke, go broke" tweet, followed a stock drop after some conservatives criticized the new logo.

          <p>Democrats are expressing outrage over the potential deportation of alleged MS-13 gang member Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda, arguing it's not his home country and that he is being denied constitutional due process rights. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis temporarily blocked the deportation, ordering Garcia to remain detained in the U.S. pending a hearing. The Trump administration, however, asserts Garcia is a "criminal illegal alien" and a public safety threat, accusing Democrats of prioritizing a gang member over American citizens' safety. This high-profile case has become a significant flashpoint in the ongoing national debate over immigration policy, due process, and the weaponization of government.</p>

Trump cited allegations of mortgage fraud against Cook, who vehemently denies the claims and asserts the president lacks the authority to fire her, setting the stage for a significant legal challenge.

Currently, all four of Utah's U.S. House seats are held by Republicans.

          <p>Fire crews across California and Oregon are battling multiple wildfires, including the uncontained Garnet fire in central California and the stabilizing Flat fire in Oregon, which destroyed four homes. Forecasters warn of new fire risks from lightning strikes and erratic winds, intensifying the challenge for firefighters. The Pickett fire in northern California wine country remains 15% contained, having spared vineyards so far. This ongoing battle against blazes comes amidst a severe heatwave in the Western U.S., with one contract firefighter dying from a cardiac emergency in Montana, highlighting the extreme conditions and human toll.</p>

          <p>The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) has abruptly canceled its long-standing Creative Writing Fellowships program, which has provided crucial support to numerous acclaimed American authors since its inception in 1966. The cancellation, communicated to applicants via email, indicates a significant shift in the NEA's priorities to align with the Trump administration's focus. New areas for grants include Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic-serving institutions, the upcoming 250th anniversary of America's independence, houses of worship, and "AI competency."

          <p>The Met Police have charged 67 individuals, ranging in age from 21 to 83, for allegedly showing support for the proscribed group Palestine Action, under section 13 of the Terrorism Act. These charges stem from arrests made in central London in July, with hundreds more arrested since the group's proscription on July 5. Palestine Action is challenging the ban in High Court, arguing it infringes on free speech and acts as a gag on legitimate protest. The Home Secretary, however, defends the ban, citing the group's alleged responsibility for incidents leading to charges like violent disorder and aggravated burglary.</p>

          <p>Bill Pulte, a Trump donor and head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, is spearheading efforts to accuse President Trump's political adversaries of mortgage fraud, including Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and Senator Adam Schiff. Pulte's actions, which involve referring "potential" fraud claims to the Justice Department, are seen as politically motivated attacks. While Cook plans to sue over her dismissal, legal experts question the "for cause" standard for removing Fed officials, and the impartiality of investigations led by Trump appointees is under scrutiny, raising concerns about the weaponization of government agencies.</p>

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) directive, which terminated a general waiver for these checks, aims to ensure only "most qualified applicants" receive American citizenship.
