          <p>A former Israeli Defense Forces spokesperson, Lt. Col. (Ret.) Jonathan Conricus, believes Israel's recent airstrikes against Iran significantly damaged Tehran's regional deterrence.  He highlights the weakening of Hamas and Hezbollah as a result of the October 7th massacres and asserts that Iran is currently at its weakest militarily and politically. Conricus suggests that this could alter how other Middle Eastern nations respond to Iranian demands.  The article also discusses the international reaction to the strikes, with some countries expressing support for Israel's actions despite criticizing the operation itself.</p>
