          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle is preparing for its IPO, but unlike most tech IPOs, existing shareholders are selling more shares (60%) than the company itself (40%). This mirrors Facebook's 2012 IPO where 57% of shares were sold by stakeholders, which is unusual. While Circle is profitable and has substantial cash reserves, one likely reason for the high insider sales is that venture capital firms are seeking liquidity after a period of meager returns and a multiyear drought in IPOs.

The unemployment rate for workers aged 22-27 who recently graduated from college is approaching 6%, surpassing the national average of 4.2%. A slowdown in hiring in sectors like tech, coupled with a mismatch between the supply of graduates and business demand, is contributing to this trend.

          <p>Onosato was promoted to sumo's highest rank of yokozuna on Wednesday, achieving the honor after competing in just 13 professional tournaments, a record pace. The 24-year-old from Ishikawa Prefecture became the 75th yokozuna and the first Japanese-born grand champion since his stablemaster Nishonoseki, the former Kisenosato, in 2017. Onosato secured his promotion by winning the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament and has won four Emperor's Cups; he is set to forge a rivalry with Mongolian yokozuna Hoshoryu.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's actions against Harvard University have fostered a sense of unity on campus, despite recent divisions over the war in Gaza and free speech issues. The Department of Homeland Security barred Harvard from enrolling international students and froze billions in grants and contracts, which has been broadly condemned by students and faculty. Former political opponents have joined together to defend the university, viewing the administration's actions as extreme.</p>

          <p>The CDC will no longer recommend routine Covid shots for healthy children or healthy pregnant women, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., citing a lack of data to support shots for healthy children. The decision, a departure from previous guidance, was made by Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic, and not through the usual CDC process. Experts disagree on the need for annual vaccines, with some stressing the importance of protection against new variants and long Covid, while others highlight the mild nature of Covid for many children and the existing immunity from prior infections or vaccinations.</p>

This action is part of an escalating battle with Harvard, with the GSA recommending agencies "terminate for convenience each contract that it determines has failed to meet its standards." The administration accuses Harvard of engaging in discrimination and antisemitism as justification for the move; potential cuts would not affect hospitals affiliated with Harvard University.</p>
