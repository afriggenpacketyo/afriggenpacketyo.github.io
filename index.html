          <p>Catastrophic flooding and heavy rainfall in and around Beijing have led to the deaths of at least 34 people, with most fatalities occurring in the city's outlying districts. The storms have forced the evacuation of over 80,000 residents and caused widespread damage to infrastructure, including power lines and roads. Authorities released water from a major reservoir to manage the crisis as residents described the sudden and rapid rise of floodwaters. The event highlights the region's vulnerability to extreme weather, echoing severe floods from the previous year.</p>

          <p>The European Union is launching an ambitious initiative to build "gigawatt" AI factories, aiming to close the gap with the U.S. and China in artificial intelligence development. These facilities are designed as comprehensive ecosystems that combine computing power, data, and talent to industrialize the creation of AI models and applications. With an initial investment of 20 billion euros, the EU seeks to bolster its technological sovereignty and support its numerous AI startups, which have been hindered by limited computing capacity. However, challenges such as high energy costs and the need for massive private investment remain significant hurdles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India has become the leading exporter of smartphones to the U.S., overtaking China for the first time, according to a new report from Canalys. In the second quarter, smartphones assembled in India constituted 44% of U.S. imports, a dramatic increase from 13% the previous year, largely driven by Apple's strategic shift of its manufacturing supply chain. This move reflects a broader trend of global manufacturers diversifying away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties and tariffs. While this marks a significant milestone for India's manufacturing sector, Apple still relies on China for producing its premium models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singapore Airlines reported a significant 59% drop in its first-quarter net profit, leading to a sharp fall of over 8% in its stock price. The airline attributed the decline primarily to lower interest income and a share of losses from its associate company, Air India. Analysts note that Air India's deeper-than-expected losses, stemming from a complex restructuring and reputational issues, are a near-term drag on SIA's financials. While the carrier states that demand for air travel remains strong, it faces challenges from normalizing margins and a volatile operating environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a landmark ruling, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has been found guilty of witness tampering and bribery, marking a historic moment for the nation's justice system. The court determined that Uribe conspired to influence testimony from imprisoned former paramilitary members who had accused him of having ties to their groups. Uribe, a polarizing figure credited by some for stabilizing the country and criticized by others for human rights abuses, faces up to 12 years in prison and is expected to appeal.

This national scheme follows various local pilot programs aimed at encouraging larger families after the abolition of the one-child policy failed to reverse the trend.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has recalled his cabinet for an emergency meeting to discuss a new peace plan and humanitarian aid strategy for Gaza. This follows a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump and weekend calls with French and German leaders, signaling a coordinated European effort after U.S.-led peace talks stalled. The plan aims to provide immediate relief and establish a pathway toward a two-state solution. The move comes amid growing pressure from within Starmer's own party to immediately recognize a Palestinian state, a step he has framed as a matter of "when, not if."</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a formal misconduct complaint against U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg, escalating a conflict over the administration's deportation policies. The complaint alleges the judge made improper public comments criticizing the Trump administration's willingness to comply with court orders, thereby undermining judicial impartiality. The dispute centers on a case where Boasberg attempted to block deportation flights to a controversial prison in El Salvador, an order the administration allegedly ignored. This action represents a significant clash between the executive and judicial branches.</p>

          <p>School districts nationwide are facing a potential crisis in student mental health services due to the abrupt discontinuation of federal grants by the Trump administration. The Department of Education cited concerns that funds were used for diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, a claim disputed by grant recipients. In Connecticut, one program serving 31 districts may have to lay off all 19 of its mental health staffers, leaving thousands of students without support. The cuts exacerbate a pre-existing national shortage of school counselors, prompting 16 states to sue the administration.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old U.S. citizen has spoken out after video of his violent arrest by Border Patrol and Florida Highway Patrol agents gained widespread attention. The footage shows an officer telling the high school senior, Kenny Laynez, "You got no rights here," during the stop, which also involved the use of a Taser. The incident highlights concerns from advocacy groups about the expansion of state law enforcement's role in immigration crackdowns under a new Florida law. U.S. Customs and Border Protection stated the individuals resisted arrest but did not acknowledge that a U.S. citizen had been detained.</p>

          <p>A new trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union is sparking debate among economists about which side emerged as the winner. The agreement imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, a rate higher than historical averages but lower than the 30% President Trump had threatened. In return, the EU will face no new tariffs on its exports to the U.S. and has pledged to make significant investments. While the Trump administration touts benefits for U.S. manufacturers, some analysts argue the deal is unbalanced and could slightly reduce the EU's GDP. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's recent visit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland, though unconventional, provided significant diplomatic access and helped solidify their working relationship. The meeting involved a free-wheeling press engagement and a shared flight on Air Force One, allowing Starmer to engage the president directly on key issues like Gaza and immigration. While the optics of associating with Trump's unpredictable style carry risks, Downing Street views the face time as invaluable for influencing U.S. policy. The discussions appeared to align U.S. and UK perspectives on the need for urgent humanitarian action.</p>

Wingfield, a transfer who was expected to be a key starter, is challenging the NCAA's "Five-Year Rule," arguing his case is meritorious due to disruptions from the pandemic and a season-ending injury. The lawsuit claims the denial is anticompetitive and causes him irreparable harm by costing him a significant NIL opportunity.
