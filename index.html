          <p>Several British newspapers are covering a power outage that affected Spain and Portugal, impacting transportation, ATMs, and tourism; The Times reports on Labour's plans for a 'milkshake tax' to combat obesity, while The Sun focuses on the impact on British tourists in Benidorm. Metro uses a My Fair Lady reference to describe the cuts, and the i Paper highlights the 'rare weather event' as a cause. The Financial Times discusses the concerns about power networks' ability to meet added demand, and the Daily Telegraph blames net zero policies for the blackouts. The Daily Mail reports on potential strike action by nurses, teachers, and council staff due to Chancellor Rachel Reeves ruling out extra cash for public sector pay rises.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the unprecedented use of executive orders by President Donald Trump during his second term's first 100 days, noting a reliance on them more heavily than any president in the 21st century. The article discusses how these orders are reshaping US governance and domestic/foreign policy, echoing themes from Project 2025, a conservative manifesto, and how Trump's policies are often based on personal preference rather than established policy. It also explores the legal challenges to these orders, highlighting the roles of Congress, the courts, and future presidents in potentially overturning them, and how the peer-review process for draft orders might be circumvented.</p>

The bank's revenues also increased by 10% year-on-year, reaching 8.524 billion euros.

          <p>HSBC, Europe's largest lender, announced a share buyback of up to $3 billion after its first-quarter results exceeded expectations, driven by strong performance in its wealth business and corporate and institutional banking segment. The bank's profit before tax was $9.48 billion, surpassing estimates of $7.83 billion, while revenue reached $17.65 billion against expectations of $16.67 billion. Despite a year-on-year decline in profit and revenue, pre-tax profit soared compared to the previous quarter. The bank warned of heightened uncertainty in the macroeconomic climate due to protectionist trade policies affecting consumer and business sentiment.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew's company, Pitch@Palace Global, was administered for two years by a company controlled by Doug Barrowman, a controversial millionaire linked to PPE contracts during the Covid-19 pandemic. After Prince Andrew's Newsnight interview in 2019, legal ownership of Pitch@Palace Global was transferred to Knox House Trustees (UK), a firm controlled by Barrowman until 2023. Barrowman and his wife, Baroness Michelle Mone, faced scrutiny for their links to a company that won government contracts during the pandemic, and the National Crime Agency is now investigating suspected criminal offenses at the firm. Prince Andrew's finances and choice of business associates have been under intense scrutiny, especially after being cut off financially by King Charles.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal party has won Canada's federal election, with opposition leader Pierre Poilievre conceding defeat, though it's unclear if the Liberals will secure a majority. The election saw the New Democratic Party's support plummet, leading to their leader's resignation, as many of their supporters shifted to the Liberals due to concerns over US President Donald Trump's tariffs and comments about making Canada a US state. Carney called the election shortly after replacing Justin Trudeau to seek a strong mandate amid the general unpopularity of his party, and Trump's statements about Canada becoming the US' 51st state played a significant role during the campaign.</p>

          <p>Amazon has launched its first batch of internet satellites, named Project Kuiper, into orbit, joining the competition in the mega constellation market dominated by SpaceX's Starlink. The launch involved 27 satellites carried by a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket, with plans to eventually reach an altitude of nearly 400 miles. Amazon aims to deploy over 3,200 satellites to provide fast and affordable broadband service globally, challenging SpaceX's existing network of over 8,000 Starlink satellites. The new satellites include a mirror film to reduce reflected sunlight, addressing concerns from astronomers about satellite constellations interfering with observations.</p>

Despite an increase in the supply of rental homes, rents continue to rise, with Chippenham in Wiltshire and Stockport in Greater Manchester experiencing significant rent increases. Over the past five years, rent increases have outpaced wage growth, with rents jumping by 40% compared to a 31% increase in average earnings. While the overall rental market shows signs of cooling, tenant demand remains high compared to pre-pandemic levels, leading to an ongoing supply-demand imbalance.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article describes the atmosphere at a Reform U.K. rally in Birmingham, noting the party's growing popularity amid discontent with the Labour government. The article highlights the party's focus on local issues like garbage strikes and potholes, as well as its appeal to voters who feel left behind by mainstream politics. The rally featured Nigel Farage, who arrived on a digger, and the attendees expressed a sense of outrage and a desire to 'make Britain great again'. The article concludes that Reform U.K. is tapping into a yearning for change, but it lacks real answers to the country's problems.</p>

Trump has walked back on his initial comments, now stating his claim was an exaggeration to make a point. While the administration has initiated discussions with both Russia and Ukraine, progress has been limited, and the U.S. threatened to withdraw from negotiations without imminent compromise.

          <p>Tomoyuki Sugano pitched five shutout innings, allowing five hits and striking out eight, to earn his third win as the Baltimore Orioles defeated the New York Yankees 4-3. Sugano (3-1) navigated a bases-loaded jam in the first inning and showcased improved pitch sequencing. Ryan O'Hearn's three-run home run in the home half of the third inning provided the Orioles with a 4-0 lead. Sugano's 3.00 ERA is currently the best among Orioles starters.</p>

          <p>Shada Islam argues that the EU has the potential to become an important global actor and thrive in a multipolar world, but it must first shed its Eurocentric worldviews, complacent policymaking, and double standards. The EU's failure to condemn Israel's actions in Gaza, while advocating for human rights in Ukraine, has drawn criticism from the global south. Islam suggests that the EU must stop lecturing and start listening, re-evaluate its soft-power credentials, and address issues of racism, Islamophobia, antisemitism, and attacks on women's rights.</p>

          <p>China's military is rapidly deploying low-cost, AI-powered drones to gain an edge in modern warfare technology. A new micro drone, weighing less than a kilogram, is designed for use across infantry units, featuring a coaxial dual-rotor system capable of carrying up to twice its own weight. The drone is equipped with foldable rotors, modular payload bays, and an on-board neural processing unit for AI-powered targeting. The PLA Daily described this as a 'phased leap' in unmanned combat team technology, essential for defining future battlefield rules.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to announce measures to ease the impact of tariffs on imported cars and car parts, providing automakers more time to relocate production to the United States. Tariffs of 25 percent on imported vehicles and auto parts will remain, but they will be modified to avoid 'stacking' with other tariffs on materials like steel and aluminum. Automakers will also be reimbursed for some tariff costs on imported components, up to 3.75 percent of a new car's value in the first year, phased out over two years. Even with these changes, substantial tariffs will still raise prices for new and used cars and increase repair costs.</p>

Trump's actions frustrated many Canadians, leading to canceled U.S. vacations and a possible early vote.
