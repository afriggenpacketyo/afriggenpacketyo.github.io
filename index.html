          <p>A heat wave is predicted to impact the eastern United States, potentially bringing record-high temperatures over several days, with the National Weather Service calling it the first significant heat wave of the season. Temperatures are expected to rise 25-35 degrees above average in the Plains, with potential record highs in the Rockies and Plains on Friday and Saturday. The heat will then move into the mid-Atlantic and Northeast, lingering into the following week, while the National Weather Service warns of triple-digit heat indices and oppressive humidity in the Northeast. It is recommended to stay out of the sun, wear lightweight clothing, and stay hydrated to avoid heat-related illnesses.</p>

          <p>Despite a lack of concrete indications of a shift in Iran's willingness to negotiate, Trump administration officials are framing the president's two-week timeline as an opportunity for diplomacy. Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff and Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi have been in communication, though no meetings are planned. Administration officials cite heavy losses among Iran's senior leadership and nuclear policy experts as a reason for the breathing room. European diplomats are scheduled to meet with Araghchi in Geneva, although some U.S. officials express skepticism about the Europeans' track record in handling Iran.</p>

          <p>States are increasingly offering tax incentives to attract data centers, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in forfeited tax revenue, according to a CNBC analysis. These exemptions, which include sales tax breaks on equipment and power, benefit tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google. Watchdog groups argue that these incentives offer questionable tradeoffs, as data centers do not create many jobs and require immense amounts of electricity. While some states like Illinois and Washington disclose company-specific data center tax breaks, others, such as Virginia, do not provide detailed breakdowns. (not investment advice)</p>

Over 60 million Americans are expected to drive to their destinations, a 2.2% increase from 2024, while 5.84 million will fly, and 4.78 million will use other forms of transportation like cruises or trains.

          <p>Tokyo police and prosecutors have issued an apology to two men for their wrongful arrest and indictment in 2020 related to the suspected unauthorized export of sensitive equipment. The apology follows a Tokyo High Court ruling that ordered compensation for Masaaki Okawara, president of Ohkawara Kakohki Co., and Junji Shimada, a former director. The men were arrested and indicted on suspicion of exporting spray dryers capable of producing biological agents without authorization, but the indictment was later withdrawn. The police and prosecutors admitted to a failure to thoroughly investigate the case, which involved the export of spray-drying apparatus.</p>

          <p>Contrary to claims that Gen Z is becoming increasingly conservative, recent data suggest that the youth vote shift in the 2024 election was a temporary event rather than an ideological realignment. While young adults voted for Trump at a higher rate in 2024 compared to 2020, they have become less likely to identify as conservative. On specific issues, Gen Z generally holds more liberal views than previous generations, with increased support for legal status for undocumented immigrants, addressing the legacy of slavery, and legal abortion. A growing number of young people identify as independents, making their votes more likely to swing between elections.</p>

At a presentation in Manhattan, Machado's team emphasized the potential for 10% annual growth and $1.7 trillion in profits within 15 years, highlighting sectors like tourism, real estate, and fossil fuels. While not directly addressing the challenge of ousting the current regime, the message appears aimed at influencing the Trump administration by aligning democratic aspirations with economic interests.

The party's reluctance to raise taxes beyond the super-rich, combined with Biden-era inflation, has revealed the limits of deficit spending. Without addressing these challenges, Democrats may struggle to enact new welfare programs amid impending fiscal constraints and the exhaustion of Social Security's trust fund.</p>

          <p>A new PBS documentary, Caregiving, examines the historical context behind the lack of resources and support for family caregivers in the United States. The film traces the evolution of caregiving policies, from early 20th-century almshouses to the exclusion of domestic workers from Social Security benefits and Medicare's decision not to cover long-term care. It highlights the financial strain on caregivers, who spend thousands of dollars out of pocket each year and miss out on significant income, and explores the current efforts to bring caregiving back into the public conversation. The documentary seeks to understand why caregiving is largely a private matter rather than a public concern in the U.S.</p>

The Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, holds ultimate authority, while the President, Masoud Pezeshkian, manages day-to-day governance. The Guardian Council ensures legislation aligns with Islamic principles, and the Expediency Discernment Council mediates disputes. The Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), led by General Mohammad Pakpour, plays a significant military and economic role, and parliament drafts laws but is limited by the Guardian Council. Understanding these key figures and institutions is essential for navigating Iran's intricate power dynamics.</p>

          <p>U.S. asset management giant Apollo is reportedly set to provide a £4.5 billion ($6 billion) loan to the Hinkley Point C nuclear project in the UK. The deal, which would be among the largest private capital investments in a project of U.K. national interest, aims to address a shortfall in funding for the delayed and over-budget project. Apollo will provide an investment-grade, unsecured debt financing package for the project at an interest rate below 7%. Both Apollo and EDF, the majority owner of Hinkley Point, have declined to comment on the matter.</p>

          <p>Cathie Wood's Ark Invest recently purchased over 3 million shares of Archer Aviation, an eVTOL aircraft company, following a significant sell-off of the stock. The sell-off was triggered by Archer's disclosure of a securities purchase agreement to issue 85 million shares at $10, diluting shareholder value. However, Wood's purchase suggests confidence in Archer's strategic operations, including developing commercial capabilities for its Launch Edition program, its partnership as the official air taxi provider for the 2028 Olympics in LA, and the development of an AI-based aviation software platform. This move highlights Wood's continued interest in the potential of electric air taxis.</p>

Sales volumes dropped 2.7%, marking the largest monthly fall since December 2023, with food retailers reporting lower sales of alcohol and tobacco. The ONS attributed the weak performance to reduced purchases and consumers cutting back due to inflation, with separate figures showing government borrowing at the second-highest level for May since 1993.

It argues that even if Iran were developing nuclear weapons, military action would be unwise, as it could trigger further escalation and instability. The author contends that Israel's attacks on Iran aimed to preempt diplomacy and a potential deal that would have stabilized Iran's position in the Middle East. The analysis suggests that the U.S. should avoid joining Israel's fight and instead focus on de-escalation and its own national interests.</p>
