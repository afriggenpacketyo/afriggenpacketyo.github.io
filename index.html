          <h2>Diplomatic Efforts Underway to De-escalate Israel-Iran Conflict</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Diplomatic efforts are underway to de-escalate the conflict between Israel and Iran, with a two-week window set by President Trump for potential U.S. involvement. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European foreign ministers in Geneva, where discussions focused on Iran's nuclear program and the possibility of diplomatic solutions. While Iran expressed readiness to consider diplomacy, it emphasized that its defense capabilities are not negotiable. The U.S. has offered Iran a civilian nuclear program if it agrees not to enrich uranium on its soil, and several countries have offered to host direct or indirect talks between the U.S. and Iran; however, skepticism remains about Iran's willingness to negotiate in good faith, especially given ongoing Israeli airstrikes and cyber attacks which have paralyzed the banking system, making communication difficult. The ultimate decision rests with Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, whose approval is needed for any agreement. Optimism for a breakthrough remains low, but the talks are considered a start. </p>

          <p>Following discussions with European countries and the European Union in Geneva, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated Iran's support for continuing talks. However, Araghchi criticized the lack of condemnation for Israel's attacks on Iran and asserted that Iran will not negotiate while Israeli attacks continue. He emphasized that Iran's nuclear program is peaceful and under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Araghchi reiterated Iran's readiness to hold another meeting in the near future, signaling a willingness to engage in further diplomatic efforts to address regional tensions. </p>

Interim CEO Ron Sargent highlighted the company's efforts to cater to value-minded shoppers through simplified promotions, reduced prices on over 2,000 products, and emphasis on private-label brands.

          <p>A new analysis reveals that the Republican's One Big Beautiful Bill Act could lead to increased monthly payments for many federal student loan borrowers. Under the proposed "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), borrowers earning around $80,000 annually could face significantly higher payments compared to the Biden administration's SAVE plan. The RAP plan would also extend the repayment timeline to 30 years, potentially delaying major life milestones for borrowers. Critics argue that the plan could push more borrowers into default, as it may not provide affordable monthly payments for many individuals (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Jersey has ordered the release of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil from ICE detention, citing that he is not a threat to the community or a flight risk. Khalil, a green card holder, was detained by immigration agents in March, causing significant distress to his pregnant wife who gave birth in April. The judge determined that Khalil's detention was "highly unusual" and that there was an effort to punish him for his anti-Israel speech, referencing his leadership in student protests against Israel's war in Gaza in 2024. Despite the government's intention to appeal, the judge's decision is effective immediately, allowing Khalil to return home to his family. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with ICE in order to receive transportation funding. The ruling sided with 20 plaintiff states that argued the administration lacked the legal authority to tie transportation dollars to immigration enforcement. Judge McConnell stated that Congress did not authorize the Secretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on federal dollars appropriated for transportation purposes. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy criticized the ruling as "judicial activism" while California Attorney General Rob Bonta lauded the decision, accusing President Trump of coercing state and local governments into carrying out his immigration agenda. </p>

Putin also mentioned the possibility of capturing the northeastern Ukrainian city of Sumy, further escalating tensions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article humorously explores the trend of adding protein to nearly every type of food, from iced tea to peanut butter, driven by Americans' obsession with the nutrient. The author recounts their experience of consuming a protein-enriched dinner, highlighting the absurdity of the trend and questioning the necessity of such high protein intake for the average person. While protein is beneficial for muscle building and satiety, the article suggests that the food industry is exploiting the "healthy" association of protein to make products more appealing, even when it may not be necessary or even beneficial. The article questions whether protein-infused products are genuinely healthier or simply a marketing tactic. </p>
