          <p>Portuguese and German authorities have launched a new search for Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in Portugal in 2007.  The search, based on warrants from German prosecutors, focuses on 21 plots of land near Praia da Luz.  German investigators identified Christian BrÃ¼ckner as their prime suspect in 2020, and this search follows a previous one conducted two years ago. The investigation continues nearly two decades after Madeleine's disappearance.</p>
