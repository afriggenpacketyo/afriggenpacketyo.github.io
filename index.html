          <p>Elon Musk has reportedly voiced his frustrations with several recent actions by the Trump administration, according to sources familiar with the matter. These grievances extend beyond spending issues in the president's legislative agenda, including concerns over the reduction of electric vehicle tax credits, which Musk's company Tesla has publicly opposed, arguing it would jeopardize America's energy independence. Musk has also reportedly objected to the Trump administration's artificial intelligence deals with competitor OpenAI, as well as the withdrawal of Jared Isaacman's nomination as NASA administrator, a move that deeply disappointed Musk. The entrepreneur has also publicly criticized trade advisor Peter Navarro and attacked Trump's funding bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination." The White House and Musk's representatives have not commented on the matter. </p>

          <p>Authorities in Cologne, Germany, evacuated approximately 20,000 people from the city center as experts worked to defuse three unexploded bombs from World War II. The operation, one of the largest of its kind in the city since the war, required the closure of significant areas, including the old city, hotels, care homes, and bridges. The Cologne Cathedral was located just outside the evacuation zone, and Deutsche Bahn warned of train diversions and cancellations due to the operation. The bombs, manufactured in the US, were discovered earlier in the week, prompting the large-scale evacuation and defusal efforts. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Senate Republicans to advocate for the passage of his "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," facing opposition due to concerns about the national debt and Medicaid changes. The bill has also drawn criticism from Elon Musk, who labeled it an "abomination." Simultaneously, Trump's administration has implemented higher tariffs on steel and aluminum, doubling them from 25% to 50%, a move that took effect early Wednesday morning. This action signals the administration's continued commitment to its trade strategy despite potential repercussions for domestic prices on various goods. </p>

          <p>The German government, under its new conservative-led coalition, is exploring a simplified procedure for designating countries as safe origins to reduce asylum seeker numbers. The proposed policy would allow a country to be declared safe through a statutory order, eliminating the need for Bundesrat consent. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt views this as part of a larger set of national measures to implement an asylum turnaround. Opposition lawmakers and NGOs have criticized the draft, citing concerns about contradicting German law, while the announcement follows a court ruling deeming tightened border security illegal. </p>

The power to remove Sajet rests with Lonnie G. Bunch III, the secretary of the Smithsonian, who is accountable to the Smithsonianâ€™s Board of Regents.

          <p>Dana Chandler was convicted of the 2002 murders of her ex-husband, Mike Sisco, and his girlfriend, Karen Harkness, after three trials, representing herself in the third trial. The case involved a drawn-out and bitter divorce between Chandler and Sisco, with family members alleging that Chandler stalked Sisco and harbored resentment towards Harkness. Despite the lack of direct forensic evidence, prosecutors presented evidence of Chandler's obsession with Sisco and her changing alibis. The first trial resulted in a guilty verdict, which was later overturned due to prosecutorial misconduct, and the second trial ended in a deadlocked jury, before she was ultimately found guilty in the third trial. </p>

          <p>A coordinated nationwide crackdown on retail crime, involving over 100 jurisdictions and 30 retailers, resulted in hundreds of arrests across 28 states. The initiative, led by Illinois' Cook County regional organized crime task force, targeted organized retail crime, where groups of thieves work together to steal goods for profit. Retailers have reported significant increases in shoplifting incidents and associated dollar losses in recent years. The effort aims to deter such conduct through focused prosecution and serious consequences. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that significant mortgage rate relief is unlikely immediately after the Federal Reserve's June meeting, as mortgage rates are more closely tied to the 10-year Treasury yield than direct Fed policy changes. The consensus is that rates will likely remain in the mid-to-upper 6% range through mid-2025, irrespective of the Fed's actions. Despite elevated rates, some experts advise buying now if financially ready, citing less competition and potential for negotiating power. Refinancing remains an option if rates decrease later, and home prices are projected to continue rising. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>Andrey Kurkov's Kyiv mysteries, particularly "The Stolen Heart," explore the surprising ambivalence felt by people living under occupation, using crime fiction tropes to subtly undermine expectations. The protagonist, Samson Kolechko, seeks to maintain order regardless of the ruling ideology, reflecting the moral compromises made during times of upheaval. The novel draws parallels to Mikhail Bulgakov's "The White Guard," highlighting the tension between personal comfort and the barbarism of occupation. Ultimately, Kurkov's work emphasizes the unsustainable nature of neutrality and the eventual need to locate one's moral backbone in the face of oppression. </p>
