          <p>Five-time major champion Brooks Koepka withdrew from a LIV Golf event in Dallas after a notable display of frustration. Following a poor tee shot, Koepka struck his club on the ground and then hit a tee box marker into a group of spectators, though no one appeared to be injured. He left the competition after playing eight holes, citing an illness that he had been dealing with all week. The withdrawal occurred while he was six over par for the round.</p>

          <p>A Haaretz newspaper report, quoting anonymous Israeli soldiers, has alleged that military commanders ordered troops to fire on unarmed Palestinian civilians near food distribution sites in Gaza. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a strong denial, calling the report a "blood libel" and defending the IDF as the "most moral military in the world."

          <p>In a significant policy shift, Germany is planning to build Europe's largest military, driven by the war in Ukraine and concerns over a potential new Trump presidency. The German government intends to change its constitution to increase defense spending to 3.5% of its GDP, a move that was previously unthinkable. This historic rearmament will be financed through a special fund and a temporary suspension of the country's 'debt brake,' aiming to create a more robust armed forces without immediately cutting social programs.

          <p>Despite being a deep-red state that strongly supports Donald Trump, Kentucky has become a surprising hub of GOP opposition to the former president's agenda. The state's most powerful Republican lawmakers, including Senators Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, along with Representative Thomas Massie, frequently criticize and vote against Trump's key initiatives. This has created a unique and tense political dynamic within the state, angering many of Trump's loyal supporters who feel unrepresented by their own party's leaders.

          <p>A new play by Jake Brasch, "The Reservoir," which recently opened at the Geffen Playhouse, tackles themes of family dysfunction and addiction. The review finds that while the play has noble intentions and features some strong performances, it often relies on familiar sitcom-level humor and theatrical tropes. The protagonist, a young man struggling with alcoholism, interacts with his four eccentric grandparents, who serve as a chorus to his recovery journey. The critic suggests the play's writing and staging lack depth and nuance, making it a well-intentioned but flawed production.</p>

The piece specifically calls out Richard Grenell's recent comments, asserting that the movement's progress has always been driven by a broad coalition, not a narrow, heteronormative ideal.</p>

          <p>A suicide bomber targeted a military convoy in the North Waziristan district of northwestern Pakistan, killing at least 16 soldiers and injuring 29 other people, including civilians. A group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban, the Hafiz Gul Bahadur armed group, has claimed responsibility for the attack. The bombing, which involved an explosive-laden vehicle, also caused two nearby houses to collapse, injuring several children. This incident is part of a significant increase in violence in the regions of Pakistan bordering Afghanistan since the Taliban's return to power.</p>

          <p>This opinion column analyzes President Trump's recent on-camera use of an expletive when discussing the long-running conflict in the Middle East. The author argues that while the moment broke presidential norms, it came across as authentic and resonated with the frustration many people feel. Instead of scripted diplomatic language, the raw emotion was perceived by some as more honest and forceful. The piece suggests that in an era of political spin, such moments of unguarded, judicious swearing might help politicians appear more human and trustworthy to voters.</p>

          <p>The upcoming Fourth of July celebrations may be more expensive for Americans due to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports. The U.S. fireworks industry, which sources approximately 99% of its consumer products from China, has been hit with significant import taxes this year. Industry representatives warn that this will likely lead to higher prices and potential product shortages for consumers. With the nation's 250th birthday approaching in 2026, the industry is concerned that continued high tariffs could turn major celebratory displays into duds. (not investment advice)</p>
