          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 22:12:41 EDT</div>

          <p>President Trump has appointed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to serve as the interim administrator for NASA. This decision follows the withdrawal of the previous nominee, billionaire Jared Isaacman, whose nomination was pulled shortly before a scheduled Senate vote. The White House cited a review of Isaacman's past political donations and professional associations with Elon Musk's SpaceX as reasons for the change. Duffy's temporary appointment comes at a critical time for the space agency as it pursues ambitious goals, including returning astronauts to the moon and future missions to Mars.</p>

          <p>South Korea's central bank has decided to keep its policy rate unchanged at 2.5% as it evaluates the effectiveness of recent measures to cool down Seoul's overheating housing market. The Bank of Korea noted a significant acceleration in housing prices and household debt, prioritizing financial stability over immediate growth stimulation. This hold follows a rate cut in May, which occurred during a period of political uncertainty and trade pressures from the U.S. The central bank is now focused on managing risks associated with the housing sector and potential volatility in foreign exchange markets.

          <p>President Trump has confirmed that a 50% tariff on copper imports will be implemented on August 1, following a national security assessment. The administration emphasized copper's critical role in national defense, citing its use in semiconductors, military equipment, and advanced weapons systems. The announcement caused a significant spike in U.S. copper prices, creating a wide premium over global market rates. While the administration's goal is to reshore copper production, experts warn that building domestic capacity will take years and that consumers may face higher prices in the interim.

          <p>Recent U.S. tariff policies targeting transshipment are causing significant uncertainty for Chinese companies that have moved or are planning to move manufacturing operations to Southeast Asia. The ambiguity in how the U.S. will implement these high tariffs on goods routed through ASEAN countries has left many businesses in a state of limbo. This strategy places Southeast Asia, a major export market for China, directly in the middle of the U.S.-China trade conflict. As a result, many Chinese exporters are adopting a cautious approach, delaying investment and operational decisions until they receive clearer guidance from Washington.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will send additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to help the country defend itself against Russian aggression. The decision comes just days after the administration confirmed a temporary halt in some arms shipments, which was part of a broader review of military stockpiles. Trump stated that the new shipments are necessary because Ukraine is being "hit very hard" and emphasized his disapproval of Russian attacks on civilian areas. The move signals a complex and evolving U.S. policy as the administration navigates its relationships with both Ukraine and Russia while aiming to broker a peace deal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists and industry experts are warning that President Trump's new 50% tariff on copper imports could lead to higher prices for a wide range of consumer products. Copper is a critical component in electrical wiring, plumbing, appliances, electronics, and vehicles, meaning the cost increase will likely be passed on to consumers. While the administration argues the tariff is necessary to rebuild the domestic copper industry for national security, analysts note the U.S. heavily relies on imports, particularly from Chile and Canada. Ramping up domestic production is a long-term process, raising concerns about inflationary pressure on the economy in the near future.</p>

The suspended personnel include both supervisory and line-level agents. The review was initiated after the July 2024 shooting incident at a campaign rally, which resulted in the death of a firefighter and raised serious questions about the Secret Service's operational readiness.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to eliminate at least 2,145 positions at NASA as part of a broader effort to reduce the size of the federal government. According to documents obtained by Politico, the cuts will primarily target high-ranking employees with specialized skills and management experience, many in core mission areas like science and human space flight. This move has caused significant concern within the space industry and among former NASA officials, who warn that the loss of expertise and proposed budget cuts could cede U.S. leadership in space exploration to competitors like China.</p>

          <p>The European Union has expressed hope of finalizing an outline for a trade agreement with the United States within days, even as the Trump administration escalates its global trade war. President Trump recently announced new tariffs on Brazil and has threatened levies on several other nations, including EU members, with a new deadline of August 1. EU officials believe progress has been made toward a satisfactory conclusion, aiming to avoid the steep tariffs. The situation remains complex, however, as Trump's unpredictable trade strategy continues to create uncertainty for the global economy and key U.S. trading partners.</p>

          <p>A former Kerr County official and recordings of emergency radio traffic suggest there were delays in activating a critical emergency alert system as floodwaters rose rapidly on July 4. A firefighter's request to send a CodeRED alert to residents was met with a dispatcher's response that approval was needed from a supervisor. Many residents in the flood-ravaged area, where over 100 people died, reported never receiving any official local warning, though the National Weather Service did issue several alerts. The incident is raising serious questions about the effectiveness and protocols of the local emergency response system during the disaster.</p>

          <p>The United States has recorded 1,288 measles cases so far this year, marking the highest total in 33 years and surpassing the significant outbreak of 2019. Health officials attribute the resurgence of the nearly-eliminated virus to declining vaccination rates in some communities. The largest portion of this year's cases is linked to an outbreak in West Texas, which has resulted in the deaths of two children. While the CDC states the overall risk to the public is low, it emphasizes that communities with low MMR vaccination rates are highly vulnerable to outbreaks.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, clearing the way for the Trump administration to move forward with its plan for sweeping layoffs across the federal government. The high court's decision allows the administration to resume its efforts to reduce the size of the federal workforce, a key initiative led by the Department of Government Efficiency. A coalition of labor unions had sued to block the layoffs, arguing the president exceeded his authority. The Supreme Court's majority stated the government was likely to succeed on the merits of the case, though it expressed no view on the legality of specific agency plans.</p>

The 9,000 striking workers, including sanitation employees and 911 dispatchers, had walked off the job seeking higher wages. The new three-year contract reportedly includes 3% annual raises and a one-time bonus, a figure significantly lower than the union's initial demands. With the agreement in place, workers have returned to their jobs, and the city has begun the task of cleaning up the accumulated trash.</p>
