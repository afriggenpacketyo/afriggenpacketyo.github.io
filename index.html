          <p>At an event marking its 75th anniversary, Germany's Central Council of Jews called on the government to continue its "unconditional" support for Israel. Council president Josef Schuster urged Chancellor Friedrich Merz not to be dissuaded from this path. In his address, Merz reaffirmed Germany's commitment, stating that while criticism of the Israeli government must be possible, it should not serve as a pretext for antisemitism. He emphasized the importance of Jewish life to Germany's future and called for civil courage against all forms of discrimination.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock fell significantly after the company reported mixed fourth-quarter earnings and a disappointing forecast for the upcoming fiscal year. The report follows a tumultuous period for the restaurant chain, which faced intense customer backlash over a rebranding attempt that included a modernized logo. The company quickly reversed the rebrand after widespread criticism, but its financial outlook remains cautious, with an expected decline in same-store traffic. CEO Julie Masino stated the company is now focused on enhancing the guest experience and learning from the passionate customer feedback. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>ABC has taken "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air for an indefinite period following controversial comments from its host. During his monologue, Kimmel suggested the man accused of assassinating conservative activist Charlie Kirk was aligned with the MAGA movement, sparking significant backlash. The decision came after the FCC chairman suggested ABC's broadcast license could be at risk and major affiliate groups, including Nexstar, announced they would preempt the show. Disney, ABC's parent company, reportedly plans to discuss the matter with Kimmel before he returns to the air.</p>

          <p>The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has published a report strongly refuting the Trump administration's attempts to downplay the dangers of climate change. The report asserts that the evidence for human-caused global warming is "beyond scientific dispute" and reinforces the validity of the EPA's 2009 "endangerment finding," which the current administration is trying to revoke. This finding is the legal basis for regulating greenhouse gases from sources like vehicles and power plants. The scientific body warned that repealing it ignores strengthened evidence of climate threats and would be detrimental to public health.</p>

          <p>In her forthcoming book, "107 Days," Kamala Harris reveals that her first choice for a running mate in the 2024 election was Pete Buttigieg. However, she decided against selecting him, believing it was "too big of a risk" for a Black woman to run on a ticket with a gay man. Harris writes that while she considered Buttigieg an "ideal partner," she felt the combination would ask too much of the American electorate, a decision she and Buttigieg acknowledged with "mutual sadness." She ultimately chose Minnesota Governor Tim Walz for the ticket.</p>

The sheriff also clarified that Robinson's family, not a former police officer father as rumored online, was instrumental in convincing him to turn himself in.

          <p>A new study has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume a significant amount of alcohol through their diet of ripe, naturally fermenting fruit. Researchers measured the alcohol content in the fruits and calculated that the chimps' daily intake is equivalent to about 14 grams of ethanol, or nearly two standard cocktails for a human. This research provides direct chemical evidence supporting the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that the human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in the fruit-eating habits of our primate ancestors. The low, steady dose is not enough to intoxicate the animals.</p>

The report notes that child poverty in the state has more than doubled since 2021 and that poverty disproportionately affects people of color, renters, and children.

          <h2>Federal Reserve's Modest Interest Rate Cut Unlikely to Satisfy President Trump</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has implemented a 0.25% interest rate cut, a move intended to balance concerns about inflation with recent weak jobs reports. This modest reduction is unlikely to appease President Trump, who has been publicly pressuring the central bank for more aggressive cuts and has challenged its independence. The decision comes amid controversy over Trump's attempt to fire Fed board member Lisa Cook and the unusual appointment of Stephen Miran, who remains a member of the Trump administration. The article suggests the Fed is maintaining its independence for now, but Trump's pressure campaign is expected to continue. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Policymakers at the Bank of England are widely expected to hold the UK's main interest rate at 4% when they meet on Thursday. This follows a cut from 4.25% in August, which brought the rate to a two-year low. Analysts believe that with inflation still running at 3.8%, nearly double the official 2% target, the Bank will be hesitant to risk further price increases by cutting rates again. The decision reflects the ongoing challenge central banks face in balancing the need to control inflation without stifling economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's 0.25% interest rate cut, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors against making drastic portfolio changes based on the decision alone. He argued that major, long-term market themes, such as the strength of technology and AI sectors, remain unchanged by the central bank's widely expected move. Cramer suggested that the mixed market reaction indicates some investors were hoping for a more aggressive cut, but he believes the Fed's prudent approach is appropriate given ongoing inflation and a softening labor market. He asserted that investors should not trade based solely on statements from the Fed chair. (not investment advice)</p>

He noted that the pandemic, inflation, and entertainment industry strikes all took a toll, but a drastic drop in business following the January Palisades fire was the "nail in the coffin."
