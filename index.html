          <p>A mega-bill encompassing President Trump's legislative agenda is in jeopardy as several Republican hard-liners signaled their opposition to advancing the package out of the House Budget Committee. Concerns about the bill adding to the national debt are driving the opposition. House Speaker Mike Johnson is working to sway holdouts and unify his divided conference. The effort to pass the bill is a crucial test of Johnson's speakership.</p>

          <p>Cassie Ventura's cross-examination in the Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial delved into their relationship, drug use, and explicit texts. The jury saw text messages from the days leading up to the premiere of "The Perfect Match." The defense suggested Combs could have been suffering from drug withdrawal in the days before the sexual assault that was captured by hotel surveillance cameras. The defense also suggested it was Ventura who pushed the idea of a "freak off" before the movie premiere, pointing to one message in which Ventura told Combs, “Baby I want to f.o. so bad but I don’t want to f--- myself up. What am I to do?”</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Mexico dismissed trespassing charges against dozens of immigrants caught in a new military zone on the US-Mexico border. The judge ruled that the immigrants were unaware they were entering a military zone and therefore could not be charged with trespassing. They still face charges for crossing the border illegally. The so-called New Mexico national defense area was established in April along 180 miles of the border.</p>
