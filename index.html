          <h2>Satellite Imagery Indicates Damage to Iranian Nuclear Program After U.S. Strikes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Satellite imagery analysis suggests that while U.S. strikes have damaged Iran's nuclear program, it is not completely destroyed, according to independent experts. Jeffrey Lewis from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies notes that crucial elements, such as Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium, appear untouched. David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security concurs, emphasizing that significant amounts of enriched uranium may still exist in undisclosed locations. These assessments contrast with the Trump Administration's claims of obliterating Iran's nuclear ambitions following Operation Midnight Hammer, which involved strikes on key nuclear sites like Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. The strikes may have missed uranium stocks, as trucks were seen at key sites before the attack, possibly moving materials to prevent damage.</p>

Established in 2016, the AIIB aimed to supplement existing multilateral development banks in promoting sustainable development. Over the past 10 years, the AIIB has financed over US$60 billion in infrastructure, including support for healthcare systems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Jin acknowledges the massive funding gap for infrastructure needs in Asian countries, estimated at around three to four trillion US dollars per year, emphasizing that no single MDB can fill this gap alone. </p>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, American leaders urged Iran to pursue diplomacy rather than retaliation. President Trump, along with Vice President Vance and Secretary of Defense Hegseth, signaled that the U.S. is open to negotiations but prepared for further action if Iran retaliates. Vance clarified that the U.S. is targeting Iran's nuclear program, not engaging in a broader war or seeking regime change. Hegseth emphasized that the strikes were intentionally limited and aimed at destroying Iran's nuclear capabilities, offering Iran an opportunity to pursue peace.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites mark an unprecedented escalation, raising concerns about the potential for a broader conflict. Experts emphasize that Iran's response will be crucial, as any action it takes carries significant risks. Sanam Vakil from Chatham House notes that Khamenei's next moves will be critical for his survival and legacy. While Iran may seek to retaliate, it faces challenges due to weakened proxy networks and the risk of provoking a major U.S. response, highlighting the delicate balance between preserving its image and avoiding further conflict.</p>

          <p>The government is set to unveil a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at lowering energy costs for UK businesses. A new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to Â£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for over 7,000 manufacturing firms by exempting them from green levies. About 500 of the most energy-intensive firms will also have their network charges reduced, increasing their discount from 60% to 90% from 2026. The plan also includes measures to expedite the connection of new factories and projects to the energy grid and aims to support the creation of over one million new well-paid jobs over the next decade.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on China to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical trade route for crude oil. This appeal comes after Iran's foreign minister warned that the Islamic Republic reserves all options to defend its sovereignty following U.S. strikes on its nuclear sites. Closing the strait could have severe consequences for the global economy, as it facilitates the transit of approximately 20 million barrels of crude oil per day. Rubio stated that such a move would be "economic suicide" for Iran, as it would halt its own oil exports to China.</p>

          <p>The U.S. attack on Iran's nuclear facilities presents several potential escalation pathways, according to experts. These include the possibility of the U.S. needing to conduct further strikes to fully disable Iran's nuclear program, Iran retaliating against U.S. forces or international shipping, and the conflict escalating into a full-scale war for regime change. The Trump administration's approach, marked by limited understanding of the potential consequences, raises concerns about a quagmire similar to the 2003 Iraq War. The lack of clear planning and consideration of second-order effects could lead to unforeseen and tragic outcomes.</p>

          <p>The recent U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have raised concerns about potential Iranian retaliation, including the possibility of blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Hormuz, located between Oman and Iran, is a crucial trade route for millions of barrels of oil and petroleum products per day. Iran's control over the northern side of the strait makes it a vital oil "chokepoint," and any disruption could significantly impact global energy markets. The U.S. has pledged to uphold freedom of navigation in the strait, with the 5th Fleet stationed in Bahrain.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military conducted a carefully planned and executed attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, relying on deception and precision to achieve surprise. The operation, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, involved B-2 stealth bombers dropping 30,000-pound bombs on key underground uranium enrichment plants. A series of deceptive tactics, including decoy flights, were used to maintain secrecy. The attack, years in the making, aimed to deliver a knockout blow to Iran's nuclear program, with U.S. officials claiming it was a "precision strike" that "devastated the Iranian nuclear program."</p>

          <p>Following the US strikes on its nuclear sites, Iran has indicated that the US must "receive a response." The conflict has renewed focus on security in the Strait of Hormuz, with Iran reportedly considering blocking it. The Strait of Hormuz is a key waterway between Oman and Iran, connecting the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. It is described as the "world's most important oil transit chokepoint," with around 20 million barrels of crude, condensate, and fuels flowing through it daily. Experts believe Iran is unlikely to close it, and exporters have alternative options.</p>
