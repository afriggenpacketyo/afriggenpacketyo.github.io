          <p>Deutsche Bank reported a second-quarter net profit of €1.485 billion, significantly surpassing analyst expectations and marking a strong recovery from a loss in the same period last year. Despite mixed results in its investment banking unit and challenges from currency fluctuations, the bank's overall revenue remained steady at €7.8 billion. The positive earnings report, along with an improved capital ratio, has bolstered investor confidence, pushing the company's shares up by nearly 6% and signaling that the bank is on track to meet its full-year targets.

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed executive orders aimed at preventing the use of what he terms "woke AI" within the federal government, part of a new American AI Action Plan. The orders mandate that government-procured AI models must be neutral and nonpartisan, specifically avoiding ideologies like Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), which the administration claims can distort accuracy. The plan also seeks to remove regulatory hurdles to spur AI innovation and establish a program to promote the export of U.S. artificial intelligence technology abroad.</p>

A search and rescue helicopter later located the plane's burning fuselage on a mountainside approximately ten miles from its destination, with emergency services being deployed to the remote crash site.

          <p>China is experiencing an unusual oversupply problem in its waste-to-energy sector, where a massive build-out of incinerators has far outpaced the supply of municipal solid waste.

          <p>In a rare move towards direct fiscal support, China is planning to provide monthly subsidy coupons to its senior citizens to help cover the costs of elderly care. The program will issue electronic vouchers to disabled seniors, aiming to ease the financial strain on families, reduce precautionary savings, and stimulate domestic consumption in the care sector. This policy shift comes as Beijing faces mounting demographic pressures and seeks to bolster its social safety net to support its rapidly aging population. (not investment advice)</p>
