        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Democrat Zohran Mamdani has challenged President Trump to a debate in New York City after independent candidate Andrew Cuomo called for a series of debates in the mayoral race. Mamdani's challenge came after Cuomo challenged Mamdani to five debates across the boroughs. Mamdani proposed debating Trump directly, questioning his policies on SNAP benefits and tax cuts. Trump criticized Mamdani's politics and expressed a desire for a one-on-one race, while Cuomo insisted Mamdani fears a race against him. The mayoral race is a hot topic, with Adams and Sliwa dismissing calls to drop out and businessman John Catsimatidis predicting changes before the end of September. The optimism score reflects the uncertainty and political maneuvering in the race.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump finalized a trade deal with Japan, implementing 15% tariffs on most Japanese goods, including autos. Tokyo agreed to invest $550 billion in U.S.-selected projects and increase purchases of American agricultural products, commercial aircraft, and defense equipment. The deal includes Japan purchasing 100 Boeing planes, increasing U.S. rice imports by 75%, and buying $8 billion in agricultural products. The U.S. will apply a baseline 15% tariff on nearly all Japanese imports, with sector-specific levies for automobiles, aerospace products, pharmaceuticals, and natural resources. The finalizing of the deal comes as Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces political pressure, with reports suggesting key LDP members may resign. The optimism score reflects the economic implications and political uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has denounced a recent incident involving two Venezuelan military aircraft flying near a U.S. Navy vessel in international waters. According to the Defense Department, this action was a "highly provocative move" designed to interfere with U.S. counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism operations. The incident occurred after President Trump announced military action against suspected drug smugglers in the Caribbean. The Pentagon has strongly advised Venezuela against any further obstruction or interference with U.S. military operations. The Navy has recently deployed eight ships to the Caribbean and Pacific Ocean to support these operations, indicating a heightened U.S. military presence in the region. The optimism score is tempered by the potential for escalation.</p>

          <p>President Trump warned of "fairly substantial" tariffs on semiconductor imports from companies not shifting production to the U.S., while signaling exemptions for firms like Apple that expand domestic investments. Trump discussed the tariffs during a White House dinner with tech leaders, including Apple CEO Tim Cook and Meta's Mark Zuckerberg. He had previously mentioned a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports, with exemptions for companies moving manufacturing to the U.S. Apple had pledged to spend an additional $100 billion on domestic manufacturing, adding to a $500 billion announcement in February. The U.S. has been working to onshore its semiconductor supply chain, with companies like TSMC and Samsung committing billions to building plants in the U.S. The optimism score considers the potential economic impacts and incentives for domestic investment.</p>

The order will authorize Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to use "secondary titles," as the president cannot change the name without congressional approval. Trump has repeatedly insisted that the name change would project a more powerful image, deeming the current title too "defensive." The renaming "conveys a stronger message of readiness and resolve," the White House document said. The U.S. Department of Defense was called the War Department until 1947, when Congress consolidated the Army, Navy, and Air Force after World War Two. The optimism score reflects the potential implications of this symbolic shift in focus.</p>

          <p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett defended her stern words for Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in a recent opinion, stating they were appropriate. Speaking at the Lincoln Center in Manhattan, Barrett said she felt she "set the calibration right" in the majority opinion on universal injunctions. She explained that Justice Jackson had made an argument in strong terms that warranted a response, emphasizing that she has the "deepest respect for Jackson" and was not attacking her personally. Barrett stressed that she attacks ideas, not people, attributing the quote to the late Justice Antonin Scalia.

          <p>The Defense Department is considering authorizing up to 600 military attorneys to serve as temporary immigration judges, according to a defense official. This initiative aims to address the backlog of over 3.4 million cases in immigration courts. The Defense Department sent an email to military lawyers in the U.S. Army Reserve seeking 100 volunteers to serve as immigration judges for 179 days. The American Immigration Lawyers Association criticized the plan, stating that immigration law is complex and requires specialized expertise. The Trump administration loosened job requirements for temporary immigration judges last month, allowing a wider group of government lawyers to handle cases in immigration court. The optimism score is tempered by concerns about the fairness and expertise of temporary judges.</p>

The CBS News data team analyzed Powerball data to determine where winners take home the most and least after taxes. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery prizes, allowing winners to receive more after federal taxes. States with higher taxes, like New York, result in lower after-tax payouts. The odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 292.2 million, while the overall odds of winning a prize are 1 in 24.9. The optimism score is based on the potential for financial windfall, balanced by the low odds of winning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump's National Guard Deployment in Los Angeles Cost Taxpayers $120M, Newsom Says</h2>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom stated that President Trump’s deployment of the national guard in Los Angeles in response to protests over immigration raids cost taxpayers nearly $120 million. The US president sent 2,000 national guard troops into the city in June amid clashes between federal immigration agents and protesters. A judge ruled that dispatching the military to accompany authorities on immigration enforcement operations violated federal law. Newsom described the move as “waste, fraud and abuse”. The optimism score is low, reflecting the financial and societal costs of the deployment.</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed sanctions against three Palestinian human rights groups that asked the international criminal court to investigate Israel over allegations of genocide in Gaza. The groups asked the ICC in November 2023 to investigate Israeli air strikes, the siege of the territory, and the displacement of the population. The US sanctions come days after the world’s biggest academic association of genocide scholars passed a resolution saying the legal criteria had been met to establish Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.

          <p>Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora suggested that enterprises may not be comfortable with browsers run by agentic artificial intelligence.

          <p>A US federal appeals court upheld an injunction barring the US State Department from enforcing a policy directive from President Trump aimed to prevent transgender and nonbinary Americans from obtaining passports that accurately reflect their gender identities. The court said the government failed to meaningfully engage with the conclusion that Trump's policy reflected "unconstitutional animus toward transgender Americans." The American Civil Liberties Union sued, arguing that the policy unlawfully prevented transgender, nonbinary and intersex people from obtaining passports consistent with their gender identities.

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order on Friday authorizing the US Department of Defense to rebrand itself as the “department of war”. The order will designate “department of war” as a “secondary title”, as a way to get around the need for congressional approval. The order will instruct the rest of the executive branch to use the “department of war” name in internal and external communications. Trump and Hegseth have been publicly pushing for the rebrand for weeks, claiming the change would present the US military as more aggressive to the world.
