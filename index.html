          <p>The White House is refuting reports that President Trump's name appears in Justice Department documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, labeling the story as 'fake news.' The Wall Street Journal had reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi informed the president of this, while clarifying that an appearance in the files does not imply wrongdoing. This development comes amid ongoing pressure for the administration to release more information about the case and a federal judge's recent decision to deny the unsealing of grand jury transcripts from Epstein's Florida prosecution, citing secrecy rules.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched an "American AI Action Plan," which includes executive orders to prevent the use of "woke AI" by the federal government. The orders identify ideologies like Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) as potentially distorting AI outputs and mandate that government-procured models prioritize neutrality and accuracy. Additional orders aim to spur AI innovation by reducing regulations and establishing a program to promote the export of U.S. AI technology. These actions are part of a broader strategy to secure American leadership in the global AI race.</p>

          <p>Excluding the pandemic shutdown period, vehicle manufacturing in the United Kingdom for the first half of the year has fallen to its lowest level since 1953. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), car output dropped by 7.3%, while van production plummeted by 45%, largely due to a plant closure. The industry has been hampered by uncertainty over U.S. tariffs, though a recent deal may restore some confidence. The government hopes new electric vehicle grants will boost the sector, but the SMMT criticizes the new system for its lack of clarity.</p>

          <p>Tesla has announced plans to produce a more affordable vehicle model and seek approval for its self-driving software in Europe this year, following its sharpest sales decline in a decade. The company's profits and deliveries have shrunk, impacted by competition from Chinese automakers, cuts to U.S. electric vehicle subsidies, and public controversies involving CEO Elon Musk. The firm also reported a $300 million loss due to U.S. tariff policies in the last quarter. Musk emphasized that achieving full autonomy for its vehicles is the key to unlocking the company's future value.</p>

          <p>Nigerian artist John Madu is being celebrated in a new exhibition at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, titled "Van Gogh x John Madu: Paint Your Path." The self-taught artist created ten large paintings that infuse Vincent van Gogh's famous motifs with a modern, cosmopolitan West African sensibility. Madu, who was influenced by Van Gogh's work from a young age, sees parallels in their self-taught journeys and their shared inspiration from East Asian art. He identifies as a global citizen and aims to create art that transcends geographical labels, reflecting his vibrant Lagos upbringing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is experiencing an unusual oversupply problem in its waste-to-energy sector, with a surplus of incineration capacity and not enough municipal waste to burn. Since 2019, the country's incineration capacity has more than doubled, while the amount of solid waste generated has only increased by about 11%. This discrepancy has left an estimated 40% of the industry's capacity idle. Experts attribute the slower growth in waste production to factors such as a broader economic downturn and a deceleration in the rate of urbanization, creating a significant challenge for the optimistically planned industry.</p>

          <p>A wave of Chinese companies, including AI firm SenseTime and dairy producer Mengniu, are tapping into capital markets to raise funds for business development and refinancing. This surge in activity is driven by a marked improvement in investor sentiment during the second half of the year. SenseTime is set to raise capital through a new share subscription to support its AI research and expansion into new areas like robotics. Meanwhile, Mengniu plans to issue yuan-denominated bonds to refinance existing debt and fund green and social-responsibility projects, reflecting renewed confidence in the market.

          <p>A tragic incident in China's Inner Mongolia region has resulted in the deaths of six university students who drowned during a field trip. The students, from Northeastern University, were visiting a copper-molybdenum mine owned by China National Gold Group when a grating panel they were on gave way, causing them to fall into an industrial flotation tank. A teacher was also injured in the incident. According to state media, the victims were third-year students majoring in mineral processing engineering. They were pulled from the tank but could not be revived by emergency responders.</p>

          <p>Organizers are expecting significant protests across Scotland as Donald Trump begins a private five-day visit to his golf resorts in Ayrshire and Aberdeenshire. The Stop Trump Coalition is planning events in major cities, expressing what they call "widespread anger" at the U.S. president's policies, which they describe as increasingly extreme. While the trip is not formal, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is scheduled to hold talks with Trump in Scotland. Police Scotland anticipates the large-scale policing operation required for the visit will stretch their resources, though they do not expect disorder.</p>

          <p>After a decade-long legal battle, former city traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo have had their convictions for rigging the Libor interest rate quashed by the UK's Supreme Court. The ruling overturns one of the most high-profile prosecutions following the 2008 financial crisis and raises questions about potential compensation and the possibility of appeals from other convicted traders. The decision is expected to lead to calls for a public inquiry into how the rate-manipulation scandal was investigated, particularly the role of banks investigating themselves and pressure from government bodies.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship is unconstitutional, upholding a lower court's nationwide block on its enforcement. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that the order's interpretation, which would deny citizenship to many individuals born in the United States, violates the 14th Amendment. The ruling marks the first time an appellate court has weighed in on the matter, keeping the injunction in place and moving the issue closer to a potential review by the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>A growing mental health crisis among university students in the UK is prompting a debate over how much responsibility educational institutions should bear. Students report feeling let down by 'one-size-fits-all' support systems, while universities stress they are not a substitute for clinical NHS services. The number of students reporting mental health conditions has nearly quadrupled in a decade, creating immense pressure on academic tutors and support staff who are often not trained to handle complex cases. This situation raises fundamental questions about the duty of care universities owe to their students.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve, a move seen as a significant escalation of his public pressure campaign against its chairman, Jerome Powell. This will be the first official visit by a sitting president to the central bank in nearly two decades, challenging the traditional respect for its political independence. Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates and has even suggested he could fire him. The visit brings this long-standing criticism directly to the Fed's headquarters, symbolizing a direct confrontation over monetary policy.</p>

          <p>Amid a nationwide housing affordability crisis, several states are enacting laws to override local zoning rules and compel cities to permit more affordable and denser housing. This article focuses on Utah, where the state is intensifying efforts to enforce its housing mandates against 'Not In My Backyard' (NIMBY) opposition from local communities. Despite these top-down measures, the state's housing shortage continues to grow, pricing many residents out of their hometowns. The trend reflects a growing frustration with local governments' inability to address the housing supply shortage, a problem now affecting the middle class.</p>

Published in The Lancet, the research suggests this more achievable target may be more effective for public health than the widely-known but less evidence-based goal of 10,000 steps. The 10,000-step benchmark originated from a 1960s marketing campaign in Japan.
