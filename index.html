            <p>The Trump administration has frozen over $2 billion in federal funds for Harvard University after the elite college rejected a list of demands from the White House aimed at combating antisemitism and promoting American values. Harvard President Alan Garber stated that the university would not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights. The White House had sent a list of demands to Harvard last week which it said were designed to fight antisemitism on campus, including changes to its governance, hiring practices and admissions procedures. The Department of Education stated that Harvard's rejection reinforced a troubling entitlement mindset and that elite universities must take antisemitism seriously to continue receiving taxpayer support.</p>

Mahdawi's lawyers have filed a petition in court claiming his detention violates the First Amendment, as he has been a U.S. lawful permanent resident for the last decade and completed a philosophy program at Columbia late last year.</p>

            <p>A federal funding freeze by the Trump administration has halted key infrastructure projects in tribal communities across the country, impacting over 22 tribes and nonprofits. Approximately $350 million in federal funding for these projects has been suspended, often without notice, affecting initiatives ranging from renovating homes to addressing climate change threats. The EPA is reviewing each grant program to ensure it aligns with the administration's priorities.

            <p>El Salvador’s President said in a meeting with Donald Trump in the White House on Monday that he would not order the return of a Maryland man who was deported in error to a Salvadorian mega-prison. The comments came a day after the Trump administration claimed it was not legally obligated to secure the return of Abrego García, despite the US supreme court ruling that the administration should “facilitate” bringing him back. Earlier this month, the Trump administration acknowledged that Abrego García was deported to a prison in El Salvador as a result of an “administrative error”.</p>

            <p>A sandstorm swept across Iraq's central and southern parts of the country, leaving more than a thousand people with respiratory problems, health officials said. Areas were cloaked in a thick orange haze, with local media reporting power cuts and the suspension of flights in a number of regions. Dust storms are common in Iraq, but some experts believe they are becoming more frequent due to climate change. Hospitals in Muthanna province in southern Iraq received at least "700 cases of suffocation", a local health official said.</p>

            <p>Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker Xpeng has ramped up development of its own artificial intelligence (AI) chip to power its semi-autonomous cars, with a first mass production model to be fitted with the Turing chip from as early as this quarter. The chip, which is claimed to be more powerful than Nvidia’s Drive Orin X, would be used in all its production models as the EV maker promoted its cutting-edge technologies. The chip could also power flying cars and robots being developed by its affiliated companies.</p>

            <p>The number of plays and musicals staged by the UK's main subsidised theatres last year was down by almost a third compared with 10 years earlier, BBC research suggests. In 2024, the 40 best-funded theatre companies opened 229 original productions, compared with 332 in 2014, a drop of 31%. Funding cuts and rising costs took much of the blame, with National Theatre executive director Kate Varah recently saying many in the industry are at "breaking point". Some venues said the shows they do stage are on a bigger scale than a decade ago, with the aim of running for longer on tour or in the West End.</p>

            <p>A CNBC Supply Chain Survey found that President Trump's tariffs won't lead to supply chains returning to the U.S. Most companies surveyed said bringing back supply chains could double their costs, and they would instead search for low-tariff regimes around the world. Over half of those surveyed (57%) said cost was the top reason for saying they would not be reshoring production; 21% said their top reason was the challenge of finding skilled labor.

            <p>More than 400 people have been killed in recent attacks by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan's Darfur region, according to the UN. The RSF launched an intense ground and aerial assault on refugee camps surrounding the city of El-Fasher in an attempt to seize the last state capital in Darfur held by their rival, the Sudanese army. The two warring sides have been locked in a bloody power struggle since April 2023. The UN said it had verified 148 killings between Thursday and Saturday, but warned the toll was much higher.</p>

Filers in the entire states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina are guaranteed this deadline extension due to the devastating hurricanes that ripped through much of the Southeast last year.</p>

            <p>California’s earthquake early warning system provided many residents with advance notice of a magnitude 5.2 earthquake, with users in some areas receiving alerts on their phones before they felt shaking. The ShakeAlert system relies on a vast array of seismic sensors to detect shaking as soon as it happens. People in Camarillo, Manhattan Beach, Palm Springs, Riverside, the San Diego neighborhood of Rancho Peñasquitos, Santa Ana and southern Orange County said they got the earthquake early warning before the shaking started. The system is operational in California, Oregon and Washington state.</p>
