          <p>White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the president's tariffs, claiming over 50 countries have reached out to negotiate. He argued the tariffs wouldn't significantly impact American consumers, a view disputed by former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who warned of increased inflation and reduced spending power. Hassett also addressed concerns about the Fed's independence and the exclusion of Russia from the tariffs, citing ongoing negotiations with Russia and Ukraine. Summers cautioned about market turbulence and advised caution in spending and investment.

          <p>The decision of where to store crypto like bitcoin can become the most consequential, and holders of crypto typically use some form of what can be called a wallet. Recent global events, such as wildfires and ongoing conflicts, are raising questions about the crypto custody debate, and it should be obvious that keeping seed phrases on paper offers the lowest level of protection against fire, yet it is common practice. Casa performs annual stress tests on seed phrase backups, and companies including Coinbase and Jack Dorsey's Block offer products that try to merge some of these ideas, creating a more secure version of a crypto wallet that remains convenient to use.
