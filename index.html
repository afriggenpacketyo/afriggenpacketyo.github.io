          <p>Moody's Ratings lowered the United States' sovereign credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing the increasing government debt and interest payment ratios. The rating agency highlighted the failure of successive administrations and Congress to address fiscal deficits and rising costs, also noting that extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would add trillions to the deficit over the next decade. This downgrade aligns Moody's with other major rating agencies like Standard & Poor's and Fitch, which had previously downgraded the U.S. The article also mentions potential impacts on Treasury yields and investor sentiment.

          <p>The Secret Service questioned former F.B.I. Director James Comey about a social media post interpreted by Trump administration officials as an assassination threat against President Trump. Comey posted a photo of seashells forming the numbers "86 47," a phrase used by Trump's critics to mean dismiss or remove Trump. The homeland security secretary and director of national intelligence publicly commented on the post, with the former saying the Secret Service was investigating it. Comey deleted the post and said he didn't realize the numbers could be associated with violence, while Trump claimed Comey knew exactly what it meant and was calling for his assassination.</p>

          <p>Cassie Ventura concluded her testimony in the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial, facing cross-examination from Combs' attorneys who challenged the consistency of her statements and the extent of harm she allegedly suffered. The defense attempted to portray Ventura as a willing participant in a swinger lifestyle and highlighted instances where Ventura was violent towards Combs. Ventura testified that she felt "worthless, just like dirt" due to regular beatings from Combs, and would return the $20 million civil settlement to avoid participating in freak offs. Prosecutors also presented testimony from a Homeland Security agent and singer Dawn Richard, who accused Combs of sexual assault and witnessed him abusing Ventura.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to release audio recordings of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s interview with Special Counsel Robert K. Hur, who investigated Biden's handling of classified information. Republicans have demanded the release of the audio, arguing it might reveal a decline in Biden's mental acuity, which was mentioned in Hur's report. The decision comes as Democrats grapple with new revelations about Biden's health while in office. The Biden administration had previously asserted executive privilege and argued that releasing the audio could hinder future investigations, but the Trump administration disagreed.</p>

          <p>Ten inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish Jail in New Orleans, prompting a manhunt involving local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies. Authorities believe the inmates, considered "armed and dangerous," had inside help. One inmate was captured, while the remaining nine are still at large, including one convicted of murder. The inmates escaped after removing a toilet and sink from a cell wall and scaling a wall. The sheriff's office cited defective locks and doors as contributing factors and claimed the city has not funded requested security upgrades. Victims have been notified and relocated for their safety.</p>

A do-over vote was later conducted at a special meeting, yielding the same result.

          <p>President Trump's announcement that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on Syria took senior Treasury Department officials by surprise. The announcement, made at an investment forum in Saudi Arabia, lacked specifics, causing officials to scramble to understand the implications. The decision follows months of lobbying by Syria's transitional government for sanctions relief. Some work was underway at Treasury for an incremental lifting of sanctions, some of which date back to 1979. Turkey and Saudi Arabia support normalizing relations with Syria's new government, which is facing challenges paying civil service salaries and rebuilding the war-ravaged country.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court extended its injunction, preventing the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act. The court found that the migrants were not given adequate time or information to challenge their removals, sending the case back to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The ruling does not prevent the government from removing the migrants under other lawful authorities. President Trump criticized the decision, while the ACLU praised the court for pausing the deportations. The justices emphasized the need to balance national security interests with constitutional rights.</p>

The ship had been buried in the sand for decades before recent storms exposed it. Historians are racing to locate shipwrecks before invasive quagga mussels destroy them.

          <p>The Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration's request to remove a temporary block on deportations of Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The justices acted on an emergency appeal from lawyers for Venezuelan men accused of being gang members. The court emphasized that people must have the opportunity to contest their removal from the United States. The case stems from a lawsuit challenging Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act. The court's decision does not block other methods the government may use to deport people.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice charged a Mexican cartel member, Maria Del Rosario Navarro-Sanchez, for providing material support to the Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG), marking the first use of a new terrorism designation.

Federal law makes it a crime to provide material support to cartels, punishable by up to 20 years in prison.</p>

          <p>A top adviser to the director of national intelligence ordered a senior analyst to reassess the relationship between Venezuela's government and a gang after intelligence findings undercut the White House's justification for deporting migrants. President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act, claiming Venezuela's government directed the gang to commit crimes in the U.S., but an intelligence assessment contradicted this claim. The National Intelligence Council reaffirmed its original findings after re-examining the evidence. Some officials saw the request for a new assessment as an effort to support Trump's agenda.</p>

Several conservative congressmen demanded steeper cuts to the budget bill. Primary sticking points include cuts to Medicaid, the state and local tax deduction, and food assistance. The bill's tax breaks total about $4.9 trillion, paid for by cuts to Medicaid and green energy tax breaks.
