          <p>The New York City medical examiner has confirmed that Shane Tamura, the gunman who killed four people at the NFL's headquarters before taking his own life, had Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). This finding supports a note found on Tamura, in which he blamed the NFL for concealing brain injury risks and requested his brain be studied. The report identified low-stage CTE but did not conclude whether the condition played a direct role in the violent attack. The shooting, which lasted mere minutes, resulted in the deaths of a security guard, a police officer, a corporate executive, and a management company employee.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising credit card debt and delinquencies, understanding payment timelines is crucial for consumers to avoid significant financial damage. While issuers may offer an unofficial grace period of a few days, a payment is officially reported as late to credit bureaus after 30 days, which can harm credit scores. The consequences escalate further at 60 and 90 days, with potential penalty APRs and more aggressive collection efforts. The article advises proactive communication with lenders and exploring options like hardship programs or balance transfers to mitigate the negative impacts of falling behind on payments.</p>

          <p>Assata Shakur, a prominent member of the Black Liberation Army, has died in Cuba where she lived for decades after escaping a U.S. prison. Convicted in 1977 for the 1973 murder of a New Jersey state trooper, Shakur maintained her innocence and became a symbol of resistance against racial injustice for her supporters. In 1979, she broke out of a New Jersey correctional facility and was granted political asylum in Cuba in 1984. She was the first woman to be placed on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists list, with a $2 million reward for her capture.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration will now permit Boeing to issue its own airworthiness certificates for some new 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner aircraft, reversing restrictions imposed after previous safety crises. This authority was revoked for the 737 MAX in 2019 following two fatal crashes and for the 787 in 2022 due to production defects. The FAA stated the decision reflects confidence in Boeing's improved production quality and will allow inspectors to focus on other areas of surveillance. The move is a significant step for Boeing as it works to recover from intense regulatory scrutiny and stabilize its manufacturing processes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sinclair announced it will resume broadcasting "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on its ABC affiliate stations, following a temporary preemption of the show. The decision comes after Disney returned the program to its network, having suspended it over comments Kimmel made regarding conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Sinclair, which owns about 40 ABC affiliates, stated that it had proposed measures to ABC to strengthen accountability and viewer feedback, though these were not adopted.

          <p>Several A-list comedians, including Dave Chappelle and Kevin Hart, are facing backlash for performing at the Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia. Critics and fellow comedians like Marc Maron and Zach Woods have condemned the event as an attempt by the Saudi government to "whitewash" its record of human rights abuses, including the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Human Rights Watch has urged the performers to use their platform to advocate for the release of detained dissidents. The controversy highlights the ongoing debate over celebrity engagement with Saudi Arabia as it invests heavily in its entertainment sector to improve its global image.</p>

          <p>Howard Rubin, a 70-year-old money manager and former prominent bond trader, was arrested Friday on charges of sex trafficking and transporting women across state lines for commercial sex acts.

His former assistant, Jennifer Powers, was also arrested for allegedly recruiting women and managing the network.

Elliott, who was 17 at the time, called 911 immediately after the incident, claiming he thought he was dreaming and had been sleepwalking. Prosecutors are pursuing a murder charge, questioning his account and demeanor, while the defense argues it was an unintentional act, citing a family history of sleep disorders.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cost of borrowing against home equity has slightly decreased following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, making these loans a more affordable option for homeowners. A new analysis shows that the monthly payment on a $150,000 home equity loan is now lower than it was earlier in the year. For example, a 10-year loan currently has an average rate of 8.34%, resulting in monthly savings of about $16 compared to rates from February. While the reduction is modest, it reflects a favorable trend for borrowers considering tapping into their home's value for large expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

A slight dip in membership renewal rates and a gross margin miss also contributed to a more than 2% drop in the company's stock price.

Prosecutors allege Comey misled the Senate by denying he had authorized a leak to the media, a claim some Republicans say is contradicted by testimony from his former deputy, Andrew McCabe.

          <p>The UK government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, plans to introduce a mandatory digital ID system as a cornerstone of its strategy to combat illegal migration. The new scheme will be required to prove an individual's right to work in the country, with the goal of making it more difficult for employers to hire undocumented workers. While the government claims the ID will also offer citizens benefits like easier access to services, the plan has drawn criticism from opposition parties and civil liberties groups. Opponents raise concerns about privacy, data security, and the potential for mass surveillance.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As retirees face concerns about outliving their savings, a strategy known as the "rule of thirds" is gaining attention as an alternative to traditional withdrawal methods. The approach involves converting one-third of retirement savings into a guaranteed lifetime income product, such as a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds of the portfolio can then be invested for growth or used for flexible spending and emergencies. This method aims to provide a balance of financial security and flexibility, reducing stress from market volatility while potentially allowing for higher overall withdrawal rates.

          <h2>Journalist Argues New Pentagon Restrictions on Press Access Weaken Accountability</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 12:57:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A veteran Pentagon reporter argues that the Defense Department's new restrictions on journalists are a threat to transparency and the First Amendment. Under the new rules, reporters must sign a 17-page agreement that could revoke their credentials for publishing unapproved, even if unclassified, information. The author contends that this policy, implemented under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, breaks with a long-standing tradition of press access that has held military leaders accountable under both Democratic and Republican administrations. Limiting journalists' ability to interact with officials and report freely ultimately harms the American public's right to know how its military operates.</p>

          <p>Moldova's Central Electoral Commission has barred the pro-Russian party "Heart of Moldova" from participating in the country's upcoming parliamentary elections. The decision follows a court ruling that limited the party's activities for one year amid an investigation into illegal financing and vote-buying. Officials in the pro-European nation have accused Russia of spending millions to interfere in the election, a charge Moscow denies. The exclusion is a significant development in a critical election for Moldova, which has been a candidate for European Union membership since 2022 and faces a political bloc of Russia-friendly parties.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially launched its "Gold Card" residency program with a price of $1 million, a significant reduction from the initially proposed $5 million. This move has made the U.S. visa one of the most competitively priced "golden visas" globally, sparking immediate interest from wealthy individuals, particularly from China and India. The program, which promises residency in "record time" in exchange for the fee, is expected to generate substantial federal revenue. However, it faces potential legal challenges as it uses workarounds of existing immigration law, and applicants may face long waits due to existing backlogs.</p>
