          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility in East Los Angeles has resulted in the deaths of at least three police officers. The blast occurred on Friday morning in a parking lot of the Special Enforcement Bureau at the Biscailuz Center. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi described it as a "horrific incident," confirming that federal agents from the ATF and FBI have been deployed to investigate the cause. California Governor Gavin Newsom has been briefed and offered state assistance in response to the tragedy.</p>

          <p>Delta and United are significantly outperforming other major U.S. airlines, accounting for over 86% of the industry's profits last year. Analysts attribute their success to strong networks and a focus on premium travel, which better insulates them from challenges like falling domestic airfares and overcapacity in coach class. While the broader industry faces a difficult year with discounted summer fares, both carriers are leveraging international routes and lucrative loyalty programs to maintain their financial edge. They are also exploring further cabin segmentation to generate new revenue streams.</p>

          <p>Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson has reportedly recovered from a recent shoulder soreness issue and is set to compete for the starting job at the upcoming training camp. Richardson, who missed most of last season with a shoulder injury, experienced a setback in June but is now cleared for participation. His return sets the stage for an open competition with veteran Daniel Jones, whom the Colts signed to a one-year contract. Richardson has shown promise with his mobility but has struggled with passing consistency in his career.</p>

          <p>Following a sharp 8.5% drop in Abbott Laboratories' stock, financial analysts are defending the company, with Jefferies upgrading it to a "buy" rating. The sell-off was prompted by a minor reduction in Abbott's growth outlook, a reaction analysts and the company's CEO have called "too punitive" and an "overreaction." They argue the headwind in the diagnostic business is temporary and that the company's strong fundamentals and potential for future growth make the current stock price an attractive entry point.

While the Trump administration has backed a strong, centralized government under new President Ahmed al-Sharaa, Israel remains deeply distrustful of the former jihadist leader and has supported his regional rivals, including the Druze minority. This fundamental disagreement created a power vacuum and may have inadvertently triggered the clashes that led to hundreds of deaths and retaliatory Israeli airstrikes on Damascus.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle monitor and adhere to a nighttime curfew amid fears he might flee the country. The restrictions are part of his ongoing trial for allegedly plotting a coup to overturn his 2022 election loss. The judge also barred Bolsonaro from using social media and communicating with his son, who has been lobbying for him in the U.S. Bolsonaro, who denies the charges, called the measures a "supreme humiliation."</p>

          <p>An employment tribunal heard testimony that a transgender doctor at a hospital in Kirkcaldy, Scotland, was left sobbing and "very shaken" after a nurse confronted her about using the female changing rooms. A senior colleague described finding the doctor, Elspeth Pitt, visibly distressed, who said she felt cornered and that the nurse's tone was aggressive. The nurse involved was later cleared of gross misconduct by an internal health board hearing and is now pursuing the case against her employer at the tribunal.</p>

The vote was briefly delayed as Democrats used procedural tactics to force votes related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, highlighting ongoing political tensions surrounding the issue.</p>

          <p>Ari Aster's new film "Eddington" is reviewed as a nasty and cynical, yet eerily accurate, neo-Western thriller set in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The movie explores how a small New Mexico town becomes a battleground of paranoia and outrage fueled by online misinformation and the isolation of lockdown. The review praises the film for capturing how the digital world bled into and distorted reality, creating a chaotic soundscape of conspiracy theories and outrage that ultimately leads to real-world violence.</p>
