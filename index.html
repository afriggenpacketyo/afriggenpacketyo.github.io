          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to purchase OxyChem, the petrochemical division of Occidental Petroleum, for $9.7 billion in cash. This acquisition represents Berkshire's most significant deal since 2022 and comes as the conglomerate holds a near-record cash reserve. Occidental plans to use a substantial portion of the proceeds to reduce its debt, which will enable the company to resume its stock buyback program and strengthen its financial position. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old convicted sex offender in Minnesota was arrested after allegedly enrolling in a high school by posing as a 17-year-old student. The man, Kelvin Micaiah Luebke, used fraudulent documents to gain access and even joined the school's football team under an alias. His deception was uncovered after staff and families reported suspicions, leading to an investigation that revealed his true identity and criminal history. The incident has prompted outrage from parents and local lawmakers, who are calling for greater accountability from school district leadership.</p>

          <p>As a U.S. government shutdown continues, many federal employees face furloughs and delayed paychecks, but members of Congress and the President will continue to receive their salaries. This is because their compensation is mandated by the Constitution and funded through a permanent appropriation, making it exempt from the annual funding lapses that affect other federal agencies. While lawmakers' pay is secure, their staff members are subject to furloughs and will not be paid until a funding resolution is passed. The situation highlights a significant disparity in how a shutdown impacts elected officials versus the broader federal workforce.</p>

          <p>For individuals needing quick access to a significant sum like $10,000, a personal loan can be a viable option, with many lenders offering rapid approval and funding. To secure favorable terms, prospective borrowers should first check their credit scores for errors and take steps to improve them, such as lowering credit card utilization. It is crucial to strategically compare offers from online lenders, traditional banks, and credit unions, as interest rates can vary significantly. Preparing necessary documentation like proof of income in advance can also streamline the application process and increase the chances of a swift approval. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hurricane Imelda has been downgraded to a post-tropical storm after making landfall in Bermuda, where it brought powerful winds and heavy rainfall. While a tropical storm warning remains in effect, the worst of the conditions have passed for the archipelago, and the system is now moving further into the Atlantic Ocean. The National Hurricane Center reported that hurricane-force winds were recorded on the island, but there have been no immediate reports of significant damage. Swells generated by Imelda are expected to cause potentially life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>A terror attack outside a synagogue in Manchester, England, has resulted in the deaths of two people and serious injuries to four others. The incident, which occurred on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, involved an assailant using a vehicle and a knife to target worshippers at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation. Police responded swiftly, shooting and killing the attacker at the scene, preventing him from entering the synagogue where many people were gathered.

          <p>Fair Isaac Corp., the company behind the FICO credit score, announced a new pricing model that will allow mortgage lenders to license its scores directly, bypassing credit bureaus. The move caused Fair Isaac's stock to surge over 20%, while shares for major credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax dropped significantly. The company stated the change aims to eliminate unnecessary markups and give lenders more choice, a move praised by the Federal Housing Finance Agency director. This strategic shift could disrupt the current credit scoring distribution system and alter the financial dynamics between FICO and the credit bureaus. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty marked by rising inflation and potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, a six-month certificate of deposit (CD) presents a stable option for savers. With current rates around 4.30%, a CD offers guaranteed, albeit modest, returns while protecting the principal investment with FDIC insurance. For example, a $10,000 deposit could earn approximately $212 in interest over the six-month term, providing a secure haven for funds. This short-term commitment allows savers to benefit from today's elevated rates without locking their money away for an extended period, offering flexibility for reinvestment next spring.

This object, named Cha 1107-7626, is about 620 light-years away and has a mass five to ten times that of Jupiter. The unprecedented accretion event, driven by magnetic activity typically seen in stars, is blurring the lines between how planets and stars form.

The administration has already frozen $18 billion for infrastructure in New York and canceled $8 billion for climate-related projects in Democratic-leaning states. The White House has also signaled that mass firings of federal employees are imminent, a departure from the typical practice of furloughing workers who later receive back pay.

          <p>With the average interest rate for a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) dropping below 8%, homeowners can now borrow large sums more affordably than in the recent past. For a $70,000 HELOC, the current average rate of 7.88% results in a monthly payment of approximately $845 for a 10-year repayment term, a noticeable decrease from costs seen just a year ago. Because HELOCs have variable rates, borrowers benefit automatically as market rates fall, without the need for refinancing. With further rate cuts anticipated from the Federal Reserve, HELOCs are becoming an increasingly cost-effective option for accessing home equity. (not investment advice)</p>

An expert attributes this trend to three main factors: corporate America's retreat from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, cutbacks at small businesses, and layoffs within the federal government, where Black women are disproportionately employed. This concerning development has prompted calls for the Federal Reserve to analyze the data and address what some see as a crisis and a potential indicator of broader economic issues.

The author argues that just as Floyd's death was used by the left to advance political goals and create a martyr figure, Kirk's assassination is now being used by the right to pursue illiberal aims and silence opposition. The article points to calls from figures like Vice President J.D. Vance for supporters to report individuals who speak ill of Kirk, leading to professional repercussions. It concludes that both sides have transformed controversial men into one-dimensional saints to be used as cudgels in the culture war.</p>

Cruz attributes his success to hard work and the values of respect and honesty taught by his parents.</p>

          <p>Jane Goodall, the pioneering primatologist who transformed the world's understanding of chimpanzees, has passed away at the age of 91. Her groundbreaking research in Tanzania, which began in 1960, revealed that chimpanzees make and use tools, a behavior once thought to be exclusively human. Initially a scientist focused on research, Goodall became a tireless global activist in 1986, traveling extensively to advocate for conservation and environmental protection. Through the Jane Goodall Institute and its Roots and Shoots program, she inspired millions to take action to protect wildlife and improve communities worldwide.</p>

          <p>At least two people have been killed in Morocco after police reportedly opened fire during youth-led demonstrations against government spending priorities. The protests, organized by a movement known as GenZ 212, erupted over the decision to build stadiums for the 2030 World Cup instead of investing in public services like hospitals amid high youth unemployment. The demonstrations have spread across major cities, including Rabat and Casablanca, with some turning violent. The government has expressed a willingness to engage in dialogue, while also reporting hundreds of arrests and dozens of injuries among both police and protesters.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Energy has canceled over $7.5 billion in funding for 223 projects, stating they were not economically viable or aligned with national energy needs. The announcement came on the first day of the government shutdown, with the White House specifying the cuts targeted projects in 16 states that voted for the previous Democratic administration. Democratic lawmakers have condemned the move as political retribution, arguing the President is illegally suspending federal projects to punish his opposition during a funding dispute. The cancellations affect a range of initiatives, from clean energy demonstrations to grid deployment.</p>

          <p>The Eiffel Tower was closed to visitors as part of a nationwide strike across France, where workers, retirees, and students protested against government spending cuts and demanded higher taxes on the wealthy. This is the latest in a series of demonstrations organized by major unions who are urging the new prime minister to abandon proposed austerity measures they argue will harm low and middle-income workers. While high-speed train services were largely unaffected, some regional rail lines and public services experienced disruptions. The protests highlight the significant social anger and political turmoil surrounding the country's upcoming budget debates.</p>

          <p>The emergence of 'Tilly Norwood,' a computer-generated actor created by an AI talent studio, has triggered significant anxiety and backlash within the Hollywood community. Actors and filmmakers have expressed alarm over the potential for AI to replace human performers, particularly after it was announced that the digital character would be signed by a talent agency. SAG-AFTRA condemned the creation, stating it was trained on the work of professional performers without permission or compensation, thereby devaluing human artistry. The creator defended the AI actor as a new creative tool, similar to animation or CGI, rather than a replacement for people.</p>

Prosecutors are expected to seek a sentence of over a decade, citing a history of violence, while his defense has requested a sentence that could lead to his release by year's end. The trial featured graphic testimony from two women who alleged Combs coerced them into drug-fueled encounters with sex workers, a violation of the Mann Act.</p>

          <p>The English Premier League is approaching a decision on whether to replace its current Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) with a new financial control system. Chief Executive Richard Masters confirmed that clubs are discussing an alternative aligned with UEFA's squad cost ratio (SCR) model, which limits spending to a percentage of club revenue. The current PSR, which allows for £105 million in losses over three years, has been criticized by some clubs for restricting investment. A final decision on adopting the new system, which would likely set the spending cap at 85% of revenue, is expected in November.</p>

          <p>For the eighth consecutive year, Finland has been named the happiest country in the world, a distinction that experts attribute to societal contentment rather than overt joy. The ranking is based on citizens' evaluation of their lives, and Finland's high score is linked to a strong social safety net, public trust, and accessible public services funded by high taxes. The Finnish concept of happiness is also closely tied to a deep connection with nature and cultural practices like saunas, which promote well-being. This focus on life satisfaction and societal support contributes to its consistent top ranking.</p>
