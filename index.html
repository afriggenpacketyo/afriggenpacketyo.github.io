            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen reports that El Salvador attempted to prevent him from seeing Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national mistakenly deported from Maryland. After being granted access, Van Hollen stated that the Salvadoran government staged photos to create a false impression of Garcia's well-being. Garcia has since been transferred to a different facility, and the Trump administration has acknowledged the deportation error. Van Hollen emphasizes the importance of protecting constitutional rights, arguing that trampling on one person's rights threatens the rights of all Americans.</p>

            <p>Both Russia and Ukraine are blaming each other for violating the agreed-upon Easter ceasefire, with accusations of overnight attacks. President Zelenskyy stated his country's forces had recorded 59 instances of Russian shelling and five assaults. The Russian Defense Ministry said Ukrainian forces launched overnight attacks in the Donetsk region and sent 48 drones into Russian territory. President Trump expressed hope for a deal between the two countries this week.</p>
