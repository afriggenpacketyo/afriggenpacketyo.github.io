          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced the Autumn Budget will be held on November 26. The announcement comes as the government faces significant pressure to balance public finances, boost sluggish economic growth, and maintain investor confidence. Economists anticipate that tax increases or spending cuts will be necessary for Reeves to adhere to her "non-negotiable" fiscal rules, especially with rising government borrowing costs. The Office for Budget Responsibility will now begin its 10-week process to produce an independent economic forecast to accompany the budget statement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is set to return to UK high streets five years after closing its physical stores. It will be available in 32 John Lewis department stores starting February 2026, with its menswear line, Topman, in six locations. The brand, which was acquired by online retailer Asos after its parent company collapsed, is aiming for a major comeback under new ownership. This nationwide partnership is seen as a strategic move to attract new, multi-generational customers to John Lewis while reviving an iconic fashion name.</p>

          <p>Despite mortgage rates falling to their lowest level since April, total mortgage application volume in the U.S. decreased by 1.2% last week. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, applications for home purchases fell by 3%, ending a four-week streak of gains, while refinance applications saw a minor 1% increase. High home prices and overall affordability challenges continue to be the primary barriers for potential buyers, outweighing the benefit of slightly lower interest rates. The market is now awaiting key economic reports, including the monthly employment data, which could influence future rate movements. (not investment advice)</p>

Anwar's appearance at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit highlighted Malaysia's alignment with China's Global Governance Initiative, which emphasizes sovereign equality and multilateralism. This move is seen as a demonstration of solidarity with the Global South, particularly as both nations face the threat of U.S. tariffs. The diplomatic gesture underscores a strengthening of ties between Malaysia and China in response to perceived unilateralism from Washington.</p>

          <p>The fast-fashion company Shein has removed a product listing and launched an investigation after an image resembling Luigi Mangione was used to model a shirt on its website. Mangione is currently facing federal charges for the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, to which he has pleaded not guilty. It is unclear how the image was generated or for how long it was active on the platform, with some speculating it was created using artificial intelligence.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has launched an aggressive social media recruitment campaign to hire over 10,000 new ICE officers and 3,000 Border Patrol agents. The campaign targets former military personnel, legal professionals, and Gen Z with patriotic and sometimes militaristic messaging, including memes and videos likening the roles to saving America from "criminals and predators." To expand its hiring pool, DHS has lowered the minimum age to 18 and is offering student loan forgiveness. Critics worry the polarizing rhetoric and rushed hiring process could attract xenophobic candidates and further politicize the agency.</p>

The Crown Prosecution Service concluded there was no realistic prospect of conviction because it could not be proven that his actions were dishonest. Osbourne, the iconic heavy metal star, passed away in July at the age of 76.</p>

The players, including Danny Murphy and Brian Deane, are part of the "V11" campaign group and allege they were victims of "financial abuse" by Kingsbridge Asset Management in the 1990s and 2000s. The MPs state the case represents a "failure of regulation, accountability and duty of care," calling for a resolution to the players' decade-long tax dispute with HMRC.

          <p>An investigation by The Guardian reveals that "CrossPolitic," the flagship podcast of the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC), has served as a platform for far-right and Christian nationalist ideologies. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is a member of a CREC church. The podcast has recently hosted guests who advocate for the criminalization of homosexuality and for the US to absorb Canada. The content raises questions about the influence of this religious movement, which opposes liberal democracy, on the views of high-level government officials like Hegseth.</p>

          <p>Contrary to a common narrative that marriage and motherhood lead to female unhappiness, a new national survey of American women finds that married mothers are the most likely group to report being "very happy." The study, which controlled for age, income, and education, found 19% of married mothers described themselves as very happy, compared to 10-13% of other groups, including unmarried women without children. Married mothers were also most likely to feel their life has a clear sense of purpose and meaning. The author suggests these roles provide unique benefits often overlooked in public discourse.</p>

          <p>A disturbing trend is emerging among prominent right-wing media figures, including Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens, who are increasingly platforming and promoting revisionist histories of World War II that downplay Nazi atrocities and rehabilitate Adolf Hitler. These influencers suggest the U.S. should have sided with Hitler against Stalin and question why he is considered uniquely evil. The article argues this is a deliberate attempt to unlearn the post-Holocaust lessons that made overt antisemitism unacceptable in American society, effectively working to mainstream antisemitic conspiracy theories and roll back decades of progress.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic argues that the Democratic Party's strategy of unequivocal support for organized labor has failed to win back working-class voters and may even be counterproductive. The article suggests that the party's recent unconditional deference to union demands on issues like trade and construction has contributed to higher costs, undermining the goal of improving affordability for all. This tension is highlighted by the "abundance agenda," which seeks to remove barriers to housing and infrastructure, often putting it at odds with specific union interests. The author advocates for a return to a more qualified alliance with labor.</p>

          <p>UCLA football games at the Rose Bowl are suffering from severely low attendance, with the number of people actually in the stadium often being far less than the officially announced figures. For the recent season opener against Utah, the announced attendance was 35,032, but the actual scan count was only 27,785. In some past games, the scan count has been less than half of the announced attendance, which UCLA defines broadly to include non-ticketed individuals like staff and media. This decline is a major concern for the athletic department, which has seen football ticket revenue nearly halve since 2014.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Times columnist is making a bold prediction that the Rams will make it to the Super Bowl this season, forecasting at least 11 wins. The optimism is based on several factors, including a talented roster, an ascending young defense, and the leadership of coach Sean McVay and quarterback Matthew Stafford. Key offseason moves, such as acquiring receiver Davante Adams and strengthening the offensive line, are seen as addressing the weaknesses that led to last season's narrow playoff exit. The author argues that with a favorable schedule, the team has all the necessary components for a deep postseason run.</p>

          <p>The British Embassy in Cairo has temporarily closed its main building after Egyptian authorities removed the concrete security barriers that had surrounded the compound for decades. This action follows escalating diplomatic tensions between Egypt and several Western nations over pro-Palestinian protests targeting Egyptian embassies abroad. Egyptian officials have accused host countries of failing to protect their missions from vandalism. The removal of the barriers in Cairo appears to be a reciprocal measure after an Egyptian activist was briefly detained by police in London during a counter-protest.</p>

Additional concerns about the Federal Reserve's independence, stemming from Trump's attempts to fire a board governor, are also contributing to market volatility.

The release, which includes old court filings and police footage, follows months of controversy surrounding the Trump administration's decision not to release additional files. Epstein, who was a longtime friend of Donald Trump, died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

          <p>The location of Adolf Hitler's Führerbunker in Berlin is now an unremarkable parking lot, yet it remains a major attraction for "dark tourism." After WWII, Soviet and later East German authorities deliberately obscured the site to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine. Today, only a small informational plaque marks the spot, a reflection of modern Germany's struggle with how to handle sites associated with Nazi perpetrators. This case study illustrates the economic and ethical complexities of dark tourism, where public demand to visit morbid sites clashes with societal reluctance to memorialize or commercialize a painful past.</p>

They found that while partial bans had minimal effect, policies combining a full ban with a fee on alternative bags led to a 25-47% decrease in plastic bag litter. The study also noted a potential 37% reduction in animal entanglement in areas with such policies, highlighting the direct environmental benefits of well-designed legislation.</p>

          <p>In an unusual series of events, federal grand juries in Washington, D.C., have recently rejected at least four separate indictment requests from the Department of Justice. The cases involved charges ranging from threatening the president to assaulting a federal agent. Legal experts describe the rejections as "exceptionally rare," suggesting that jurors may be disagreeing with the DOJ's theory of prosecution or that the administration has lost credibility with local jurors. The trend raises questions about prosecutorial discretion and the relationship between the Justice Department and the D.C. community.</p>
