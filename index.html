        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump faced criticism for using the term "shylocks" during a speech in Iowa, a word the Anti-Defamation League labeled a "centuries-old antisemitic trope." The term, a reference to a greedy Jewish moneylender in Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," was used while discussing his new legislative package. When questioned, Trump stated he was unaware of the word's antisemitic connotations, claiming he only understood it to mean a moneylender charging high rates. Democratic Representative Dan Goldman condemned the remark as "blatant and vile antisemitism."</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over two decades of experience treating heart disease has outlined five "toxic" food categories he avoids feeding his children to promote long-term health. These include microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and deli slices because of preservatives and nitrates. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health. The article suggests healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain Greek yogurt, and unprocessed proteins.</p>

          <p>Competitive eating legend Joey Chestnut made a triumphant return to win the 2025 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, consuming 70.5 hot dogs and buns in ten minutes. After being banned from the 2024 competition over a brand partnership dispute, Chestnut reclaimed his title from last year's winner, Patrick Bertoletti. While falling short of his 2021 world record of 76 hot dogs, the 41-year-old expressed his excitement to be back and vowed to return next year. In the women's event, Miki Sudo secured her 11th victory by eating 33 hot dogs.</p>

          <p>Renowned documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as one of history's most pivotal events, asserting that it "turned the world upside down" by creating the concept of a citizen rather than a subject. In an interview ahead of the nation's 250th anniversary, Burns emphasized that the Declaration of Independence set in motion global movements for equality and unalienable rights. He argued for embracing the complexities of American history, including its internal struggles and the exclusion of many groups from its founding principles, as a way to create a richer, more inclusive national story.</p>

          <p>Economists are expressing alarm over the new tax and spending bill, which the Congressional Budget Office projects will add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. Experts warn that the U.S. is already on an "exploding debt path," and this legislation could accelerate the risk of a financial crisis where bond markets lose faith in the country's ability to pay its debts. The increased debt could lead to higher interest rates for consumers on mortgages and car loans, while also limiting the government's capacity to respond to future emergencies.

          <p>The direct-action group Palestine Action is set to be officially banned as a terrorist organization in the UK after a High Court judge rejected its request for a temporary injunction against the government's decision. The proscription means that supporting the group, known for its protests targeting companies linked to Israel's arms industry, will become a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The government moved to ban the group following an action that caused an estimated £7 million in damage. The group's co-founder called the decision a "dystopian nightmare" and plans to appeal.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is facing criticism for sending a widely distributed email that praised former President Donald Trump's new domestic policy bill, a move analysts described as a departure from the agency's apolitical norm. The email, from SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano, celebrated the bill's tax relief for seniors and claimed it reaffirms Trump's promise to protect Social Security. Critics pointed out that the email sounded like partisan communication and that the bill's tax cuts could actually hasten the insolvency of the Social Security trust fund, according to some analyses.

          <p>The women's singles tournament at Wimbledon saw two major upsets as sixth seed Madison Keys and former world number one Naomi Osaka were both eliminated in the third round. Keys, who was reportedly ill, was defeated in straight sets by 37-year-old German veteran Laura Siegemund.

An upset Osaka stated she had high hopes for a deep run at the tournament and was frustrated by the loss, though she acknowledged her growing comfort on grass courts.</p>

Despite ether's price lagging behind bitcoin, institutional interest is focused on Ethereum's utility, stability, and security for applications like stablecoins and real-world asset tokenization.

          <p>A group of five Democratic state lawmakers from Florida were denied entry to a new, remote immigration jail nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz" by former President Trump. The denial occurred one day after the first detainees arrived at the facility, which is managed by the state of Florida in partnership with the federal government. The lawmakers condemned the move as an "abuse of power" and an attempt to hide potential human rights violations. The facility is part of an intensified immigration enforcement effort in Florida, where local law enforcement has been deputized to conduct immigration operations.</p>

Despite growing societal acceptance, a bill to legalize civil partnerships has been stalled in parliament for over two years. Soldiers report mixed experiences, with some finding support within their units while others face discrimination and threats with little legal recourse.</p>

          <p>A report details the complex negotiations that led to Paramount Global paying former President Donald Trump a $16 million settlement to drop his lawsuit over a "60 Minutes" interview. The deal was seen as crucial for securing government approval for Paramount's sale to Skydance Media, which is backed by Trump ally Larry Ellison. The settlement ends Trump's claims regarding the editing of a 2024 interview with Kamala Harris and a subsequent segment he disliked. While Paramount avoided a formal apology, the settlement has been criticized by press freedom advocates as a dangerous precedent for media intimidation.</p>

          <p>Health experts are detailing the significant physical effects of competitive eating, as exemplified by the annual Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest. Gastroenterologists explain that eaters train to relax and expand their stomachs to accommodate massive quantities of food, a practice that could lead to permanently stretched stomach muscles and impaired gastric emptying. In the short term, competitors face extreme bloating, gastrointestinal distress, and risks from ingesting huge amounts of sodium and fat. While the long-term consequences are not well-studied, immediate dangers include choking, aspiration, and potential tearing of the esophagus.</p>

The suit claims that agents are targeting people based on their appearance in raids on known hubs for Latino workers, such as hardware store parking lots and street vendor corners. Advocates argue that ambitious arrest quotas are leading agents to detain individuals, including U.S. citizens, without the required "reasonable suspicion" that they are in the country illegally.

Authorities believe the explosion may be related to the unloading of liquified petroleum gas. An investigation has been launched, and officials noted that a much greater tragedy was avoided by the swift evacuation of a nearby sports center.</p>
