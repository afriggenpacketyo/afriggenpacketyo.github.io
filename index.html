          <p>A shooting at the Grand Sierra Resort casino in Reno resulted in the deaths of four people, including the suspect, and left three others injured. Authorities identified the gunman as 26-year-old Dakota Hawver, who died from injuries sustained during a shootout with police. The incident began when Hawver opened fire on multiple victims in the valet area and parking lot, seemingly at random, before being confronted by security and responding officers. Investigators reported that Hawver, who had no prior criminal or mental health history, fired approximately 80 rounds from a legally purchased handgun.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, has publicly urged former President Trump not to consider any form of leniency for Ghislaine Maxwell. Their statement followed Trump's recent comments acknowledging that Epstein had "stolen" Giuffre from his Mar-a-Lago resort. The family expressed concern over Maxwell's attempts to gain immunity in exchange for testimony, arguing that the convicted sex trafficker should not be trusted or rewarded. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Epstein's sex trafficking ring and is appealing her conviction.</p>

          <p>Following strong earnings reports from Microsoft and Meta, CNBC's Jim Cramer endorsed Meta's significant spending on artificial intelligence, viewing it as a wise investment to build a "brain trust." Meta's stock surged on the news of powerful AI-driven growth, while Microsoft's market cap surpassed $4 trillion due to its robust cloud business. Looking ahead to upcoming earnings from Apple and Amazon, Cramer expressed caution about Apple due to tariff exposure but remained optimistic about Amazon's cloud and advertising segments. The article highlights the continued massive investment in AI as a dominant theme in the tech sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The number of migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats has exceeded 25,000 for the current year, a milestone reached significantly earlier than in previous years. On Wednesday alone, 898 people arrived on 13 boats, according to the UK Home Office. The rising numbers have intensified the political debate, with the opposition calling it a "national emergency." In response, the government has emphasized its cooperation with French authorities to dismantle smuggling networks and a new pilot scheme to return some migrants to France, aiming to deter the dangerous journeys.</p>

          <p>Former NASA astronauts and twin brothers, Mark and Scott Kelly, discussed the current state of the U.S. space program, including significant budget cuts and the challenges of long-duration missions. Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat from Arizona, confirmed he is working with the Transportation Secretary on a path forward for NASA as it faces a 20% workforce reduction. The brothers, who were part of a famous NASA study on the effects of spaceflight, also reflected on the unique experience of launching into orbit. Scott Kelly noted the most difficult part of being on the International Space Station is the separation from family and Earth.</p>

          <p>A 76-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of administering poison after eight children became ill at a summer camp at Stathern Lodge in Leicestershire, UK. Police and ambulance services responded to reports of the unwell children, all of whom were taken to the hospital as a precaution and have since been discharged. The man remains in custody as a major incident team investigates the complex and sensitive case. The police watchdog is also independently investigating the force's handling of initial concerns about the children's wellbeing, which were reported prior to the incident.</p>

          <p>Comcast reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street expectations, causing its stock to rise despite a continued loss of broadband customers. The company lost 226,000 broadband subscribers, though this was fewer than analysts had feared. Executives expressed confidence in a new market strategy, including new pricing and a free mobile line offer, designed to combat intense competition. Strong performance in its film studios and theme parks, including the new Epic Universe, helped bolster overall revenue, while its Peacock streaming service saw losses narrow significantly.

          <p>The recent season premiere of "South Park" took an indirect approach to satirizing contemporary politics, using Donald Trump as a vehicle to critique its parent company, Paramount. The episode, "Sermon on the 'Mount," features Trump suing the town while also referencing Paramount's recent cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" and a lawsuit settlement with Trump. This layered commentary allowed the show's creators to address sensitive corporate and political issues in a provocative, high-profile way. The strategy transformed an entertainment-industry drama into an accessible storyline that generated widespread discussion and viral attention.</p>

His comments came after two days of what he described as "tough" negotiations in Stockholm, as an August 12 deadline approaches. While Bessent noted that some technical details still need to be resolved and that President Trump has the final say, his confidence suggests a potential de-escalation in the trade tensions between the two economic superpowers. The U.S. has been operating under a truce, having lowered its tariff rate from 145% to 30%.</p>

          <p>Television presenter Jeremy Clarkson has announced a "devastating" outbreak of bovine tuberculosis (TB) at his Diddly Squat Farm in Oxfordshire. In a social media post, he shared that an infected cow, pregnant with twins, was identified at the farm, which is the subject of the popular Amazon Prime series "Clarkson's Farm." Bovine TB is an infectious respiratory disease that requires any cattle testing positive to be isolated and slaughtered to prevent further spread. The farm is located in an "edge area" for the disease, a buffer zone between high and low-risk regions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is moving to revoke the 2009 "endangerment finding," the scientific and legal foundation for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. EPA head Lee Zeldin unveiled the proposal, which, if finalized, would strip the agency of its authority to curb climate pollution from sources like power plants and vehicles. Environmental law experts warn this represents a radical pivot in U.S. climate policy and a full embrace of fossil fuels. The move is expected to face numerous legal challenges, but it marks a significant step in dismantling federal climate regulations.</p>

          <p>The White House has issued an order to end the "de minimis" tariff exemption, a loophole that allowed small-value shipments (under $800) to enter the U.S. tax-free. The policy, which was heavily used by e-commerce companies shipping from China, will now be eliminated for all countries effective August 29. The administration stated the move is intended to close pathways for tariff evasion and the smuggling of illicit goods like synthetic opioids.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new genetic study has revealed a remarkable evolutionary origin for the potato, suggesting the entire lineage arose from the hybridization of an ancient tomato and another flowering plant. Researchers found that this chance union, occurring 8 to 9 million years ago, created a new species with a novel ability: forming tubers. Neither parent plant could create these nutrient-storage organs, but the hybrid combined the right genetic traits to do so, allowing it to thrive in new, harsher environments. This discovery reshapes our understanding of the potato's history and highlights hybridization as a powerful, creative force in evolution.</p>

California Governor Gavin Newsom has stated he will redraw his state's maps to offset any gains by Texas Republicans, setting up a potential "electoral arms race."

          <p>A deep-sea expedition has discovered extensive communities of tubeworms and mollusks flourishing at depths over 31,000 feet in the Pacific Ocean's Kuril–Kamchatka and Aleutian trenches. In these extreme environments, characterized by crushing pressure and a lack of sunlight, scientists were surprised by the scale of this larger marine life. Researchers believe these creatures survive not on nutrients trickling down, but by capitalizing on chemical energy produced by microbes from carbon accumulated on the trench floor. The discovery challenges previous assumptions about the limits of life and opens new avenues for studying adaptation in extreme environments.</p>
