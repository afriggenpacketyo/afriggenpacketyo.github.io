          <p>A significant contrast in energy policy is emerging between the U.S. and China, driven by their broader technological competition and the world's increasing demand for electricity for AI and data centers. While Beijing is accelerating its investment in renewable energy to secure a global tech advantage, the Trump administration is moving to eliminate tax credits for wind and solar power, labeling them as unreliable. This divergence highlights two distinct national strategies for powering future technological growth, with China forging ahead in the green energy sector while the U.S. appears to be deprioritizing it in favor of other energy sources.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has stated he may obstruct the Washington Commanders' plans for a new stadium in D.C. unless the team reverts to its previous "Redskins" name. He also called for the Cleveland Guardians to return to being the "Indians," claiming Native American communities support this, though no evidence was provided. The Commanders organization dropped the controversial name in 2020 following widespread criticism that it was a racial slur. It is unclear what authority Trump would have to block the stadium project, which already has congressional approval for the city to use the proposed site.</p>

          <p>Jake Larson, a D-Day veteran who gained late-in-life fame as "Papa Jake" on TikTok, has passed away at the age of 102. Larson, who landed on Omaha Beach in 1944, captivated 1.2 million followers by sharing his World War II experiences, honoring his fallen comrades, and promoting peace. Remembered for his quick wit and warm personality, he used his platform to connect with younger generations and advocate for remembering the sacrifices of the past. His family confirmed he died peacefully, and tributes have poured in from around the world for the man who called himself "the luckiest man in the world."</p>

          <p>Canada is experiencing its most significant measles outbreak since the disease was declared eliminated in 1998, with over 3,800 cases in 2025, far surpassing U.S. figures on a per capita basis. The surge, concentrated in Ontario and Alberta, is largely attributed to low vaccination rates, particularly within some Low German-speaking Mennonite communities, and fueled by post-pandemic anti-vaccine misinformation. Health officials note that while Canada lacks a single prominent anti-vaccine figure like in the U.S., a general rise in vaccine hesitancy and distrust in the healthcare system are critical factors driving the spread of the highly contagious and dangerous virus.</p>

          <p>Scott Turner, the current Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and a former defensive back for the Washington Redskins, has publicly supported President Trump's call for the Washington Commanders to revert to their previous name. Turner, who played for the team in the 1990s, stated on social media that he was drafted by the Redskins, not the Commanders, and that it's time to bring the name back. His endorsement adds another voice to the pressure campaign initiated by Trump, who threatened to impede the team's new stadium deal if the name change is not reversed, a move the team's current owner has said he will not make.</p>

The article also points to massive investment in data centers, energy infrastructure, and a potential lending boom from relaxed bank stress tests as key drivers of economic strength.

          <p>The UK government is relaunching the Pensions Commission to address warnings that future pensioners will be worse off than today's retirees without intervention. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) highlighted that nearly half of working-age adults, especially the self-employed and low earners, are not saving into a private pension. This savings gap is projected to leave those retiring in 2050 with £800 less per year. The revived commission will bring together experts, unions, and employers to build a national consensus on how to encourage greater private pension savings, particularly among underrepresented groups.</p>

          <p>Alcohol is classified as a Group 1 carcinogen, with strong evidence linking its consumption to an increased risk of oral cancer. According to oncology specialists, alcohol contributes to this risk in several ways: its breakdown produces acetaldehyde, a toxic chemical that damages DNA, and it promotes body-wide inflammation. Furthermore, chronic alcohol use can impair the body's ability to absorb essential, cancer-fighting nutrients like vitamins A, C, and E. The article emphasizes that the risk is dose-dependent, with even light drinkers facing nearly double the risk compared to non-drinkers, and heavy drinkers facing a fivefold increase.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals that public support for President Trump's large-scale deportation program has fallen, with a majority now believing it targets more than just dangerous criminals. This shift has contributed to a drop in the president's approval among Hispanic Americans. The survey also indicates that a large majority of Americans, nearly two-thirds of whom disapprove of his handling of inflation, want the administration to focus more on lowering prices rather than on tariffs or spending cuts. Initial reactions to the recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill" are largely negative, with most believing it primarily benefits the wealthy.</p>

          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will not resign, despite his ruling coalition losing its majority in the upper house of parliament in a recent election. The loss for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its partner Komeito reflects public frustration over rising prices and the threat of U.S. tariffs. This electoral setback follows the coalition's loss of its majority in the more powerful lower house last year, further weakening the government's influence.

Furthermore, building on a "small, highly populated, property-owning, democratic island" necessitated expensive compromises, such as extensive tunneling to appease local constituencies.

The spirit's rise from a locally consumed beverage to a premium product in international markets highlights a growing appreciation for handcrafted, authentic liquors.</p>

          <h2>Book Uncovers Vatican Program That Sent Italian Children of Unwed Mothers to US as Orphans</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book, "The Price of Children," reveals a Vatican-run program from 1950 to 1970 that sent approximately 3,500 Italian children to the U.S. for adoption, misclassifying them as orphans. Most of these children were born to unwed mothers who were pressured or misled into relinquishing them to Catholic-run institutions, believing it was temporary. The investigation, based on church archives, found that mothers were often not told their children were being sent overseas, and in some cases, were falsely told their child had died. The program highlights the severe stigma faced by unwed mothers and the lifelong trauma experienced by the adoptees and their birth families.</p>

          <p>Following his victory at The Open, Scottie Scheffler's performance is drawing widespread comparisons to the dominance of Tiger Woods in his prime. In the last four seasons, Scheffler has won four major championships and secured 13 PGA Tour victories, establishing himself as the undisputed world number one. His peers and commentators point to his machine-like consistency and ruthless ability to close out tournaments as "Tiger-like." While Scheffler himself dismisses the comparisons as premature, his calm demeanor, combined with a recently improved putting game, has transformed him into the most formidable force in men's golf today.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced plans to close its Office of Research and Development (ORD), the primary scientific arm responsible for analyzing environmental and health hazards. The move is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to downsize the federal government, which the EPA claims will save over $748 million and allow the agency to better focus on its core mission. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups, have condemned the decision, arguing that eliminating the ORD will cripple the agency's ability to use the best available science and will have generational impacts on public health and safety.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships argues that the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection—the ability to understand their own emotions and needs. The article suggests that common parental responses, such as dismissing a child's fears or sadness, can inadvertently teach them to distrust their own feelings, leading to insecurity and anxiety. To foster this skill, parents are advised to validate their child's emotions, welcome their full selves, and model their own emotional regulation. This approach is said to build resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence, which are crucial for lifelong mental health.</p>

          <p>A nonprofit founded by tech billionaire Adam Miller, called Better Angels, is aiming to prove that affordable housing can be built profitably without taxpayer subsidies. The organization is bidding on several projects in the Los Angeles area, proposing to finance them with private equity and conventional loans, which it claims will reduce costs and construction time significantly compared to traditional tax-credit models. By creating a profitable model, Miller hopes to attract more private, for-profit developers to the affordable housing sector to address the homelessness crisis. The initiative is already backing two smaller projects nearing completion.</p>

Legal experts note this development not only removes what was seen as the most expedient path to a resolution but will also likely trigger more litigation over the manner in which the deals were overruled. With the case still in pretrial hearings after more than two decades, the cancellation makes a trial seem even more distant. The decision leaves 9/11 family members, who are divided on the issue, frustrated and questioning if there will ever be a final outcome.</p>

The man, identified by his wife as Keith Jones-McAllister, was wearing a heavy, 20-pound metal chain used for weight training when he entered the MRI room. The machine's powerful magnetic field immediately pulled him in, causing a fatal "medical episode." His wife stated she had called him into the room to help her up after her scan. MRI facilities have strict protocols requiring the removal of all metal objects due to the immense magnetic force they generate.</p>

Bass was particularly critical of the tactics used, such as masked agents in unmarked cars, which she said resembled kidnappings.
