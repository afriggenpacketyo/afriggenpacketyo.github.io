          <h2>Former Reform MP Rupert Lowe Will Not Face Criminal Charges</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rupert Lowe, formerly a Reform MP for Great Yarmouth, will not face criminal charges related to an allegation of threats. The Crown Prosecution Service made the decision after a detailed review of the evidence, concluding that there was insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. Lowe had been suspended by the Reform party in March amid claims of threats towards the party's chairman. The CPS considered witness statements before reaching its decision, ensuring a thorough assessment of the situation before determining there was not enough evidence to support a conviction.</p>

          <p>Japan's health ministry is planning to eliminate out-of-pocket payments for childbirth, potentially starting in April 2026, to address the country's declining birthrate. The proposed policy involves fully covering normal delivery expenses under the public medical insurance system. Currently, normal childbirth is not covered by Japan's medical insurance, leading to varying costs across prefectures. If implemented, a unified price will be set nationwide, though obstetricians have expressed concerns about potential financial strain on medical institutions.</p>

          <p>Recent market volatility is causing concern for families with 529 college savings plans, particularly those nearing tuition payment deadlines. Experts advise checking asset allocations and assessing risk appetite, with age-based portfolios typically becoming more conservative as college nears. Adjusting allocations to include cash equivalents can provide principal protection, but financial advisors caution against shifting entirely to cash. Recent changes allow rolling over unused 529 funds to a Roth IRA and using them for continuing education, apprenticeships, and student loan payments, enhancing the plans' value (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Social Security recipients in default on student loans may have up to 15% of their benefits reduced to repay the debt, though a minimum of $750 per month must be retained. Borrowers facing offsets may receive less notice under the Trump administration, but still have the right to contest the collection. Preventing the offset is possible by proving financial hardship or having a pending student loan discharge. Borrowers should ensure their loan servicer has current contact information.</p>
