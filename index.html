            <p>An immigration judge has ruled that Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist, can be deported based on claims that he poses a threat to foreign policy, a determination initially made by the Trump administration. The ruling has sparked outrage among Khalil's supporters, who claim it is a violation of his right to free speech and an attempt to silence pro-Palestinian voices. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem praised the decision, while Khalil's attorneys plan to file applications for relief to prevent his deportation. The ruling came despite a federal court case in New Jersey that remains active, which has ruled that Khalil cannot be deported while the proceedings are ongoing.</p>

            <p>Monica Sementilli was found guilty of murder for the 2017 death of her husband, Fabio Sementilli, a famed hairdresser, after a jury trial in Los Angeles. The case involved allegations of an affair with Robert Baker, who pleaded no contest to the murder in 2023 and received a life sentence. Prosecutors argued that Monica conspired with Baker to kill Fabio for financial gain, pointing to evidence of a love affair, secret communications, and her actions on the day of the murder. The defense maintained her innocence, but the jury ultimately sided with the prosecution, finding her guilty on all charges. </p>

            <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to unfreeze federal funding to Maine, which was previously withheld due to the state's refusal to comply with the executive order banning transgender athletes from women's sports. The judge agreed with the state's argument that withholding funding used to feed children and vulnerable adults was inappropriate, even amidst Title IX violations. The Department of Education has also launched an investigation into the state, referring the Maine Department of Education to the Department of Justice for allowing trans athletes to compete in girls' sports. This follows an incident where a Maine state representative identified a trans athlete on social media, leading to her censure.</p>
