          <p>Federal prosecutors have revealed that the man who attempted to assassinate Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2022 also intended to kill two other justices. According to a sentencing memorandum, Nicholas Roske's goal was to "single-handedly alter the constitutional order" due to his opposition to the court's potential overturning of Roe v. Wade. The filing details his extensive premeditation, including online research into murder techniques and the home addresses of multiple justices. Prosecutors are seeking a sentence of at least 30 years to life, arguing his actions constitute a form of terrorism against the U.S. government.</p>

However, Musk later refuted the claim in a post on his social media platform X, stating the report was "fake news" and that xAI is not currently raising capital.

          <p>Former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann strongly criticized ESPN personality Stephen A. Smith for his commentary on Jimmy Kimmel's suspension from ABC. Smith had questioned the comedic nature of Kimmel's remarks about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which led to the suspension. In response, Olbermann accused Smith of being an "idiot" and "prostituting himself to the right wing" for financial gain. This public dispute underscores the deep divisions and intense reactions within the media industry regarding the intersection of comedy, politics, and free speech.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent threats by President Trump and FCC Chairman Brendan Carr to revoke the broadcast licenses of networks like ABC have highlighted the federal government's regulatory power over the media. Broadcast networks such as ABC, NBC, and CBS operate on public airwaves licensed by the FCC, which requires them to serve the "public interest." While this authority has historically been used to address issues like obscenity or children's programming, the current administration is framing it in terms of political bias. Experts note that revoking a license is a complex process that would likely face significant legal challenges based on First Amendment protections.</p>

The government argues that TPS was not intended to be a permanent solution for migrants and is pushing to end the protections while the legal battle continues.

          <p>A CNBC investigation has revealed significant issues with counterfeit goods and fraudulent sellers on Walmart's third-party online marketplace. As Walmart rapidly expanded its e-commerce platform to compete with Amazon, its seller vetting processes reportedly became more lax, allowing bad actors to impersonate legitimate businesses and sell fake products, including potentially dangerous health supplements and beauty items. The report found that some shoppers were unaware they were buying from third-party sellers, assuming the products were backed by Walmart's trusted brand. In response to the findings, Walmart has recently tightened its vetting requirements for sellers in certain categories.</p>

Among the cheapest methods are home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which currently have an average rate of 8.05% and could become cheaper with future cuts due to their variable rates. Home equity loans offer the stability of a fixed rate and are also a cost-effective choice. While no longer in the single digits, personal loans remain a less expensive alternative to high-interest credit cards and do not require putting up a home as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A tribute to the late Robert Redford explores the actor and director's career, highlighting a recurring theme in his work: the hollowness and corrupting nature of victory. From iconic roles in films like "Downhill Racer" and "The Candidate," Redford consistently portrayed characters whose athletic prowess or political success revealed a deeper moral ambiguity. The article argues that his nuanced performances and directorial choices reflected a profound distrust of easy wins and the superficiality of being seen as an icon. This perspective shaped a legacy that valued artistic integrity and truth over the simple celebration of success.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has announced it will raise the retail prices of its Xbox Series S and Series X consoles in the United States, citing "changes in the macroeconomic environment." The price hikes, which will take effect in October, will see the base Xbox Series S increase to $399 and the Series X with a disc drive rise to $649. While the company did not directly mention tariffs, the move follows similar price increases by competitors Sony and Nintendo and comes as many consumer electronics companies grapple with the economic impact of the Trump administration's trade policies.</p>

          <p>American consumers are facing higher grocery bills due to a combination of three primary factors, according to food industry analysts. The Trump administration's tariffs on imported goods, such as coffee, have directly increased costs, which companies are passing on to shoppers. Climate change is disrupting traditional growing regions in the U.S., forcing a greater reliance on more distant agricultural sources. Finally, a shortage of agricultural workers, linked to immigration policies and waning interest in the field, is further straining the food supply chain and contributing to inflation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The indefinite suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show following pressure from the Trump administration exemplifies the inherent vulnerability of free expression in a democracy. This article argues that the very openness that allows for dissent and satire can be exploited by demagogues to silence critics, creating a "paradox of democracy." The author notes that while illiberal tendencies exist on both the left and right, the current situation is distinct because it involves the direct use of state regulatory power to muzzle speech. The capitulation of ABC and station owner Nexstar sets a chilling precedent, signaling that media institutions may self-censor to avoid government retribution.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has notified Congress of its intent to sell nearly $6 billion worth of advanced weaponry to Israel. The proposed package includes 30 AH-64 Apache helicopters and 3,200 infantry assault vehicles, which would significantly bolster the Israeli military's capabilities. This move signals continued strong U.S. support for its ally, even as Israel faces growing international condemnation and isolation over its ongoing war in Gaza.

Officials plan to reinstate a preferred booking system for LNG carriers and are developing a new pipeline project to transport natural gas liquids across the isthmus, freeing up canal slots for other vessels. These initiatives aim to address the decline in energy transits, which fell sharply as shipping companies opted for longer routes to avoid canal restrictions.

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, ruling that the legal complaint failed to meet procedural requirements. The judge stated the filing was not a "short and plain statement" but rather a "platform to rage against an adversary," containing repetitive and superfluous allegations. Trump's legal team has been given 28 days to file an amended complaint that complies with court rules. The New York Times welcomed the swift ruling, characterizing the original lawsuit as a political document intended to stifle independent reporting rather than a serious legal action.</p>

With both chambers now in recess for at least a week, the stalemate increases the likelihood of a funding lapse.
