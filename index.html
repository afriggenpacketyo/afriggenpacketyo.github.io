          <p>Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, thanked President Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending as his time with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) concludes.

          <p>The Trump administration will fly a migrant, known as O.C.G., back to the U.S. after a judge ruled his deportation to Mexico ignored due process. O.C.G., who sought asylum from Guatemala, was deported to Mexico despite an immigration judge's order barring his removal to any country other than Guatemala, and his claims that he was previously held for random and sexual assault during his second attempt to get to the United States. The Justice Department admitted an error in their account of O.C.G.'s removal, and the judge mandated his return. This case highlights ongoing scrutiny of the Trump administration's deportation practices and due process concerns.</p>

          <p>A federal court ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority with his reciprocal tariffs, a setback to his economic agenda. The Court of International Trade found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act did not grant the president the power to unilaterally implement sweeping duties. The Trump administration swiftly appealed the ruling, arguing that foreign countries' nonreciprocal treatment created a national emergency. The suit was brought on behalf of five U.S. businesses that rely on imports, setting up a legal battle that could reach the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

This strategy, however, could clash with the Trump administration's demands to address trade imbalances and end state subsidies to Chinese companies. Experts anticipate that China is unlikely to scale back its manufacturing-led strategy, maintaining trade tensions between the two countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal court has ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority by imposing global tariffs, dealing a blow to a key part of his economic policies. The Manhattan-based court stated that the U.S. Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations, not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The Court of International Trade ruled that an emergency law invoked by the White House does not provide unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country.

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled a contract to develop a vaccine against flu viruses, including the H5N1 bird flu, citing concerns about the safety of mRNA technology. The Department of Health and Human Services terminated a $766 million contract with Moderna, stating that continued investment was not scientifically or ethically justifiable. Experts criticized the decision, arguing it puts American lives at risk and hinders pandemic preparedness. Moderna stated that studies showed positive interim results, and the company will explore alternative paths forward.</p>

This move is in response to China’s recent restrictions on exports of critical minerals to the United States, which threatened U.S. company supply chains. The new limits push the world’s largest economies closer to supply chain warfare. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also announced the U.S. would "aggressively revoke" visas for Chinese students in critical fields or with ties to the Chinese Communist Party.</p>

          <p>Conservative insiders describe Kemi Badenoch's leadership as a "total disaster" amid declining Conservative fortunes. Since July, the party has faced worsening conditions, marked by severe local election results and the rise of Reform UK. Badenoch's strategic call to prioritize policy reviews over immediate policy stances is being criticized as naive. The Conservative Party HQ has also experienced redundancies, contributing to a sense of despondency among party members, even though she has tried to mitigate those concerns.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has launched an investigation into whether California, its interscholastic sports federation, and a school district are violating the civil rights of cisgender girls by allowing transgender students to compete in school sports. The Justice Department is also supporting a lawsuit alleging similar violations in another school district. The legal actions are the latest attempts by the Trump administration to scale back transgender rights nationwide. LGBTQ+ advocates and Democratic lawmakers have denounced the framing of transgender inclusion in sports as diminishing the rights of women and girls.</p>

          <p>The UK Ministry of Defence will spend more than £1bn to develop technology to speed up decisions on the battlefield, with a new Digital Targeting Web connecting soldiers with information from satellites, aircraft, and drones. This investment is part of the government's strategic defense review, highlighting lessons from the war in Ukraine. The UK military will also establish a new Cyber and Electromagnetic Command to oversee military cyber operations. The extra investment is possible because of the government's commitment to increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027.</p>
