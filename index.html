          <p>The United States and China have agreed to de-escalate their trade tensions, adhering to a previous truce. Negotiators from both countries announced the agreement following high-level talks in London, signaling a commitment to the Geneva consensus. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the framework reached would be presented to President Trump for approval, with similar expectations for Chinese President Xi Jinping. The agreement also addresses Chinese restrictions on rare earth exports to the U.S. and potential rollbacks of U.S. tech sales restrictions to China. Optimism surrounding the agreement is tempered by the need for both presidents' approval before implementation.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has announced a tentative launch date of June 22 for the company's robotaxi service in Austin, Texas.

The service will be geofenced to limit the initial operational area, and employees will remotely monitor the fleet.

          <p>An appeals court has issued a temporary pause on a ruling that would have required the Trump administration to provide due process for deported Venezuelans. The pause came a day before the administration was scheduled to outline how nearly 140 Venezuelans deported to El Salvador could challenge their expulsion. The initial ruling had ordered the government to allow these individuals to return to the United States to present their asylum claims, arguing that they were improperly denied due process. The appeals court's decision introduces uncertainty regarding the fate of these asylum seekers and the legal procedures surrounding their deportations.</p>

          <p>Sting, the Grammy-winning singer-songwriter, has criticized successive governments for neglecting the North East of England, where he grew up. He announces a significant donation to the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art in Gateshead, citing discouraging statistics for child poverty in the area. Sting recalls a childhood rich in culture despite humble beginnings, attributing his early exposure to the arts to local institutions like the Wallsend library and the People's Theatre. He describes the now-disappeared Swan Hunter shipyard as a victim of government neglect and emphasizes the importance of cultural experiences for children.</p>
