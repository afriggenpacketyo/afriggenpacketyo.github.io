          <p>China is championing a new development bank for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) as a way to create financial instruments independent of US-led systems. This move is particularly critical for member states like Iran, which faces renewed and severe US sanctions that could cut off its access to global finance. The initiative, highlighted by a $1.4 billion loan pledge from China, signals a broader geopolitical shift as the bloc aims to reduce its vulnerability to Western economic pressure and foster Eastern cooperation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a ruling in the landmark antitrust case against Google, imposing some limits on the company but stopping short of ordering the sale of its Chrome browser. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta deemed a forced divestiture "incredibly messy and highly risky," leading to a 9% surge in the stock of Google's parent company, Alphabet. While the decision is seen as a major win for Google, the judge did clear other remedies, such as requiring Google to share some search data with rivals to foster competition.</p>

          <h2>Analyst Argues Trump Administration is Reframing January 6 Capitol Attack as a Triumph</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents a critical analysis of the Trump administration's recent actions regarding the January 6 Capitol riot, arguing they amount to an effort to rewrite the event's history. The piece highlights the decision to grant military funeral honors to Ashli Babbitt, who was killed during the insurrection, as a key example of this trend. It also points to the pardoning of rioters and the appointment of their legal defenders to Justice Department roles as evidence of a broader project to turn the insurrection into a "delayed triumph" for political gain.</p>

          <p>In a landmark decision for New York state, a judge has ruled that advanced DNA evidence from whole genome sequencing can be used in the trial of Rex Heuermann, the accused Gilgo Beach serial killer. This cutting-edge technique allowed prosecutors to link Heuermann and his family to degraded, rootless hair strands found on the remains of multiple victims. The defense challenged the ruling, arguing the lab is not licensed in New York, but the decision sets a major precedent for using such forensic technology in future criminal cases across the state.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has clarified that the Trump administration has "no immediate plans" to send the National Guard to Chicago, following recent comments from the president suggesting such a deployment was imminent. While President Trump has asserted his authority to send federal forces to quell violent crime, Vance indicated the administration hopes to work with Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who has called the idea "unhinged." This development comes as the administration reportedly plans to expand immigration enforcement in the city and has already deployed the Guard in other major cities.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have successfully voted to create a new subcommittee dedicated to reinvestigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The move, which passed along party lines, is framed by its supporters as an effort to "uncover the full truth," claiming the previous Democrat-led investigation was biased against former President Trump. Chaired by Rep. Barry Loudermilk, the subcommittee will have full subpoena power and is expected to produce a final report by the end of 2026, though Democrats have widely criticized it as an attempt to rewrite history.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has overturned the Trump administration's decision to freeze $2.2 billion in research grants to Harvard University, ruling the action was illegal. Judge Allison Burroughs found that the administration retaliated against the university for its positions on free speech and diversity, using concerns about antisemitism as a pretext. The ruling vacates the freeze orders, which had halted critical research on topics like tuberculosis and Lou Gehrig's disease, and bars the administration from enforcing them.

          <p>The Idaho Attorney General's office has announced that no criminal charges will be filed against the four Pocatello police officers involved in the fatal shooting of Victor Perez, a 17-year-old with autism. Prosecutors concluded they could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were unjustified in using deadly force. The officers were responding to a 911 call about a man with a knife and were unaware of Perez's age or disabilities when they arrived. The family's attorney expressed disappointment but not surprise at the decision and plans to proceed with a civil lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Canada's Félix Auger-Aliassime has advanced to the US Open semifinals for the second time in his career after a hard-fought victory over Australia's Alex de Minaur. Auger-Aliassime overcame a tense, four-set battle, winning 4-6, 7-6(7), 7-5, 7-6(4) in a match marked by nerves from both players. The win represents a significant return to form for the 25-year-old, who has struggled with injuries and confidence in recent years. For de Minaur, it was another heartbreaking quarter-final exit, his sixth at a Grand Slam without advancing to the next stage.</p>

          <p>Linda Stermer, a Michigan woman accused of murdering her husband, Todd Stermer, in 2007, has been found guilty for a second time and sentenced to life in prison. The case involved a house fire from which Todd escaped, only to be run over by Linda in the family van. Her initial 2010 conviction was overturned in 2018 by a federal judge citing prosecutorial misconduct, granting her temporary freedom. However, prosecutors chose to retry the case, and a jury once again convicted her of arson and murder, a verdict supported by her sons but disputed by her daughters.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has denied reports that he was offered a position in the Trump administration in exchange for dropping out of his independent re-election campaign. Speculation arose that advisers to President Trump discussed offering Adams a job at the Department of Housing and Urban Development to consolidate anti-progressive votes behind another candidate, Andrew Cuomo. The goal would be to prevent Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani, the current frontrunner, from winning. A spokesperson for Adams stated the mayor is fully committed to his campaign and has had no such discussions with President Trump.</p>

          <p>Angela Rayner, the UK's Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary, has admitted to underpaying stamp duty tax on a flat she purchased in Hove. She attributed the "mistake" to initial legal advice that did not properly account for complex trust arrangements related to her family home in Greater Manchester. While Prime Minister Keir Starmer has backed his deputy, the Conservative opposition has called for her dismissal, labeling her position "untenable." Rayner has since contacted tax authorities to settle the amount owed and has referred herself to the prime minister's independent adviser on ministerial standards for investigation.</p>

          <p>A renewed effort to prohibit members of Congress and their immediate families from owning or trading individual stocks is gaining traction with the introduction of a new bipartisan bill. The "Restore Trust in Congress Act" consolidates several previous proposals and is supported by a wide range of lawmakers from progressive Democrats to conservative Republicans. The bill would require lawmakers to sell their individual stocks soon after taking office and would impose significant financial penalties for violations. Supporters argue the ban is crucial for restoring public trust, which has been eroded by perceptions of insider trading.</p>

Two-thirds of respondents reported that prices are still increasing and expect them to continue to do so.

          <p>Ten years after German Chancellor Angela Merkel's welcoming "wir schaffen das" declaration during the 2015 migrant crisis, Europe's political landscape has shifted dramatically toward restrictive immigration policies. This in-depth article traces the change from initial public welcomes to the current era of border fences, pushbacks, and deals with non-EU countries to halt migrant flows. The rise of far-right parties across the continent, fueled by concerns over security and economic strain, has pressured even centrist governments to adopt tougher stances. This has led to a complex and often tragic situation for asylum seekers attempting to reach the continent.</p>
