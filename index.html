          <p>Former Conservative minister Nadine Dorries has announced her defection to Reform UK, emphatically stating that the Conservative Party is "dead" and urging its members to consider a new political future. Having served as culture secretary and a health minister under Boris Johnson, of whom she was a close ally, Dorries' departure follows 18 years as an MP and persistent criticism of current Conservative leadership. She explained her decision by pointing to issues like rising crime, specifically shoplifting, and the use of hotels to accommodate migrants, affirming her alignment with Nigel Farage on law and order, immigration, and the need for drastic public spending cuts. This high-profile defection is widely perceived as a significant blow to the Conservative Party and highlights the ongoing realignment within UK politics.</p>

          <p>London City Lionesses have made history by signing France international Grace Geyoro from Paris St-Germain for £1.4 million, setting a new world record fee in women's football. This landmark transfer, which surpasses two other £1 million signings this summer, underscores London City's ambitious strategy, driven by wealthy American owner Michele Kang's substantial investment in the club. Recently promoted to the Women's Super League and operating without affiliation to a men's team, the Lionesses aim to disrupt the traditional hierarchy and become a Champions League contender. Geyoro, a highly experienced midfielder with 103 caps for France, is expected to significantly elevate the team's performance and attract further attention to London City's growing influence in the global football market.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order directing the Department of Defense to use "Department of War" as a secondary title, aiming to project "strength and resolve." This move would revert to a name last used in the 1940s, though a permanent legal change would likely require congressional approval. The White House has not disclosed the potential billion-dollar cost for a full rebrand, which would impact numerous agencies, emblems, and uniforms. Trump and Secretary Pete Hegseth advocate for refocusing the department on "warfighting" and a "warrior ethos," criticizing its perceived emphasis on diversity programs.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has issued a preliminary ruling, determining that Europe is dumping pork and pork by-products into the Chinese market, causing "material injury" to its domestic industry. Starting September 10, importers of the affected European products will be required to provide corresponding deposits to China’s General Administration of Customs, based on the margin determined for each company in this preliminary decision. This action signals escalating trade tensions between China and Europe, potentially impacting agricultural markets and consumer prices in both regions. The move is part of Beijing's broader strategy to protect its domestic industries from perceived unfair foreign competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra abruptly left the country ahead of a crucial Supreme Court ruling that could lead to his imprisonment. His departure occurred just hours before a parliamentary vote to select a new prime minister, following the recent removal of his daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, from office due to an ethics violation. Thaksin, who was ousted in a 2006 coup and lived in exile for years, had returned in 2023 to serve an eight-year sentence, later reduced, but faced claims of special treatment. This political turmoil positions construction magnate Anutin Charnvirakul as a frontrunner for the premiership.</p>

          <p>Argentina's President Javier Milei is aggressively pursuing the nation's copper potential, aiming to capitalize on surging global demand for electrification and renewable energy to stabilize the volatile economy. As part of his "Make Argentina Great Again" agenda, Milei introduced the Large Investment Incentive Regime (RIGI), offering generous benefits to large-scale investors. This scheme has attracted over $30 billion in projects, with copper alone accounting for $16 billion, drawing interest from major players like BHP and Glencore. Experts view Argentina as a highly exciting new copper story, though policy consistency will be crucial for long-term success. (not investment advice)</p>

Sir Tony also praised the UK's robust response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, contrasting it with the earlier Crimea annexation. He urged skepticism against the notion of a new non-NATO "axis" forming, emphasizing the lack of mutual trust among such nations.</p>

However, Russia has rejected the idea, stating such guarantees would not suit its interests.
