          <h2>Germany's Unofficial Economy Surges Amid High Taxes and Dissatisfaction with Public Services</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 04:11:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is experiencing a significant boom in its "shadow economy," with undeclared work projected to reach €511 billion in 2025. Labor market expert Friedrich Schneider attributes this surge to growing public frustration over high taxes and contributions not being matched by the quality of state services, such as unreliable trains and crumbling infrastructure. The article also explores the connection between the rise in undeclared work and the country's citizen's income welfare program, which some critics argue disincentivizes official low-paid employment. While structural fraud exists, experts believe a strong, booming official economy is the most effective way to curb this trend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After securing a trade framework with Japan, the Trump administration is now turning its attention to negotiations with the European Union. The U.S. has set an August 1 deadline for a deal, threatening to impose 30% tariffs on EU imports if an agreement is not reached. The recent U.S.-Japan deal, which reduced auto tariffs without imposing export caps, has raised hopes among some analysts that a similar breakthrough could be possible for the EU. European auto stocks surged following the news, as the sector is a key component of EU exports to the United States and has been a major point of contention in trade discussions.</p>

          <h2>DNA Analysis of Skeletons in Turkey Reveals 9,000-Year-Old Matrilineal Society</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 04:08:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study of 9,000-year-old skeletons from the Neolithic settlement of Çatalhöyük in Turkey has confirmed that the society was organized around women. DNA analysis revealed that individuals buried under the same house were often related through their mother's side, indicating a matrilocal system where men moved in with their female partner's family. This genetic evidence supports earlier archaeological theories based on female figurines and the discovery of more grave goods with female remains. The research also suggests a society that valued equality, as evidence points to the practice of children being raised in neighboring households to ensure a fair distribution of resources.</p>

          <p>Major German automakers, including Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz, saw their shares rise significantly following the announcement of a trade agreement between the United States and Japan. The deal, which lowers U.S. tariffs on Japanese vehicles, has sparked optimism that the European Union may secure a similar breakthrough in its own trade negotiations with Washington. The EU has been under pressure from the threat of increased U.S. tariffs, and the automotive sector is a critical component of its export market. The positive market reaction reflects hopes that the U.S.-Japan agreement could set a favorable precedent for European car manufacturers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While deflationary pressures are a concern, economists argue that China's economy requires more fundamental, long-term reforms rather than just short-term stimulus. According to experts at Peking University, a key issue is boosting "total factor productivity," which has been declining and necessitates significant institutional and technological innovation. The article suggests that the current system for evaluating government officials, which prioritizes GDP growth and major projects over debt management, has contributed to industrial overcapacity. As China formulates its next five-year plan, there are calls for a shift in incentives to focus more on consumption and high-quality development. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a new report from AI firm Anthropic, China is pulling ahead in the global artificial intelligence race due to its significant advantage in power generation capacity. The report highlights that China added 400 gigawatts of power capacity last year, approximately ten times more than the United States. This disparity is particularly concerning as the U.S. AI sector alone is projected to require at least 50 gigawatts of power by 2028. The findings suggest that energy constraints in the U.S. could become a critical bottleneck, hindering its ability to compete with China in developing and deploying large-scale AI models.</p>

The new law gives the prosecutor general, a Zelensky loyalist, increased control over the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap). This move has drawn condemnation from within Ukraine and concern from Western allies, including the EU, which views a strong, independent anti-corruption framework as essential for Ukraine's European integration and a condition for financial aid.

Initial findings indicate the deep-diving mammals were healthy but had not been feeding recently.

          <p>The UK government has revealed that its planned 40% cut to the foreign aid budget will disproportionately affect Africa, with the largest reductions targeting children's education and women's health initiatives. A Foreign Office report acknowledged that these cuts could lead to increased risks of disease and death. While funding for multilateral bodies like the World Bank and the Gavi vaccine alliance will be protected, aid organizations warn that the most marginalized communities will pay the highest price. The government stated the cuts are part of a strategic review to ensure every pound is spent efficiently, focusing on clear priorities.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered another defeat, falling 10-7 to the Minnesota Twins in a game marked by a disastrous performance from their bullpen. In the sixth and seventh innings, Dodgers relievers issued a series of walks and committed a critical fielding error that allowed the Twins to score six runs on just two hits, turning a tie game into a rout. Manager Dave Roberts described the quality of baseball as a "tough watch" and suggested the team may have hit "rock bottom" in its current slump. The loss is the Dodgers' 11th in their last 14 games, highlighting significant pitching issues amid key injuries.</p>

This shift has led to a decline in the local school's population and forces residents to travel for basic shopping. While the tourism industry supports thousands of jobs, the article highlights the growing tension between economic benefits and the quality of life for those who call the Old Town home.</p>

          <p>Despite a challenging UK retail environment, a chain of stores called Duck World, which sells only rubber ducks, is managing to stay afloat in prime London locations. The business, which offers 700 varieties of collectible ducks, appeals to tourists, gift-seekers, and millennial collectors. While facing pressures from inflation and rising costs, the co-founder remains optimistic, citing the iconic status of the rubber duck and the high-profit margins on such novelty items. Retail analysts suggest that the business benefits from "treatonomics," a trend where consumers purchase small, affordable luxuries, but caution that its long-term success may depend on its ability to endure beyond being a fad.</p>

          <p>Leaders from the European Union and China are set to meet in Beijing, but the summit is shadowed by escalating tensions and low expectations for any significant breakthroughs. The relationship is strained by clashes over trade, technology, and China's support for Russia, with analysts noting that the two sides have more to argue about than agree on. The situation is further complicated by U.S. trade policy, as President Trump's adversarial approach puts pressure on the EU to align with Washington on issues like export controls. Analysts believe the biggest deliverable from the summit may simply be that the meeting is happening at all.</p>
