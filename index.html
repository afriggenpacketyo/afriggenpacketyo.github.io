          <p>Warren Buffett, at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting, voiced concerns about President Trump's trade policies, stating that trade should not be used as a weapon. Buffett emphasized that global prosperity ultimately benefits the United States and its citizens, suggesting that a more collaborative approach is wiser than punitive tariffs. He acknowledged that Berkshire Hathaway faces risks from tariffs and geopolitical events, but the company is unable to predict the potential impact. Buffett's remarks come amidst concerns about a contracting GDP and economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a New York Times article, Chinese officials are reportedly considering offering deeper cooperation with the United States in combating the flow of fentanyl as a way to de-escalate the ongoing trade war. China has historically used its willingness to address fentanyl issues as leverage in its relationship with the U.S., and is now considering sending a high-ranking security official to Washington to initiate trade talks. This move comes after increased pressure from the Trump administration and could potentially lead to a simultaneous reduction in tariffs between the two countries.</p>

          <p>President Trump has claimed that grocery and gas prices are falling, but experts say that's misleading. According to ABC News, economists argue that while overall inflation has eased slightly, grocery prices have accelerated and gas prices have remained essentially flat since Trump took office. Experts also note that falling oil prices, which Trump touted as a positive, often indicate expectations of an economic slowdown. Despite some price decreases in certain food items, overall food and gas costs have not declined as Trump asserts.</p>

          <p>According to a New York Times article, Harvard President Alan Garber is navigating a complex situation as he defends the university against federal intrusion while also addressing concerns about campus culture and antisemitism. Garber disagrees with President Trump on many issues but agrees that Harvard has a campus culture problem that needs urgent fixing. He is working to reform Harvard's policies on student discipline, protests, and diversity, while simultaneously fighting against the Trump administration's efforts to cut funding and strip the university of its tax-exempt status.</p>

          <p>A new lawsuit seeks to force the New Jersey State Police to allow mitochondrial DNA testing on envelopes used to send ransom notes in the 1932 Lindbergh baby kidnapping case. Researchers hope that saliva on the stamps and glue used to seal the envelopes could help resolve questions about whether Bruno Hauptmann acted alone. The state police have cited concerns about damaging the evidence as the reason for restricting access. The case remains a source of speculation and conspiracy theories, and DNA testing could potentially provide new insights.</p>

The article critiques the futuristic visions of space colonization and super-intelligent AI as a means to escape government control and establish total corporate control. It suggests that these fantasies offer moral absolution for their actions and gives them a sense of meaning, but offers nothing for the rest of us.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports are raising costs for wedding dresses and threatening the small shops that sell them, according to CNBC. The bridal gown industry, heavily reliant on Chinese manufacturing, faces significant challenges due to the increased duties. Small businesses are struggling to absorb the higher costs, and some brands are adding tariff surcharges. The tariffs have also led to slowed production and uncertainty for the industry, potentially impacting brides and the tradition of finding garments for special occasions.</p>
