          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, wrongly deported to El Salvador, has been brought back to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges. The indictment alleges he conspired to transport aliens and unlawfully transported undocumented aliens. Attorney General Pam Bondi said the Salvadoran government agreed to return Abrego Garcia after being presented with an arrest warrant. President Trump stated that the Department of Justice made the decision to return Garcia, who has a legal team denying all the allegations against him. </p>

          <h2>DOGE Continues Operations After Musk's Departure</h2>

          <p>Despite Elon Musk's departure from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the team's approach to transforming government is becoming "institutionalized." With members embedded in multiple agencies, DOGE's efforts to cut costs and bureaucracy are expected to continue. This suggests that the impact of Musk's work may extend beyond his personal involvement, with his strategies being adopted more widely within the government. This transition shows a degree of stability in the long-term plans. </p>
