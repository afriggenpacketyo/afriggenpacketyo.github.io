          <p>A horrific shooting occurred during a Catholic Mass at Annunciation Catholic Church in south Minneapolis, resulting in the deaths of an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old, and injuring 17 others, including 14 children. The 23-year-old shooter, identified as Robin Westman, approached from outside and fired through windows before dying of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The incident, which happened on the first day of school, has been described as a deliberate act of violence against innocent worshippers. Authorities and community leaders are providing support and calling for action against such violence.</p>

          <p>A recent Lending Tree study, analyzing U.S. Census Bureau data, reveals that nearly 6 million full-time workers earned at least $100,000 in 2023 without a bachelor's degree. This report highlights alternative routes to high-paying careers, challenging the traditional necessity of a four-year college diploma amid rising tuition costs and student debt. Occupations such as software developers, sales engineers, and elevator repairers are among those where a significant percentage of non-college-degree holders achieve six-figure salaries. The findings suggest a shift in employment requirements, with more companies loosening degree mandates.</p>

          <p>A Chicago Teamsters local is demanding that Mauser Packaging Solutions require federal immigration enforcement (ICE) to present a judge-signed warrant before entering their property. This demand is a key part of a two-month-long strike by about 140 workers, many of whom are Latino, who also cite concerns over employee surveillance. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has publicly supported the Teamsters, advocating for worker protections and criticizing federal government actions he views as targeting immigrants and people of color. Johnson, a former teachers' union figure, has called Chicago a 'welcoming city' and referred to President Trump as a 'dictator'.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved the latest COVID-19 vaccines but with new limits, clearing them only for individuals at higher risk of severe illness, such as those aged 65 and up or younger adults with underlying conditions. This policy shift, championed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., marks a departure from previous broader authorizations and could complicate access and insurance coverage for healthy adults. The decision follows Kennedy's changes to the CDC's vaccine advisory panel, which now includes known vaccine critics. Pediatric and obstetric groups have expressed deep concern over the limited approval, urging broader access for children and pregnant women.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors in Washington, D.C., were unable to secure a felony indictment from a grand jury against Sean Dunn, a former Justice Department employee. Dunn, 37, admitted to throwing a 'submarine-style sandwich' at a Customs and Border Patrol officer on August 13. Despite video evidence showing Dunn yelling expletives and throwing the sandwich before attempting to flee, the grand jury declined to indict him. Dunn was subsequently fired from his paralegal position at the Justice Department after his arrest.

          <p>YouTube TV subscribers could lose access to Fox channels, including sports, business, and news, due to an ongoing contract dispute over carriage fees. Google-owned YouTube claims Fox is demanding payments significantly higher than those received by partners with comparable content. If a deal isn't reached by the Wednesday deadline, YouTube TV has offered a $10 credit to affected members. Fox, meanwhile, accused Google of exploiting its influence and urged them to engage meaningfully in negotiations. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr has also called for a resolution, highlighting the importance of access to news and sports for millions of Americans.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reiterated his commitment to protecting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, vowing to prevent cuts to these programs if Congress pursues a reconciliation bill. Trump emphasized that Social Security is 'doing great' and will be protected, despite projections from the 2025 Trustees Report indicating the program's trust fund will run out by 2033. His administration recently passed the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act, offering a temporary tax deduction for seniors, which critics argue provides limited benefit to the program's long-term solvency. The Social Security Administration is also working towards becoming a 'digital-first agency' to evolve for future generations.</p>

Draper had been struggling with a bruised humerus since April, causing him to miss previous tournaments to recover.

          <p>For 2025, the maximum monthly Social Security benefit for a senior retiring at full retirement age is $4,018, increasing to $5,108 for those who wait until age 70.

This article explains that the exact maximum amount is only available to a specific birth cohort and emphasizes the significant impact of claiming age on benefit amounts.

While this strategy can boost engagement and brand visibility, marketing experts caution against opportunistic approaches that lack genuine relevance, noting that the rapid saturation of such reactions can lead to consumer ambivalence.

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly accused Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud, alleging she claimed primary residency in two different states. This accusation follows Trump's announcement of Cook's removal, which her attorney states is beyond the President's authority, vowing a lawsuit. Experts highlight that owner-occupancy mortgage fraud, while a housing market issue, is notoriously difficult to prove in court, requiring specific intent to deceive rather than just a mistake. Borrowers are motivated by lower interest rates and tax benefits for primary residences, but proving fraud involves establishing intent and is considered 'small ball' in a legal context.</p>

          <p>Despite market expectations of a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September, credit card interest rates are unlikely to fall significantly in the near future. Most credit cards have variable APRs tied to the prime rate, but issuers typically adjust rates slowly and less generously after Fed cuts compared to hikes. Additionally, high credit card delinquency rates and inflation remaining above the Fed's target contribute to lenders maintaining higher APRs to offset risk. The article advises consumers to proactively seek lower rates through negotiation, balance transfers, debt management plans, or personal loans rather than waiting for market-driven changes.

          <p>Lego, the Danish toymaker, reported a 12% increase in revenue and 13% growth in consumer sales for the first half of 2025, reaching a record $5.44 billion USD. This success is largely attributed to the popularity of its Botanical collection, which has expanded since its 2021 launch with flower-themed brick sets. Additionally, strategic brand partnerships with franchises like Formula 1 and the children's animated series 'Bluey' significantly boosted sales. Lego plans further collaborations, including with Pokémon next year, reinforcing its position as the world's largest toymaker.

          <p>Israeli forces are pushing further into Gaza City, preparing for a full invasion aimed at dismantling what they describe as Hamas's last stronghold, despite ongoing international condemnation and a declared famine in the region. This military escalation comes as tens of thousands of Israelis are protesting, demanding their government agree to a ceasefire deal to secure the release of the remaining 50 hostages held by Hamas. Protesters criticize Prime Minister Netanyahu for prioritizing the offensive over a comprehensive hostage deal, with some accusing him of 'scuttling the deals.' International mediators await Israel's formal response to a US-backed ceasefire proposal, while the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains dire.</p>

          <p>Far-right activist Tommy Robinson will not be charged in connection with an alleged assault at St Pancras railway station in London on July 28. British Transport Police (BTP) confirmed that the Crown Prosecution Service concluded there was insufficient evidence to bring charges, partly because the alleged victim declined to provide a statement. Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was arrested in August on suspicion of grievous bodily harm but maintained he was acting in self-defense. Footage from the incident showed Robinson near a motionless person on the floor, prompting a police investigation that ultimately led to no criminal charges.</p>

          <p>The concept of universal basic income and unrestricted cash transfers, once hailed as a solution for economic justice, is facing renewed scrutiny following recent studies. These studies indicate that direct cash aid did not consistently produce lasting improvements in mental health, stress, or financial well-being for low-income recipients. This has sparked debate, with critics on the right questioning the efficacy of such social policies, while proponents argue that cash transfers are primarily intended to cut poverty and provide basic security, not to 'fix' individuals. The article highlights nuances in the research, including the impact of external factors like the pandemic, and notes that while some enthusiasm may wane, the movement for cash assistance continues to evolve with new experiments and positive findings in specific contexts.</p>

Key questions for analysts include the performance of Nvidia's new Blackwell chips and the state of its business in China, especially after the Trump administration's shifting stance on export licenses and China's push for homegrown chips.

Passengers are allowed a free small carry-on bag, with larger ones incurring fees up to £75. The airline is also scrapping an €80 monthly cap on staff earnings from this bonus, encouraging ground handlers to enforce rules for faster boarding and fewer flight delays.
