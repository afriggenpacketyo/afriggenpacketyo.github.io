The company called the posthumous request a mistake by an employee and has since been in contact with the family to express its regret.</p>

          <p>Baek Se-hee, the South Korean author of the internationally bestselling memoir "I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki," has died at the age of 35. Her 2018 book, which compiled conversations with her psychiatrist, was celebrated for its honest portrayal of depression and its role in normalizing mental health discussions globally. Following her death, her family confirmed that her donated organs—including her heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys—helped save the lives of five individuals, fulfilling her wish to inspire hope.</p>

          <p>The article explores the evolving relationship between President Trump, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, and Russian President Putin, noting a significant shift in Trump's tone. It suggests that Trump's recent tougher stance on Putin may stem from Ukraine's battlefield successes and a realization that Russia may be a losing power. This new dynamic sets a different stage for the upcoming diplomatic talks in Washington and a planned meeting between Trump and Putin in Budapest to discuss the war's end.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's policies have created an existential crisis for American farmers, which the author dubs "Farmageddon." The author contends that retaliatory tariffs from China have decimated markets for key crops like soybeans, while the concurrent government shutdown has cut off access to critical USDA loans and support programs. This combination has left farmers squeezed by soaring production costs and plummeting prices, threatening the viability of family farms across the heartland.</p>

          <p>Negotiations in Congress to end the ongoing government shutdown have reportedly stalled, with little sense of urgency on Capitol Hill. This is partly because the Trump administration has taken unilateral steps to mitigate some of the most visible public impacts, such as ensuring military members receive their paychecks.

          <p>China has launched military training exercises near the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea, a move that coincides with the final day of the annual "Sama Sama" joint naval drills involving the Philippines, the United States, Japan, and other allies. This action comes amid a period of heightened tensions between Beijing and Manila over several contested maritime territories in the resource-rich waterway. The overlapping military activities underscore the escalating risk of conflict in the strategically vital region.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Donald Trump's sustained attacks on fact-checking and the concept of "misinformation" represent a fundamental assault on the principles of objective truth. The author points to recent decisions by major tech companies like Google and Meta to move away from professional fact-checkers in favor of crowdsourced "community notes" as evidence of this dangerous trend. This shift is framed as an unraveling of Enlightenment values, where verifiable facts are being replaced by a consensus-driven reality that threatens reasoned public debate.</p>

          <p>The article examines the immense cultural and historical expectations being placed on basketball prodigy Cooper Flagg as he begins his NBA career with the Dallas Mavericks. It situates his arrival within the long-standing "Great White Hope" narrative in American sports, a racial mythos dating back over a century, particularly relevant in a franchise known for its white superstars. Flagg must navigate the dual pressures of reviving a team still reeling from Luka Dončić's departure and confronting this complex racial baggage.</p>

          <p>Colonel Michael Randrianirina has been sworn in as the new president of Madagascar after leading a military coup that ousted President Andry Rajoelina, who has since fled the country. The takeover followed weeks of widespread, youth-led protests against chronic poverty, and electricity and water shortages. The African Union has condemned the coup and suspended Madagascar's membership, while a military-led council is expected to govern for up to two years before organizing new elections.</p>

          <p>U.S. semiconductor firm Micron Technology plans to cease supplying server memory chips to data centers located within mainland China, according to sources familiar with the decision.

While acknowledging the changing competitive landscape, Mackenzie stressed that the pub's unique role as a community gathering place remains its core strength.</p>

          <p>Indonesia is actively working to establish direct export channels to China for its fresh durians, a strategic move aimed at significantly increasing profits for its growers. Currently, Indonesian durians are often routed through neighboring countries like Malaysia and Thailand, which handle the necessary cold-chain logistics and phytosanitary approvals for Chinese customs. By developing its own capabilities, Indonesia hopes to capture a larger share of the vast Chinese market, which consumes over 90% of the world's durian production.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new scientific study highlights the dual threat facing major coastal cities like Shanghai, which are simultaneously sinking due to land subsidence and facing rising global sea levels. The research, published in the journal Nature, attributes at least 94% of this urban subsidence to man-made activities, primarily groundwater extraction. This combination of sinking land and rising waters creates a severe long-term risk for these densely populated delta regions, which are often built on soft, compacting sediment.</p>

          <p>In response to the unpredictable and often escalating U.S. tariffs, many Chinese exporters are strategically shifting their focus away from the American market. They are actively seeking new buyers and building relationships in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa to diversify their revenue streams. While official data indicates overall Chinese exports have grown, individual manufacturers report that the loss of the large U.S. consumer base has led to intense price competition in new markets and a significant drop in profits.</p>
