        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged to a new record high, driven by gains in technology and real estate sectors. The rise followed the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to lower its benchmark interest rate, a move Chairman Jerome Powell described as a precautionary "risk management cut." While some Asian markets like South Korea's Kospi also saw gains, others, including Australia's ASX/S&P 200 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng, experienced declines amid the mixed economic signals. The Fed's announcement also hinted at the possibility of two additional rate cuts before the year's end, influencing investor sentiment across the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>ABC has taken "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air for an indefinite period following controversial comments made by the host. Kimmel linked the individual accused of killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk to former President Donald Trump's MAGA movement, sparking significant backlash. The decision came after pressure from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, who suggested ABC's broadcast license could be at risk, and a pre-emptive cancellation by Nexstar Media Group's affiliated stations. While Kimmel has not been fired, the move has ignited a fierce debate about free speech, media responsibility, and political pressure on broadcasters.</p>

          <p>A suspect named Donald Henson is in federal custody after allegedly driving his car into the entrance gate of the FBI's Pittsburgh Field Office in what authorities initially termed a "targeted attack." After the crash, Henson reportedly threw an American flag over the gate before fleeing on foot. No injuries were reported, and a bomb squad was called to clear the vehicle, which had messages written on its windows. Officials noted that Henson had recently visited the office to make a complaint and is believed to have a history of mental health issues.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines CEO Dave Davis has informed employees of impending job cuts and a significant reduction in flight schedules starting in November. The struggling discount carrier, which recently emerged from its second bankruptcy, plans to cut capacity by 25% to lower costs and focus on its most profitable markets. The airline is currently in negotiations with vendors and aircraft lessors to re-evaluate its fleet size, which will directly impact staffing levels across the company. These measures are part of a broader strategy to stabilize the airline's finances amid high costs and weaker-than-expected travel demand.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 22:28:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, analysts anticipate that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) will pursue only modest monetary easing for the remainder of the year. This cautious approach is expected to help support the yuan by narrowing the interest rate gap between the two countries, thereby easing capital outflow pressures. On Thursday, the PBOC set a slightly weaker midpoint rate for the yuan, but the offshore yuan had strengthened overnight after the Fed's announcement. Economists suggest a potential 10 basis point cut from the PBOC later in the year, a smaller adjustment than the Fed's. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>USC defensive coordinator D'Anton Lynn stated that he has not been contacted by UCLA regarding its vacant head coaching position and that his focus remains on improving the Trojans' defense.

NASA announced that the issue was traced to a conservative safeguard in the software settings and has been resolved. Astronauts Jonny Kim and Zena Cardman will use the station's robotic arm to capture the spacecraft, which is carrying over 11,000 pounds of supplies, spare parts, and research materials for the crew.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced his intention to designate the decentralized, far-left activist movement known as antifa as a "major terrorist organization." The move raises legal questions, as the U.S. government does not have a domestic terrorism statute equivalent to the one for foreign entities, partly due to First Amendment protections. Trump called antifa a "SICK, DANGEROUS, RADICAL LEFT DISASTER" and urged an investigation into its funders. The announcement follows a similar proposal from 2020 and comes amid a charged political atmosphere, with critics arguing antifa is an ideology rather than a structured organization.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Current forecasts predict the storm will track north of the Caribbean and stay over open waters for several days, posing no immediate threat to land. However, the system is expected to intensify over the weekend and could develop into a low-grade hurricane by Sunday. While its path remains uncertain, forecasters suggest it may approach Bermuda next week as it continues to strengthen, with potential maximum sustained winds reaching 85 mph.</p>

          <p>Frank Somerville, a former longtime news anchor for KTVU in the Bay Area, was arrested on suspicion of assault following a physical altercation with his adult daughter. In a now-deleted social media post, Somerville claimed the fight occurred after his daughter arrived at his home unannounced and a dispute over money escalated. This marks Somerville's fourth arrest in four years, following previous incidents including DUI charges and an altercation with family members. His attorney described the situation as a delicate family issue that she hopes can be resolved outside of the criminal justice system.</p>

          <p>Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of assassinating Charlie Kirk, surrendered peacefully after his family helped broker the arrangement with law enforcement. According to Washington County Sheriff Nate Brooksby, Robinson was "truly fearful of being shot by law enforcement" and did not want a SWAT raid on his family's home. A retired detective and friend of the sheriff facilitated the surrender, bringing Robinson to the sheriff's office where he was met by plainclothes detectives. Robinson has since been charged with aggravated murder, and prosecutors have stated their intent to seek the death penalty.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume the equivalent of nearly two alcoholic beverages per day by eating naturally fermented fruit. Researchers chemically tested the figs and plum-like fruits that make up the chimps' diet and found an average alcohol content of about 0.3% by weight. While this low dose is not enough to cause intoxication, the steady consumption supports the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in ancestral fruit-eating habits. The study provides the first direct chemical measurements of ethanol in fruits routinely consumed by wild chimps.</p>

          <p>According to a new report, California continues to have the highest poverty rate in the U.S., a position it shares with Louisiana. The California Budget and Policy Center found that in 2024, approximately 17.7% of residents could not afford basic necessities, a rate that has shown little improvement since a surge in 2023. The report attributes the stubbornly high rate to the expiration of pandemic-era anti-poverty programs like the federal child tax credit, which had previously helped lower poverty to a historic low. Researchers warn that recent federal and state budget cuts could cause poverty to rise further.</p>

          <p>Enrique Tarrio, a key leader of the Proud Boys, revealed that the far-right group has activated a network to identify and target individuals who celebrated the assassination of Charlie Kirk online. The campaign's goal is to pressure employers to fire these individuals, a tactic Tarrio acknowledges was previously used against his own group. Tarrio, who was released from prison after being pardoned for his role in the January 6th insurrection, stated his mindset has shifted to "an eye for an eye." The effort is part of a broader right-wing response to Kirk's killing, which has also seen some militia groups use the event as a recruiting opportunity.</p>
