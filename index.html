          <p>Scotland is facing continued disruption as cleanup operations begin after Storm Floris, described as the most damaging summer storm in recent memory. The storm caused widespread power outages, affecting around 50,000 homes, and significant travel chaos with numerous train and flight cancellations. While the main weather alert has passed, a yellow warning remains in place, and authorities are working to restore power and clear transportation routes. The Scottish government held an emergency meeting to address the significant disruption and advised caution.</p>

          <p>Tennessee is proceeding with the execution of Byron Black, a 69-year-old inmate convicted of a 1988 triple murder. The case is unprecedented as Black has a working implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, raising legal and ethical questions about whether the device could cause undue pain during the lethal injection. Despite appeals and concerns from his attorneys that the execution could become a "grotesque spectacle," the state's governor and the U.S. Supreme Court have allowed it to move forward. The state disputes the device would cause suffering, arguing Black would be unresponsive.</p>

          <p>Following a narrow series loss to India, analysis suggests England's cricket team faces a monumental challenge in the upcoming Ashes series in Australia. The team's success appears heavily dependent on the fitness and performance of captain Ben Stokes, who embodies the 'Bazball' spirit. With a poor track record in Australia over the last decade and a squad largely inexperienced in those conditions, a victory would be considered one of Stokes' greatest accomplishments. The article highlights the contrast between England's strong batting lineup and Australia's formidable bowling attack, setting the stage for a highly anticipated contest.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest amid an ongoing trial into an alleged coup plot. The decision by Justice Alexandre de Moraes came after Bolsonaro allegedly violated previous precautionary measures by communicating with supporters during a protest via his son's phone. The case has drawn international attention, with the Trump administration condemning the order and sanctioning the justice, creating a tense diplomatic situation. Bolsonaro's lawyers plan to appeal the ruling, which has intensified Brazil's political divisions.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the St. Louis Cardinals 3-2 after a late-game collapse by their bullpen wasted a strong performance from starting pitcher Tyler Glasnow. Glasnow pitched seven impressive innings, allowing only one run, while Cardinals' starter Sonny Gray was equally dominant. The game was decided in the final innings after both starters exited, with the Cardinals scoring the winning run in the ninth inning off a pinch-hit single. The loss highlighted the Dodgers' bullpen struggles, which conceded more runs in a short span than Glasnow did all night.</p>

          <p>Thirty years after Croatia's 'Operation Storm,' the event is remembered with starkly different perspectives in Croatia and Serbia, highlighting ongoing regional tensions. In Croatia, the 1995 military offensive that recaptured territory is celebrated as a heroic victory and a key moment in its war of independence, marked by a large military parade. Conversely, Serbia views it as a tragic 'pogrom' that led to the mass expulsion and killing of ethnic Serbs, commemorating it as a day of mourning. The differing interpretations underscore the deep-seated historical grievances that still influence political rhetoric in both nations.</p>

          <p>An analysis piece argues that Poland's recent political developments serve as a cautionary tale for liberal democracies worldwide. Less than two years after ousting the populist Law and Justice party, the country saw a right-wing populist candidate win the presidency, and Prime Minister Donald Tusk's coalition is struggling. The article suggests that post-populist governments often get bogged down in reversing their predecessors' legal and institutional damage, failing to offer a compelling future vision. This dynamic can lead to public frustration and a swift return of populist forces, a pattern potentially repeating in other nations.</p>

While some other global militaries have moved away from this type of aircraft for modern warfare, Beijing seems committed to the strategy.

The ministry also pointed out that both the U.S. and EU continue to engage in significant trade with Russia themselves. (not investment advice)</p>

The agreement, valued at 10 billion Australian dollars, is described as the largest defense-industry deal ever between the two nations and strengthens their strategic partnership in the Indo-Pacific. The move is part of Australia's broader military restructuring to enhance long-range strike capabilities in response to China's military expansion. The first three warships will be built in Japan, with the remaining eight to be constructed in Western Australia.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) has agreed to pay $1.7 million to settle a lawsuit brought by 45 California counties alleging the company improperly disposed of hazardous waste. The investigation found that UPS had discarded corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials in regular trash bins, which were then sent to landfills not equipped to handle such waste. UPS was reportedly cooperative with the investigation and has already implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs across its California facilities to prevent future violations and ensure environmental safety.</p>

          <p>It is currently tarantula mating season in California, leading to increased sightings of the large, fuzzy spiders as males leave their burrows in search of mates. The season, which runs from August to December, sees male tarantulas traveling long distances, making them more visible in areas like Joshua Tree National Park, the Santa Monica Mountains, and Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. Experts note that while their appearance can be intimidating, native California tarantulas are generally harmless to humans unless provoked and their bite is not considered dangerous, though their hairs can cause skin irritation.</p>

          <p>A growing shortage of volunteer firefighters across the U.S. is straining emergency services and could force more communities to switch to paid departments, a move that would significantly increase costs for taxpayers. Volunteers constitute nearly 70% of the nation's firefighters and save an estimated $46.9 billion annually, but their numbers have declined by over 20% since 1985 while emergency call volumes have tripled. Lawmakers are considering incentives like student loan forgiveness to boost recruitment, as departments struggle to maintain staffing levels and ensure community safety.</p>

The team also found evidence that the cave system was used for human burials during the earlier Neolithic period.

The ad had previously drawn some online criticism for its wordplay on "genes" and "jeans," which some interpreted as having racial undertones. Trump's endorsement, which contrasted the campaign with what he called "woke" advertising, fueled a meme-driven rally for the retailer's stock.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) warns that Taiwan's energy supplies are highly vulnerable in the event of a military blockade by mainland China. Based on war-gaming scenarios, the report estimates that Taiwan's natural gas reserves would be depleted in just 11 days, coal in seven weeks, and oil in 20 weeks. However, the authors also concluded that a blockade would not be a low-risk option for Beijing, as it would likely incur high casualties and could easily escalate into a wider conflict involving the United States and Japan.</p>

          <p>Wildlife officials in California are issuing a warning after multiple wild pigs in Monterey County were found to have blue-dyed muscle and fat tissue. The discoloration was caused by exposure to a rodenticide called diphacinone, which the pigs likely consumed either directly or by eating other animals that ingested the bait. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is urging pesticide applicators to use methods that prevent non-target wildlife from accessing bait. They are also advising hunters to avoid consuming any game animal that shows signs of blue tissue or other abnormalities.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows a significant increase in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among people aged 45-49, which is linked to a rise in screenings for this age group. Following recommendations to lower the screening age to 45, screenings increased by 62% from 2019 to 2023. This has corresponded with a sharp rise in the detection of localized cancers, which are more treatable. While researchers call the findings promising, they note that screening rates for this younger demographic remain suboptimal and inequitable across different socioeconomic groups.</p>
