          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of fatally stabbing four University of Idaho students in November 2022, has accepted a plea deal that spares him the death penalty.

          <h2>UK house prices experience sharpest monthly drop in over two years</h2>

          <p>According to mortgage lender Nationwide, UK house prices fell by 0.8% in June, marking the largest single-month decline since February 2023. This drop is thought to reflect a temporary dip in demand following April's changes to stamp duty rules, which made home purchases more expensive for many. Despite the monthly fall, the annual price growth rate remains positive at 2.1%, and economists anticipate that market activity will pick up again in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>
