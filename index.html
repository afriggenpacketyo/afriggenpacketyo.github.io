          <p>Following the second round of direct talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that both countries are preparing for a new prisoner exchange. Delegations exchanged documents through the Turkish side, with Ukraine also handing over a list of children it wants Moscow to return, claiming they were forcibly removed from Ukrainian territory, while Moscow claims the children were relocated for their safety. Expectations for a breakthrough remain low, as both parties have submitted written proposals outlining their demands, revealing a significant gap in reaching an agreement to end the conflict. Ukraine seeks an internationally monitored 30-day ceasefire as a starting point for peace talks, based on a U.S. proposal.</p>

          <p>Ukraine launched a drone attack on Russian military air bases, reportedly planned and coordinated from inside Russia over the past 18 months, causing damage to Russian bomber aircraft. The attack occurred a day before the second round of direct talks between Russia and Ukraine in Turkey, with Ukraine claiming to have damaged or destroyed 41 Russian bomber aircraft at bases across the country, while asserting that no Russian civilians were endangered. Ukraine's SBU intelligence agency stated that Russia cannot bomb Ukraine with impunity, vowing to destroy the enemy everywhere. Despite the escalation, delegations from both countries met in Istanbul for negotiations, with Ukraine demanding a full and unconditional ceasefire and the return of Ukrainian children and civilian hostages, while Russia has not revealed any new conditions or terms for a hypothetical ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Stocks of major U.S. steel companies experienced a significant jump after President Trump announced the doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum, increasing them from 25% to 50%. This move, enacted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, aims to address what the administration deems a national security threat. However, the spike in U.S. steel tariffs is sparking concern that consumers could face price hikes on big-ticket products and even groceries. The European Union has announced it is preparing countermeasures against the United States in response to the higher tariffs, signaling potential trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that President Trump's attempts to pressure China into trade concessions through export controls are unlikely to succeed. Washington recently unveiled new restrictions on the sale of jet engine and chip design technologies to China.

          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Norway have surged by 213% in May compared to the previous year, contrasting with a downward trend observed across Europe. The increase is mainly attributed to the sales of the revamped Model Y compact SUV. Despite this surge, Tesla's European sales have recently suffered a decline due to reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk's rhetoric and political activities. However, Norway's EV incentives, including VAT exemption and discounts on road taxes, contribute to the popularity of EVs in the country.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has refused to hear a Second Amendment challenge to blue-state bans on assault weapons. The challenge aimed to overturn laws in Maryland, California, and eight other states that restrict semiautomatic guns. Three conservative justices voted to hear the case, but Justice Kavanaugh declined to cast the key fourth vote, suggesting the court may address the issue in the future. This decision leaves in place the existing bans on assault weapons in the affected states.</p>

These include fewer repayment plans, with a new income-based option replacing existing income-driven plans, and new borrowing limits for undergraduates and graduates. The plan also entails the removal of deferment and forbearance options, limiting borrowers' ability to pause payments during economic hardship. Finally, the proposal aims to limit future changes to repayment, providing more stability to the system. (not investment advice)</p>

This tax increase has sparked investor alarm, with analysts noting that Illinois' rate will be among the highest in the country.

The economy's performance and the Federal Reserve's actions will play significant roles in silver's future price movements.
