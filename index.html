          <p>A Texas judge has scheduled an October 16 execution for Robert Roberson, convicted in the 2002 death of his daughter. Roberson's case has drawn significant attention due to evolving scientific understanding of "shaken baby syndrome," the diagnosis central to his conviction. His legal team and supporters, including a bipartisan group of lawmakers, argue that new evidence proves his innocence and that the child's death was a tragic accident, not a crime. They plan to seek a stay of execution while appeals challenging the original conviction are still pending in higher courts.</p>

          <p>A powerful 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck off the southern coast of Alaska, leading authorities to issue a tsunami warning for the peninsula. The quake occurred approximately 50 miles south of Sand Point, prompting immediate alerts from the National Weather Service. The situation is developing, with coastal communities advised to follow emergency protocols. The warning highlights the region's vulnerability to significant seismic activity and the potential for dangerous tidal waves following such events.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to replace high-fructose corn syrup with real cane sugar in its beverages sold in the United States. This potential shift follows public health concerns about corn syrup, notably voiced by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In a social media post, Trump praised the move as "just better" and beneficial for the company, though Coca-Cola has not yet issued a formal comment confirming the change. The announcement signals a potential major shift in the ingredients of one of America's most iconic products.</p>

Survivors and their attorneys are split, as fewer eligible claimants would mean higher individual payouts but could also empower opponents to reject the entire settlement deal.</p>

          <p>Several U.S. states, including Louisiana and Texas, are enacting their own food safety laws that reflect the agenda of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. These state-level actions, such as mandating warning labels for artificial additives and banning soda purchases with food stamps, are outpacing federal reform. Kennedy has supported these efforts, which align with his "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) platform. This strategy allows the administration to push its food policy goals without creating new federal regulations, potentially forcing national food companies to alter their products.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ), based at the Peace Palace in The Hague, serves as the principal judicial body of the United Nations. Composed of 15 judges from different nations, it adjudicates legal disputes between states, distinct from the International Criminal Court (ICC) which tries individuals. Its jurisdiction applies when states consent to it or when a dispute falls under a UN convention like the Genocide Convention. While its rulings are legally binding, the ICJ has no enforcement mechanism, relying on the cooperation of the involved parties.</p>

The historic estate, once owned by actors Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck, features a 12,000-square-foot main house and several other structures. Despite multiple owners over the years, the property has surprisingly never been subdivided. The current owner completed a four-year remodel, and with eight separate parcels, the estate offers significant potential for a developer.</p>

          <p>Andrea Gibson, the poet laureate of Colorado, has died at age 49 after living with ovarian cancer. Known for their seven books of poetry, Gibson's work often explored themes of love, kindness, and empathy with a plain but tender style. After receiving a terminal diagnosis, Gibson famously refused to "battle" cancer, instead choosing to embrace the brevity of life, which they said led to some of their most joyous moments. Their writing, which was both politically charged and deeply personal, earned them a dedicated following for its unselfconscious earnestness.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government is restricting tariff-free imports of foreign steel to shield its domestic industry from the effects of U.S. tariffs. Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that tariff rate quotas will be tightened, and imports exceeding the new limits will face a 50% tariff, with an additional levy on steel originating from China. The move comes after the Trump administration imposed heavy tariffs on Canadian steel, causing a significant drop in Canadian production. Canada also plans to prioritize using domestic steel in federal government projects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 2022 data breach by a UK official, which exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had sought relocation, has been made public after a court injunction was lifted. The leak prompted a covert UK government operation, the Afghanistan Response Route (ARR), to secretly relocate those at highest risk. The government has spent £400m so far, with about 900 individuals and 3,600 family members already in or en route to the UK. The revelations raise serious questions about government secrecy and the safety of those still in Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>A recent Economist/YouGov poll indicates that President Donald Trump's disapproval rating has hit a second-term high of 55%, compared to a 41% approval rating. The decline in favorability appears to be driven primarily by a drop in support among Democrats and independents since he took office in January. The survey also touched upon the recent controversy surrounding the closure of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. It found that a majority of Trump's own 2024 voters, 59%, believe the government is covering up evidence in the case.</p>

This move is part of an effort to resolve a dispute with the Trump administration, which has frozen $400 million in federal grants over allegations that the university failed to protect Jewish students. Critics of the IHRA definition argue that it can be used to stifle legitimate criticism of Israel by conflating it with antisemitism. The decision is one of several concessions Columbia has made to restore its federal funding.</p>

          <p>A recent uptick in the Consumer Price Index, which rose 2.7% annually in June, is raising concerns about the future of credit card interest rates. Since the Federal Reserve often keeps interest rates high to combat inflation, and credit card APRs are tied to the Fed's benchmark rate, consumers could face higher borrowing costs. While the Fed is expected to hold rates steady in the short term, continued inflation could force them to maintain or even increase rates later. This environment makes it more challenging for consumers carrying debt to pay down balances. (not investment advice)</p>
