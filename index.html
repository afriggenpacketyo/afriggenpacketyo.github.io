          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 20:51:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Harvard study analyzing data from over 66,000 nurses found a significant correlation between experiences of violence and heart health. The research, published in Circulation, revealed that women who had been stalked had a 41% higher risk of cardiovascular disease, while those who had obtained a restraining order faced a 70% higher risk. These findings suggest that such traumatic experiences should be considered alongside traditional risk factors like diet and exercise when screening for heart health. Researchers hope this will lead to better preventative care and improve overall women's health outcomes.</p>

          <p>As autumn approaches, stargazers can look forward to several notable celestial phenomena. Key events include Saturn reaching its opposition on September 21st, making it appear at its largest and brightest for the year. Additionally, the Orionid meteor shower, originating from Halley's Comet, will be active from early October to early November, peaking around October 22nd. The article notes that viewing conditions for the Orionids will be ideal due to the peak coinciding with a new moon, minimizing light pollution. Other events are also mentioned for sky-watching enthusiasts.</p>

          <p>Three Austrian nuns in their 80s have defiantly returned to their former convent after being moved to a care home against their will. With the help of former students and a locksmith, Sister Bernadette, Sister Regina, and Sister Rita re-entered the Kloster Goldenstein convent, where they had lived and worked for decades. The nuns stated they were unhappy in the care home and were exercising their right to live in the convent until the end of their lives. Church authorities have expressed disapproval, citing the nuns' health and the unsuitability of the convent for proper care.</p>

          <p>An ICE agent shot and killed Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez in Franklin Park, Illinois, during an attempted arrest. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the incident occurred after Villegas-Gonzalez resisted and tried to drive his vehicle into the agents, striking and dragging one officer. The agent, reportedly fearing for his life, discharged his firearm, and Villegas-Gonzalez later died at a hospital after crashing his car. The injured agent was also hospitalized but is in stable condition. The shooting has prompted calls for a full investigation from local officials, including the release of all video footage.</p>

          <p>A CBS News analysis revealed that AI tools, including X's chatbot Grok, rapidly spread false information following the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Grok incorrectly identified the suspect multiple times, generated altered photos of the person of interest, and provided contradictory information about the suspect's voter registration. Other AI services, like Perplexity and Google's AI Overview, also produced inaccurate information, labeling the shooting a "hypothetical scenario" or misidentifying individuals. Experts explain that generative AI's probabilistic nature makes it prone to error during fast-moving news events, highlighting the growing challenge of AI-driven misinformation.</p>

          <p>A Palestinian businessman in Tulkarm alleges that Israeli soldiers occupied his family's home for over three months, using it as a base before setting it on fire. Nasser Faratawi claims his property, which included his business and luxury apartments, was vandalized with graffiti, and his belongings were destroyed before the fire in June. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated it was "not aware of any arson" but acknowledged that a complaint is under review. The incident highlights the routine military use of Palestinian homes in the West Bank, where tensions and violence have escalated since the start of the war in Gaza.</p>

          <p>New research from Policy in Practice indicates that seven million households in the UK are failing to claim £24 billion in available benefits and government support. The analysis identifies awareness, complexity of the application process, and social stigma as the primary barriers preventing people from accessing aid like universal credit and pension credit. While the amount of unclaimed support is rising, the report also notes progress in some areas, such as increased uptake of pension credit. The government states it runs campaigns to promote benefits, but experts argue the system's complexity is a significant hurdle for those in need.</p>

          <p>Following the arrest of suspect Tyler Robinson, legal analyst Phil Holloway has called for further investigation into potential co-conspirators in the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Holloway noted that Robinson was reportedly communicating with others on Discord about the attack and was provided with the rifle, suggesting a conspiracy. He argues that anyone who knowingly encouraged or assisted Robinson, such as by providing the weapon, could be criminally liable. While Utah officials have stated no additional arrests are currently expected, Holloway emphasizes that authorities should investigate the firearm's origin, which could lead to further charges.</p>

Such incidents are common in the DR Congo, where river transport is essential but vessels are often old, poorly maintained, and dangerously overloaded.

According to his family, he had become more political in recent years and had expressed a strong dislike for Kirk, calling him "full of hate."

The recovered rifle had casings engraved with messages, including "hey fascist! CATCH!" and a reference to an Italian anti-fascist song.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated the move would reduce regulatory burdens on businesses, claiming the data collection has no material impact on health or the environment.

The film is described as feeling more like a feature-length collection of outtakes than a fresh satirical take. While the lead actors still show improvisational chemistry, the gags feel tired and the overall effort is a nostalgia lap that doesn't reach 11.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Uber, alleging widespread discrimination against passengers with disabilities. The suit claims that Uber drivers frequently refuse service to individuals with service animals, illegally charge cleaning fees for animal shedding, and deny requests for passengers to use the back seat for mobility devices. The government argues these actions have caused significant hardship for disabled individuals, who have missed appointments or been left stranded. Uber responded that it prohibits such discrimination and has policies and a hotline in place to address violations, stating it disagrees with the lawsuit's allegations.</p>

          <p>The California state legislature has passed Senate Bill 79, a significant housing bill designed to increase density by overriding local zoning laws near public transit. The bill, which now heads to the governor's desk, allows for the construction of taller, denser apartment buildings near bus and train stations, including in some single-family neighborhoods. Proponents argue the measure is a necessary step to address the state's severe housing shortage and affordability crisis. However, critics, including the Los Angeles City Council, contend that it is a "one-size-fits-all" mandate that strips local control over responsible development.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's search for the next Federal Reserve chair has expanded to include Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income. Rieder reportedly interviewed with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is leading the selection process. The administration is considering multiple candidates, including former Fed governors, as it seeks new leadership and structural changes at the central bank. Rieder, like current chair Jerome Powell, comes from a Wall Street background rather than traditional academic economics. President Trump has been openly critical of the Fed's interest rate policies, demanding significant cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

Instructors and participants note that classes are now attracting more teenagers and young adults, a significant shift from the dance's previous association with older demographics. The modern form of line dancing also incorporates a wider variety of music genres beyond traditional country, from pop to rock, broadening its appeal and helping to break down old stereotypes.</p>

          <p>This article contrasts the responses of Utah Governor Spencer Cox and President Donald Trump to the assassination of Charlie Kirk. While Trump immediately cast blame on the "radical left" and called for aggressive reprisal, Cox consistently urged calm, unity, and a rejection of rage-filled politics. The author highlights Cox's pleas for Americans to log off social media and engage in constructive dialogue as a direct counterpoint to the president's divisive rhetoric. The piece suggests that while Cox represents a conciliatory impulse within the GOP, Trump's more inflammatory approach is currently the dominant force in the party.</p>

          <p>A recent academic assessment has begun to analyze the economic effects of U.S. sanctions on China's Xinjiang region, imposed over alleged human rights abuses. The sanctions, which began in 2019 and expanded under the Uygur Forced Labour Protection Act, have targeted 144 Chinese companies, effectively blocking their goods from the U.S. market. While Beijing has condemned the sanctions as an attempt to undermine the region's stability, the full economic impact remains a subject of study. The targeted industries include apparel, electronics, and critical minerals, affecting companies both within Xinjiang and in other major Chinese export hubs.</p>

In response, Paramount stated its opposition to the campaign, arguing that silencing artists based on their nationality does not promote understanding or peace.

          <p>This opinion piece explores why many on the religious right were quick to call Charlie Kirk a martyr following his assassination. The author, a professor of American religious history, argues that Kirk's brand of evangelicalism, which rejected empathy and promoted confrontational politics, aligns with a modern right-wing Christian movement that sees itself in a cultural war. This perspective contrasts with an earlier form of evangelicalism that emphasized service and compassion. The article questions whether Kirk's legacy fits the traditional concept of martyrdom, suggesting his death is being used to validate a political and religious ideology built on division.</p>

Maresca confirmed that he has not seen either player since the season began, as they use different facilities and train at different times.

RPI was reportedly chosen for its "unique ability" to link data, though experts in the autism research community have questioned the choice and the necessity of the study itself.
