          <p>Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers, who were convicted of cutting down the Sycamore Gap tree, were also suspects in a sexual assault investigation. The investigation involved alleged homophobic assaults that occurred around the same time as the tree felling. One victim reported being doused in icing sugar and verbally abused, and later identified himself in videos of other men suffering homophobic abuse. Despite the police preparing a file, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided against bringing charges due to insufficient evidence and time elapsed, a decision the victim challenged unsuccessfully.</p>

          <p>This week's inflation report will provide initial insights into the effects of President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff policies on U.S. prices. Economists anticipate a slight cooling in inflation, with prices expected to increase by 2.3% over the year ending in April. Trump has since eased some tariffs, including temporarily reducing levies on China from 145% to 30% for 90 days, while China also agreed to cut tariffs on U.S. goods. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has cautioned that sustained tariffs could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth.</p>

          <p>Manchester United will hold a barbeque at the club's Carrington training ground if they win the Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur. No parade is planned, and players are restricted to two free tickets each for the match. These measures are part of cost-cutting efforts at the club, which have included redundancies and the removal of free lunches for staff. Staff will not receive free tickets for the game; instead, a viewing party will be hosted in central Manchester.</p>

          <p>Faced with rising health care costs and a deepening budget crisis, California Governor Gavin Newsom must reconsider his promise of universal health care, potentially scaling back coverage for immigrants without legal status. The state has expanded Medicaid to cover an estimated 1.6 million immigrants, but costs have soared to $9.5 billion per year. Lawmakers are considering freezing enrollment, imposing cost-sharing measures, or restricting benefits. Any resulting budget trouble could harm Newsom's political legacy, especially if he runs for president in 2028.</p>

          <p>Texas farmers along the Rio Grande are struggling due to a prolonged drought and a dispute over water deliveries from Mexico, as required by an 80-year-old treaty. Mexico has historically been behind on delivering water, causing significant losses for Texas farms. President Trump has pressured Mexico with the threat of tariffs and denied water requests. While Mexico has pledged to make immediate deliveries, it may not be enough to meet the treaty obligations, and some farmers fear the relief will be temporary. The situation has impacted the entire region, leading to the closure of a sugar mill and threatening the citrus industry.</p>

While the tariff reduction is welcome news, it also creates uncertainty and potential logistical challenges. The tax on Chinese imports to the U.S. will drop from 145% to 30%, and China will lower its tariffs on U.S. goods from 125% to 10%. Some businesses are considering producing and shipping products early for the Christmas season to avoid the risk of higher tariffs in the fall.</p>
