          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson and Representative Anna Paulina Luna have reached a deal to allow new parents to vote by proxy, addressing legislative paralysis in the House. The agreement formalizes a "vote pairing" procedure where an absent member coordinates with a present member on the opposite side to offset their absence. Luna will not trigger her bipartisan discharge petition, as Johnson explores ways to increase accessibility for new mothers in Congress, such as adding a nursing room near the House floor. The procedure was used in 2018 when the Senate voted to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed the recent stock market decline, stating he doesn't want markets to fall but considers it necessary "medicine" to fix trade deficits, particularly with China. He emphasized the need to resolve the trillion-dollar trade deficit, indicating a willingness to deal with China if they address their surplus. These comments followed a global stock market sell-off triggered by Trump's planned tariffs, with U.S. stock futures dropping significantly. Trump also shared a video on his Truth Social account suggesting the market drop was intentional for broader economic plans.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department is appealing a judge's order to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, arguing the court lacks authority to compel the Executive branch's engagement with a foreign power. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, was deported despite a 2019 ruling protecting him from deportation due to potential persecution by gangs. The White House has described the deportation as an "administrative error," while Abrego Garcia's lawyers argue the government has failed to take action to correct its mistake.

          <p>Newly qualified medical students are facing uncertainty as they are only being informed of their job locations weeks before starting, leading to logistical challenges and anxiety. The NHS has implemented a new system where students are assigned "placeholder jobs," indicating only the general region they will be working in. This change, intended to address fairness concerns, has resulted in more students not receiving their preferred placements.

This revision reflects a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the new trade war and potential negotiations.

          <p>U.S. oil prices have fallen below $60 a barrel, reaching their lowest level since 2021, due to concerns that President Trump's global tariffs will trigger a recession. Futures tied to U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude dropped more than 3% on Sunday night. Worries are mounting that the tariffs could lead to higher prices for businesses, slowing down economic activity and hurting demand for oil. The price of WTI has declined after back-to-back 6% declines last week.</p>

          <p>The UK government has relaxed rules for car manufacturers ahead of the 2030 ban on petrol vehicles. The measures are intended to support the industry amidst new tariffs and the transition to electric vehicles. Smaller firms will be allowed to keep making petrol cars beyond the 2030 deadline, and some hybrid vehicles can stay on the market until 2035. The government said it is working with UK car manufacturers to simultaneously "strengthen its commitment to the phase out" while introducing "practical reforms to support industry meet this ambition".</p>
