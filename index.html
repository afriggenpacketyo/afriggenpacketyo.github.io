          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries amid a congressional impasse that threatens a government shutdown. The meeting comes after Democratic leaders demanded direct negotiations, refusing to support what they term a "dirty spending bill" that omits their healthcare priorities. Competing Republican and Democratic funding proposals failed in the Senate, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown after the September 30 deadline. The House and Senate have left Washington, adding pressure to reach a resolution to keep the government operational.</p>

The 27-year-old secured the prestigious prize ahead of her international teammate Mariona Caldentey, with several English players also placing in the top 10. This victory continues a five-year streak of Barcelona players winning the award, following Alexia Putellas's wins in 2021 and 2022. Bonmati's win comes after a remarkable season where she overcame viral meningitis to lead Spain to the Euro 2025 final and win a domestic treble with her club.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced that the FDA will advise doctors against prescribing Tylenol to pregnant women, citing a disputed link to autism. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated that drug labels will be updated and a public health campaign will be launched to raise awareness. However, this move is met with significant skepticism from medical experts and major health organizations, who point to inconclusive studies and maintain that acetaminophen is one of the safest pain relievers available during pregnancy. The drug's manufacturer, Kenvue, has strongly disputed the administration's claims, emphasizing the health risks of untreated fever in expectant mothers.</p>

          <p>A Sacramento district attorney has suggested that the recent shooting at an ABC affiliate station may have been politically motivated, potentially influenced by the network's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel. The suspect, Anibal Hernandez Santana, allegedly left behind disturbing notes referencing Jeffrey Epstein and high-ranking Trump administration officials, alongside an anti-Trump book. According to DA Thien Ho, the circumstantial evidence points to a targeted attack, connecting the suspect's actions to the recent controversy surrounding the late-night host. Hernandez Santana is now facing both state and federal charges for the incident at KXTV ABC10.</p>

The suspect, Jacob Samuel Winkler, faces a felony charge that carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. According to the criminal complaint, a Secret Service officer witnessed Winkler aim the laser at the low-flying helicopter, an act that poses a significant danger by risking pilot disorientation and flash blindness.

          <p>Denmark's largest airport in Copenhagen has suspended all take-offs and landings following the sighting of two to three large drones in the vicinity. The closure, which began Monday evening, has led to the diversion of at least 35 flights to other airports. Police are currently investigating the incident, and there is no timeline for when the airport will reopen. An airport spokesperson confirmed the airspace closure due to the unidentified drones, which has caused significant disruption to air travel. Similar drone sightings have also been reported in Oslo, the capital of Norway.</p>

          <p>The iconic Reel Inn seafood shack, destroyed in a fire months ago, may have a chance to rebuild after California State Parks reversed its initial decision. The owners, Andy Leonard and Teddy Seraphine-Leonard, were originally told they could not rebuild on the state-owned land and could only bid to operate a temporary food truck nearby. Following public outcry, the state agency has now reaffirmed its commitment to partnering with the owners to bring the beloved restaurant back. While a clear timeline has not been provided, this development offers a glimmer of hope for the return of the 40-year-old establishment, a cherished landmark for locals and tourists.</p>

          <p>A social media post by President Trump demanding Attorney General Pam Bondi prosecute his political rivals has caused confusion, with some administration officials believing it was an intended private message. The post explicitly named former FBI Director James Comey, Senator Adam Schiff, and New York AG Letitia James, stating "They're all guilty as hell." The message, which also pushed for the appointment of his former lawyer to a U.S. attorney role, resembled Trump's typical texting style, according to sources. Critics, including Adam Schiff and Hillary Clinton, condemned the post as an open call for political retaliation and an authoritarian weaponization of government.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to reconsider a 90-year-old legal precedent that shields officials at independent federal agencies from being fired by the president without cause. The case, which will be heard in December, stems from President Trump's efforts to remove members of the Federal Trade Commission. The court's conservative majority has already allowed several of Trump's firings to proceed, signaling a potential willingness to overturn the 1935 ruling from *Humphrey's Executor v. United States*. Such a decision could fundamentally alter the separation of powers by giving the president direct control over agencies designed to operate with political independence.</p>

          <p>Two months after a major wildfire destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and closed the park's North Rim, questions about the initial fire management strategy remain unanswered. The Dragon Bravo Fire, ignited by lightning on July 4, was initially managed with a "confine and contain strategy" but exploded under dry, windy conditions. Arizona's elected officials have called for investigations into the response, but say they have received little information from the National Park Service. While the fire caused significant economic damage to local businesses, an ecological assessment found that most of the area burned at low severity and is expected to recover quickly.</p>

          <p>The White House has detailed a new ownership structure intended to allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. while addressing national security concerns. The plan involves creating a U.S.-based joint venture with a majority of American investors and board members, which will control the app's U.S. operations and its powerful algorithm. Software company Oracle will provide comprehensive security oversight, continuously monitoring the technology to prevent malicious use or undue influence. While the White House expressed confidence that China has approved the deal, Beijing has not publicly confirmed the final agreement, leaving some uncertainty about the app's future.</p>

          <p>Shares of mortgage lender Better Home & Finance Holding Co. experienced a dramatic surge of over 46% after a positive recommendation from Eric Jackson, president of EMJ Capital.

He highlighted the company's use of AI to innovate in the mortgage industry and noted its valuation is significantly lower than comparable newly public firms. This endorsement sparked a massive rally, with the stock more than doubling at one point during the trading session. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, homeowners looking to borrow $50,000 against their home equity face a choice between a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC). Currently, a HELOC is slightly cheaper on a monthly basis, with its variable rate benefiting from the cooling rate climate. However, a home equity loan offers the stability of a fixed interest rate over the entire loan term, protecting borrowers from future rate hikes. This article advises homeowners to carefully weigh the immediate savings of a HELOC against the long-term predictability of a home equity loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AquaStar Corp. is recalling over 85,000 bags of frozen shrimp sold at Kroger and other retailers across 31 states due to potential contamination with the radioactive element cesium-137. The recall affects several products, including "Kroger Raw Colossal EZ Peel Shrimp," sold between June and September 2025. The FDA alert notes that while the products originated from a facility with insanitary conditions, no shrimp have yet tested positive for the isotope. Consumers are advised to dispose of the recalled products or return them for a refund, as long-term exposure to cesium-137 can elevate cancer risk.</p>

          <p>Estonia is calling for a more forceful NATO response after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets conducted a prolonged, 12-minute violation of its airspace. An Estonian lawmaker suggested that future incursions should be met with a response similar to Turkey's 2015 shootdown of a Russian bomber. The incident is the latest in a pattern of Russian provocations against NATO members, prompting Estonia to invoke Article 4 consultations. While some analysts and officials in Poland advocate for a firm military deterrent, others caution against overreacting and escalating tensions with Russia, which denies any violation occurred.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's stop-work order against Orsted's Revolution Wind farm, allowing the renewable energy company to resume construction. The Interior Department had ordered a halt to the nearly completed project off the coast of New England, which is set to power over 350,000 homes. Judge Royce Lamberth granted Orsted a temporary injunction, stating the company was likely to succeed in its lawsuit and would suffer irreparable harm if work remained stopped. The ruling represents a significant setback for President Trump's efforts to shut down the U.S. offshore wind industry.</p>

          <p>New York Democratic mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani has withdrawn from a scheduled WABC-TV town hall to protest the network's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show. Mamdani framed his decision as a stand against corporate leaders who prioritize their bottom line over the freedom of the press in the face of government pressure. The suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" followed criticism from the FCC chairman over the host's remarks about the killing of a right-wing activist. Mamdani's protest adds to the growing backlash from politicians and free-speech advocates against ABC and its parent company, Disney, for what they see as capitulating to authoritarian pressure.</p>
