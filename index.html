          <p>Austin Robert Drummond, the 28-year-old suspect in the killing of four people in Tennessee, was apprehended in a wooded area following a weeklong manhunt. The victims included Cortney Rose, her two children, and her daughter's boyfriend. The same day the bodies were discovered, an infant belonging to two of the victims was found safely in a stranger's yard. Drummond now faces multiple charges, including four counts of first-degree murder and aggravated kidnapping, while four other individuals have been arrested for allegedly assisting him after the fact.</p>

          <p>Bangladesh's interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, has announced that the country will hold its next general election in February 2026. This will be the first election since a widespread popular uprising led to the ousting of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government a year ago. In a broadcast address, Yunus confirmed that his caretaker government would facilitate the transfer of power to an elected body following the vote. He stated his intention to formally request the Chief Election Commissioner to arrange the election before the start of Ramadan.</p>

          <p>Students in Scotland have seen a slight increase in exam pass rates for National 5, Higher, and Advanced Higher qualifications compared to the previous year. The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) also reported a reduction in the attainment gap between students from the most and least deprived areas. Despite some mail delivery delays due to Storm Floris, over 147,000 candidates received their results. Education officials celebrated the positive outcomes, noting a return to pre-pandemic performance levels and a record number of university and college placements offered to young Scots.</p>

The industrial firm surpassed sales and earnings expectations, driven by significant profit margin expansion and better-than-expected cash flow. Management raised its full-year guidance and reaffirmed the November 1 target for spinning off its electronics division, which has benefited from the AI boom. The club views the stock's muted reaction to the positive news as an attractive buying opportunity. (not investment advice)</p>

In a CNBC interview, he stated that JPMorgan gave him 20 days to move hundreds of millions in cash, while Bank of America declined his attempt to open an account for a deposit exceeding one billion dollars. Trump suggested this was due to regulatory pressure under the Biden administration. The allegations resurface claims of financial institutions discriminating against conservative clients, an issue the Trump administration is reportedly addressing via executive order.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he is no longer considering Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent for the position of Federal Reserve chair, as Bessent wishes to remain in his current role. Trump stated he would soon name his nominee for an open seat on the Fed's board, potentially elevating that person to chair when Jerome Powell's term ends. He mentioned former economic adviser Kevin Hassett and former Fed governor Kevin Warsh as strong contenders. The announcement follows Trump's ongoing criticism of Powell for not cutting interest rates more aggressively amid a slowing economy.</p>

The zoo stated that feeding its predators "whole prey" is essential for imitating their natural diet and ensuring their welfare and nutritional needs are met. It assured that the donated animals are euthanized gently by trained staff before being used as fodder. The controversial request has generated a strong public response, prompting the zoo to limit comments on its social media posts.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly set to propose a plan for the full military occupation of the Gaza Strip. According to Israeli media, the strategy aims for the "full conquest" of the territory and the complete defeat of Hamas. The proposal has drawn criticism, including from former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who warned it would lead to an endless war with heavy casualties. This development comes as indirect ceasefire talks have stalled and amid growing international pressure to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and revive a two-state solution.</p>

AI is now listed among the top five reasons for layoffs this year, with the technology sector being hit particularly hard. Since 2023, the outplacement firm has linked over 27,000 job losses directly to AI's advancement.

          <p>American consumers may soon see sharp price increases on popular Swiss products like luxury watches, skincare, and chocolate if a threatened 39% U.S. tariff is enacted. The high tariff rate has surprised analysts and businesses, who are now scrambling to negotiate a deal to avert the levies.

          <p>President Donald Trump has intensified his criticism of India for purchasing discounted Russian oil, threatening to substantially increase tariffs on Indian goods. He accused New Delhi of "fueling the war machine" and profiting from the sales. This follows a previous threat of a 25% duty on Indian exports. The Kremlin responded by stating that sovereign nations like India have the right to choose their own trade partners. The escalating rhetoric signals souring relations between Washington and Moscow, which had been more cordial at the start of Trump's second term.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's threats to impose tariffs on countries trading with Russia, analysts believe China will continue purchasing Russian oil. The strategic energy relationship is seen as mutually beneficial, providing China with a stable and secure resource supply. After the U.S. took action against India for its Russian oil imports, China is viewed as the next likely target. However, China's foreign ministry has asserted it will act based on its national interests, stating that "tariff wars have no winners." Russia was China's top crude oil supplier in the previous year.</p>

          <p>Yum Brands, the parent company of KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, has developed a reputation for being an incubator for top executive talent in the restaurant industry. Numerous high-profile CEOs at rival chains, including the leaders of Starbucks, Brinker International, and Cracker Barrel, previously held senior roles within the Yum system. Analysts attribute this trend to the company's strong focus on leadership development and a culture that provides executives with significant growth opportunities. The vast scale of Yum's global operations creates a competitive environment that often propels its alumni to top positions elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Yum Brands reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of analyst expectations, largely due to struggling sales at its KFC and Pizza Hut chains in the United States. Both brands saw a 5% decline in U.S. same-store sales, as executives admitted their value messaging and new menu items failed to resonate with consumers. In contrast, Taco Bell continued to perform well, reporting a 4% increase in same-store sales, driven by new chicken products. The company is undergoing a leadership transition, with CFO Chris Turner set to become CEO in October. (not investment advice)</p>
