            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen alleges that the El Salvadorian government initially attempted to prevent him from visiting Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national mistakenly deported from Maryland, before reversing course. Van Hollen accuses the government of staging photos during his visit to portray Abrego Garcia as living comfortably, despite being held in a notorious prison. Abrego Garcia's deportation is under legal scrutiny, with the Supreme Court ordering the government to facilitate his return, though the White House has resisted. Van Hollen emphasizes that the case is about protecting constitutional rights, urging the administration to present evidence in court to support claims of Abrego Garcia's alleged gang affiliation.</p>

            <p>Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Austan Goolsbee discussed the potential economic impact of President Trump's tariffs, noting anxieties among Midwest business leaders about significant impacts on their operations. Goolsbee acknowledged preemptive purchasing behavior due to tariff concerns, which could lead to artificially high activity followed by a summer slowdown. He emphasized the importance of monetary independence from political interference to maintain the Fed's credibility and ensure stable inflation and economic growth. Goolsbee expressed hope that the tariff situation could lead to a new golden age of global trade, but also cautioned against repeating the high inflation rates of 2021 and 2022.

            <p>Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey criticized the Trump administration's decision to freeze funding for Harvard University, highlighting the detrimental effects on research, science, and American competitiveness. She stated that research labs are shutting down, scientists are leaving the U.S., and clinical trials are being halted due to the cuts, which also impact teaching hospitals like Boston Children's. Healey argued that the funding freeze undermines the state's efforts to lower costs and build more housing, especially with Trump's tariffs increasing the cost of lumber and building materials. She also condemned Trump's call for Harvard to lose its tax-exempt status, calling it an attempt to silence critics.</p>

            <p>Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey has publicly criticized President Trump's attacks on Harvard University, arguing that these actions are damaging American competitiveness by forcing research labs to shut down and scientists to seek opportunities abroad. Healey noted that these cuts are having a ripple effect, impacting local hospitals, such as Boston Children's, and leading to the layoffs of scientists and doctors. She emphasized that the state cannot compensate for the loss of federal funding and that Trump's tariffs are only making the situation worse. She also noted that the President's actions were a form of weaponization of government power.</p>

            <p>Solicitor General John Sauer responded to the Supreme Court's overnight order temporarily blocking the removal of alleged Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang members to El Salvador, calling it "unprecedented" and wrong. Sauer argued the plaintiffs have no standing to seek an injunction since the government has already paused their deportations. He implored the justices to limit the sweeping order to only a pause on AEA removals, not any removals of Venezuelan alleged gang members. The Supreme Court's order followed an emergency appeal from the ACLU, contending immigration authorities were moving to restart removals under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.</p>

            <p>Trump administration border czar Tom Homan defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, asserting that the administration "did the right thing" by removing a public safety and national security threat. He criticized Senator Chris Van Hollen's visit to Abrego Garcia, accusing him of supporting an MS-13 gang member, and argued that due process rights are more limited under the Alien Enemies Act, which the administration invoked. Homan denied that tattoos alone determine gang membership, stating they are one of many factors considered. Homan's defense came shortly before the Supreme Court temporarily halted the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans being held in Texas.</p>

            <p>Israel acknowledged "professional failures" in the deaths of 15 Palestinian paramedics in Gaza last month, following criticism from human rights groups and the United Nations. An internal investigation found breaches of orders and an "operational misunderstanding" by troops, with poor night visibility also contributing to the incident. A commanding officer will be reprimanded, and a deputy commander dismissed, though it's unclear if criminal charges will be filed. The investigation claimed that six of the victims were Hamas members but provided no supporting evidence, while Hamas is designated as a terrorist organization by Israel, the US, and other countries.</p>

            <p>A new study has found that jet lag is more severe when traveling eastward, with travel-related sleep disruption taking longer to recover from than previously thought. Researchers analyzed sleep patterns during 60,000 trips and found that while sleep duration recovers quickly, sleep timing can take significantly longer to realign when heading east, as one effectively "loses" time. The body's circadian rhythm is less confused when traveling westward because the direction "prolongs" the body's experience of a normal day-to-night cycle. The study also found that young adults feel the negative sleep effects on long flights more than older adults.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's stance on immigration reflects a preference for wealthy individuals, aligning with the idea of selling citizenship or residency. While many find the concept of commodifying national belonging distasteful, numerous countries, including the United States, offer residency in exchange for investment. Trump's approach to immigration seems to prioritize financial gain, potentially overlooking other valuable contributions immigrants can make to society. The article suggests that Trump's focus is on attracting "uber-rich" immigrants, highlighting his emphasis on lucre and economic efficiency.</p>

While Republicans generally support Trump's policies, including tariffs, Utahns are wary of cuts made by Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency and his ideas to make Canada and Greenland a part of the U.S. The poll also revealed that nearly half of Utahns approve of Vice President J.D.

The findings asserted that six of those killed were Hamas members, though video footage showed the ambulances had lights flashing and logos visible, and the medics did not appear to be acting in a threatening manner.</p>
