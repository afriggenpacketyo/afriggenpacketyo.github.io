The suspect allegedly reversed his car into a child's front-yard birthday party, killing 31-year-old Ashley Hernandez Gutierrez and injuring 13 others, including eight children. Sunday fled the scene but later surrendered to authorities and now faces charges including negligent manslaughter.

          <p>American cattle ranchers are voicing strong opposition to President Trump's suggestion of importing beef from Argentina to lower consumer prices. They argue this move would undermine the domestic market at a critical time when ranchers are already contending with drought and the re-emergence of the parasitic screwworm. Industry groups like the National Cattlemen's Beef Association state that government intervention would create chaos and harm rural America, urging the administration to focus on biosecurity and market-based solutions instead. Ranchers believe the focus should be on eradicating animal diseases and supporting domestic production rather than substituting it with imports.</p>

          <p>Rabbi Angela Buchdahl, the first Asian American to lead New York's Central Synagogue, shares her perspective on faith, identity, and leadership in a recent interview. She emphasizes that her personal experiences as a Korean Jew, often feeling like an outsider, cultivated a deep sense of empathy that now defines her ministry. In her new memoir, "Heart of a Stranger," Buchdahl argues that radical compassion and understanding shared humanity are essential, especially amid rising antisemitism and political division. Her message resonates with a global online audience, highlighting a belief that true strength in faith comes from empathy rather than power.</p>

          <p>A White House official has clarified that there are no arrangements for a meeting between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in the near future. This statement follows President Trump's earlier announcement of a potential summit in Budapest to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. While Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov held a call described as productive, the Kremlin has indicated that any high-level meeting would require serious preparation. The U.S. administration continues to navigate its diplomatic strategy regarding the ongoing conflict, balancing calls for a ceasefire with support for Ukraine's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk, known for its popular drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, is set to undergo a significant boardroom overhaul. Seven board members, including the chairman and vice chair, will not seek re-election following a disagreement with the majority shareholder, the Novo Nordisk Foundation, over the company's future governance. This change comes amid increased competition from rivals and a recent profit warning, which has impacted the company's valuation after it briefly became Europe's most valuable company in 2024. The foundation's chairman, a former CEO of the pharma company, is being proposed as the new chairman.</p>

          <p>Lord Bracadale has resigned as the chairperson of the public inquiry into the 2015 death of Sheku Bayoh, who died after being restrained by police in Kirkcaldy, Scotland. The resignation follows persistent criticism from the Scottish Police Federation, which questioned his impartiality after he held private meetings with Mr. Bayoh's family. Lord Bracadale stated that it became clear many core participants had lost confidence in his leadership, which he felt would damage public trust in the inquiry's final report. He expressed hope that a new chair will be appointed swiftly to restore confidence and continue the investigation into the circumstances of Bayoh's death.</p>

          <p>General Motors saw its stock rise over 15% after the automaker significantly beat Wall Street's third-quarter earnings expectations and raised its financial guidance for 2025. The company reported adjusted earnings of $2.80 per share on $48.59 billion in revenue, exceeding analyst forecasts. GM now projects higher full-year adjusted earnings and free cash flow, signaling confidence despite a reported 57% drop in net income due to charges from its electric vehicle pullback. CEO Mary Barra credited the strong performance to the company's compelling vehicle portfolio and the collective efforts of its team.</p>

          <p>Leading defense and aerospace companies, including GE Aerospace, Northrop Grumman, RTX, and Lockheed Martin, have raised their financial forecasts for the year, citing robust demand that is offsetting economic uncertainties and tariffs. All four firms surpassed Wall Street's third-quarter profit estimates, driven by increased defense deliveries and strong performance in commercial aviation sectors. Lockheed Martin's CEO noted "unprecedented demand" from both U.S. and international customers, prompting aggressive investments in production capacity. This industry-wide optimism reflects a surge in defense spending and a resilient market for both military and commercial aerospace products.</p>

          <p>Despite the ongoing federal government shutdown, student loan borrowers still have access to several resources for assistance. While the Department of Education is closed, its website, Studentaid.gov, remains operational for services like applying for repayment plans or loan consolidation. Furthermore, since student loan servicers are government contractors, they continue to operate, handling billing, payments, and applications for forbearance or deferment. Borrowers can also seek help from nonprofit organizations, state student loan ombudsmen, or by filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau if they encounter issues with their loans.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department has directed its employees to refrain from sharing photographs of the ongoing demolition work in the White House's East Wing. The construction is part of President Trump's plan to build a new, privately financed $250 million ballroom. The warning was issued after images of excavators tearing down parts of the historic complex, taken from the adjacent Treasury building, went viral online. A Treasury spokesperson stated the measure was a precaution to prevent the careless sharing of images that could reveal sensitive security features or confidential structural details of the White House complex.</p>

          <p>A recent article in The Atlantic examines the complex relationship between income and parental happiness, challenging a popular narrative that wealthier mothers are the most stressed and unhappy. While some data suggests higher-income mothers experience unique pressures related to intensive parenting, a broader look at research indicates they generally report higher life satisfaction than their lower-income counterparts. Sociologists note that factors like education, partnership status, and work environment all significantly influence parental well-being. The article concludes that parenthood is emotionally complex for all, and the struggles of affluent mothers highlight the need for more robust, universal family-friendly policies.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Pancho Villa: World Champion, 1923," celebrates the legacy of Francisco "Pancho Villa" Guilledo, the first Filipino boxer to win a world title. Co-authored by artist Joe Aquilizan and professor Dr. Bernard Remollino, the book draws on a vast collection of memorabilia to tell the story of Villa's journey and his historic 1923 victory. Villa became a sensation in America, challenging racial barriers and paving the way for future Filipino fighters like Manny Pacquiao. His career was tragically cut short when he died from an infection at age 24, but his impact on boxing and Filipino American history remains profound.</p>

          <p>With enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies set to expire at the end of 2025, many Americans who rely on them are expressing anxiety about the future cost of health insurance.

The dramatic rally was triggered by its inclusion in the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF, which appears to have initiated a significant short squeeze, as over 63% of its available shares had been sold short. The momentum was further fueled by an announcement of expanded distribution through a deal with Walmart.
