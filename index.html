          <p>The lawyer for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador and later returned to the U.S., contends that his case transcends immigration debates, representing a crucial stand for due process rights. Chris Newman argues that the Trump administration is trying to frame it as an immigration issue, but it is actually about protecting fundamental constitutional rights for everyone. Garcia faces human smuggling charges, which his lawyers claim are a politically motivated attempt to undermine his due process rights. Democratic lawmakers who visited Garcia in El Salvador were warned about the erosion of democratic institutions, highlighting the importance of safeguarding such institutions in the U.S. The article emphasizes that this case is about constitutional protections rather than immigration policy, as the Trump administration is invested in framing it.</p>

          <p>Residents in Japan with foreign roots are increasingly voicing concerns about racial profiling by police, with some taking legal action. A survey indicates that foreign nationals in Japan are questioned by police at a rate significantly higher than Japanese citizens, despite similar crime rates. The issue gained attention after a video of a police officer making discriminatory remarks went viral, and the U.S. Embassy issued a warning to U.S. citizens. While the National Police Agency has issued advisories to avoid racially motivated questioning, some view recent comments by the justice minister as potentially encouraging discriminatory attitudes.</p>

          <p>President Trump has warned that the military deployment in Los Angeles in response to ICE protests could be the first "of many," and that protesters could be met with "equal or greater force." Trump defended his administration's deportation policy and vowed to enforce it strictly, while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth echoed these sentiments during a congressional hearing. The president also suggested he is open to invoking the Insurrection Act, while Democratic leaders have criticized Trump's actions as provocative and dangerous. The article highlights the escalating tensions between the administration and state leaders, as well as the potential for further military involvement in domestic affairs.</p>
