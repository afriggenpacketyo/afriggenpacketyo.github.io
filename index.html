          <p>Top Trump administration officials, including Energy Secretary Chris Wright, visited Alaska's Prudhoe Bay to advocate for doubling oil production and constructing a natural gas project. Wright emphasized the global demand for oil and natural gas, envisioning Alaska as a key energy provider. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced plans to repeal Biden-era restrictions on leasing and development in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, drawing criticism from environmentalists who fear the impacts of climate change and fossil fuel development. Alaska's political leaders expressed support for Trump's initiatives, highlighting the economic importance of resource development for the state. Optimism remains in the air with the potential for Alaska to re-establish itself as a major energy player. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mexico's Morena party is poised to control the Supreme Court following the country's first judicial election. Preliminary vote tallies indicate that the majority of newly elected justices have strong ties to the ruling party. Experts warn this shift could undermine checks and balances, granting the governing party control over all three branches of government. Critics fear that the judicial reform, pushed by President Claudia Sheinbaum's mentor, aims to stack courts in favor of the party, potentially leading to further reforms and electoral changes.</p>

          <p>In the Karen Read murder trial, text messages sent by the lead homicide detective, Michael Proctor, have emerged as a point of contention. The messages, which contain vulgar and obscene language, raise questions about Proctor's early opinions and potential bias in the investigation. Defense attorneys argue that the texts suggest Proctor reached a conclusion about the case before the autopsy was completed, potentially causing him to overlook other evidence. The detective's alleged rush to judgment could have influenced the investigation, according to the defense.

          <p>The UK government is threatening to sue Roman Abramovich to ensure the Â£2.5 billion from the sale of Chelsea Football Club goes to Ukrainian humanitarian aid. The funds have been frozen in a UK bank account since the sale, following Abramovich's sanctioning after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The disagreement centers on Abramovich's desire to donate the proceeds to "all victims of the war in Ukraine," including those in Russia, while the UK government insists the funds should only be spent on humanitarian efforts inside Ukraine. The legal action aims to resolve the impasse and ensure the money benefits those suffering in Ukraine.</p>
