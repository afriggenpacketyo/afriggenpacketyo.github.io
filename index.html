          <p>President Trump signed a proclamation on Wednesday enacting a travel ban affecting twelve countries due to national security concerns. The restrictions involve complete entry bans from Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. Partial restrictions will be imposed on Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. This action follows a previous travel ban issued in 2017, which faced legal challenges before being upheld by the Supreme Court in a revised form. The president stated his commitment to working with nations willing to enhance information-sharing and identity-management procedures. </p>

          <p>President Trump's recent travel ban is creating new challenges for individuals in war-torn countries like Afghanistan and Myanmar. For those seeking refuge in the United States, the order has diminished their hopes for sanctuary. The ban adds another layer of difficulty for people already facing immense hardship and instability in their home countries, further limiting their options for safety and a better future. The order has been met with condemnation from human rights groups, who say it will harm vulnerable populations and undermine American values.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces have recovered the bodies of Judi Lynn Weinstein and Gad Haggai, two Israeli-American hostages killed during the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023. The couple's remains were found in Khan Younis, a city in southern Gaza, during a special operation by the Israeli army and Shin Bet internal security agency. Weinstein and Haggai were taking an early morning walk near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz when Hamas militants attacked, and Weinstein managed to call emergency services to report that both she and her husband had been shot. The recovery of their bodies brings closure to their family, who have been advocating for the release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has been released globally, prompting midnight store openings and eager fans lining up to purchase the highly anticipated console. Retailers, such as Currys in the UK, reported record-breaking pre-orders, although some suppliers like Game experienced cancellations. Despite the excitement, concerns linger about whether the Switch 2 can replicate the success of its predecessor, partly due to higher game prices. The new console boasts enhanced features, including a larger screen and increased processing power, but faces questions regarding its game lineup and overall value proposition.</p>

          <p>The New Zealand Parliament has imposed record suspensions on three lawmakers who performed a Maori haka during a debate on Indigenous rights last November. Te Pati Maori co-leaders Debbie Ngarewa-Packer and Rawiri Waititi were suspended for 21 days, while Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke received a seven-day suspension. The suspensions stem from concerns that the haka, a traditional Maori dance, was performed in a manner that could intimidate other members of the house. Maipi-Clarke argued that the suspension was an attempt to silence Maori voices in Parliament, highlighting ongoing tensions between Indigenous people and the descendants of European colonizers.</p>

          <p>Recent progress made by FEMA in addressing long-standing issues of inequitable disaster assistance is now at risk due to program cuts and staff reductions under the Trump administration. The Biden administration had taken steps to simplify application processes and provide immediate assistance to vulnerable populations, but these efforts are being reversed. The administration's focus on eliminating equity programs and budget cuts have raised concerns about FEMA's ability to adequately serve all Americans after disasters. Experts warn that these changes could disproportionately affect poor people, racial minorities, and those in rural and tribal areas.</p>

          <p>A BBC Arabic team, including British citizen Feras Kilani, was detained by Israeli forces while filming in southern Syria near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The team was filming near a UN observation post when they were approached by Israeli soldiers, who confiscated their equipment and phones.

After hours of waiting, members of the team were blindfolded and zip-tied, while Kilani was separated and interrogated.

          <p>The government in England has announced that any child whose parents receive Universal Credit will be able to claim free school meals from September 2026, regardless of their income. This rule change is projected to make 500,000 more pupils eligible for free school meals, and the government has set aside £1bn to fund the change up to 2029. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the changes to free school meals would save parents £500 a year and "lift 100,000 children out of poverty". The IFS think tank noted that while the rule change would cut child poverty to a degree, other measures would have a lower cost per child lifted out of poverty.</p>

While January is often referred to as "divorce month," family law attorney Kirk Stange said it's one of the slowest months of the year for his firm. A 2016 study from the University of Washington found that divorce filings consistently peaked in March and August. Overall, the number of divorces in the U.S. has continued to drop, and the only demographic that has seen an increase in divorce rates are those people over age 50.</p>

          <p>Minors in adult jails across Maryland face prolonged isolation, lack of schooling, and fear of sexual assault, with the state violating federal standards more frequently than any other. Maryland law mandates that minors as young as 14 be charged as adults for certain crimes, leading to their detention in adult jails. Federal law requires sight and sound separation between adults and minors, but this often results in minors spending entire days in solitary confinement. The state is expected to lose $350,000 in federal funds due to these violations, as lawmakers have repeatedly failed to pass legislation that would bring the state into compliance.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has taken down several covert operations using its AI tools for malicious purposes, including those linked to China, Russia, and Iran. One Chinese operation, dubbed "Sneer Review," used ChatGPT to generate comments on social media platforms, while another collected intelligence by posing as journalists. OpenAI says it disrupted 10 operations using its AI tools in malicious ways, and banned accounts connected to them. Despite the variety of tactics used, OpenAI noted that these operations did not generally achieve greater engagement due to their use of AI.</p>
