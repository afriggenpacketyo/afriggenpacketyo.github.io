          <p>The eastern United States is experiencing a severe heat wave, with cities like New York, Boston, and Baltimore facing record-high temperatures and extreme humidity due to a "heat dome," which traps heat in the lower atmosphere. Hospitals are seeing an increase in heat-related illnesses, and public transport is experiencing disruptions. Over 150 million people are under heat warnings, leading to increased demand for power and a surge in sales of air conditioners and fans. While some relief is expected by the weekend, the heat remains a significant concern for the region.
