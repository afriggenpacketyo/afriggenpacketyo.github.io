She discusses filming during a difficult personal period, noting that her divorce from Ben Affleck was finalized the same month the movie premiered, and describes the experience as a catalyst for necessary personal growth. Lopez also touches on her early career struggles, including sleeping on a bench at a dance studio before her breakthrough.

          <p>The Des Moines school board has placed Superintendent Ian Roberts on paid administrative leave after he was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for allegedly being in the country illegally. ICE stated that Roberts, who competed for Guyana in the 2000 Olympics, entered the U.S. on a student visa in 1999 and was subject to a final removal order from 2024. The school board expressed shock, noting that multiple background checks before his hiring revealed no citizenship issues and that he had affirmed he was a U.S. citizen. Roberts has retained legal counsel to address the serious accusations against him.</p>

          <p>Iraqi President Abdullatif Jamal Rashid has declared that his country is entering a new phase of stability and is now "100% safe" for business and investment. In an interview, he stated that Iraq is focused on rebuilding its infrastructure and wants to strengthen trade and energy partnerships with the United States as U.S. troops begin their final withdrawal. Despite ongoing threats from ISIS cells and Iran-aligned militias, Rashid downplayed concerns about Iranian influence, insisting that Iraq maintains its independence in decision-making. He highlighted the upcoming parliamentary elections as a sign of the nation's democratic stability and progress.</p>

          <h2>Analysis of Alternative Data Sources Suggests Official Inflation Figures May Be Incomplete</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 10:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid skepticism about official government inflation statistics, alternative data sources present a more nuanced view of the U.S. economy. Indexes from sources like Truflation and Adobe suggest consumer prices may currently be lower than the reported 2.9% Consumer Price Index (CPI), but other indicators show potential for future increases. For example, reports from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) and the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) indicate rising costs for businesses, which could soon be passed on to consumers.

          <p>China is implementing a new industrial manufacturing model, known as a "pull system," to mass-produce rockets and satellites with the same efficiency and cost-effectiveness as cars. This approach reverses the traditional "push" system, where components are made based on forecasts, often leading to delays and waste. In the new model, final assembly lines will "pull" components from suppliers on an as-needed basis, ensuring consistent quality and flexibility. Chinese researchers believe that mastering this scalable production method will be crucial for dominating the rapidly growing global space industry, which is projected to expand exponentially by 2045.</p>

          <p>As national chain stores continue to close, rising vacancy rates in U.S. shopping centers are creating rare opportunities for small and local businesses. With the national shopping center vacancy rate climbing to 5.8%, landlords are becoming more flexible, allowing independent retailers, wellness practitioners, and service-based businesses to negotiate favorable rents and lease terms in previously unaffordable locations. While overall rents are still increasing, the rate of growth has slowed, providing an opening for entrepreneurs to revitalize these spaces. This trend is fostering a more diverse retail landscape, though experts note the opportunities vary significantly by geographic market.</p>

Other debunked ideas are that you will inevitably be lonely, that life abroad is perfect, that your first move must be permanent, and that it's too late in life to relocate.

          <p>China is expanding its influence in Africa by establishing Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) centers, with new facilities recently opened in Tunisia and Chad. These centers are part of a broader health diplomacy strategy that Beijing has used for decades, sending medical teams and promoting TCM to build goodwill and cultural ties on the continent. The new facility at Mongi Slim University Hospital in Tunisia is a direct result of recent health cooperation agreements between the two nations. This growing network of TCM centers across Africa demonstrates China's strategic use of cultural exchange as a tool to enhance its soft power and strengthen relationships.</p>

          <p>A new court filing from legal watchdog groups alleges that children are being held for prolonged periods in an ICE detention facility in Dilley, Texas, under inhumane conditions. Attorneys who visited the center, run by private contractor CoreCivic, reported accounts of dirty drinking water, chronic sleep deprivation due to lights never being turned off, and inadequate medical care and hygiene supplies. The filing describes a "prison-like environment" where families face emotional distress and children exhibit signs of self-harm. These allegations suggest violations of the Flores settlement agreement, which sets minimum detention standards for immigrant children in U.S. custody.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's recent flurry of massive infrastructure deals, including a $100 billion investment from Nvidia and a $300 billion partnership with Oracle, is raising questions among investors and analysts. While CEO Sam Altman defends the spending as necessary for AI innovation, some critics see a troubling, self-referential pattern reminiscent of the dot-com bubble. The deals create a tangled web where partners are also investors; for example, Nvidia is investing in OpenAI while also selling the company its GPUs. With OpenAI's revenue projected at only $13 billion this year, the sustainability of this high-cost ecosystem is under scrutiny. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis piece expresses growing concern over the fragility of American democracy, arguing that the Trump administration is actively undermining its foundational principles. The article points to the normalization of military presence in cities, purges of government officials deemed disloyal, and threats against the integrity of free and fair elections as signs of advancing authoritarianism. It warns against complacency, stating that the Constitution's power relies on the active commitment of citizens to defend it. The author calls for urgent, widespread action, from grassroots protests to legal challenges, to counter these threats before the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Despite the persistent threat of urban fires, the United States has made significant progress in fire safety, cutting the per-capita civilian fire death rate by roughly two-thirds since 1980. This dramatic improvement is not the result of a single breakthrough but rather the accumulation of many small, often overlooked changes over decades. Key factors include the widespread adoption of working smoke alarms, increased use of automatic sprinkler systems, and safer consumer products like fire-resistant furniture and self-extinguishing cigarettes. These advancements in building codes, product safety, and public awareness campaigns have collectively saved countless lives and made American homes and buildings far safer.</p>

          <p>Music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs is scheduled to be sentenced next week after being found guilty on two counts of transportation for engagement in prostitution. While he was acquitted of more severe sex-trafficking and racketeering charges, he still faces a theoretical maximum of 20 years in prison. The charges stem from orchestrating and paying for travel for sexual encounters involving his girlfriends and male sex workers. Prosecutors are recommending a sentence of at least four to five years, whereas Combs's defense team is arguing for a sentence of no more than 14 months, which would result in his near-immediate release given time already served.</p>

          <p>Switzerland is holding a second referendum on the introduction of a national electronic identity card system, with initial projections showing the vote is too close to call. A similar proposal was rejected in 2021 due to concerns over data privacy and the involvement of private companies. The revised plan addresses these issues by keeping the system optional, state-run, and storing data on users' smartphones rather than in a central database. Supporters argue the e-ID will streamline bureaucratic processes, while opponents maintain fears that it could still undermine privacy and lead to citizen tracking, reflecting the country's strong tradition of data protection.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration increasingly appears to use the Justice Department for political ends, some legal analysts suggest that jury nullification could re-emerge as a tool to protect the rule of law. Jury nullification is a historic practice where a jury acquits a defendant, even if legally guilty, because they believe the law itself or its application is unjust. While it has a controversial history, particularly in the Jim Crow South, it was also used by abolitionists to defy the Fugitive Slave Act. The article argues that if jurors perceive prosecutions against political opponents as tyrannical, they have the right to refuse to convict, serving as a final check on executive overreach.</p>
