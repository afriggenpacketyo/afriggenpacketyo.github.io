          <p>A high-ranking Department of Justice official has announced plans to meet with Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year sentence for her involvement in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring. The purpose of the meeting is to determine if Maxwell possesses information about other individuals who may have committed crimes. This development follows criticism of the Trump administration for not releasing more files related to the Epstein investigation. Maxwell’s attorney confirmed that discussions with the government are underway and stated that his client will always testify truthfully, expressing gratitude for President Trump's commitment to uncovering the truth.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase has significantly restructured the leadership of its advanced technology research group, which focuses on emerging fields like quantum computing and blockchain. Marco Pistoia, who led the group since 2020, has departed the bank, along with one of his key deputies. To fill the role, JPMorgan has hired Rob Otter from State Street, who previously led JPMorgan's Onyx blockchain business. The move signals a strategic shift for the bank's research division, which explores how next-generation technologies can be applied to solve complex problems in the financial industry.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has conducted a significant reshuffle of her senior team, appointing former foreign and home secretary Sir James Cleverly as the new shadow housing secretary. This move will pit him directly against Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner in Parliament. The shake-up involves several other key changes, including new appointments for the health and culture briefs, as the party seeks to renew its policy platform and present a unified front. The reshuffle occurs eight months into Badenoch's leadership, a period during which the Conservative party has struggled in opinion polls following a poor showing in recent local elections.</p>

          <p>Households in the United Kingdom are facing a significant increase in their food expenses, with the average annual grocery bill projected to rise by £275. According to market researcher Worldpanel, food prices jumped 5.2% in the last month compared to the previous year, marking the highest increase since early 2024. This surge is forcing many shoppers to switch to cheaper supermarket own-brands, simplify their meals, or otherwise cut back on costs. The rising cost of food is a major contributor to the UK's overall inflation rate, with about one-fifth of households reportedly struggling to afford their groceries.</p>

          <p>Influential figures within the MAGA movement are facing a dilemma regarding the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, torn between supporting President Trump's dismissal of the issue and echoing their base's demand for more information. While some pundits are moving on, commentators like Tucker Carlson are increasingly critical of the administration's handling of the case, framing it as a betrayal of populist principles. Carlson has used the controversy to critique the conservative establishment on other issues, arguing it has become disconnected from the concerns of average Americans. This internal conflict highlights a rare and significant rift within Trump's typically unified political base.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has declared its intention to withdraw the United States from UNESCO, the United Nations' cultural and education agency, with the exit planned for December 2026.

This marks the third time the U.S. has left the Paris-based agency, having previously withdrawn in 1983 under Ronald Reagan and again in 2017 during Trump's first term.

While national average yields for one-to-five-year CDs remain relatively low, online banks are providing significantly more competitive rates, with some short-term CDs offering Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) well over 4%. The report explains the phenomenon of the inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently have higher rates than long-term ones.

The financial pressure is so intense that some tenants are forced to turn down job opportunities in areas with high rents, while others rely on financial help from their parents.

          <h2>US and Taiwan Explore Potential Spaceport Collaboration for Suborbital Flights</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and Taiwan are in discussions regarding a potential collaboration on spaceport development to facilitate ultra-fast suborbital flights. According to the American Institute in Taiwan, such cooperation could dramatically reduce travel time, potentially cutting a trip from Taipei to Houston to as little as two and a half hours. Suborbital transport involves a vehicle briefly exiting the Earth's atmosphere before gliding to a runway landing. While still in an experimental phase, this emerging technology could revolutionize long-distance travel for both passengers and cargo in the coming decades, and is being developed by several global powers.</p>

CEO Mary Barra emphasized that the company is adapting to new trade policies while positioning itself for a profitable future.

          <p>Public health officials are warning that reported funding cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by the Trump administration could severely hamper efforts to combat the nation's overdose crisis. The cuts could affect the Overdose Data to Action (OD2A) program, which provides crucial funding for states and cities to track drug use, monitor overdose trends, and distribute the reversal drug naloxone. Health departments that rely on this funding are now planning for worst-case scenarios, concerned that a reduction in resources will be a major step backward after overdose deaths began to decline for the first time in 2023.</p>

This measure was approved by the Defense Secretary following a request from DHS, which faces a shortage of beds amid the Trump administration's push for increased arrests. The use of military resources for immigration detention is enabled by a national emergency declaration at the southern border. This development comes as the administration's policies on immigration and border security continue to be a central and contentious national issue.</p>

          <p>The South Carolina Shrimpers Association has filed a federal lawsuit against 25 restaurants in the Charleston area, accusing them of consumer deception and unfair trade practices. The lawsuit alleges that these establishments market and sell imported, frozen shrimp as "local" and "wild-caught," which misleads customers and harms the state's authentic shrimping industry. An investigation cited in the complaint used genetic analysis and found that 90% of the tested restaurants were not serving genuine local shrimp. The lawsuit seeks to protect the integrity of the Lowcountry's seafood brand, a vital component of the region's billion-dollar tourism economy.</p>
