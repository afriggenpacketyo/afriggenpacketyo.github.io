          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House did not give the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The Manhattan-based court stated that the US Constitution gave Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations, a power not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The Trump administration lodged an appeal within minutes of the ruling. Global markets responded positively, with stock markets in Asia rising and the US dollar making gains against safe-haven peers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Wu Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, Beijing should anticipate Washington adopting alternative pressure tactics in future tariff negotiations. Wu suggests that while President Donald Trump might continue using tariffs, he is likely to show more restraint after seeing their mixed results. Wu believes Trump understands tariffs had limited impact on China but carried significant side effects for the US. Therefore, China needs to be alert to the possibility that Trump may explore other measures related to science, diplomacy, and security.</p>

The Israeli government's slow response to Merz's remarks suggests they have resonated deeply. Experts note that Merz has been more restrained in his criticism compared to other European leaders, making his comments particularly impactful. The lack of a strong formal response from Israel indicates that Merz's words have stung the political elite and are being taken seriously in Jerusalem.</p>

          <h2>Motivations Behind Americans Joining the Israeli Military</h2>

          <p>This article explores the phenomenon of Americans joining the Israeli military, questioning the motivations behind such decisions and highlighting the radicalization process. The author notes that an estimated 23,380 American citizens currently serve in Israeli ranks, some driven by a "fierce commitment to the Jewish state." The article contrasts this with Americans fighting alongside Ukrainians and points out the lack of attention given to the radicalization of young Zionist men and women. It also touches on the historical context and the establishment's affinity for Israel.</p>

          <p>Catherine Russell, the executive director of UNICEF, highlights the dire situation of children in Gaza, where thousands have been killed or wounded. She emphasizes the growing threat of famine and the need for humanitarian aid. Russell criticizes Israel's blockade of aid and a new aid delivery system that bypasses the United Nations, warning it could worsen the situation. She calls for a return to the functioning UN-led aid pipeline with safe and sustained humanitarian access to prevent further suffering and death among Gaza's children.</p>

          <p>The Angels' offense remained quiet, resulting in a 1-0 shutout loss to the Yankees, completing a sweep and diminishing their recent eight-game win streak. Despite a ninth-inning rally in the previous game, the Angels failed to produce runs, with catcher Logan O'Hoppe striking out to end the game. Manager Ron Washington employed strategies like intentionally walking Aaron Judge twice in the first two innings, but the team's struggles at the plate continued. The Angels made roster moves, including designating veteran infielder Tim Anderson for assignment, and await the return of Mike Trout from injury.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10 percent increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by demand ahead of potential negative impacts from higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Global production also increased by 7.8 percent to 814,787 vehicles. While Toyota has stated it will not pass on tariff costs to consumers, analysts anticipate pressure to do so if the higher levies persist. The company expects a 34.9 percent drop in net profit for the full business year due to tariff measures and a stronger yen. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A US Court of International Trade has found President Trump's sweeping tariffs unlawful, ruling that he lacks the authority to impose them without Congressional approval.

This decision significantly undermines Trump's economic strategy, which relies on tariffs as a negotiating tactic and revenue generator.

Roma children are often separated into “Roma schools” or “Roma classes,” with lower academic expectations and higher drop-out rates. Despite legal guarantees and reforms, segregation continues, with measures often reinforcing the very segregation they claim to address. The author argues that Slovakia must stop managing segregation and start ending it through diverse classrooms, mixed environments, and early support.</p>
