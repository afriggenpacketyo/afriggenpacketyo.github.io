        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford Motor Company surpassed Wall Street's expectations for the first quarter but has withdrawn its 2025 financial outlook due to an anticipated $2.5 billion impact from President Trump's tariffs. While the company plans to offset $1 billion of these costs through various remediation actions, the remaining $1.5 billion impact and concerns over potential supply chain disruptions have prompted the decision to suspend guidance. Ford imports fewer vehicles compared to General Motors, resulting in a smaller tariff impact than GM's projected $4 billion to $5 billion. The automotive industry is currently navigating 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts not compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.</p>

          <p>Air traffic controllers at Newark Liberty International Airport experienced a temporary loss of radar and communication with aircraft due to an equipment failure, according to their union. The incident, which occurred on April 28, left controllers "unable to see, hear, or talk to them," resulting in significant flight delays. The FAA acknowledged that the antiquated air traffic control system is affecting the workforce, with some controllers taking time off to recover from the stress of the outage. United Airlines has announced it will cut 35 flights a day from its Newark hub to alleviate disruptions, as the facility is chronically understaffed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a surprising move, the Trump administration has requested a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to restrict access to the abortion pill mifepristone, aligning with the position previously taken by the Biden administration. The Justice Department's court filing argues that the case, brought by the attorneys general of Missouri, Idaho, and Kansas, does not meet the legal standard to be heard in the Texas federal district court where it was filed. The lawsuit challenges regulatory changes made by the FDA that expanded access to mifepristone, including its use in telemedicine and for individuals under 18. The case's initial iteration was previously rejected by the Supreme Court due to lack of standing.</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the FAA following ongoing disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport, which have led to numerous delays and cancellations. Schumer cited a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, cuts at the FAA, outdated technology, and depleted federal funds as contributing factors to the chaos. He also questioned the FAA's decision to offer bonuses to air traffic controllers at certain towers but not to those in Washington, Philadelphia, or New York. The senator warned that the issues at Newark could foreshadow problems at other airports if the FAA fails to implement real solutions.</p>

          <p>Nineteen states and Washington, D.C., are suing the Trump administration over the layoff of thousands of Health and Human Services (HHS) staffers, claiming the cuts are dismantling the agency and disproportionately affecting essential programs like the CDC and FDA. The lawsuit alleges that the layoffs have deprived states of critical data and hindered access to grants for worker safety and Head Start programs. The states argue that HHS is exceeding its legal authority and violating the Constitution's separation of powers by slashing programs authorized by Congress. The suit also criticizes HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s views, citing his vaccine skepticism.</p>

          <p>Former Governor Andrew Cuomo is facing scrutiny for potentially violating New York City campaign finance rules by using his campaign website to communicate strategic information to a super PAC supporting his mayoral bid, a practice known as "red-boxing." Cuomo's website includes polling data, pre-edited video clips, and detailed spending instructions for Fix the City, a super PAC backing his campaign. While this practice is legal on the federal level, New York City has adopted rules to prevent candidates from coordinating strategy and spending with super PACs.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at incentivizing pharmaceutical companies to manufacture drugs in the United States by streamlining the approval process for new production sites. The order will enable the FDA to conduct more inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities with the same resources and increase surprise inspections of foreign drug facilities. This initiative precedes Trump's planned tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals, which have already spurred domestic manufacturing investments from companies like Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, and AbbVie. However, some pharmaceutical companies, such as Pfizer, have expressed concerns that the tariff threat could deter further U.S. investments in research and development.</p>

          <p>Israeli fighter jets conducted airstrikes on the port city of Hudaydah in western Yemen following a Houthi ballistic missile strike near Israel's main international airport. The strikes targeted the port and a cement factory, resulting in casualties, according to Houthi-run health authorities. The Israeli military said the port served as a primary income source for the Houthi regime. The exchange represents the latest escalation in the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Iranian-backed Houthi militia, which has been launching missiles and drones at Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Despite months of retaliatory actions, neither side has achieved its stated objectives.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a plan to pay unauthorized immigrants $1,000 to voluntarily return to their home countries, along with providing travel assistance. The Department of Homeland Security is promoting this as a "historic opportunity" and a cost-effective alternative to forced deportation. Critics argue that the initiative may pressure immigrants with legal pathways to remain in the U.S. to self-deport without fully understanding their rights. The administration claims that self-deportation could improve an immigrant's chances of legally returning to the U.S. in the future, a claim that some experts dispute.</p>

          <p>The affordability of the classic American breakfast, consisting of eggs, toast, potatoes, and meat, is being threatened by rising costs of key ingredients. Factors such as bird flu outbreaks, climate change, and President Trump's tariffs are driving up the prices of eggs, coffee, and orange juice. While some elements like toast and pancakes remain relatively stable due to America's grain production, the overall cost of a diner breakfast is increasing, potentially impacting working-class individuals who rely on it as an affordable meal. The tradition of the American breakfast is in peril, as is the vision of national plenty it once symbolized.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company announced that President Trumpâ€™s tariff policies are expected to reduce its 2025 profit by approximately $1.5 billion, leading the company to withdraw its financial forecast for the year. The automaker cited the potential for supply chain disruptions and retaliatory tariffs as reasons for the decision. Ford's profit in the first three months of the year fell to $471 million from $1.3 billion in the same period a year ago, attributing the decline to lower vehicle sales due to paused production and inventory reduction efforts. The company narrowed its loss on electric vehicles to $849 million from $1.3 billion a year ago.</p>

          <p>President Trump, shortly after taking office, questioned whether he had a duty to uphold the Constitution and the Fifth Amendment right to due process, particularly concerning his mass deportation efforts. When asked if he agreed that citizens and noncitizens are entitled to due process, Trump responded, "I don't know. I'm not a lawyer. I don't know." Legal experts have criticized Trump's comments, emphasizing that the Fifth Amendment applies to all individuals, not just citizens. Trump later stated that he would seek to appoint judges who would not challenge his deportation plan, further escalating his standoff with the courts.</p>
