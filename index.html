          <p>Meta has filed a lawsuit against Joy Timeline HK Ltd., the developer of the CrushAI app, which uses AI to generate nonconsensual, sexualized images of individuals. The lawsuit, filed in Hong Kong, aims to prevent Joy Timeline from advertising on Meta's platforms after repeated attempts to circumvent ad review processes. Meta emphasized the seriousness of the abuse and its commitment to protecting users, also announcing updates to enforcement methods and technology to detect and remove similar ads. The company plans to share signals about these apps with other tech companies to address the issue across platforms, disrupting networks of accounts promoting these services. The goal is to combat the proliferation of 'nudify' apps and safeguard the online community from abuse.</p>

          <p>Former NFL Pro Bowl offensive lineman Taylor Lewan shared an anecdote about being roasted by President Donald Trump regarding a poor first pitch he threw at a St. Louis Cardinals game. Lewan and Will Compton encountered Trump at UFC 316 in Newark, New Jersey, where Trump jokingly criticized Lewan's throwing ability. Lewan's errant pitch had previously drawn mockery on social media, with comparisons to 50 Cent's infamous first pitch, and Lewan humorously expressed his need for redemption after the incident.

          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) board of governors has formally declared Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in 20 years. The resolution, backed by the US, UK, France, and Germany, cites Iran's failure to provide full answers regarding undeclared nuclear material and activities, expressing concern over its enriched uranium stockpile. Iran has condemned the resolution as political and announced plans to open a new enrichment facility. This action follows an IAEA report criticizing Iran's lack of cooperation and noting its capacity to produce nine nuclear bombs, while Iran maintains its nuclear activities are peaceful.</p>

Olympic swimmer Danielle Hill, who trained at the centre, condemned the attack as racism, and local representatives criticized a Stormont minister for a social media post about the location of migrant families.

Iran has responded with warnings of military retaliation, while the U.S. considers options to support potential Israeli military action. The primary sticking point remains Iran's uranium enrichment program, with Trump demanding zero enrichment, a condition unacceptable to Tehran, raising the specter of military conflict.

          <p>Uranium mining is experiencing a resurgence in the United States due to increasing electricity demand from AI models and a global push for cleaner energy. The U.S., once a leader in uranium mining, now imports over 95% of its uranium, but recent government support, including a ban on Russian uranium imports and federal funding for domestic enrichment, aims to change this. Experts estimate that known uranium deposits will run out by 2080 if nuclear energy demand continues to grow, with domestic uranium miners working to ramp up production. Despite these efforts, the U.S. is expected to remain reliant on other countries for uranium due to limited domestic reserves.</p>

The officers argue that the failure to hang the plaque violates the Equal Protection clause, especially as President Trump downplays the attack and Republican leaders honor him.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's consumer inflation has eased to 2.82% in May, lower than expected, primarily due to a decrease in food prices, according to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. The year-on-year headline inflation is the lowest since February 2019, with food inflation hitting 0.99%. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been relaxing monetary policy amid these easing inflationary pressures, recently cutting its benchmark repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.50%. Economists expect further rate cuts, while India's economy expanded at a faster-than-expected rate of 7.4% in the quarter ended March. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A skier died in an avalanche on Alaska's Mount McKinley, just days after a climber fell 3,000 feet to his death on the same peak. Nicholas Vizzini, 29, was caught in the avalanche while descending a slope with his snowboarding partner, who sustained minor injuries. This incident follows the recent death of Alex Chiu, who fell on the mountain's West Buttress climbing route. The climbing season typically runs from early May to early July, and there are currently around 500 climbers on Mount McKinley.</p>

          <p>Some mothers are actively trying to delay their daughters' first periods, driven by concerns about the effects of chemicals and the trend of earlier menarche. The average age of menarche in the US has shifted earlier, which is associated with increased risks of certain health conditions. These parents are focusing on changes to diet, personal care products, and screen time to mitigate potential risks. Experts suggest that limiting exposure to endocrine disruptors is reasonable, but caution against hypervigilance and potential risks of eating disorders, while advocating for broader societal and policy changes.</p>

Despite the escalating tensions, President Trump's Middle East envoy plans to proceed with a sixth round of nuclear program talks with Iran. The Trump administration is reportedly considering options to support Israeli military action without direct involvement, such as aerial refueling or intelligence sharing. Meanwhile, Iran's Defense Minister has warned that if talks fail, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps will target all U.S. bases in host countries. (not investment advice)</p>

The claims included falsified paperwork and a contaminated oxygen system tube that may have been installed in an aircraft now in service.
