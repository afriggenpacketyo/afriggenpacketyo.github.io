            <p>An IDF inquiry into the deaths of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month has attributed the incident to 'professional failures,' including an 'operational misunderstanding' and a 'breach of orders.' The investigation found that troops opened fire believing they faced a threat from enemy forces, but the report also blamed 'poor night visibility' for the commander's failure to identify the vehicles as ambulances. The deputy commander of the unit involved has been dismissed for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has dismissed the report as 'invalid,' asserting that it shifts responsibility to personal error while the truth is different.</p>

            <p>Justice Samuel Alito has issued a strong dissent against the Supreme Court's decision to temporarily halt President Trump's deportations of Venezuelan criminals under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Alito criticized the timing and lack of explanation for the decision, arguing it was 'unprecedented and legally questionable.' The court's decision blocks the deportations of Venezuelans held in Texas, pending further review. The ACLU had filed an emergency appeal, arguing that deportations under the Alien Enemies Act had resumed, prompting the Supreme Court's intervention.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court issued an overnight order temporarily blocking the removal of Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang members to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA).

            <p>Trump administration border czar Tom Homan defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, accusing Senator Chris Van Hollen of supporting a gang member and terrorist. Homan argued that due process rights are more limited under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, which was invoked in the deportation. He denied that migrants are labeled as gang members solely based on tattoos. Homan maintained that the administration acted lawfully and removed a public safety threat.</p>

            <p>Chinese airlines have started returning Boeing aircraft to the U.S., including a 737 Max that landed in Seattle. This comes after China reportedly ordered its airlines to halt further deliveries of Boeing aircraft amidst trade tensions with the U.S. The order is impacting Boeing's business in China, as one lessor saw a Chinese airline back away from a commitment to take delivery of a 737 Max 8. The trade war between President Trump and China is affecting Boeing's ability to challenge Airbus's dominance in the Chinese market.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen is advocating for Kilmar Abrego Garcia's due process rights after his wrongful deportation to El Salvador. Van Hollen insists the government has presented no evidence linking Abrego Garcia to MS-13 and is urging them to present their case in court, not on social media. He criticized the administration for flouting court orders and emphasized that depriving one man of his constitutional rights threatens everyone's rights. He rejects Gavin Newsom's suggestion that defending Abrego Garcia is politically dangerous.</p>
