          <p>The Federal Railroad Administration is consulting with Elon Musk's Boring Company to explore potential cost-saving measures for Amtrak's Frederick Douglass Tunnel program, which connects Baltimore to Washington and Virginia. The project's estimated cost has surged from $6 billion to $8.5 billion, prompting the Department of Transportation to seek innovative solutions. The Boring Company, known for its tunneling expertise, has presented ideas to build the tunnel more efficiently, but these talks have raised conflict-of-interest concerns given Musk's other business ventures and advisory role to President Trump. The project is intended to replace the aging Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel, addressing long-standing concerns about costs and deadlines, and is the single largest infrastructure effort led by Amtrak.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement to significantly reduce tariffs on each other's imports for a 90-day period, marking a potential turning point in their ongoing trade war. The U.S. will lower its tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China will decrease its tariffs on U.S. goods from 125% to 10%. This agreement, resulting from high-level trade discussions in Geneva, aims to ease economic tensions and foster a more balanced trade relationship, with both countries establishing a consultation mechanism to address mutual concerns. The move has been met with positive market reactions and hopes for further cooperation, although the long-term impact remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Edan Alexander, a U.S.-Israeli citizen held hostage in Gaza, has been released by Hamas as President Trump departed for a Middle East trip. Alexander, who was serving in the Israeli military when abducted, was transferred to the Red Cross and then the Israel Defense Forces. Hamas stated the release was unconditional, hoping for a lasting ceasefire and renewed humanitarian aid to Gaza. Negotiations are expected to continue, focusing on a comprehensive agreement to end the war and establish a prisoner exchange, while Israel maintains preparations to intensify fighting. Meanwhile, Gaza faces a severe risk of famine due to restricted aid, and Israeli strikes have reportedly caused casualties in a school-turned-shelter.</p>

          <p>President Trump is pushing for drug manufacturers to reduce their prices to match those in other high-income countries within a month, threatening significant caps on Medicare earnings if they fail to comply. He aims to implement a "most favored nation" approach, ensuring the U.S. pays the lowest global price for prescription drugs. This initiative expands on a previous proposal blocked by courts, and the administration plans to engage with pharmaceutical companies to determine the appropriate pricing. The industry opposes the plan, arguing it would stifle innovation and investment, while pharmacy benefit managers support efforts to lower drug prices, but the success and scope of this policy remain uncertain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Episcopal Church's migration service is declining a federal government directive to assist in resettling white South Africans granted refugee status, citing its commitment to racial justice and reconciliation. Bishop Sean Rowe announced the decision, emphasizing the church's historic ties with the Anglican Church of Southern Africa, which fought against apartheid. The church views the preferential treatment of white South Africans as unfair, given the thousands of refugees facing years of vetting. While ending its partnership with the government, the church will explore other avenues to support immigrants, including those already in the country and those stranded overseas, but another faith-based refugee agency, Church World Service, says it is open to serving the South African arrivals.</p>

          <p>The EPA's annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions report, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request after the agency failed to publish it, indicates that the U.S. is not reducing emissions quickly enough to meet its climate goals. While emissions have decreased by 17% since 2005, a 61-66% reduction is needed by 2035. The report identifies carbon dioxide as the primary greenhouse gas, mainly from burning fossil fuels, with the transportation sector being the largest emitter. Concerns arise that the Trump administration's policies may reverse progress by disincentivizing electric vehicles and favoring fossil fuels over renewable energy, so the Environmental Defense Fund is concerned.</p>

Similar incidents have been reported across the country, with schools facing expensive damages and potential health hazards from toxic smoke.

          <p>President Trump is facing scrutiny for planning to accept a $400 million luxury plane from Qatar for use as Air Force One, despite previously criticizing the country. Defending his decision, Trump used an analogy involving golfer Sam Snead, stating that one should always accept a "gimme" rather than risk missing a putt. This justification reflects a broader pattern of ethical concerns surrounding Trump's business dealings and potential conflicts of interest, including his family's real estate ventures and cryptocurrency projects. Critics argue that accepting such a gift raises serious questions about foreign influence and the mixing of public office with personal gain.</p>

The bill aims to extend provisions from the 2017 tax law but faces opposition from some Republicans concerned about state and local tax deductions. To offset the cost of these cuts, the bill proposes raising taxes on universities, migrants, and President Biden’s agenda, and it is expected to add trillions to the deficit. The measures are just one component of broader legislation that Republicans hope to enact in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>American Bitcoin, a bitcoin mining firm backed by President Trump's son Eric, is set to go public through a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining, deepening the Trump family's involvement in cryptocurrency. The company aims to mine bitcoin efficiently and build up reserves, aligning with President Trump's pledge to make the U.S. a bitcoin mining powerhouse. However, bitcoin mining is controversial due to its energy-intensive nature. The Trump family's growing crypto empire has drawn criticism over potential conflicts of interest, with Senate Democrats pushing for limits on elected officials' involvement in crypto ventures.</p>

          <p>Nicole Eggert, known for her role as Roberta "Summer" Quinn on "Baywatch," shared that the show's stigma impacted her dating life and career. Eggert initially joined the show for a spin-off but left after two seasons due to creative differences. The negative press surrounding "Baywatch" led to casting doors closing for her, and she felt labeled as a "Baywatch bimbo." She said people had preconceived notions about her due to her role, making it difficult for them to get to know her beyond her on-screen persona, and she also regrets getting breast implants at 18.</p>

He has also started a meme cryptocurrency, $TRUMP, and auctioned off access to himself through sales of the coin.
