        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a protracted legal battle, a central Berlin street with a name considered racist will be officially renamed Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Strasse. The original name, Mohrenstrasse or "Moor Street," has long been criticized by civil society groups for its derogatory colonial-era connotations. The new name honors Anton Wilhelm Amo, an 18th-century Black German philosopher and the first Africa-born scholar to earn a European doctorate. The renaming is seen as a significant step in Germany's process of decolonizing public spaces and acknowledging its colonial history.</p>

          <p>Lucy Connolly, recently released from a 31-month prison sentence for inciting racial hatred, has described herself as one of "Sir Keir Starmer's political prisoners." Connolly was jailed after posting on social media, in the wake of the 2024 Southport attack, that people should "set fire" to hotels housing asylum seekers. In her first interviews since her release, she stated the post was not her "finest moment" but maintained her belief that her imprisonment was politically motivated and an infringement on free speech.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 27th season of "South Park" is being lauded for its successful and sharp satire of the second Trump administration, a feat many other comedy shows have struggled with. The article argues that creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have succeeded by avoiding pandering "clapter" comedy and instead using gratifyingly mean-spirited caricatures of political figures. By deploying its signature animation style and spiteful humor, the show has managed to land comedic blows that feel both fresh and cathartic in a challenging political landscape.</p>

          <p>Omar Fateh, a Democratic Socialist candidate for mayor of Minneapolis, is facing criticism following a political rally conducted largely in a foreign language and featuring few American flags. Political opponents, including Rep. Tom Emmer, condemned the event, suggesting it demonstrated a "puts America last" agenda. The controversy comes as Fateh also lost a key endorsement from the state's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party due to cited irregularities in the convention's voting process, a decision Fateh claims was an insider game.</p>

          <p>The iconic White House Rose Garden is undergoing a significant renovation directed by President Trump, replacing its traditional lawn with stone paving. The $1.9 million project, funded by private donations, was reportedly initiated by Trump to solve the problem of high heels sinking into wet grass during events. The new design, featuring paving stones and striped umbrellas, bears a resemblance to features at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, marking another instance of the president imprinting his personal aesthetic onto the historic residence.</p>

          <p>A popular drive-thru coffee shop in Sudbury, Massachusetts, is shutting down after 12 years in business following a town decision to prohibit it from selling egg sandwiches. The owner, Debby Johnston, was told by the public health director that her egg preparation methods were deemed unsanitary and unsafe, a claim she disputes after years of operation without issue. The closure has prompted an outpouring of community support, and Johnston plans to appeal the decision at an upcoming Board of Health meeting to save her business.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has announced a plan for the mass deportation of asylum seekers who arrive in the UK via small boats, describing the situation as a "massive crisis." The proposal involves detaining arrivals on disused military bases before returning them to their countries of origin, a measure that would likely face significant legal and political challenges. The plan, which Farage estimates would cost £10 billion over five years, also includes withdrawing the UK from the European Convention on Human Rights to facilitate the deportations.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, who were convicted in 1996 for the brutal shotgun murders of their parents, have both been denied parole after becoming eligible for release this year. The brothers, aged 18 and 21 at the time of the 1989 killings, have long maintained they acted in self-defense after years of severe abuse, while prosecutors argued the motive was to inherit their parents' fortune. Recent public interest, fueled by a Netflix series, has revived debate over their case, but parole boards determined both still pose a risk to public safety.</p>

Multilateral development banks are presented as ideal vehicles for such collaboration, though they are increasingly being bypassed for national projects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities in San Bernardino County have arrested Jake and Rebecca Haro, the parents of missing 7-month-old Emmanuel Haro, on suspicion of murder. Investigators now believe the baby is dead and that the parents' report of a kidnapping in Yucaipa was fabricated. The sheriff's department stated there were "inconsistencies" in the parents' story from the beginning of the investigation. While the search for the baby's body continues, officials have expressed confidence that the justice system will hold the parents accountable for the tragic circumstances.</p>

          <p>North Korea has lodged a protest, calling it a "serious provocation," after South Korean soldiers fired warning shots at North Korean troops who briefly crossed the military demarcation line this week. South Korea's military stated its troops acted according to standard procedure when the northern soldiers crossed into the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) while setting up barriers. The North Korean soldiers retreated without returning fire, but a North Korean military official accused the South of deliberately escalating tensions during joint US-South Korean military drills.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Expands Injunction Blocking Trump Administration from Withholding Funds from 'Sanctuary' Jurisdictions</h2>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has expanded a nationwide injunction preventing the Trump administration from withholding federal funding from so-called "sanctuary" cities and counties. The ruling blocks the administration from denying or placing immigration-related conditions on funds for jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The judge described the administration's executive orders on the matter as an unconstitutional "coercive threat." This decision marks another legal setback for the administration's efforts to compel local governments to assist in its immigration policies.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers' Offense Stalls in 2-1 Loss to Padres, Forfeiting Sole Possession of First Place</h2>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers were held to just three hits in a 2-1 loss to the San Diego Padres, causing them to fall back into a tie for first place in the National League West. Despite a strong seven-inning performance from pitcher Blake Snell, the Dodgers' offense was largely silenced by Padres' starter Yu Darvish. The loss squandered the momentum the Dodgers had built after sweeping the same Padres team just a week prior. A failed rally in the ninth inning sealed the defeat, tightening the division race.</p>

          <p>China's growing presence in the Arctic is causing unease in the United States, highlighted by the recent arrival of a five-strong fleet of Chinese icebreakers and research vessels in the region. The US Coast Guard has been monitoring the fleet, which reportedly came within 290 nautical miles of the Alaskan coast, near a disputed area of the "extended continental shelf" claimed by the US. This activity underscores China's intensifying interest in the Arctic for scientific and potentially strategic purposes, contributing to geopolitical tensions in the high north.</p>
