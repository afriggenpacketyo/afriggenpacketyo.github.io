          <p>Belinda Taylor, a 48-year-old woman from Totnes, died in a skydiving accident in Devon, along with skydiving instructor Adam Harrison. Taylor's partner, Scott Armstrong, described her as a "caring, giving person" who "loved adventure" and was the mother of four children. She worked as a massage therapist and volunteered at a food bank, always putting others' needs before her own. Friends and family remember her adventurous spirit, kindness, and the joy she brought to those around her, with investigations underway by police, British Skydiving, and the East Devon District Council Environmental Health and Safety Office. Her loss has left a void in the community, as she was cherished for her generosity and vibrant personality.</p>

          <p>At Home, a home decor and furniture retailer with over 200 locations, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as part of a restructuring agreement. The agreement aims to eliminate $2 billion in debt and provide $200 million in capital for the restructuring process. The company, owned by Hellman & Friedman, had been struggling due to rising tariffs and missed an interest payment in May, leading to a forbearance agreement with lenders. The restructuring is expected to transfer ownership to lenders holding over 95% of the company's debt, with the majority of stores remaining open both in-store and online. The company faces challenges beyond debt, including a slowdown in consumer demand for home furnishings due to low consumer confidence and a sluggish housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The G7 summit in Canada is set to address ongoing trade instability, conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and uncertainty stemming from the White House's economic and foreign policies. Allies are expected to question President Trump's stance on major geopolitical issues, particularly regarding trade tariffs and potential trade wars. While Trump's 90-day pause on "reciprocal" tariffs is in effect, Japan and the EU are seeking deals before the July 9 deadline when higher trade duties could return. Bilateral meetings between Trump and leaders seeking trade agreements are anticipated, although the likelihood of significant deals remains uncertain, with Trump expressing confidence in potential progress.</p>

          <p>Vance Luther Boelter was arrested on suspicion of killing Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and wounding State Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. The arrest followed a two-day manhunt in a wooded rural area west of Minneapolis, where Boelter surrendered peacefully. Governor Tim Walz called the attack a "politically motivated assassination", while Mrs. Hoffman stated that both she and her husband felt "incredibly lucky to be alive", further adding that there is never a place for this kind of political hate. Investigators found a list of "targets" in Boelter's vehicle, including Governor Walz, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, and State Attorney General Keith Ellison, prompting notifications to authorities in neighboring states.</p>

However, the event was described as a "sad affair" with irregular marching and a low-energy crowd, contrasting with the vibrant and hopeful displays of the protesters. The event was seen as Trump's attempt to imitate a dictator, using the armed forces as a prop to demonstrate his love of violence and indifference to the constitution.</p>

          <p>Vance Boelter, the suspect in the shooting of two Minnesota lawmakers, is due in court to face charges of murder and attempted murder. Boelter is accused of killing State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and wounding State Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. Authorities recovered a target list from Boelter's car with the names of dozens of Minnesota Democrats, including Hoffman, Hortman, Governor Tim Walz, and U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, sparking a massive two-day manhunt that ended with Boelter's arrest.</p>

          <p>Over twenty Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire near aid distribution sites operated by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. The UN human rights chief, Volker Turk, accused Israel of weaponizing food and called for a full investigation into the attacks near the sites. The health ministry reports that at least 300 people have been killed and more than 2,600 wounded near aid distribution sites since the GHF began operations. The IDF has acknowledged its troops opened fire near aid sites on previous occasions and has contested the death toll, attributing much of the violence to Hamas.</p>

          <p>The case of Adriana Smith, a brain-dead pregnant woman in Georgia, has ignited debate between pro-choice and pro-life factions. Smith is being kept alive on life support against her family's wishes to allow her unborn child to gestate, raising questions about decision-making for incapacitated individuals. While Georgia's abortion ban influenced the hospital's decision, the case primarily concerns who should make decisions for permanently incapacitated people. Some argue that the hospital denied Smith's family the opportunity to decide whether she should be kept on life support, while others defend the hospital's actions to preserve the life of the fetus.</p>

A strategist at Quantum Strategy suggests using any lull in the conflict to invest in energy assets as a safe haven. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin dairy farmer, Adam Faust, has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging discrimination against white farmers through diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.

Faust previously sued the Biden administration for race discrimination in the USDA's Farmer Loan Forgiveness Plan.
