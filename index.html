          <p>Senator Lindsey Graham is moving forward with plans to fund President Trump's border security agenda, despite Senator Rand Paul's proposal to cut the funding by more than half. Graham, who chairs the Senate Budget Committee, is advocating for the Senate to fully fund the President's border security plan, which includes building a wall, increasing ICE detention capacity, and hiring more Border Patrol Agents. Senator Paul argues that the White House's funding request is excessive and that significant cuts could be made without compromising border security. The Senate is working to pass a bill advancing Trump’s agenda on taxes, immigration, energy, defense, and the national debt, aiming to cut $1.5 trillion in federal spending (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Congressional Democrats and some Republicans are criticizing the multimillion-dollar cost of the Army's 250th-anniversary parade, which President Trump has long advocated for. The Army estimates the parade will cost between $25 million and $45 million, including the participation of 6,700 troops, tanks, military vehicles, and aircraft. Critics argue that the money could be better spent on supporting military families or medical defense research. The parade coincides with Trump's 79th birthday and will feature a presentation of an American flag and the administration of the constitutional oath to Army enlistees.</p>

          <p>President Trump has affirmed his support for Chinese students studying in the United States, stating that he is in favor of allowing them to stay and work for American companies after graduation. This stance appears to reverse previous initiatives from his administration that aimed to limit or block international students due to national security concerns. Trump emphasized that having Chinese students in the U.S. is beneficial for both American schools and the country as a whole. He noted that if these graduates are not allowed to remain in the U.S., they may return to their home countries and start businesses there.</p>

Noem was criticizing California's governor and Los Angeles's mayor when Padilla attempted to ask a question and was escorted out of the room. Padilla stated he was trying to get information about DHS's immigration enforcement actions and claimed he was forced to the ground and handcuffed, though not detained or arrested. The Department of Homeland Security asserted Padilla was an "attacker" and that officers acted appropriately, while politicians have reacted to the incident, with Governor Newsom calling it "outrageous, dictatorial, and shameful."</p>

The agreement may include a US commitment to revoke some of its tech embargoes in return for China's relaxation of rare earth export restrictions. China had previously tightened its rare earth exports, which impacted US car manufacturers and defense companies, prompting Trump to engage in talks with Xi Jinping.

California's governor and attorney general filed an emergency request to block the expansion of what they call an "unlawful militarization." The state argues that Trump failed to meet the legal requirements for such a federal deployment, while the Department of Justice argues that limiting the military would amount to a "rioters' veto to enforcement of federal law."

          <p>Senator Alex Padilla, a Democrat from California, was handcuffed and forced to the ground by police officers after being forcibly removed from a press conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles. Padilla interrupted Noem as she discussed her department's plans to continue deportation efforts in California, which have led to protests. Padilla stated he was not arrested or detained, while DHS blamed Padilla for the altercation, claiming he was not wearing a security pin and was lunging at Noem.

          <p>President Trump's attendance at a performance of 'Les Misérables' at the Kennedy Center has drawn criticism, given the musical's themes of protesting autocracy and fighting for social justice, contrasting with Trump's political actions. Trump, who ousted the chair of the Kennedy Center's board and installed himself in the role, attended the performance as a fundraiser. His attendance also coincided with protests in Los Angeles against his administration's treatment of immigrants, prompting him to deploy military force. The article explores the irony of Trump's appreciation for a musical that critiques the very principles he appears to embody.</p>
