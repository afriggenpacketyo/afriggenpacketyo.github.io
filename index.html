          <p>Oil giant Shell announced better-than-expected adjusted earnings of $4.26 billion for the second quarter, surpassing analyst forecasts despite a challenging backdrop of lower global oil and gas prices. The company maintained its commitment to shareholder returns by announcing another $3.5 billion in share buybacks, marking its 15th consecutive quarter of substantial buybacks. CEO Wael Sawan noted the company's strong performance and ongoing transformation efforts, which have included achieving $800 million in structural cost reductions this year. Shell's share price has outperformed competitors, indicating investor approval of its strategy focused on performance, discipline, and simplification. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a victim of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has issued a strong plea to President Donald Trump, urging him not to pardon Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's convicted accomplice. They assert that Maxwell is a "monster" who should remain in prison, emphasizing the profound and lasting suffering Giuffre endured while assisting prosecutors, including death threats and financial ruin. The family also expressed shock and concern over Trump's recent claim that Epstein "stole" Giuffre from Mar-a-Lago, raising questions about his awareness of Epstein and Maxwell's criminal activities. They believe any leniency for Maxwell would be a significant injustice.</p>

          <p>A Delta Air Lines flight traveling from Salt Lake City to Amsterdam was compelled to make an emergency landing in Minneapolis due to severe in-flight turbulence, which led to 25 passengers requiring hospitalization. Flight tracking data indicated a significant and rapid altitude change approximately 40 minutes into the journey, necessitating the diversion. Delta confirmed the aircraft landed safely and expressed gratitude for the prompt response from emergency services. This incident highlights growing concerns among scientists who suggest that climate change could increase the frequency of such severe turbulence events in the future.</p>

          <p>American cyclist Matteo Jorgenson of Visma Lease-a-Bike demonstrated immense dedication as a domestique in the Tour de France, primarily tasked with supporting team leader Jonas Vingegaard against the formidable Tadej Pogačar. Despite Pogačar's overwhelming dominance throughout the race, Jorgenson consistently exerted himself, launching attacks and pushing his limits, even while battling bronchitis. Although his efforts didn't directly lead to a general classification victory for his team, his relentless pressure cumulatively exhausted Pogačar. This strategic attrition ultimately created an opening for teammate Wout van Aert to clinch a significant stage win on the final day, validating Jorgenson's agonizing, selfless contributions.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reported a significant increase in arrests of undocumented immigrants in the Houston area for offenses involving the sexual exploitation of minors, with 214 individuals apprehended in six months, exceeding the prior fiscal year's total. Former Arizona Supreme Court Judge Andrew Gould attributed this surge to Houston's proximity to the southern border and a renewed political will under the Trump administration to prioritize the removal of individuals charged with felonies, especially those involving children. The success of these operations relies heavily on close cooperation between local and federal law enforcement, which improves efficiency and boosts morale among departments.</p>

          <p>Russian forces launched a severe barrage of drones and missiles on Kyiv, resulting in at least six fatalities, including a six-year-old child, and over 50 injuries, with one strike devastating a residential high-rise. Ukrainian officials reported widespread damage across the capital, describing a "horrible morning." These attacks occurred despite US President Donald Trump's recent warnings of impending tougher sanctions on Moscow if a ceasefire is not agreed upon by August 8. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the actions as "demonstrative murder," emphasizing that peace without strength remains impossible in the face of such aggression.</p>

Furthermore, the CAC noted that American AI experts have allegedly identified mature "tracking and positioning" and "remote shutdown" technologies within Nvidia's computing chips.

Critics argue that such a ban could inadvertently drive young users to less regulated online platforms, potentially exposing them to greater risks.

          <p>Shares of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean surged over 16% to a nine-year high following US President Donald Trump's announcement of a 15% tariff on Seoul's exports to the US. Hanwha Group's vice chairman was part of a delegation lobbying for the trade deal, and the company is expected to expand its Philly Shipyard in Philadelphia, playing a key role in revitalizing US shipbuilding. The stock gains also follow Hanwha Ocean's strong second-quarter operating profits, which reversed previous losses. The company is also launching initiatives to boost global competitiveness against Chinese rivals and has established a new engineering center in India. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At least 30 Palestinians were reportedly killed and approximately 300 wounded by Israeli gunfire while attempting to access humanitarian aid in northern Gaza, according to the Hamas-run civil defense agency. The Israeli Defense Forces stated they fired "warning shots" at a distance and were not aware of casualties from their actions, but Gaza hospital sources later reported increased fatalities. This tragic event occurs as UN-backed global food security experts warn that a "worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out" in Gaza. The UN Secretary-General has emphasized that the current "trickle of aid" must transform into an "ocean" to alleviate the dire humanitarian situation.</p>

New Delhi prioritizes protecting its local farmers by resisting greater market access for American agricultural products, a key concern for its large voting bloc. Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal affirmed India's commitment to national interest over deadlines, aiming for a comprehensive deal by late 2025. Analysts suggest the US has strategic reasons not to alienate India, viewing it as a potential alternative to China in global manufacturing and a critical partner in managing great power rivalry.

President Christina H. Paxson affirmed that the agreement safeguards the university's academic independence, including a clause preventing government interference in curriculum content.

Despite this initial, smaller-scale deal, the team is widely anticipated to remain active before Thursday's deadline.

          <p>UK high streets are confronting an "endless battle" against organized crime gangs engaged in the illicit trade of tobacco and vapes, leading to widespread shop closures and instilling fear within communities. In Newport, for instance, 19 establishments were shuttered in nine months due to illegal sales, with residents reporting instances of intimidation, open drug dealing, and even an acid attack. Trading Standards officers describe a complex challenge involving forced labor and the use of "stash cars" for illegal stock, compounded by limited legal powers for permanent closures. This illicit trade significantly deprives public services of revenue and underscores the difficulties local authorities face in protecting communities from such pervasive criminal activities.</p>

President Trump has publicly supported the plan, which seeks to bolster the GOP's slim House majority.
