          <p>DoorDash announced its acquisition of restaurant booking platform SevenRooms for $1.2 billion in an all-cash deal, expected to close in the second half of 2025. The company also reported first-quarter revenue of $3.03 billion, which fell short of the expected $3.09 billion. Despite the revenue miss, DoorDash highlighted strong consumer demand and engagement across its marketplaces. The company also stated that they have agreed to a deal with Deliveroo worth $3.9 billion, which will expand their ability to build world class services that increase their potential to grow local commerce and support their financial goals.</p>

          <p>New trade data reveals a sharp decline in U.S. imports and exports, reminiscent of the disruptions seen during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, with the agricultural sector being particularly affected. Ports are experiencing significant decreases in export volumes, especially for key farm products like soybeans and corn, due to tariffs implemented by the Trump administration. Retailers are warning consumers to buy soon, as inventory levels may become lean in the coming months due to these trade disruptions. Hawaii-based liner operator Matson lowered its 2025 outlook, citing a 30% year-over-year decline in container volume since the tariffs were put in place.</p>

          <p>Colombian authorities have arrested over 200 suspected members of the Gulf Clan, the country's largest drug cartel, accused of murdering two dozen security force members recently. President Gustavo Petro has accused the group of systematically targeting security forces, leading to a large-scale response by law enforcement. The cartel, which engages in illegal gold mining, racketeering, and migrant smuggling, is believed to have around 7,500 members and funds its activities primarily through cocaine trafficking. The arrests come amidst a surge in violence in Colombia since the 2016 peace deal with the FARC guerrilla army.</p>

          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, now a mayoral candidate, has released a 36-page plan to address the city's mental health crisis, focusing on removing severely mentally ill individuals from the streets. The plan includes expanding involuntary hospitalizations, requiring screenings for mandatory outpatient treatment upon discharge from hospitals and jails, and adding more supportive housing units and psychiatric beds. Cuomo's proposals align with similar efforts by Mayor Eric Adams and Governor Kathy Hochul, who have also pushed for changes to force more people into treatment. The plan allocates $2.6 billion in capital funding over five years to build at least 600 additional supportive housing units annually, and addresses criticism that Cuomo oversaw a reduction in psychiatric beds as governor.</p>

          <p>Luxury carmaker Ferrari reported a 17% jump in first-quarter profit, driven by strong demand for personalized vehicles.

          <p>Recent polls in the UK indicate a decline in Labour's support since their victory last summer, with the Reform party gaining ground. Reform even held the voting intention lead for the entire month of February, marking a significant challenge to the major parties. Support for Reform has grown across all demographic groups, especially among younger voters, while Labour's support has decreased across the country. The Prime Minister's approval ratings have also declined, and the first-past-the-post system may lead to an imbalance between national vote share and the number of seats won by Reform.</p>

These facilities are being revived for immigration detainees, with contracts awarded to for-profit prison corporations like CoreCivic and Geo Group. Concerns have been raised about conditions in these facilities, including reports of stabbings, suicides, and lack of basic resources. The ACLU has criticized the administration for ignoring safety concerns and placing immigrants in facilities with dangerous conditions.</p>

          <p>House Judiciary Committee Democrats have launched a review of the Trump administration's decision to freeze funding for hundreds of organizations providing services to crime victims. The investigation seeks information on whether the cuts were directed by Elon Musk's Department of Governmental Efficiency and what criteria were used to decide to restore funding to some organizations. The committee is questioning how the Department of Justice plans to support crime victims after terminating grants that support critical services.</p>

          <p>Hispanic consumers are reducing their grocery spending, impacting sales for companies like Coca-Cola, Constellation Brands, and Colgate-Palmolive. Executives attribute this decline to concerns about stricter immigration policies and broader economic worries. Constellation Brands, which relies heavily on Hispanic consumers for its beer sales, provided a weaker-than-expected outlook, citing these concerns. Hispanic consumers make up a meaningful percentage of Keurig Dr Pepper's business, but CEO Tim Cofer noted a decline in both trips and spending per trip among this demographic.</p>

          <p>Congress is considering imposing a steep tax on university endowments, a move that would significantly impact the finances of elite higher education institutions. While taxing wealthy university endowments has been championed by both the left and right, the motivations differ. Republicans aim to punish universities they view as too left-leaning, while progressives seek to redistribute educational resources. Studies suggest that taxing university endowments may not solve affordability or exclusivity problems and could lead to tuition increases and cuts in financial aid.</p>

While officials deny any currency talks with the U.S., the currency weakened over 3% against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday. This comes after a meteoric 9% rally over the previous two trading days. Experts attribute the dramatic swings to exporters converting U.S. dollar reserves and life insurers hedging their U.S. dollar debt holdings.</p>
