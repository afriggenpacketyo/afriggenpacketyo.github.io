        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia and Ukraine executed another prisoner swap, each side bringing home 307 soldiers, amidst ongoing conflict. This exchange occurred shortly after a large-scale combined drone and missile attack injured over a dozen people in Kyiv, with subsequent drone strikes injuring at least seven more. Ukrainian officials reported that Russia launched a second round of drone strikes on Kyiv early Sunday. Despite these exchanges, battles continue along the 620-mile front line, with neither country relenting in their deep strikes, and diplomatic efforts to reach a ceasefire remain challenging, though President Trump said he held a two-hour phone call with Putin which he described as "excellent." The prisoner swap is seen as a moment of cooperation in otherwise failed efforts to reach a ceasefire in the three-year war. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author, journalist, and activist whose book ‚ÄúAgainst Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual Assault‚Äù helped redefine the modern understanding of sexual assault as a crime of power and violence rather than passion, has died at the age of 90. Her groundbreaking work, published in 1975, provided the first comprehensive history of sexual assault across centuries and examined its use as a wartime military tactic. The book's publication, coinciding with increased awareness of sexual violence, helped open the public's eyes to the issue, leading to the establishment of numerous rape-crisis centers and reforms in state laws to facilitate the prosecution of sexual assault cases. Brownmiller's work also sparked controversy, with critics labeling it an anti-male polemic, but it remains a significant contribution to feminist thought and activism.</p>

          <p>A teenager was arrested in Huntington Beach, California, on suspicion of murder after allegedly shooting and killing a 29-year-old man with a flare gun. Police responded to reports of a shooting near Florida Street and Utica Avenue, where they found Jose Manuel Nares suffering from a gunshot wound and later died at the hospital. The suspect fled the scene but was quickly apprehended by responding officers, and the weapon was recovered, with detectives believing this was an isolated incident and that there is no ongoing threat to the community. While statistics on flare gun fatalities are limited, authorities note that flare guns can cause injury and can be modified to fire other types of ammunition.</p>

          <p>North Korea has detained three shipyard officials, including the chief engineer, construction head, and an administrative manager, following an accident during the launch of a new warship. The 5,000-ton destroyer sustained damage to its bottom, causing it to tip off balance during the launch ceremony, which leader Kim Jong Un described as a "criminal act." State media identified the detained officials as being responsible for the accident, and an investigation is currently underway to determine the full extent of the mishap.

          <p>Israeli strikes in Gaza have resulted in the deaths of nearly 80 people, including nine of a doctor's ten children, with the Hamas-run Health Ministry reporting that hospitals in the north are now inaccessible. The Israeli military claims it struck suspects operating from a structure next to its forces in Khan Younis, describing the area as a dangerous war zone and stating that the claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review. Accusations have also surfaced that the Israeli military is using Palestinians as human shields, sending them into buildings and tunnels to check for bombs and gunmen, a practice prohibited by international law. Despite these allegations, Israel's military denies the use of human shields and accuses Hamas of using civilians as shields, blaming them for the civilian death toll.</p>

Despite the disruption, festival organizers confirmed that all scheduled events, including the closing ceremony, would proceed as planned, with the Palais des Festivals switching to an independent power supply.

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada has invited King Charles III to open the 45th Canadian parliament, a move interpreted as a demonstration of Canada's sovereignty and independence against perceived threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. This invitation is significant as it marks a rare occasion, with the last British monarch delivering Canada's throne speech in 1977 and opening a new session of parliament in 1957. Carney's decision signals a more supportive stance towards the Crown, contrasting with previous Liberal leaders, and comes at a time when Trump has undermined Canada's sovereignty and imposed tariffs that threaten its economic stability. While the Canadian population is largely indifferent to the British monarchy, the invitation underscores Canada's unique traditions and separation from the United States.</p>

The 76-year-old musician made the announcement on social media, expressing his sincere apology to fans and noting that his doctors advised him against performing. NPH occurs when cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the brain, leading to problems with walking, cognitive symptoms, and urinary incontinence, but is often misdiagnosed as normal signs of aging or other conditions like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. Joel is undergoing physical therapy and hopes to return to the stage in the future, and doctors say that going public with his diagnosis could help others get the help they need sooner.</p>

Driving instructors cite increased expenses like car costs, fuel, and insurance as reasons for the price hikes, while learners express frustration at the financial burden and the need to cut back on other essential expenses. The practical test backlog also forces learners to take more lessons to maintain their skills, adding to the overall cost.

          <p>Anna Holligan, a BBC journalist based in Amsterdam, reports the theft of her custom-made cargo bike, which she used as a mobile broadcasting studio. The bike, dubbed the Bike Bureau, was essential for her reporting series "Dutch News from the Cycle Path" and allowed her to broadcast live from various locations. The theft has resonated with colleagues and the local community, who recognize the bike's importance as a symbol of sustainable journalism and a tool for showcasing working motherhood. Despite the setback, Holligan remains hopeful about finding a new way to continue her reporting and maintain her connection with the community.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is facing criticism for prioritizing white South Africans (Afrikaners) as refugees while thousands of other refugees remain in limbo due to policy changes. President Trump's administration opened a refugee pathway exclusively for Afrikaners, citing racial discrimination, while simultaneously restricting routes for other migrants. This decision has sparked controversy, with refugee advocacy groups arguing that every case of protection should be based on credible evidence of persecution and equal treatment under the law. The situation has left many refugees feeling stuck and questioning the fairness of the U.S. refugee program.</p>

          <p>Victims of Joel Le Scouarnec, France's most prolific known pedophile, are expressing frustration over the lack of public interest in his trial, where he admitted to sexually assaulting 299 people, mostly children. Despite the trial's significance and the horrific nature of the crimes, it has been met with widespread indifference, leading victims to form a campaign group to pressure authorities and question the lack of government attention. Victims accuse French society of ignoring the case due to a culture of deference and a reluctance to acknowledge child sexual abuse. Some observers have reflected on the absence of a single, totemic figure like Gis√®le Pelicot, whose public courage caught the public imagination and enabled people to find some light in an otherwise bleak story.</p>

          <p>Young men in the U.S. are increasingly joining Russian Orthodox churches that promote a virile, unapologetic form of masculinity, often rejecting modern American societal norms. These churches, like the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR), attract converts seeking a sense of traditional values and a rejection of what they perceive as over-feminization in Western culture. Leaders like Father Moses McPherson champion a version of masculinity that emphasizes physical strength, traditional gender roles, and a rejection of contraception. The trend reflects broader political shifts and a growing interest in Russia as a bastion of traditional Christianity.</p>
