          <p>Southeast Asian leaders convened in Kuala Lumpur, addressing concerns about the impact of new U.S. tariffs on regional economies. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim highlighted the strain on the global trading system due to the tariffs, which range from 10% to 49% affecting ASEAN members. Anwar Ibrahim said he wrote to U.S. President Donald Trump to propose an ASEAN-U.S. meeting to negotiate the tariffs. The leaders warned that unilateral tariffs pose complex challenges to ASEAN's economic growth, stability, and integration, reaffirming their commitment to a non-discriminatory multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organization (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A manhunt is underway in northern Arkansas for Grant Hardin, a former police chief convicted of first-degree murder and sexual assault, after he escaped from a high-security prison dressed in a fake law enforcement uniform. Hardin, 56, escaped from the Calico Rock North Central Unit on Sunday and is considered extremely dangerous, according to county officials. Prior to his conviction, Hardin had a history of law enforcement positions and faced reports of excessive force and falsifying a police report. He was serving a 30-year sentence for the 2017 murder of James Appleton and an additional 50 years for a 1997 sexual assault case.</p>

          <p>Sexual orientation develops during puberty through a complex interplay of biological and psychosocial factors, with no single cause identified. Human sexuality is characterized by its diversity, and sexual orientation is considered a matter of fate, not choice, developing during adolescence under the influence of sex hormones. After this developmental phase, sexual preference remains stable, despite societal pressures to conform. Despite universal human rights including the right to free sexual orientation, individuals continue to face exclusion, discrimination, and persecution in many countries due to their sexual orientation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent call to wind down the war in Gaza signals a shift in tone from Israel's strongest allies, including the United States, Britain, and France, who are now placing overt pressure on Israel. These countries, which initially supported Israel's response to the Hamas-led attack, now criticize the expansion of operations in Gaza as disproportionate. Britain has suspended trade negotiations with Israel and sanctioned Israeli extremists, while France is organizing a conference to discuss the creation of a Palestinian state. Despite these moves, these countries continue to support Israel in practical ways, but the shift in messaging indicates a growing impatience with Prime Minister Netanyahu.</p>

          <p>The article presents a case against summer, arguing that it is an overrated season filled with heat, boredom, and disappointment. The author criticizes the summer industrial complex, which promotes idealized images of beaches and vacations that often fail to meet expectations. The author argues that summer lacks significant events, and the calendar is filled with indistinguishable days, making it a time of collective inaction. The author also points out the increasing danger of extreme heat due to climate change.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that invasive alien plants and animals have cost Europe over $1.5 trillion in the last six decades, highlighting the significant economic impact of these species. The research assessed data on 162 invasive species, estimating their damage to agriculture and national economies across numerous countries. Invasive plants were found to be the most costly, followed by arthropods, mammals, birds, molluscs, and fish. The study indicates that the global economic impact of invasive species could be several times higher than previously thought.</p>

          <p>Marcel Ophuls, the German-born filmmaker best known for his documentary “The Sorrow and the Pity,” has died at the age of 97. The film, released in 1969, challenged the myth of widespread French resistance to the Nazi occupation during World War II. Ophuls interviewed ordinary citizens of Clermont-Ferrand, revealing the complexities of collaboration and resistance during the war. His other notable works include “Hôtel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie,” which won an Academy Award.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has dismissed claims of potential Russian involvement in alleged arson attacks at properties connected to Prime Minister Keir Starmer as "ludicrous." This denial follows media reports suggesting that UK security officials are investigating a possible link between the attacks and Russia. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that London tends to suspect Russia of all negative events occurring in Great Britain, but such suspicions are typically groundless and lack evidence. Three individuals, including two Ukrainian nationals and a Romanian man, have been charged in connection with the police investigation into the attacks.</p>

          <p>The head of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), Jake Wood, resigned, stating that the organization could not operate in adherence to humanitarian principles within the framework of the Israel-backed plan. The plan, which involves private contractors delivering aid to Palestinians through Israel-designated distribution sites, has faced criticism from the United Nations. Wood expressed pride in developing a plan that could feed hungry people while addressing security concerns, but ultimately found it incompatible with humanitarian standards. The GHF plans to begin delivering aid despite Wood's resignation, aiming to reach one million Palestinians by the end of the week.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on China and proposed tax bill may jeopardize the burgeoning U.S. battery industry, which depends on Chinese components and federal subsidies. The tariffs have already increased battery costs for U.S. buyers, and the Republican budget bill could restrict access to subsidies for battery production and installation. Companies like LG Energy Solution and Tesla have expressed concerns about the impact of these policies on their operations and the overall energy sector. The potential disruption to the battery industry could hinder the country's ability to meet rising power demand and transition to renewable energy (not investment advice).</p>

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that they targeted a Hamas and Islamic Jihad command and control center in the area, accusing Hamas of using the Gazan population as human shields.

          <p>The article argues that the Trump administration is engaging in a subtle form of constitutional crisis by practicing "legalistic noncompliance," where the executive branch uses legal arguments to claim compliance with court orders while actually defying them. Examples include the administration's actions regarding the Alien Enemies Act, the freeze on USAID funds, and the future of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This approach lowers public awareness of noncompliance and risks normalizing defiance of judicial oversight, potentially leading to legalized noncompliance where courts enable the administration's actions.</p>
