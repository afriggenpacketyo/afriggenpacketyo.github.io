        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has incurred over €1.1 million in administrative penalties since 2017, accounting for more than half of the total €1.8 million fined to all German political parties. These fines relate to issues such as illegal donations, misuse of parliamentary funds, and false financial reporting. The largest transgression involved illegal donations from a Swiss company for election advertising. The AfD attributes this to its relatively young party history and lack of experience, stating it now employs a strict 'six-eye-principle' and intensive training to prevent future violations.</p>

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul announced that Germany will not currently back proposed European Union sanctions against Israel. The EU had considered cutting research funding for Israeli companies after an internal review suggested Israel's actions in Gaza violated an EU-Israel agreement on human rights. Wadephul stated that Germany is not convinced by this proposal, opting instead for restricting weapons deliveries to Israel, which he views as a more targeted and effective approach. This decision highlights differing strategies among EU members regarding accountability for the conflict.</p>

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul emphasized the necessity for Europe to prioritize fulfilling its support commitments to Ukraine to compel Russian President Vladimir Putin to engage in negotiations. Speaking at an EU foreign ministers' meeting in Copenhagen, Wadephul noted that ongoing Russian attacks demonstrate Moscow's unwillingness for talks. He called on EU partners to 'increase the pressure' on Putin by honoring existing support measures and considering further actions, asserting that only concrete aid would bring Russia to the negotiating table. Other issues, he suggested, should be deferred until this primary goal is achieved.</p>

He acknowledged that the path to reform would be 'difficult' and involve 'painful decisions' and 'cuts,' but asserted his determination to renew the country for future generations.

Berlin police state force was used after warnings to disperse were ignored, and the incident has been referred to oversight authorities. The event has sparked protests at the German Embassy in Dublin.</p>

          <p>The body of a German man, missing for nearly a week, has been recovered from Lake Como in northern Italy. The 55-year-old father from Bühl disappeared after jumping from a rented boat to save his children, who were successfully rescued. An unmanned robot located his body at a depth of 220 meters, which was then brought to the surface by divers. Authorities suspect he was caught in a strong current in one of Europe's deepest lakes. The recovery concludes a week-long search hampered by bad weather and strong winds.</p>

          <p>The case of Marla-Svenja Liebich, a convicted neo-Nazi extremist who legally changed gender under Germany's new Self-Determination Act, has ignited a national debate. Liebich, previously known as Sven Liebich, was sentenced to 18 months for incitement and defamation, having used derogatory terms against transgender individuals. After becoming Marla-Svenja, she requested to serve her sentence in a women's facility, prompting Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt to question potential abuses of the law by extremists. Critics argue that using one individual's actions to potentially restrict rights for others undermines the law's intent.</p>

          <p>Ten years after former Chancellor Angela Merkel's iconic 'Wir schaffen das!' (we can do it!) declaration, Germany is assessing the enduring impact of its 2015 migration policy. The country welcomed over a million refugees, leading to significant societal, cultural, and political shifts. While two-thirds of refugees from that wave found employment by 2022, a notable unemployment gap persists, with migrants four times more likely to be jobless. Current Chancellor Friedrich Merz, from Merkel's own party, has distanced himself from the policy, emphasizing the need for controlled immigration and better integration, indicating ongoing national debate on the issue.</p>

A group of masked men attempted to enter the Crowne Plaza hotel through a rear entrance, damaging security fences.

Two police officers sustained minor injuries, but protesters did not gain entry to any hotels.

The drones broadcast loud sounds, including AC/DC's 'Thunderstruck,' movie dialogue from 'Marriage Story,' and live human voices, to scare predators away. This experiment is part of ongoing efforts to foster coexistence between recovering wolf populations and ranchers, who have historically faced livestock losses. While previous nonlethal methods like fencing and guard dogs have been used, drones offer a new, adaptable approach to hazing, with early trials showing successful interruptions of wolf hunts.

Johnson accused the Trump administration of 'behaving outside the bounds of the constitution' and stated the city would pursue legal avenues if rights are violated. The White House, however, criticized the move as a 'publicity stunt' and urged Democrats to focus on crime reduction.</p>

          <p>This commentary article delves into the complex ethical questions surrounding the overdose death of Google executive Forrest Hayes and the culpability of Alix Tichelman, who pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter. The author questions why Tichelman, who was also injecting heroin, faced legal consequences while Hayes, who arranged the encounter and requested the injection, is often given a pass. The article highlights the consensual nature of their drug use and the 'glacial' reaction of Tichelman after Hayes collapsed, contrasting it with her previous actions in another overdose. Ultimately, it suggests that blame and accountability in this case are not solely forensic but ethical.</p>

Investigators discovered Hayes, a married father of five, had a secret liaison with 26-year-old aspiring model Alix Tichelman, whom he met through a 'sugar daddy' dating website. Surveillance video from the yacht, obtained after a court order, revealed Tichelman preparing and injecting both herself and Hayes with heroin.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to issue an executive order requiring voter identification for every vote cast, with 'no exceptions.' He also stated intentions to end mail-in voting, except for the severely ill and military personnel stationed far away. Trump has consistently made unsubstantiated claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election and baseless allegations of non-citizen voting. While federal elections are administered at the state level, the constitutional power of a president to enact such measures unilaterally remains unclear. These proposed changes align with his long-standing efforts to reform the electoral system.</p>

This shift presents an opportunity for the KMT to capitalize on growing discontent with the DPP, but internal leadership struggles could hinder its ability to effectively challenge the current government and consolidate its position.</p>

This policy aims to boost the economy by utilizing untapped resources, drawing comparisons to Donald Trump's 'drill baby drill' approach.

This beetle, which has destroyed millions of spruce trees across Europe, was found to be entering the UK via winds across the English Channel, not just imported wood. Drones survey vast forest areas for signs of infestation, while sniffer dogs detect the beetle's pheromones and waste in timber stacks. These innovative methods have reportedly led to the eradication of the beetle from at-risk areas in southeast England, though climate change poses future challenges.</p>
