          <h2>Justice Department Revises Policy on Seeking Reporter Records in Leak Investigations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 18:49:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the reversal of a Biden administration policy, now allowing federal authorities to seek reporters' phone records and compel testimony in leak investigations. Bondi stated this change is necessary to protect a broader range of government secrets, including "classified, privileged and other sensitive information." First Amendment advocates have expressed concerns, particularly given President Trump's history of criticizing leaks and the press. The new memo's phrasing suggests a potential expansion beyond previous policies, raising fears of increased government intrusion into journalistic activities.</p>

          <p>Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering a health insurance executive in Manhattan, pleaded not guilty, prompting Judge Margaret Garnett to caution the U.S. attorney general against making public statements that could bias the trial.

          <p>Small businesses are requesting relief from the Trump administration's tariffs on foreign goods, arguing that these taxes disproportionately affect their operations due to thin margins. Senator Ed Markey has urged the Small Business Administration to grant exemptions, highlighting the vulnerability of small enterprises to rising costs. The U.S. has increased tariffs on Chinese imports and imposed tariffs on other trading partners, which small business owners say are already jeopardizing their livelihoods. Isabel Guzman, former head of the SBA, emphasized the lack of cash reserves and supply chain diversity among small businesses, making them more susceptible to tariff challenges.</p>

These groups, some with ties to global jihadist networks, aim to merge the region with Pakistan and have been implicated in numerous high-profile attacks.
