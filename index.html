          <p>Approximately 60 protesters were arrested near the U.S. Capitol during a demonstration against President Trump's Army anniversary parade and the deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles.  The protesters, many of whom were veterans, crossed police lines while marching toward the Capitol.  The arrests highlight the ongoing tension surrounding military deployments for domestic purposes and the use of taxpayer money for such events. The arrests occurred on the eve of the Army's 250th-anniversary parade.</p>

          <p>Tourism from China to South Korea is increasing following a period of political instability in Seoul.  Bookings for April-June are significantly higher than previous months, indicating a rebound in travel.  Improved relations between the two countries, including a phone call between the leaders, are contributing to this increase.  The rise in tourism suggests that the easing of political tension is positively impacting cross-border travel.</p>
