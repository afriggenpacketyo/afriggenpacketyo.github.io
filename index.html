          <p>A Biden-appointed federal judge, Deborah Boardman, has drawn strong criticism from conservatives for sentencing Nicholas Roske to eight years in prison for attempting to assassinate Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. This sentence is significantly lower than the 30 years sought by the Department of Justice, with the judge citing mitigating factors like Roske's cooperation. Critics allege political bias and question the consideration of Roske's transgender identity, prompting the DOJ to announce an appeal.</p>

          <p>In Tbilisi, Georgia, police used water cannons and pepper spray to disperse anti-government protesters who tried to storm the presidential palace. The demonstrations, which saw tens of thousands waving Georgian and EU flags, are a continuation of a crisis following last year's disputed parliamentary election and the government's suspension of EU talks. Many opposition leaders are imprisoned, and protesters accuse the ruling Georgian Dream party of acting in Russia's interests.</p>

          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from transferring immigrant children to adult detention centers after they turn 18. This ruling reaffirms a 2021 order mandating their release to the "least restrictive setting" if they are not deemed a danger or flight risk. The administration also faces criticism for allegedly reviving family separation tactics and proposing $2,500 incentives for children to self-deport, further escalating federal clashes over immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Iran executed six death-row inmates, alleging they conducted attacks in the country's southwest on behalf of Israel, including killing police officers and orchestrating bombings. Human rights activists, however, claim the men were "Arab political prisoners" from 2019 protests who were subjected to torture and coerced confessions. These executions contribute to a wave of capital punishments in Iran, with over 1,000 recorded in 2025, a pace not seen in decades and criticized by international human rights experts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump asserted that a Gaza peace deal is "very close," despite Israel continuing its bombing campaign in the territory. He told Axios he would push to finalize the 20-point plan, with Hamas accepting parts but seeking further negotiations. Trump claimed he told Netanyahu, "Bibi, this is your chance for victory," and ordered Israel to stop bombing. The plan includes a ceasefire, hostage-prisoner exchange, and phased Israeli withdrawal, aiming to rehabilitate Israel's global image.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly urged Hamas to "move quickly" on the Gaza peace plan, warning that "all bets will be off" if there are delays. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed hope for the return of all hostages by October 13, coinciding with the end of the Sukkot holiday. While Israel reportedly reduced military activity to facilitate hostage location, Gaza officials noted continued airstrikes. U.S. envoys, including Jared Kushner, are heading to Egypt for talks on troop positioning, humanitarian aid, and prisoner exchanges.</p>

          <p>Turkey faces a delicate balancing act as the US and G7 nations pressure President Erdogan to reduce the country's substantial reliance on Russian oil and gas, which accounts for 66% of its oil imports and 41% of natural gas. Turkey benefits from discounted Russian energy due to sanctions but is actively diversifying its sources by securing long-term LNG contracts with American and Australian firms. This strategy aims to enhance energy security and improve relations with the US, despite the continued strong ties with Russia. (not investment advice)</p>
