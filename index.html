          <p>Google's $32 billion acquisition of Wiz, a cybersecurity startup, could revitalize the sluggish IPO and M&A markets.  The deal follows a previous failed offer and signals increased investor appetite for cybersecurity solutions, driven by the rise of AI and cloud computing. This could trigger further acquisitions in the sector and encourage more cybersecurity companies to pursue IPOs.</p>
