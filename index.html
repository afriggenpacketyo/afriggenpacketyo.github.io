          <p>Former President Donald Trump is threatening to obstruct the Washington Commanders' plan for a new stadium unless the NFL team reverts to its previous name, the Redskins. On his social media platform, Trump claimed there is significant public demand for the name change, also calling for the Cleveland Guardians to become the Indians again. The Commanders organization dropped its long-criticized name in 2020 amid concerns that it was a racial slur against Indigenous people. It remains unclear what authority Trump would have to block the stadium project, which involves redeveloping a site on federal property that Congress has already granted to the city.</p>

          <h2>Canada Becomes an Unlikely Epicenter for North American Measles Outbreak</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 20:50:31 EDT</div>

          <p>Canada is experiencing a significant measles outbreak in 2025, with over 3,800 cases reported, making it the only Western nation in the top 10 for current outbreaks. The spread, most prominent in Alberta and Ontario, has been linked to low vaccination rates, particularly within some Low German-speaking Mennonite communities, and fueled by post-pandemic vaccine hesitancy. Health officials note that while the U.S. has prominent anti-vaccine figures, Canada's situation is more complex, involving community distrust and misinformation. The outbreak highlights the vulnerability of under-vaccinated populations to the highly contagious and dangerous virus, which was declared eliminated in Canada in 1998.</p>

          <p>Scott Turner, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and a former player for the Washington Redskins, has publicly supported President Trump's call for the Washington Commanders to revert to their old name. In a social media post, Turner stated he was drafted by the Redskins, not the 'Commanders,' and affirmed that Trump is right to demand the change. This endorsement adds a new dimension to the controversy, as the team's current owner, Josh Harris, has clearly stated he is not considering another name change. The situation highlights a clash between political pressure and the franchise's current branding and direction.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns over looming tariff deadlines, several positive factors are currently bolstering the stock market. A strong second-quarter earnings season, led by the banking sector, has set a positive tone for investors. Additionally, proposed tax relief measures in President Trump's "big beautiful bill," such as extending 2017 tax cuts and increasing child tax credits, are expected to inject billions into the economy and support consumer spending. Other tailwinds include tax relief for business R&D, increased domestic manufacturing, and massive investments needed for data centers and the energy grid, suggesting a resilient economic outlook.

          <p>The UK government has issued a warning that individuals retiring in 2050 are projected to be financially worse off than today's pensioners unless retirement savings are significantly increased. To address this, the Department for Work and Pensions is reviving the Pensions Commission to investigate why nearly half of working-age adults, particularly low earners and the self-employed, are not contributing to private pensions. Analysis reveals stark disparities, including a 48% gender gap in private pension wealth for current retirees. The commission aims to build a national consensus on a future strategy to prevent a widespread retirement savings crisis.</p>

However, New York State Police later stated they found inconsistencies in his account and that there was no indication an abduction occurred. The investigation is now focused on the father's conflicting timeline and statements, with authorities confirming there is no ongoing threat to the public.

          <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals that public support for President Trump's deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the use of detention facilities. The shift in opinion coincides with a perception that the program is targeting more than just dangerous criminals. Meanwhile, the poll indicates that Americans, including many outside of Trump's base, want the administration to focus more on lowering prices, with seven in ten saying not enough is being done to address inflation. Initial public reaction to the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is also negative, with most believing it will primarily benefit the wealthy.</p>

While the loss weakens the coalition's legislative power, Ishiba asserted his focus remains on critical trade negotiations.

          <p>The UK's High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project, now billions over budget and years behind schedule, may have been destined for trouble due to fundamental national challenges, according to insiders. While mismanagement played a role, a key problem cited is the difficulty of building large infrastructure on a small, densely populated, and democratic island. The initial ambition to create the world's fastest railway drove up costs, and the complex legislative process required extensive and expensive compromises to appease local opposition. This suggests that any major UK infrastructure project faces inherent obstacles related to geography, property rights, and the political system.</p>

          <h2>New Book Uncovers Vatican Program That Sent Italian Children to America as Orphans</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book, "The Price of Children," reveals a Vatican-run program from 1950 to 1970 that sent approximately 3,500 Italian children to the U.S. for adoption, many of whom were not true orphans. The children were often born to unwed mothers who were pressured or misled into relinquishing them to Catholic institutions, believing it was a temporary arrangement. Church documents show that these children's identities were altered to declare them orphans, making them eligible for U.S. visas without their mothers' full consent. The investigation exposes a painful history for thousands of adoptees and their birth mothers who were tragically and permanently separated.</p>

          <p>Following his victory at The Open, Scottie Scheffler's performance is drawing comparisons to the dominance of Tiger Woods, as he becomes a defining force in modern golf. Since his 2021 Ryder Cup breakthrough, Scheffler has won four major championships and solidified his world number one ranking with machine-like consistency. While Scheffler himself dismisses the parallels, his peers and analysts point to his calm demeanor, ruthless ability to close out tournaments, and a recently improved putting game as key factors in his success. His unorthodox swing and quiet personality differ from Woods, but his results have established him as the undisputed benchmark for his competitors.</p>

Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups, have condemned the decision, arguing it will cripple the agency's ability to use the best available science and will have generational impacts on public health and safety.

          <p>During a recent concert, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin gave a humorous warning to the audience before performing the "Jumbotron Song," advising them to prepare in case they appeared on the large video screens. The warning follows a viral incident at a previous show where a man and woman, later identified as executives from the same company, were caught on camera in an intimate moment and quickly separated. That incident led to the CEO's resignation and a formal investigation by the company. Martin's new pre-song banter appears to be a lighthearted acknowledgment of the potential for awkward, high-profile moments during the fan-focused segment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, the most crucial skill for a successful life is self-connection—the ability to understand one's own emotions and needs. This skill builds emotional resilience, fosters healthy boundaries, and cultivates authentic confidence, acting as a buffer against anxiety and self-doubt. The article suggests that parents can nurture this by validating their child's feelings, welcoming their full range of emotions, and modeling their own self-awareness. Simple shifts in language, like asking "What were you feeling?" instead of "Why did you do that?", can help children develop a strong and trusting inner voice.</p>

Stein expresses concern within the business community that discussions between the two nations have focused almost exclusively on tariffs, neglecting other critical trade issues.

This development reopens questions about the viability and fairness of the tribunal system, the admissibility of evidence obtained through torture, and whether there will ever be a definitive legal resolution for the masterminds of the September 11th attacks.</p>

The incident occurred at a medical facility on Long Island, New York, when the man entered the MRI room without permission. The victim's wife, who was the patient, said she had called him in for assistance and that he was wearing a 20-pound chain used for weight training. The machine's powerful magnetic field attracted the metal chain, causing the fatal event. This tragic accident highlights the critical safety protocols required around MRI machines, which can turn any magnetic object into a dangerous projectile.</p>
