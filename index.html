          <p>The 2025 Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado for her persistent efforts to promote democracy in her country. The Nobel Committee highlighted her struggle against expanding authoritarianism and her commitment to a peaceful transition of power, framing the award in the context of a global retreat of democratic values. The committee emphasized that democracy is a fundamental precondition for lasting peace, recognizing Machado as a symbol of hope for a future where citizens' rights are protected.</p>

          <p>A scientific debate is intensifying over the creation of "mirror life," a synthetic form of biology with molecules that are mirror images of those found in nature. Proponents suggest it could revolutionize medicine by creating longer-lasting therapeutics, while opponents warn of catastrophic, uncontrollable risks, such as mirror bacteria evading immune systems and collapsing ecosystems. While the technology to create self-replicating mirror organisms is still decades away, some scientists are calling for a moratorium on such research, whereas others argue that banning it could stifle crucial scientific advancements and understanding of life's origins.</p>

          <p>At Leicester Crown Court, the organizer of a vigil for Madeleine McCann testified about being approached by Julia Wandelt, a woman who claims to be the missing girl. Janet Kennedy, Madeleine's great-aunt, stated she was "stunned" when Wandelt attended the 2024 vigil and attempted to give her an envelope for Kate and Gerry McCann, asserting she had proof of her identity. Wandelt and her associate Karen Spragg are on trial for stalking the McCanns, with the court hearing details of their alleged persistent and unwanted contact, which the family found deeply distressing.</p>

          <p>A powerful 7.4-magnitude earthquake, followed by a 6.9-magnitude aftershock, has struck the southern Philippines, resulting in at least five deaths and triggering tsunami alerts. The tremors caused significant damage, including landslides in a remote mining village and cracks in buildings, with an international airport in Davao city also affected. Authorities urged coastal residents to evacuate to higher ground due to the threat of "life-threatening wave heights," creating a tense situation as the region assesses the full extent of the disaster.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is leveraging the threat of laying off federal workers as a bargaining chip in the ongoing government shutdown, a departure from previous shutdowns where mass firings did not occur. President Trump has indicated plans to cut what he terms "Democrat Agencies," aligning with conservative goals to reduce the federal workforce, as outlined in proposals like "Project 2025." Labor unions have filed lawsuits challenging the legality of these threats, while furloughed employees face unpaid leave, contributing to what union leaders describe as the lowest morale ever seen.</p>

Despite his decorated career, Davids joined the struggling League Two club, bringing a Champions League-winning mentality that clashed with the lower-league environment, famously insisting players call him 'Sir'. His tenure was marked by on-field intensity, multiple red cards, wearing the number 1 jersey, and eventually skipping some away games, yet he is still remembered fondly for nearly saving the team from relegation.</p>

          <p>The NBA is marking its return to China with two preseason games in Macao, a significant step in rebuilding its relationship with its second-largest market after a six-year hiatus. The league is aiming to reconnect with its massive Chinese fanbase of over 425 million social media followers and unlock future growth as U.S. television viewership declines. The return is bolstered by a renewed partnership with Alibaba and reflects years of effort to overcome the political fallout from a 2019 controversy, signaling a renewed focus on the lucrative market.</p>

          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has officially designated Google's search and search advertising services with "strategic market status," activating new powers to regulate the tech giant. This move follows a nine-month investigation concluding that Google holds "substantial and entrenched market power," with over 90% of UK searches on its platform. While not a finding of wrongdoing, the designation allows the CMA to impose remedies, potentially including fairer search rankings and greater publisher control over content, to enhance competition in the digital market.</p>

          <p>Japan's long-standing ruling coalition has fallen apart after the junior partner, Komeito, withdrew its support for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The move effectively eliminates the parliamentary majority for incoming LDP leader Sanae Takaichi, casting serious doubt on her ability to become the country's first female prime minister. Komeito cited the LDP's failure to adequately address a persistent political slush-fund scandal as the reason for its withdrawal, creating significant political instability and uncertainty for Japan's leadership at a critical time.</p>
