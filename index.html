        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill encountered significant resistance as conservatives blocked it from advancing in the House Budget Committee due to insufficient federal spending cuts. Five Republicans opposed the legislation, citing concerns over delayed Medicaid work requirements and excessive front-loaded spending, which Speaker Johnson hopes to resolve. Blue-state Republicans are also withholding support unless the cap on state and local tax deductions is raised further, creating additional hurdles for the bill's passage. Trump has urged Republicans to unite, but disagreements persist, potentially delaying the bill's progress to the House floor before Memorial Day. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent report by Healthy Babies, Bright Futures has found concerning levels of toxic heavy metals, particularly arsenic and cadmium, in rice sold across the United States. The study found arsenic in 100% of the 145 rice samples tested, with one in four exceeding the FDA's limit for infant rice cereal. The report highlights the absence of limits for rice itself, despite its widespread consumption by infants and toddlers. The USA Rice Federation acknowledges consumer concerns and pledges to work with the FDA to ensure the U.S. rice supply meets established thresholds. </p>

While meetings between Ukrainian and Russian delegations did occur, Trump emphasized the need for his personal involvement to break the deadlock, citing the high number of casualties. The Kremlin has indicated that any meeting between Putin and Trump would require careful preparation, but acknowledged the necessity of a serious conversation on international issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model indicates that while many Americans may see lower taxes under the Republican tax plan, some could end up worse off due to associated spending cuts. The report suggests that lower-income individuals earning less than $51,000 annually may experience a decrease in after-tax income, particularly after 2026, due to reductions in federal programs like Medicaid and food stamps. In contrast, the wealthiest earners, those in the top 0.1 percent, could see significant gains. This assessment arrives as some conservative Republicans have blocked the tax package from moving forward, demanding further spending cuts.</p>

          <p>While it is legally permissible to stop paying credit cards, doing so can lead to serious financial consequences, including damaged credit, collection activity, and potential lawsuits. Credit card debt is unsecured, meaning lenders cannot seize assets, but they can pursue legal avenues to recover unpaid balances. Alternatives to consider before stopping payments include talking to the card issuer about hardship programs, seeking credit counseling, exploring debt settlement (with caution), or considering bankruptcy. Exploring these options can help manage debt without risking wage garnishment or long-term financial fallout. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republicans are divided on whether they are struggling to recruit competitive Senate candidates after several potential contenders passed on key races in 2026. High-profile Republicans like Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia and former Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire opted not to run, raising concerns about the party's ability to attract centrist candidates who can appeal to voters statewide. Some believe that candidates closely tied to Trump may struggle in statewide races due to backlash against his policies and federal government cuts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. consumer sentiment has fallen to its second-lowest level on record, driven by increasing concerns that tariffs will lead to higher inflation, according to a University of Michigan survey. The index of consumer sentiment dropped to 50.8 in May, with year-ahead inflation expectations rising to 7.3%. The majority of the survey was completed before the U.S. and China announced a 90-day pause on most tariffs, with uncertainty over trade policy dominating consumers' economic outlook. Investors and policymakers are closely monitoring inflation expectations, as the Federal Reserve aims to ensure long-term inflation expectations do not rise before resuming rate cuts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a report highlighting high levels of arsenic in rice brands across the U.S., experts recommend several strategies to limit exposure. These include diversifying your diet with rice alternatives like quinoa, barley, and couscous, which contain lower levels of heavy metals. Consumers are also advised to check labels for the rice's growing region, as rice grown in California typically has lower arsenic levels. Cooking rice like pasta, using a high water-to-rice ratio and draining the excess water, can also reduce arsenic content by 40% to 60%.</p>
