          <p>Gold prices have been consistently rising and may continue to do so in June due to factors like slowing inflation progress, frozen interest rates, and geopolitical tensions. Investors often turn to gold as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, potentially driving prices higher. Experts suggest considering fractional gold investments or dollar-cost averaging to manage the high price. While predicting gold prices is difficult, these factors suggest a potential for continued growth (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly criticized Vladimir Putin over the escalation of strikes on Kyiv, stating that Putin has gone "absolutely CRAZY!" and is "playing with fire." Despite previously touting his personal relationship with Putin, Trump's comments signal growing frustration. However, it remains uncertain whether Trump will take punitive action against Russia. While Trump mentioned considering new sanctions, the Kremlin dismissed his criticism as an "emotional reaction." Analysts suggest Trump's remarks may influence the U.S. attitude toward sanctions or aid to Ukraine.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to redirect $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to trade schools faces significant obstacles, according to education experts. Federal grants are awarded through a competitive process for specific research purposes, requiring specialized faculty and facilities. Trade schools typically offer vocational training and lack the infrastructure for the type of research funded by agencies like the NSF and NIH.

These actions build on a pattern of granting clemency to individuals who align with him politically or who he believes were unfairly targeted. Critics argue that Trump is stretching presidential pardon power beyond its norms, potentially undermining efforts to hold officials accountable. His choices reflect a de-emphasis on fraud and public corruption cases within the justice system.</p>
