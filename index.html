          <p>A devastating house fire in Brent, north-west London, resulted in the deaths of a 43-year-old woman, a 15-year-old girl, and two boys aged eight and four. Emergency services responded to the blaze in Tillett Close, Stonebridge, where two terraced three-storey homes were engulfed in flames. A 41-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody, while a woman in her 70s and a teenage girl were hospitalized. The London Fire Brigade deployed eight fire engines and approximately 70 firefighters to control the fire, which is now under investigation by police and fire services to determine its cause.</p>

          <p>Financial markets are increasingly uneasy with President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," particularly his plans for significant tariffs on EU imports. This article reports that the yield on 30-year U.S. government bonds has risen above 5%, nearing an 18-year high, and Moody's has downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating. Concerns center on the U.S.'s "twin deficit" and fears that Trump's policies will fuel inflation and trigger a recession. Economists are debating the potential dangers of high debt levels, and investors are questioning the safety of U.S. assets amid Trump's erratic policymaking.</p>

This article states that the State Department has banned the term "racially or ethnically motivated violent extremism" and plans to cut offices focused on countering violent extremism. Critics worry that the administration is prioritizing threats that align with Trump's base while deprioritizing the far-right threat, which they see as a politicized issue. These changes follow a pattern of moving resources away from programs addressing the far-right since Trump took office.</p>

This article reports that Milwaukee redirected police funding to affordable housing and youth programs, while Seattle created a third public safety department focused on mental health crises. Austin invested more in homeless services after diverting funds from the police budget. While public sentiment has shifted since 2020, organizers say the movement sparked important conversations about city priorities and reimagining public safety.</p>

          <p>A recent study reveals that UK employees work from home more than most of their global counterparts, averaging 1.8 days a week, compared to the international average of 1.3 days. Hybrid working patterns have become the dominant model in advanced economies, particularly in English-speaking countries. This trend is attributed to the cost and length of commuting, especially in London and south-east England. Despite some companies mandating a return to the office, home working levels in the UK have stabilized since 2023, with women and parents more likely to resist strict return mandates.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are attempting to pass the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which would make permanent the 2017 tax cuts, primarily benefiting wealthy Americans.

Critics argue the bill is fiscally irresponsible and regressive, harming working-class families while benefiting the wealthy.

An expert from the Institute of Food Technologists notes that food processing is essentially a larger-scale version of home cooking techniques, often with tighter controls for temperature and hygiene. While home preparation allows for control over ingredients, monitoring nutritional parameters remains crucial regardless of where the food is prepared.</p>

          <p>The recent death of 4,000 chicks in the mail highlights a hidden aspect of the poultry industry: the mass shipping of live baby animals. While mass-casualty events are rare, the article emphasizes that many more farmed animals die in transportation than most realize, as they are treated as commodities. The article details the conditions of chickens raised for meat, noting that many die before reaching the slaughterhouse, and millions more die during transport due to extreme temperatures and overcrowding. The author argues that the industry prioritizes profit over animal welfare, leading to preventable deaths.</p>

West Point has disbanded several student clubs, including the National Society of Black Engineers, following presidential executive orders.

          <p>New research traces the sensitivity of human teeth to the exoskeletons of ancient, armored fish. The study, published in Nature, reveals that structures in the armor of these fish, previously thought to be scales, were used for sensing. The research suggests that our teeth inherited the ability to sense things like pain and temperature from these ancient fish. This explains why we experience toothaches and the zing from cold treats, connecting our dental woes to evolutionary history.</p>
