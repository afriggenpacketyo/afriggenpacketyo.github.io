          <p>During a Pirates-Cubs game at PNC Park in Pittsburgh, a fan fell from the right-field bleachers above the Clemente Wall onto the warning track, prompting immediate medical response and a temporary game delay. The incident occurred shortly after an RBI double by the Pirates' Andrew McCutchen, with another fan assisting the injured individual before trainers and police arrived. The fan was stabilized on a backboard and carted off the field, while players were seen praying or kneeling during the delay, with the person's condition remaining unknown at the time of the article's publishing. </p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department is working to reunite firearm owners with guns recovered from the Palisades Fire, which burned over 23,000 acres earlier this year. During the debris removal process, authorities located approximately 500 firearms, many severely damaged by the fire. The LAPD is asking individuals who believe they lost a firearm in the fire to contact the department's Gun Recovery Unit, providing personal information and a description of their firearm, as the department recognizes the sentimental value these items may hold for their owners. The Palisades Fire, along with the Eaton Fire, caused significant damage and economic losses in Los Angeles County.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court appears divided over a case concerning the creation of an online Catholic charter school in Oklahoma, which could have implications for the separation of church and state. The case, involving St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, raises questions about public funding for religious schools, with arguments focusing on whether excluding the school from the charter system constitutes religious discrimination. Justices Kavanaugh and Alito seemed sympathetic to the school's argument, while liberal justices expressed concerns about weakening the wall between church and state; a decision in favor of the school could lead to the direct flow of government funds to a religious entity for religious activities. The outcome is expected to hinge on Chief Justice John Roberts.</p>

          <p>A cybersecurity expert in China is cautioning against over-reliance on artificial intelligence for decision-making, citing potential security vulnerabilities. Qi Xiangdong, chairman of Qi An Xin, warned that hackers could exploit AI systems through data poisoning or other vulnerabilities, leading to manipulation of the model's decisions. He also noted that erroneous information introduced by staff could contaminate the model's learning environment, resulting in incorrect outputs. This warning comes amid growing popularity of China's DeepSeek chatbot, which has been hailed as a success in the country's innovation drive, despite Western sanctions limiting access to high-tech chips.</p>

          <p>The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has indicated that certification for China's C919 passenger plane will not be granted in 2025, potentially delaying the aircraft's entry into the European market.

Despite this setback, analysts believe that Comac, the manufacturer, will continue its efforts to introduce the C919 to overseas markets. The C919 has been in regular domestic use since its first commercial flight in May 2023, transporting over 1 million passengers.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Apple violated a previous court order by charging commissions on purchases made outside of its App Store, siding with Epic Games in an antitrust dispute. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers stated that Apple must stop collecting these commissions and referred the company to prosecutors for a potential criminal probe.

The judge accused Apple of willfully creating anticompetitive barriers to maintain its revenue stream and stated that an Apple executive lied on the witness stand.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have finalized an agreement that grants the U.S. access to Ukraine's mineral resources and establishes a joint investment fund to support Ukraine's reconstruction. The deal, pushed by President Trump, aims to give the U.S. a stake in Ukraine's future while addressing concerns about providing Kyiv with unchecked financial support. The agreement follows months of negotiations and is intended to signal a long-term commitment to a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine, with no benefits for those who supported Russia's war efforts. The Trump administration did not immediately provide details about the agreement, and it was not clear what it meant for the future of American military support for Ukraine.</p>

The vote underscores ongoing anxieties about the economic consequences of the tariffs, despite the administration's efforts to reassure lawmakers.

          <p>Las Vegas hospitality workers are still awaiting the promised elimination of taxes on tips, a key campaign pledge by President Trump. Despite the promise, no legislation has been enacted, leaving tipped workers like Sebastian Espinoza struggling with rising costs. Union leaders are urging action, while the White House says the president is working with Congress to address the issue. Two bills are currently under consideration, one in the Senate and one in the House, that aim to eliminate federal income tax on tips and potentially raise the sub-minimum wage.</p>

          <p>AI-assisted cameras mounted on Los Angeles Metro buses generated nearly 10,000 citations for parking violations in a single month. The cameras, which scan for illegally parked cars blocking bus lanes or stops, have significantly increased the number of tickets issued compared to previous enforcement methods. The program aims to improve bus times, increase ridership, and address mobility concerns, with each citation reviewed by a human. The AI-powered cameras scan for illegally parked cars and compile a video of each violation, a photo of the license plate and the time and location, according to the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter, underscoring the risks President Trump faces as he pursues an aggressive trade war. The news, a sharp political jolt and economic warning, came at the end of a quarter marked by stock price declines and widespread uncertainty among businesses and consumers. The contraction raises questions about Trump's economic competence and the potential for an extended slowdown or recession, with some advisors recognizing the timing and execution of tariff announcements as potential mistakes. The report proves to be a harbinger of an extended slowdown or recession, the situation could become the economic analog of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s fumbled withdrawal from Afghanistan four years ago this summer.</p>

          <p>Yosemite National Park officials are cautioning visitors to be cautious of mule deer, which cause more injuries to visitors than any other animal in the park. The National Park Service noted that while these animals may seem harmless to humans, they are still wild and skittish, and equipped with sharp hooves and antlers, a deer will lash out and defend itself if startled. They advised people to maintain a safe distance if they see these animals from afar. Officials warned that feeding and approaching wildlife in Yosemite is illegal, in order to protect wildlife and ensure human safety.</p>

The company's profitability, in particular, stands out and should help allay fears that CEO Mark Zuckerberg is spending too aggressively on AI. Meta increased its 2025 capital expenditures guidance range to $67 billion at the midpoint, up $4.5 billion from the outlook provided in late January in the wake of the panic over Chinese AI startup DeepSeek . On the earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li both cited internal statistics showing that AI recommendation algorithms are driving increased engagement and better returns for advertisers.</p>

          <p>Microsoft shares jumped after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly results, driven by its Azure cloud business, and issued surprisingly strong guidance. The middle of the range was higher than LSEG's $72.26 billion consensus. The company sees 34% to 35% in Azure growth at constant currency, compared with StreetAccount's 31.5% consensus. While earnings and revenue topped estimates, those results are backward looking. President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs were announced in early April, so the company's optimistic forecast provided some relief to investors who have been concerned about how tech businesses will fare the remainder of the year.</p>

"A portion of that spend has been redirected to other markets, but overall spend for those advertisers is below the levels prior to April," Li said.

          <p>The U.S. economy shrank in the first quarter of 2025 as businesses rushed to stockpile goods ahead of President Trump's sweeping tariff policies. The nation's gross domestic product shrank at a 0.3% annual rate, down from growth of 2.4% in the final three months of 2024, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday in its initial GDP estimate. The slowdown comes amid growing concerns that Mr. Trump's wide-ranging tariffs could disrupt the U.S. economy, with some economists raising the chances of the U.S. slipping into a recession in 2025.</p>

Trump has previously said that there would be disruptions, but for the first time, he acknowledged that many Americans might have to do with less as a result of the tariff standoff. "They have ships that are loaded up with stuff, much of which, not all of it, but much of which we don't need. And we have to make a fair deal. We've been ripped off by every country in the world. But China, I would say, is the leading, the leading one and the leading, candidate for the chief-ripper-offer," Trump said.</p>
