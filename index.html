            <p>Tech giants like Tesla, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Nvidia are bracing for a challenging earnings season, with uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policies looming large. The on-again, off-again approach to tariffs has created market chaos, impacting revenue, earnings, and future planning for these companies. Concerns range from increased costs and reduced ad spending to potential slowdowns in consumer spending. Tesla, for example, faces challenges due to its reliance on suppliers in Mexico and China, while Alphabet worries about the online ad market and cloud business spending. Meta and Apple also face challenges related to hardware businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The deadline for Americans to obtain a Real ID is rapidly approaching, with enforcement set to begin on May 7, but many states are still not fully compliant. A recent analysis reveals that at least 16 states have compliance rates below 50%, potentially leading to disruptions at airport security checkpoints. Travelers without a Real ID will face additional screening, potentially causing delays, and may be denied entry to the security checkpoint if their identity cannot be verified. The Real ID Act was passed in 2005 to enhance the security of state-issued identification following the 9/11 attacks.</p>

            <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to challenge a freeze on $2.2 billion in federal funding, escalating a dispute over diversity initiatives and concerns about anti-semitism.

            <p>Chinese universities are dominating global research on chip design and fabrication, outpacing institutions from the United States and other countries. A recent report indicates that nine of the top ten producers of English-language research on chips from 2018 to 2023 were Chinese institutions. This trend highlights China's growing focus on semiconductor technology, particularly as the United States imposes restrictions on chip exports to the country.

            <p>President Trump has intensified his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, urging him to lower interest rates and questioning his performance.

Economists and analysts warn that undermining the Fed's independence could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth. The President's renewed attacks follow similar incidents throughout his first term, challenging established norms regarding the relationship between the executive branch and the central bank.</p>

            <p>Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has sparked backlash after posting on X, appearing to celebrate the death of Pope Francis. Greene's post, which stated that "evil is being defeated by the hand of God," was interpreted by many as a disrespectful reaction to the pontiff's passing. The post has drawn criticism from other X users, who have accused Greene of being a disgrace and lacking compassion. Greene, who was baptized Catholic but later joined an evangelical Protestant denomination, has previously criticized the Catholic Church's leadership.</p>

            <p>As the Ukraine war continues, Russia is close to regaining full control of the western region of Kursk and controls nearly all of Luhansk and more than 70 per cent of the Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. Russia’s gains merely amount to a Pyrrhic victory, but Ukraine is a complete loser. Even if Ukraine joins the European Union before 2030, as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has suggested, its Nato membership ambitions look doomed. This is causing a power vacuum which China could fill.</p>
