          <p>John Woeltz, a crypto investor, was arrested in New York City for allegedly kidnapping and torturing an Italian tourist who had arrived to retrieve Bitcoin he was previously forced to send under threat. Prosecutors detailed how the victim was lured to Woeltz's home, then tied up and tortured for weeks, enduring electric shocks, a saw cut to the leg, and forced crack cocaine use. Evidence recovered included weapons, body armor, and disturbing images of the victim. The victim managed to escape and flag down a traffic agent, leading to Woeltz's arrest and arraignment, where he was deemed a flight risk. </p>

          <p>A British fishing vessel was impounded by French authorities for allegedly fishing illegally in French waters without a license. The French coast guard's navy patrol vessel Pluvier inspected the ship in the English Channel, leading to its seizure and detention at the port of Boulogne. The UK Foreign Office is providing support to the British national involved and is in contact with French authorities. This incident follows criticism of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's deal with the EU, which grants EU vessels access to UK waters for 12 more years.</p>

          <p>Michelle Renee, a California bank manager, and her daughter were kidnapped and forced to rob her own bank after masked men broke into her home and strapped fake dynamite to them. The kidnappers controlled Michelle's actions, directing her to steal money from the vault while threatening her daughter's life. After successfully robbing the bank, Michelle returned home to find her daughter safe, but the subsequent trial shifted the focus onto Michelle's past, including her previous work as a stripper and financial difficulties. Despite overwhelming evidence against the perpetrators, the defense attempted to portray Michelle as a willing participant, attacking her credibility and maternal instincts.</p>

          <p>Doctors in Japan are denouncing the ongoing COVID-19 restrictions in hospitals, which limit patient visitations, even for terminally ill individuals. Despite the government downgrading the threat level of COVID-19, many hospitals continue to enforce strict visitation rules, including mask requirements, temperature checks, and time limits. Physicians and social workers argue these restrictions violate human rights, highlighting cases where families were denied access to loved ones, even grandchildren. They emphasize that there is no scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of these restrictions and advocate for a more compassionate approach that balances infection control with patients' needs.</p>

          <p>A new study in Scientific Reports reveals that dog owners who ruminate about work stress may inadvertently pass anxiety to their pets. The research found that dogs of owners with high job stress exhibited more stress-related behaviors, such as whining and pacing. This connection is attributed to "crossover," where stress spills over from one individual to another, and "emotional contagion," where dogs pick up on human feelings through subtle cues. The study suggests that employed dog owners could improve their pets' well-being by avoiding work-related thoughts when at home.</p>

Connolly's legal team, supported by the Free Speech Union, claims the sentence is disproportionate, while critics emphasize the dangers of online hate speech.

          <p>The Japanese government plans to improve working conditions and increase salaries for chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions to attract talent amid growing global popularity of Japanese cuisine. The annual salary will increase to over 6 million yen ($41,000), and chefs will have the option for government-covered rented accommodation. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya emphasizes the significant role of chefs in hosting foreign dignitaries and promoting Japanese food, calling them 'food diplomats.' The goal is to fill vacancies and enable chefs to pursue their careers more easily.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all goods from the European Union, citing trade imbalances. The EU's trade commissioner responded firmly, stating that the EU is ready to defend its interests and seek a mutually beneficial deal. Meanwhile, there's been an increase in Americans seeking permanent residency in the UK, possibly due to the polarized political climate under Trump. Additionally, plans have been announced to rebuild and reopen the infamous Alcatraz prison, and Trump's commencement address at West Point included political attacks and controversial statements.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, becoming the first train company to return to public ownership under the Labour government. While the government hails this as a "new dawn for rail," it refrains from promising lower fares, focusing instead on improving services and reinvesting profits. The SWR trains will now be managed by DfT Operator and integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), pending parliamentary approval. Unions have expressed concerns over outsourcing, and the Conservatives have called for Labour to deliver on its promises.</p>

The restricted areas include the offices of Hegseth and top aides.

The new policies are seen as part of a broader effort by the White House to control news reporting on the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party has committed to reinstating winter fuel payments to pensioners and scrapping the two-child benefit cap if it gains power. This announcement puts pressure on Labour, which has faced internal divisions over these policies. Reform UK proposes funding these measures by cutting net-zero projects and eliminating hotels for asylum seekers. The winter fuel payment provides a lump sum to pensioners, while the two-child benefit cap restricts benefits for families with more than two children.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author of "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual Assault," passed away at the age of 90. Her groundbreaking book redefined sexual assault as a crime of power and violence rather than passion, influencing laws and societal attitudes. Brownmiller's work sparked both praise and controversy, challenging male-generated myths and prompting discussions on feminism, power dynamics, and social responsibility. Her contributions to the women's movement and her impact on the understanding of sexual assault are significant.</p>
