          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has officially endorsed former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the mayoral election, framing the move as a necessary alliance to defeat Democratic Socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani. Adams, who recently dropped his own reelection bid, criticized Mamdani as a "snake oil salesman" and a threat to the city. The endorsement unites two prominent but controversial figures in New York politics against Mamdani, who holds a significant lead in recent polls and has condemned the alliance as a representation of corrupt, "big money" politics. The race remains complex with Republican Curtis Sliwa also on the ballot.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Trump has called off a planned summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, citing insufficient progress from Russia toward a peaceful resolution in Ukraine. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that while a future meeting is not ruled out, the president wants to see tangible action rather than just talk. This decision was accompanied by new, stringent sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies, freezing their U.S. assets. The move signals growing frustration from the Trump administration over the ongoing conflict, despite previously amicable conversations between the two leaders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals that while a majority of California Democrats support Governor Gavin Newsom running for president in 2028, the state's overall electorate is more divided on the matter. The poll shows more Democratic support for a Newsom candidacy than for one by former Vice President Kamala Harris. Voters also indicated they believe Newsom is currently focused on both state and national issues. The survey highlights a broader perception that California sets a good example for the nation on technology and culture but falls short on housing, taxes, and economic policy.</p>

          <p>A federal indictment against former NBA player Damon Jones alleges he leaked non-public information about LeBron James' injury status to sports bettors. The indictment claims that in February 2023, Jones, then an unofficial coach for the Lakers, texted a co-conspirator that James would be out of an upcoming game, urging them to place a "big bet" before the news became public. James, who did not play in the game against the Milwaukee Bucks due to an ankle injury, is not accused of any wrongdoing. This case is part of a broader investigation into illegal gambling schemes involving sports insiders.</p>

          <p>For the second consecutive week, average 30-year mortgage rates have fallen, now standing at 6.19%, offering a potential opening for homebuyers who have been sidelined by higher borrowing costs. While this downward trend is positive, experts advise caution, as the decreases are gradual and could reverse due to various economic factors. Prospective buyers are encouraged to weigh the benefits of acting now, with potentially less market competition, against the possibility of further, albeit likely modest, rate cuts later in the year. Acting now could secure a desired property before the traditionally competitive spring buying season arrives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold prices have experienced significant fluctuations, dropping sharply before rebounding, creating opportunities for strategic investors. The volatility is driven by competing factors, including Federal Reserve rate cuts weakening the dollar and a strong stock market pulling investors toward riskier assets. To capitalize on these swings, investors can consider trading gold mining stocks or ETFs, which offer leveraged exposure and liquidity. Alternatively, using gold-backed ETFs or futures allows for direct short-term plays on price movements, while long-term investors can strategically purchase physical gold during price dips.

The script, adapted from a Korean film, explores themes of online radicalization and the desperate human need for purpose.

Experts explain that toddlers are testing boundaries to understand their place in the world and exert control over their environment. The article offers practical parenting tips, such as modeling calm responses, offering limited choices to give toddlers a sense of agency, and reframing negative commands into positive instructions.</p>

Mute swans are considered destructive because they are highly territorial and consume large amounts of submerged aquatic vegetation, which is a vital resource for native waterfowl. Landowners will also be able to kill the swans on their property without a license, as the birds are not protected under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is slowly moving through the central Caribbean and is forecast to intensify into a major hurricane by early next week, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm is projected to bring days of heavy rainfall, with totals of 6 to 12 inches possible in Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. This rainfall poses a significant risk of life-threatening flash flooding and landslides in the region. A hurricane watch and tropical storm warning are currently in effect for Jamaica and southwestern Haiti as residents prepare for the storm's impact over the next several days.</p>

          <p>The Senate has unanimously passed the IRS MATH Act, which aims to make "math error" notices sent to taxpayers clearer and more helpful. The bill, which now heads to the president's desk, addresses complaints that current notices for simple clerical mistakes are confusing and do not adequately explain how to correct the error or the consequences of not responding. Taxpayers currently have 60 days to respond before the IRS's proposed changes become final. Lawmakers hope the new legislation will make it easier for individuals to resolve minor tax return issues without needing professional assistance.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to impose new sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, caused a significant spike in global oil prices. Brent crude rose over 5% to nearly $66 per barrel, while U.S. crude also jumped more than 5%. The Treasury Department stated the sanctions are a response to Moscow's lack of commitment to a peace process in Ukraine and are designed to harm the Kremlin's ability to fund the war. This move represents a more aggressive stance from the U.S. and introduces new volatility into energy markets already concerned about trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A severe marine heat wave in 2023 has led to the "functional extinction" of elkhorn and staghorn corals in Florida, according to a new study in the journal Science. These two species are critical for building the reef's structure, which protects coastlines from storm surge and supports a vast marine ecosystem. The study found that between 98% and 100% of these corals were wiped out as ocean temperatures remained at record-breaking levels for an extended period. This catastrophic loss highlights a climate tipping point for coral reefs and will have long-lasting consequences for Florida's coastal communities and marine biodiversity.</p>

Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda condemned the act as a "blatant breach of international law" and a "reckless and dangerous" provocation.

President Trump, who initially said the project would not touch the existing structure, now states the demolition is necessary for a modern and stable replacement. The National Trust for Historic Preservation has urged the administration to pause until the plans undergo a legally required public review, expressing concern that the new structure will overwhelm the White House's classical design.

          <p>A four-year study conducted in Southern California has found that E. coli strains from contaminated meat may be responsible for a significant number of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Researchers discovered that 18% of the more than 2,300 UTIs analyzed were linked to E. coli found in grocery store meat samples, particularly turkey and chicken. The study, published in the journal mBio, suggests that UTIs should be considered not just a personal health issue but also a food safety problem. The findings also revealed that people in low-income areas had a 60% higher risk of these foodborne infections.</p>
