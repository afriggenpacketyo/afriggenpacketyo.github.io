        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck near Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, triggering widespread tsunami warnings across the Pacific, including Hawaii, Alaska, Japan, and the U.S. West Coast. Japan's Nemuro experienced an initial 30-centimeter wave, while larger waves up to 3 meters were anticipated for other coastal regions, including Chile and Ecuador. Russian areas closest to the epicenter reported damage and evacuations, with residents moving to higher ground. This seismic event, among the strongest globally since 2011, prompted urgent action and detailed alerts from meteorological agencies, underscoring the potential for prolonged danger from successive waves.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom intends to issue an executive order that will allow local governments in Los Angeles and Malibu to restrict development permitted under Senate Bill 9 in designated very high fire hazard severity zones. This action follows strong pressure from L.A. City Councilmember Traci Park and Mayor Karen Bass, who voiced concerns that widespread use of SB 9, which allows up to four units on single-family lots, could dangerously strain evacuation routes and infrastructure during future wildfires. The governor's decision aims to mitigate potential safety risks by preventing an "explosion of density" in areas susceptible to severe blazes, prioritizing community safety over broad housing expansion in vulnerable regions.</p>

          <h2>EPA Moves to Revoke Landmark Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 22:26:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency announced its intent to revoke the 2009 "endangerment finding," which served as the scientific basis for regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin characterized this as the largest deregulatory action in U.S. history, claiming it would save Americans billions annually by reinstating consumer choice for vehicles and reducing living costs. Critics, however, including scientists and environmental groups, warn that repealing this finding ignores overwhelming scientific evidence of climate change's dangers and could exacerbate environmental and public health risks. This article details the controversial policy shift and its potential far-reaching implications.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-4 comeback victory against the Cincinnati Reds, largely propelled by clutch hitting from Will Smith and Freddie Freeman in the later innings. Smith provided a game-tying RBI single in the seventh and the decisive go-ahead RBI double in the ninth, while Freeman also contributed significantly with a three-hit game including an RBI single. This win, marking the Dodgers' 37th comeback of the season, helped address their recent offensive struggles, particularly with runners in scoring position. Despite an 0-for-5 performance from Shohei Ohtani, the team's ability to capitalize on late opportunities proved crucial in securing the score.</p>

          <p>Singapore's Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) maintained its monetary policy, signaling stability, but warned of a projected economic slowdown in the second half of 2025, particularly in trade-related sectors. The central bank cited significant uncertainty for 2026, largely due to potential changes in global tariff rates, especially from the Trump administration's trade policies. Despite dodging a technical recession in Q2 2025 with stronger-than-expected GDP growth, MAS remains cautious, indicating a readiness to adjust policy if U.S. tariffs impact Singapore's export-dependent economy.

          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta has proposed a "legal pathway" for Democrats to introduce new congressional district maps directly to voters through a statewide ballot measure, aiming to circumvent the state's independent redistricting commission. This initiative is designed to counteract Republican efforts in conservative states, such as Texas, to redraw electoral boundaries in their favor and potentially strengthen the GOP's slim majority in the U.S. House. While Republicans, including Assembly Leader James Gallagher, have condemned the proposal as undemocratic, the article explains that this move seeks to allow California voters to temporarily reclaim the power to shape their districts, potentially netting Democrats several seats in the state's 52-member delegation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate confirmed Susan Monarez as the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in a party-line vote.

Kennedy Jr.'s past criticisms.

          <h2>Examining the Fractured Nature of Online Cultural and Political Discourse</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 20:07:22 EDT</div>

          <p>This article critically analyzes how online platforms have disordered cultural and political discourse, using a controversial American Eagle ad featuring Sydney Sweeney as a case study. It argues that internet interactions often consist of individuals issuing statements rather than engaging in genuine dialogue, with context stripped away and amplified by algorithms. The piece highlights how legitimate concerns, like fears of eugenics, can be reduced to "culture war" fodder by opportunistic actors across the political spectrum, distorting public opinion and fueling outrage for content creation. The article suggests that this fragmented environment turns complex issues into mere spectacles, hindering productive conversation.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced the UK will recognize Palestinian statehood by September, contingent on Israel taking significant steps to end the "appalling situation" in Gaza. Starmer emphasized the goal of a two-state solution and called for a sustainable ceasefire, the release of hostages by Hamas, and unimpeded aid delivery to Gaza. Israeli Prime Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the announcement, calling it a reward for Hamas's terrorism.

          <p>A CNBC Fed Survey indicates a virtual three-way tie for the next Federal Reserve Chair, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett leading the contenders. The survey also revealed that 84% of respondents believe President Trump will not fire current Chair Jerome Powell before his term ends in May 2026, despite Trump's past criticisms. The article highlights concerns among economists that political jockeying for the Fed chair role may already be compromising the central bank's independence. It also discusses expectations for future interest rate cuts, with most respondents forecasting reductions by year-end. (not investment advice)</p>
