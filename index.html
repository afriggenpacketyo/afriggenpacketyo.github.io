          <p>Maine State Representative Laurel Libby is suing House Speaker Ryan Fecteau and House of Representatives clerk Robert Hunt after she was censured by the Democrat majority for a social media post identifying a trans athlete. Libby claims the censure violates her First Amendment rights and disenfranchises her constituents. The case is being heard in federal court in Rhode Island, with Judge Melissa DuBose presiding. The lawsuit comes amid ongoing conflict between Maine and the federal government over the state's refusal to ban trans athletes from women's sports, resulting in paused federal funding.</p>

          <p>The Senate approved a Republican plan for trillions in tax breaks and spending cuts, despite Democratic opposition and warnings of economic risks. The vote, which fell largely along party lines, advances Trump's agenda amid concerns about the economy and potential recession. Democrats argue the plan favors the wealthy and could lead to cuts in social safety net programs, while Republicans frame it as preventing a tax increase for American families and boosting the economy. The framework now moves to the House for consideration.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement of universal 10% tariffs has sent shockwaves through the market, leading to a significant sell-off and raising concerns about a potential recession. The tariffs, aimed at prying open foreign markets, have been met with retaliation from China and criticism from economists. The market turmoil has erased trillions in value, and the Federal Reserve's response has been cautious, adding to investor uncertainty. Trump defends the tariffs as an economic revolution that will ultimately benefit America, urging citizens to "hang tough".</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is standing firm on his decision to impose universal 10% tariffs, describing it as an "economic revolution."

          <p>Theodore McCarrick, a former D.C. Cardinal defrocked in 2019 after being found guilty of molesting adults and children, has died at the age of 94. Archbishop Robert McElroy issued a statement acknowledging the harm McCarrick caused during his ministry and offering prayers for the victims of sexual abuse. The McCarrick scandal caused a crisis of credibility for the Catholic Church, especially since there was evidence that Vatican and U.S. church leaders knew he slept with seminarians but turned a blind eye as McCarrick rose to the top of the U.S. church.</p>

          <p>New research reveals that approximately 115 million Americans, over a third of the US population, reside in areas vulnerable to wildfires, even in cities once deemed safe. The climate crisis, coupled with gaps in understanding how fires spread in urban environments, increases the risk of devastating blazes. Homes themselves act as fuel, complicating existing scientific models. Researchers emphasize the urgent need for awareness and adaptation, as many communities remain unprepared for the growing threat of urban wildfires, which are increasing due to climate change and development into wildland areas.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that older adults who received a shingles vaccine were 20% less likely to develop dementia in the following seven years compared to those who didn't. The study, which followed over 280,000 people in Wales, adds to growing evidence that a readily available, inexpensive vaccine could offer protection against dementia. Scientists theorize the vaccine's protective effect might be related to reducing inflammation around nerve cells, a known factor in cognitive decline. Further research, including randomized control trials, is underway to explore antiviral treatments for dementia.</p>

          <p>Demonstrations against Trump's second term are smaller and more decentralized compared to his first term, reflecting a shift in the political atmosphere. Increased surveillance, stricter laws targeting protest, and a sense of resignation have made mass mobilizations more difficult. While smaller, local protests are more common, they may not provide the same expressive outlet or collective impact as large-scale demonstrations. Activists are adapting, building coalitions, and focusing on local action, but the path to effective resistance remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>BYD, a Chinese automaker, is rapidly becoming a leader in the electric vehicle market, offering innovative technologies at competitive prices. The company recently announced a platform that can charge EVs with up to 250 miles of range in about 5 minutes. However, some EV analysts are skeptical of this innovation, citing technical hurdles and potentially high costs. Despite the skepticism, BYD's advancements are challenging established EV manufacturers and shifting perceptions of Chinese automakers.

          <p>China's Foreign Ministry responded to the imposition of sweeping new tariffs from the U.S. by saying "the market has spoken" and called for equal consultation with the White House to defuse the escalating trade war. This came after U.S. stock markets fell sharply on Friday, and the Chinese Finance Ministry announced it would impose a 34% tariff on all goods imported from the U.S. starting on April 10, exacerbating investor fears.</p>

          <p>All around a recent farm show in Canada, equipment salespeople struggled to swing deals with farmers worried about tariffs. Canada was spared the Trump administration's broad global tariffs on April 2 but faces tariffs on steel and aluminum exports to the U.S. as well as on autos not compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade. Meanwhile, farmers' appetite for new combines, tractors and other farm equipment has slumped, and manufacturers are pulling back.</p>
