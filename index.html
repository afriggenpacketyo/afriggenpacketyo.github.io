          <p>Nike has announced that new tariffs will cost the company approximately $1 billion in the current fiscal year, a significant challenge to its ongoing turnaround efforts. The sneaker giant reported a sharp 86% drop in quarterly profit as it works to clear old inventory and reset its business strategy. Despite beating Wall Street's low expectations on revenue and earnings, the company faces headwinds from these duties. Nike plans to mitigate the costs over time by adjusting its supply chain, reducing its manufacturing presence in China, and implementing price increases for consumers.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 is approaching a record high, completing a significant turnaround after a sharp decline in April following new tariff announcements. Analysts attribute the market's strong rebound to several factors, including easing investor concerns about trade disputes as negotiations enter a quieter phase. Optimism around technology stocks, particularly AI-related companies like Nvidia, has also been a major driver of the rally. Furthermore, investor sentiment has been buoyed by signals from the Federal Reserve that it may implement two interest rate cuts later this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>North Korea has inaugurated the Wonsan-Kalma coastal tourist zone, a massive new resort that state media claims will launch a new era for its tourism industry. Leader Kim Jong Un attended the opening ceremony for the site, which will initially only be open to domestic visitors starting next week. The project is a key part of Kim's effort to boost the nation's struggling economy, but it opens while the country remains largely closed to foreign visitors due to pandemic-era restrictions. Russian officials have indicated their citizens will be the first foreign tourists to visit in July.</p>

          <p>A detailed assessment reveals the condition of Iran's four main nuclear sites following recent military strikes. The Fordo and Natanz enrichment facilities sustained significant damage from bunker-busting bombs, with experts believing they are inoperable or severely damaged. The Isfahan conversion site's above-ground buildings were reportedly destroyed, and the Arak heavy water reactor was also struck. However, experts caution that Iran may still possess concealed stocks of highly enriched uranium and other undisclosed backup facilities, suggesting a diplomatic agreement is necessary for a long-term solution.</p>

These grants were intended to fund local projects addressing pollution and climate impacts in vulnerable communities. The plaintiffs argue the funds were canceled without legal justification, and they are seeking to have the funding for all 350 impacted grant recipients restored through this collective legal action.</p>

The discussion highlighted that China is actively working to create its own financial sphere centered on the yuan.

          <p>The UK government is reportedly preparing to scale back its planned welfare reforms in a deal to appease over 100 rebellious Labour MPs. Sources indicate that current recipients of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health element of Universal Credit will be protected from cuts, which will instead apply only to future claimants. This move represents a significant climbdown for the government, which faced a potential defeat on its flagship welfare bill. The concessions are expected to allow the bill to pass, marking the third major government U-turn in the past month.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made a rare public appearance with his wife and their daughter, Kim Ju Ae, at the opening of the new Wonsan-Kalma tourist resort. Ju Ae, believed to be around 12, is the only one of Kim's rumored three children to be seen in public, intensifying speculation that she is being groomed as his successor. State media has increasingly used honorific titles like "respected" to describe her, and her appearances have often been linked to significant state events.

          <p>For the first time since its launch, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured direct images providing evidence of a previously undiscovered exoplanet. The planet, named TWA 7b, is believed to be roughly the mass of Saturn and orbits a young star. Detecting such planets is typically challenging, but scientists successfully used a high-contrast imaging technique with a coronagraph to suppress the star's bright glare and reveal the faint object. While a small possibility remains that it could be a background galaxy, researchers state the evidence strongly points toward it being a planet.</p>

          <p>A new survey from the American Farm Bureau Federation reveals that a Fourth of July barbecue for ten people will cost significantly more in California than the national average. The state's cookout cost is estimated at $90.06, compared to the U.S. average of $70.92. Staples like ground beef, chicken, and even hamburger buns are priced higher in California. The report attributes the elevated costs to several factors, including nationwide inflation, the impact of tariffs on imported goods, reduced cattle and chicken supplies, and potential disruptions to the agricultural workforce in the state.</p>

The Senate parliamentarian has ruled that several key provisions, including a plan to cut Medicaid funding to pay for new spending, violate Senate rules and would require a 60-vote threshold.

          <p>The teenager known as Child Q, who was strip-searched by Metropolitan Police officers at her school in 2020, has released a statement following the officers' dismissal. She expressed profound and lasting trauma, stating, "I don't know if I'm going to feel normal again." A tribunal found two officers guilty of gross misconduct for the search, which was conducted while the 15-year-old Black student was on her period and without an appropriate adult present. The case, which found the search unjustified but did not find race to be a factor, has sparked widespread outrage and calls for police reform.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has mounted a robust defense of its recent military strikes on Iran, countering a preliminary intelligence assessment that suggested limited impact. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth held a press conference calling the operation an "historically successful attack" and accusing leakers of trying to undermine the president's success. Top intelligence officials also released statements affirming that Iran's nuclear facilities were "severely damaged" or "destroyed." Despite the strong defense, officials provided few new details on key questions, such as the exact setback to Iran's capabilities.</p>
