          <p>Apple has signed a five-year media rights agreement with Formula 1, making Apple TV the exclusive U.S. broadcaster for all races starting in 2026. The deal, valued at approximately $140 million per year, will include all F1 events within the standard Apple TV subscription, unlike its separate MLS Season Pass model. This move marks a significant expansion of Apple's live sports portfolio, replacing ESPN as the incumbent partner. The partnership builds on the success of the Apple-produced F1 movie starring Brad Pitt.</p>

Despite the friction, Trump expressed optimism about the relationship and mentioned a potential meeting with President Xi Jinping in the coming weeks. This conversation is seen as a potential step toward stabilizing the economic relationship between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A stampede at the state funeral for Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga in Nairobi has resulted in dozens of injuries, with at least 17 people hospitalized. The incident occurred as thousands of mourners gathered to pay their respects to the influential politician, who died at age 80. This follows a separate event where security forces opened fire on crowds, killing at least three people. President William Ruto, who declared a seven-day mourning period, praised Odinga for his pivotal role in the nation's politics and transition to democracy.</p>

          <p>The UK government has lost its bid to prevent a High Court review of its decision to ban the direct-action group Palestine Action under terrorism laws. The Court of Appeal ruled that the group's co-founder can proceed with a judicial review, which offers a faster path to challenge the ban than the standard government process. The ban has led to over 2,100 arrests, and this ruling allows for a more immediate legal examination of the proscription's lawfulness. Palestine Action's co-founder hailed the decision as a significant legal victory against what she called a misuse of counter-terror resources.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Rand Corporation suggests that stabilizing the U.S.-China rivalry is both possible and mutually beneficial, despite deep-seated differences. Researchers argue that while the two nations are far from ending their competition, they should seek ways to coexist to prevent the relationship from escalating to dangerous levels of tension. The report recommends that the United States should counter China's more aggressive ambitions while simultaneously seeking to manage the rivalry, similar to its approach during the Cold War. It notes that some openings for coexistence exist if they can be properly leveraged.</p>

          <p>The potential carcinogenic properties of talcum powder have been a subject of debate for decades, primarily due to its risk of contamination with asbestos.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies talc as "probably carcinogenic" when used on the perineum, with the primary concern being ovarian cancer. Following numerous lawsuits, major manufacturers like Johnson & Johnson have transitioned from talc-based to cornstarch-based powders to mitigate health risks.</p>

          <p>Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has been appointed co-chair of Prosecutors Against Gun Violence (PAGV), a national, bipartisan group of over 50 prosecutors working to reduce gun violence. Bragg plans to focus on combating interstate gun trafficking and the proliferation of "ghost guns," bringing his experience from a major city to the national level. He emphasized that while homicides are declining in many cities, gun violence disproportionately affects Black and Latino communities. Bragg also highlighted the importance of collaboration between law enforcement and community-based violence prevention programs, which currently face federal funding cuts.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed a bill that would have banned toxic PFAS "forever chemicals" in cookware and other consumer products, a move advocates fear could slow similar legislation in other states. In his explanation, Newsom expressed concern about the bill's impact on the availability of affordable cookware, a reason public health advocates dispute, noting that safe alternatives are widely available. The decision followed intense lobbying from the cookware industry and is seen as a significant win for manufacturers. Environmental groups worry the veto will be used by industry lobbyists to argue against PFAS bans nationwide.</p>

          <p>China is tightening its control over the global supply of rare earth elements by expanding its export regulations to include products made outside the country using Chinese technology or minerals. However, analysts suggest that enforcing these new rules on a global scale will be challenging for Beijing. Unlike the United States, which has a long-established legal and compliance framework for its export controls, China lacks a comparable system. This could hinder its ability to track and regulate the use of its rare earth materials and technologies throughout complex international supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a writer reflects on her decision to marry her long-term partner of three decades primarily to gain access to his SAG-AFTRA health insurance. The arrangement, initially a practical solution, became complicated when the union later stripped senior performers of their coverage, rendering the "forever" promise void. This experience leads her to contemplate the fragile nature of permanence, drawing parallels with racial covenants in her home's original deed and the precariousness of legal protections. She concludes that true permanence lies not in paperwork but in the daily choice to stay together.</p>

          <p>The UK media regulator, Ofcom, has ruled that the BBC committed a "serious breach" of broadcasting rules by failing to disclose that the narrator of a documentary about Gaza was the son of a Hamas official. The investigation concluded that this omission was "materially misleading" as it deprived the audience of critical context needed to assess the narrator's perspective. Ofcom has ordered the BBC to broadcast a prime-time statement of its findings, a rare and significant sanction. The BBC has accepted the ruling in full and previously apologized for what it called a "significant failing in relation to accuracy."</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans, particularly early retirees not yet eligible for Medicare, face substantial health insurance premium increases if the enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies expire at the end of the year. The subsidies, which cap premiums at 8.5% of household income, are set to lapse amid the ongoing government shutdown negotiations. Without an extension, many middle-income households could see their annual premium costs rise by thousands of dollars, forcing difficult financial choices like depleting retirement savings or forgoing necessary medical care.

          <p>The potential transfer of U.S. Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine has emerged as a key factor in diplomatic maneuvering between Washington, Kyiv, and Moscow. President Trump has publicly floated the idea of sending the long-range missiles as leverage to bring Russia to the negotiating table, a move that prompted the arrangement of a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest. While the U.S. has a limited supply of the necessary ground-based launchers, the strategic threat posed by the missiles is significant.

Scholars called for a research approach that is more deeply rooted in the country's specific historical and social context, emphasizing the need for field research to correct biases. Lin Shangli, president of Renmin University, stated that China's transformation cannot be properly interpreted through Western logic due to vast differences in scale and structure.
