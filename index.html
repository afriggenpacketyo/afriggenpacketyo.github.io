          <p>BBC Director General Tim Davie affirmed to MPs that no one is "irreplaceable" as the corporation confronts recent scandals, including allegations against "MasterChef" presenters. He stated that while the BBC does not have a "toxic culture," there are pockets where things are not right, and consequences will follow for those who do not live the organization's values. Davie also addressed a significant error in broadcasting a Glastonbury performance with anti-IDF chants, calling it "deeply disturbing" and confirming that new measures, such as delaying high-risk live acts, are now in place to prevent similar incidents.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest is reportedly set to appoint Ange Postecoglou as their new head coach following the dismissal of Nuno Espirito Santo. Nuno was sacked after 21 months, despite leading the club to its highest Premier League finish in decades and securing European qualification. Postecoglou, who was recently let go by Tottenham after a difficult league season but a historic Europa League win, is considered a strong candidate to take over. The decision has surprised many of the club's players, and some fans are skeptical of Postecoglou's high-risk tactical approach.</p>

          <p>A Russian air attack on the village of Yarova in eastern Ukraine has resulted in the deaths of more than 20 civilians, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. The victims were reportedly ordinary people who were collecting their pensions in the Donetsk region settlement, which is near the front lines of the conflict. President Zelensky shared graphic footage of the aftermath, describing the strike as an attack for which there are "no words." The incident represents one of the deadliest attacks on Ukrainian civilians in recent weeks, prompting calls for a global response.</p>

The deal ensures the conservative direction of outlets like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal will continue after Rupert Murdoch's death. Under the terms, Lachlan will control a new trust, while his more politically moderate siblings—Prudence, Elisabeth, and James—will cease to be beneficiaries of trusts with shares in Fox or News Corp. They are set to sell their holdings and will each receive approximately $1.1 billion, effectively ending their influence over the company's editorial stance.</p>

          <p>The city of Shenzhen has launched a new service allowing international tourists to receive instant tax refunds through overseas e-wallets like AlipayHK. The initiative, a collaboration between the Shenzhen Taxation Bureau, the central bank, and Ant International, aims to streamline the refund process from days to seconds. This move is part of a broader Chinese strategy to attract more foreign visitors and stimulate consumer spending. To further encourage tourism, China recently lowered the minimum purchase amount for tax refunds and increased the cash refund ceiling.</p>

          <p>Dr. Beverly Daniel Tatum, former president of Spelman College, observes that Black students are increasingly drawn to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in the current political climate. She suggests that in an era where some seek to erase Black history, HBCUs offer an affirming environment where students feel included and their heritage is valued. Tatum also addresses the broader challenges facing higher education, including what she describes as unprecedented government overreach and ideological pressure from the Trump administration. While HBCUs are seeing a surge in applications, they face financial challenges in providing aid to all deserving students.</p>

Under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., federal guidance has shifted, particularly concerning COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children, causing an uproar in the medical community. In response, professional groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics are issuing their own, often conflicting, advice, and some states are creating their own policies.

          <p>A group of tenants in a Koreatown apartment building is staging a sit-in protest in their parking garage to oppose the owner's plan to eliminate their parking spots. The owner intends to convert the garage space into five accessory dwelling units (ADUs), a move permitted by a state law designed to increase affordable housing. However, the long-term residents argue that reserved parking is a necessity in the densely populated neighborhood, citing safety concerns and the difficulty of finding street parking. They contend that the loss of this essential service, which was part of their lease agreements, is unfair despite the landlord's compliance with the law.</p>

          <h2>Trump-Era Medicaid Cuts Poised to Strain Children's Hospital Finances</h2>

          <p>Recent cuts to Medicaid spending are expected to have a significant financial impact on children's hospitals across the United States, which rely on the program for nearly half of their revenue. The law, which reduces federal Medicaid spending by about $900 billion over a decade, includes a provision that would cap supplemental payments many states use to bolster hospital funding. Hospital administrators warn that these cuts could force them to reduce staff and services, affecting care for vulnerable children. While proponents of the cuts argue they target fraud and waste, healthcare leaders say the reductions will inevitably harm pediatric care. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At a recent virtual BRICS summit, India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar urged member nations to address significant trade imbalances, noting that India's largest deficits are with its BRICS partners. This call came as the bloc, which includes Brazil, Russia, China, and South Africa, collectively criticized U.S. trade policies and tariffs. While nations like Brazil and China took a strong stance against American "unilateralism," India's focus remained on the economic aspects of the partnership. India's trade deficit with China reached a record high last fiscal year, and its deficit with Russia has also grown due to increased oil imports. (not investment advice)</p>

The incident has been described as an unnecessary and excessive use of force, intended to intimidate critics of President Aleksandar Vucic's regime. In response, Vucic congratulated the police on a "professionally executed job," while the commander of a special anti-terrorist unit resigned, claiming he was removed for not being under the president's absolute control.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has decided against breaking up Google in a landmark antitrust case, citing the rapid emergence of generative AI as a disruptive force that could challenge the company's search market dominance. While the court found that Google illegally monopolized the market through default-search agreements, Judge Amit Mehta's final ruling focused on lesser remedies, such as information sharing. In his opinion, the judge noted that the "astonishing" investment and innovation in AI by competitors like OpenAI has fundamentally changed the competitive landscape since the case began. This new reality, he argued, lessens the need for a drastic structural remedy like selling off the Chrome browser.</p>

          <p>North Korean state media announced that leader Kim Jong Un personally supervised the final ground test of a new high-thrust, solid-fuel engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). This development is a significant concern for international security, as solid-fuel missiles can be launched more quickly and with less warning than liquid-fuel versions. Analysts believe the completion of this test phase indicates that North Korea is preparing for a full test launch of a new, more advanced ICBM, possibly before the end of the year. The advancement comes amid deepening cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has expressed serious concern that the country may be heading towards an economic crisis requiring a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), similar to the one in 1976. Citing rising government bond yields and insufficient economic growth, she argued that the Labour government lacks a viable plan to avoid a "doom loop" of rising taxes and unstable public finances. Badenoch offered to work with the government "in the national interest" on issues like welfare spending cuts to help stabilize the economy. A Labour source dismissed her offer, stating her party had "crashed the economy" when it was in power. (not investment advice)</p>
