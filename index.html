            <h2>Alaska Lawmakers Grapple with Market Instability Amid Trump Policies</h2>

            <p>Alaska lawmakers are facing budget uncertainty due to President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies and declining oil prices, impacting the state's reliance on oil revenues. The volatility has intensified existing tensions over allocating funds between the yearly oil-wealth fund checks for residents and essential services like education. With lawmakers hesitant to raise taxes and having depleted billions in savings, they find themselves in a challenging situation. Some leaders hope the tariffs might encourage countries to invest in Alaska's proposed liquefied natural gas project, which Trump has repeatedly promoted despite economic feasibility concerns.

            <p>The Trump administration is moving to withhold federal funds from Maine after the state refused to sign a Title IX resolution agreement banning transgender athletes from girls' sports. Maine officials argue that Title IX does not prohibit transgender girls from participating in girls' sports teams, citing federal court rulings. The Department of Education plans to initiate administrative proceedings to terminate Maine's K-12 education funding and refer the case to the Department of Justice. This action follows a prior warning and reflects the administration's stance on transgender athletes' participation in sports.</p>

            <p>Economists are questioning President Trump's credibility after he walked back on newly imposed tariffs, creating confusion and uncertainty in the global market. The inconsistent implementation of trade policies is causing businesses and consumers to struggle to adapt, leading to delayed investments and altered spending habits. Concerns are growing about stagflation, as tariffs threaten to raise prices and slow economic growth. The administration's focus on tariffs overlooks the importance of the service sector in the US economy, potentially harming key industries like tourism and technology.</p>

This scandal questions the authenticity of sustainable tourism in Scandinavia, where nature is central to the industry.

            <p>The U.S. House is reconsidering its voting rules after Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna's push for proxy voting for new parents sparked a major debate. What began as a seemingly minor rule change escalated into a conflict involving party leadership and the Freedom Caucus. Luna's efforts to accommodate working parents in Congress led to a compromise involving vote-pairing, though some remain unsatisfied. The debate highlights the challenges of adapting historical rules to modern circumstances.</p>
