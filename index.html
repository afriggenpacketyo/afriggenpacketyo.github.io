        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly advanced a pivotal budget bill central to Donald Trump's agenda, overcoming a key procedural hurdle with a 51-49 vote. The nearly 1,000-page legislation, which extends Trump-era tax cuts and introduces new ones, has faced significant dissent within the Republican party over its provisions, particularly cuts to welfare and healthcare programs. Despite some GOP defections, party leadership secured enough votes to begin debate, though the bill's final passage remains uncertain as Democrats plan to delay proceedings and critics like Elon Musk warn of its economic impact.

          <p>A tropical depression has formed in the western Gulf of Mexico and is forecast to strengthen into a tropical storm before making landfall in Mexico. The system, designated Tropical Depression 2, was located east-northeast of Veracruz, Mexico, with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph. The National Hurricane Center has issued tropical storm warnings for parts of the Mexican coast, anticipating heavy rain and strong winds.

          <p>In a dramatic late-night session, Senate Republicans secured the necessary votes to begin debate on President Trump's major tax and spending bill after Senator Ron Johnson switched his vote from "no" to "yes." The procedural motion passed, narrowly avoiding the need for a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President. Following the vote, Democrats initiated a tactic to have the nearly 1,000-page bill read aloud, a process estimated to take over 15 hours.

          <p>A jury has found Samuel Woodward guilty of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement for the 2018 killing of his former classmate, 19-year-old Blaze Bernstein. Prosecutors successfully argued that Woodward, who was involved with a neo-Nazi group, targeted Bernstein because he was gay and Jewish. The trial, delayed for years, culminated in a verdict that brings a life sentence without parole. Bernstein's family, who described their son as a creative and magical person, expressed relief at the verdict, which they see as a form of justice for their son.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new plans for food businesses in England to partner with officials to encourage healthier consumer choices and combat rising obesity rates. Rather than imposing specific targets, the voluntary initiative will see major retailers and manufacturers report on their sales of healthy food to increase accountability. Potential strategies include offering promotions on nutritious items, adjusting loyalty point systems, or changing store layouts to make healthy options more accessible. The policy is part of a broader national health strategy aimed at reducing pressure on the NHS and creating the "healthiest generation of children ever."</p>

Without naming individuals, he alluded to past instances where he felt compelled to speak out against comments from both Republican and Democratic leaders.

The protests, which have been ongoing for months, were sparked by a deadly railway station roof collapse that critics attribute to government corruption.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 21:23:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cities often experience significantly higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas due to a phenomenon known as the "urban heat island effect." This effect is caused by the prevalence of dark, hard surfaces like asphalt roads and buildings, which absorb and retain the sun's heat more than natural landscapes. This stored heat is released slowly, keeping urban environments warmer, especially overnight. The lack of vegetation and water sources, which provide natural cooling in the countryside, exacerbates the issue. As climate change makes heatwaves more frequent and intense, urban populations are disproportionately vulnerable to their dangerous effects.</p>

          <p>Japan has successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, marking the end of the series' 24-year career as a cornerstone of the nation's space program. The rocket, which lifted off from Tanegashima Island, deployed a government satellite designed to monitor greenhouse gases and climate change. Developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, the H2A series has a 98% success rate and has been instrumental in deploying satellites and probes. It is now being replaced by the more cost-competitive H3 rocket, as Japan aims to strengthen its position in the global satellite-launch market.</p>

          <p>An estimated crowd of over 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a major demonstration for human rights and a clear message to Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The large turnout was reportedly fueled by the government's attempt to ban the march under a controversial "child protection" law that equates homosexuality with pedophilia. Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, celebrated the event's success, stating it was a peaceful show of defiance against a "hateful power." The march highlighted the ongoing cultural and political clash between Hungary's populist government and advocates for LGBTQ+ rights and civil liberties.</p>

          <p>The UK government has strongly condemned chants calling for "death to the IDF" during a Glastonbury Festival performance by rap duo Bob Vylan, which was broadcast live by the BBC. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy reportedly sought an urgent explanation from the BBC's director general regarding the broadcast. The BBC acknowledged some comments were "deeply offensive" and stated the set would not be available on its iPlayer service. Avon and Somerset Police are now reviewing footage from the performance, as well as one by the controversial rap group Kneecap, to determine if any criminal offenses were committed.</p>
