        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Israeli military has commenced an expanded ground operation in Gaza City, aiming to dismantle Hamas's infrastructure and warning residents to evacuate south. This move follows intense airstrikes and comes as many Palestinians, already displaced, struggle to find safe passage or shelter in overcrowded southern areas. The operation, dubbed "Gideon Chariots," signifies a major escalation in the conflict, with Israeli forces reportedly surrounding the city. The United Nations has estimated over 220,000 Palestinians have fled northern Gaza in the past month, highlighting the severe humanitarian impact of the ongoing offensive. A UN-commissioned report also accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, a claim Israel vehemently rejects.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Gallup survey reveals that 62% of U.S. adults aspire to be their own boss, yet only a fraction pursue entrepreneurship due to common barriers like finances, fear of failure, and lack of business knowledge. Experts advise against waiting for 'perfect' savings, suggesting a 2-6 month expense goal and testing ideas as a side hustle. For those concerned about startup costs, service-based businesses like consulting can leverage existing skills with lower overhead. Building a solid business structure, understanding your target market, and seeking mentorship are crucial steps to overcome knowledge gaps and foster resilience against the inevitable setbacks in the entrepreneurial journey.</p>

          <p>A CNBC Fed Survey indicates that 82% of economists, fund managers, and strategists believe President Trump's actions are aimed at limiting or eliminating the Federal Reserve's independence. A majority of respondents predict these actions will lead to higher inflation, increased unemployment, lower economic growth, and a depreciated U.S. dollar. While there's a consensus on a quarter-point rate cut by the Fed this week, opinions diverge on whether this is the correct move, reflecting internal FOMC debates. Concerns about a recession have also risen, with tariffs and policy uncertainty identified as major threats to economic expansion. The survey highlights the perceived risks of political interference in monetary policy.</p>

          <p>Technology giant Oracle is reportedly part of a consortium of firms that could enable TikTok to continue its U.S. operations, as the Trump administration and China work towards a framework deal. The precise structure remains unclear, including the extent of ByteDance's involvement and control over TikTok's algorithm. This development comes ahead of a potential meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi to finalize the agreement, following years of national security concerns over the app. Oracle has previously partnered with TikTok to route U.S. user data through its servers, and its co-founder, Larry Ellison, is known to be a friend of President Trump.</p>

          <p>As autumn approaches, Europe's gas reserves stand at over 80%, providing a solid buffer for the upcoming winter, though slightly lower than previous years. The continent has diversified its energy supplies away from Russia, relying more on liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Norway, the U.S., and Qatar, alongside increased renewable energy adoption. Despite this internal resilience and stable global supply conditions, new uncertainties arise from U.S. President Donald Trump's pressure on Brussels to impose tariffs on buyers of Russian energy. While the expiration of the Ukraine-Russia gas transit deal had a muted impact, Trump's tariff threats could still introduce volatility, potentially leading to temporary price spikes or localized shortages. Europe aims for full energy independence from Russia by 2027.</p>

          <p>Scientists have unearthed what could be the world's oldest known mummies in Southeast Asia, dating back up to 12,000 years. The discovery challenges previous timelines for human mummification, which were largely attributed to the Chinchorro people 7,000 years ago. Researchers found human remains in crouched positions with cuts and burn marks across various sites in China and Vietnam, suggesting the bodies were smoke-dried over fires by ancient hunter-gatherer communities. This practice likely allowed people to maintain spiritual connections with ancestors, reflecting a deeply human desire for loved ones to remain present. The findings contribute significantly to the study of prehistoric funerary practices and highlight the ancient, widespread nature of mummification.</p>

          <p>Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor involved in the Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell cases, has sued the Department of Justice, alleging her July termination by the Trump administration was "unlawful and unconstitutional." Comey, daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, claims she was fired solely due to her father's identity or her perceived political affiliation, with no legitimate explanation provided. Her lawsuit names the DOJ, the Executive Office of the President, and other entities as defendants. Comey's dismissal is part of a trend of DOJ employees challenging their terminations during Trump's second term, and she warned that such actions could instill fear and suppress independent thought within the department.</p>

          <p>World Athletics has stated it will "remind" Great Britain about its rules concerning religious and political slogans, following Jeremiah Azu's display of a '100% Jesus' headband at the World Championships in Tokyo. Azu wore the headband during the men's 100m semi-finals, where he finished fourth and missed out on the final. The governing body's regulations explicitly prohibit the marketing of such slogans during competition. With Azu potentially competing in the 4x100m relay, World Athletics plans to reiterate its rules and the potential consequences to the British team. This incident highlights the ongoing tension between athletes' personal expressions and sporting regulations.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the AI revolution, while promising efficiency, is primarily serving to make the already wealthy unfathomably richer, intensifying wealth inequality and social division. Companies like Palantir and OpenAI are seeing massive growth and creating new billionaires, driven by AI's potential to automate jobs across all sectors, from coding to warehouse operations. The author suggests this represents an efficient upward redistribution of wealth, with a speculative bubble forming around AI stocks. The article posits that this technological prioritization over common labor needs, coupled with deepening class cleavages and political dysfunction, creates a society where tech serves itself rather than human needs, leading to increased loneliness and unhappiness.</p>

          <p>California nurses are reporting a significant increase in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) presence at hospitals, alleging agents are interfering with patient care and creating a fearful environment. Dianne Sposito, a nurse with over 40 years of experience, recounted an incident where an ICE agent blocked her from treating a screaming immigrant patient. Nurses across the state express concerns that ICE agents prevent patients from contacting family, listen to private conversations, and disrupt medical care, potentially violating patient privacy laws. This surge follows a Trump administration executive order overturning the 'sensitive locations' policy that previously limited immigration enforcement in healthcare facilities, leading to fears that sick individuals will avoid seeking necessary medical attention.</p>

          <p>China's largest coffee chain, Luckin Coffee, is expanding into the U.S. market, opening five locations in New York City to challenge Starbucks on its home turf. Luckin's model relies on mobile app orders and aggressive discounting, often offering 30-50% off, aiming to build brand awareness despite initial stores operating at a loss. This strategy contrasts with Starbucks' focus on profitability per store. Luckin's history includes an accounting fraud scandal in 2020, leading to delisting and bankruptcy, but it has since re-emerged with new leadership and rapidly scaled its operations, surpassing Starbucks in China with over 26,000 locations globally.</p>

          <p>This article provides a historical exploration of Zionism, defining it as a nationalist movement that emerged in the 19th century, advocating for a Jewish society in Ottoman Palestine. It traces Zionism's origins to the 1897 Basel congress, where leaders like Theodor Herzl sought legal settlement and established the Zionist Organization. The article highlights the movement's early diversity, including debates over statehood and religious inclusion, and acknowledges the historical oversight of Palestine's Arab population. It draws parallels between Zionism and other nationalist movements, emphasizing its complex past, internal disagreements, and ongoing evolution in defining national identity and its relationship with Palestinians. Viewing Zionism historically reveals it as a multifaceted movement, not a monolith.</p>

Berthoumieu accepted that her actions warranted a red card, though no on-field action was taken at the time of the incident. The panel initially set an 18-game suspension but reduced it by six due to her remorse, while noting she had the opportunity to stop the action. Berthoumieu is appealing the length of the ban, which would rule her out for the remainder of the World Cup and until March 1. Her captain, Manaé Feleu, is also appealing a separate three-game suspension.</p>

This call follows the firing or suspension of numerous workers across various fields for comments deemed inappropriate about Kirk's death. The campaign, initially launched through an anonymous website, has intensified fears of a crackdown on free speech and has been linked by Trump allies to an alleged left-wing 'terror' movement, despite police indicating the suspect acted alone.</p>

          <p>The Prime Minister has ordered a new investigation into how MI5 provided false evidence to three courts concerning conversations with the BBC. This directive follows rejections from both the High Court and the Investigatory Powers Tribunal regarding MI5's previous explanations for the inaccuracies. The case centers on a neo-Nazi state informant, Agent X, who exploited his MI5 role to coerce his girlfriend. MI5 had initially lied about its policy of not confirming informants' identities, a claim disproven by BBC evidence. The new inquiry, led by Investigatory Powers Commissioner Sir Brian Leveson, aims to address the "serious procedural deficiencies" found in MI5's earlier investigations and determine next steps.</p>

The drug, a long-acting amylin analogue, mimics a hormone to increase satiety and demonstrated a "well-tolerated" profile with mostly mild to moderate gastrointestinal side effects.
