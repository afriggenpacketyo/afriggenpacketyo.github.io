            <p>The U.S. Treasury market experienced an unusual sell-off amidst market turmoil caused by President Trump's proposed tariffs, leading to a spike in Treasury yields. Concerns arose about who was selling these safe-haven assets, with speculation pointing towards China potentially weaponizing their Treasury holdings by converting proceeds into Euros or German bunds. However, analysts caution that selling Treasurys could harm China's investments as well, while others suggest Japan's life insurers might be reducing their U.S. exposure. The sell-off highlights the complex interplay between trade policy, investor behavior, and global economic stability (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>With the tax deadline approaching, taxpayers can file for an extension to gain an additional six months to submit their federal return. The IRS offers several methods for requesting an extension, including online payment systems and Form 4868, but it's crucial to remember that an extension only applies to filing, not payment. Penalties are assessed for late filing and late payment, so it's advisable to estimate and pay any owed taxes by the original deadline to avoid fines. The IRS also provides payment plans for those who cannot afford to pay their taxes on time.</p>

            <p>A controversial anti-poverty solution known as the "success sequence" is gaining traction in public schools, advocating that poverty can be avoided by making three choices in the right order: education, full-time employment, and marriage. The Heritage Foundation promotes this model legislation, suggesting personal choices primarily drive economic prosperity, but policy experts argue that the evidence underpinning its anti-poverty message is weak. Critics argue that the sequence confuses correlation with causation and deflects attention from systemic barriers, while proponents maintain its popularity across political and demographic lines, emphasizing the importance of personal responsibility.</p>

            <p>The UK government has intervened to secure crucial supplies of coking coal and iron ore for British Steel, preventing the shutdown of its blast furnaces. This action followed a breakdown in talks with the Chinese owner, Jingye, who was accused of planning to halt production. The government's move ensures the continuation of virgin steel production in the UK and safeguards 2,700 jobs, with industry minister Sarah Jones confirming the arrival of shipments from the US and Australia. The government aims to find a private sector partner for the plant's future ownership, while Beijing criticizes the intervention as "politicising trade co-operation."</p>

            <p>The availability of low-deposit mortgages in the UK has reached its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis, offering a boost to first-time buyers. Moneyfacts reports a significant increase in deals requiring 5% or 10% deposits, providing greater choice for those with limited savings. However, despite the increased options, mortgage rates remain elevated, with borrowers still facing rates well over 5% on average. While securing a mortgage is one thing, buyers also need to act relatively quickly when it comes to finding a new home.</p>
