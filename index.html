          <h2>Nvidia Receives US Approval to Resume Sales of Advanced AI Chips to China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 07:55:34 EDT</div>

          <p>Nvidia has received approval from the Trump administration to sell its advanced H20 AI computer chips to China, reversing a previous ban. CEO Jensen Huang announced the policy shift, highlighting the importance of the Chinese market for American tech competitiveness. The decision is seen as a significant boost for Nvidia, allowing it to better compete with rivals like Huawei and potentially easing trade frictions. This development comes as the U.S. has been tightening controls on advanced technology exports to China over national security concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government created a clandestine resettlement program for Afghans after a significant data breach in February 2022 exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 applicants. An Ministry of Defence official inadvertently released the data, which included information on individuals potentially at risk from the Taliban. The secret scheme, which has already cost £400 million, was established in response to the leak and has so far brought 4,500 Afghans to the UK. The existence of the program was concealed by a court injunction that has now been lifted.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst estimates, driven by strong performance in its fixed income trading and investment banking divisions. The bank's revenue from these sectors benefited from market volatility related to U.S. trade policy shifts. Despite a 17% drop in overall earnings compared to the previous year, the underlying results were robust. CEO Jamie Dimon noted the U.S. economy's resilience but also warned of persistent risks from trade uncertainty and geopolitical conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) is reportedly operating without a policy on transgender athletes, as its 2021 guidelines have not been renewed. This comes as the U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear cases on the issue and conservative groups are targeting the sport for its lack of clear rules. The U.S. Soccer Federation also lacks a policy for its national teams, creating a vacuum that advocacy groups seeking to ban transgender women from sports are aiming to fill. The situation reflects a broader, contentious cultural and political debate over transgender rights in the United States.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is preparing to vote on a White House request to cancel $9.4 billion in previously approved funding, targeting foreign aid and public broadcasting. The rescissions package primarily seeks to cut $8.3 billion from USAID and other international programs, along with $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. While the House approved the measure, some Senate Republicans have expressed opposition to cutting specific programs like PEPFAR, which combats global AIDS. The move requires only a simple majority, creating a tense political battle. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mike Waltz, President Trump's nominee for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is scheduled to testify at his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday.

          <p>A pastor and divinity school professor argues that houses of worship should not endorse political candidates, despite a recent IRS rule change allowing them to do so. The author contends that while churches must address moral and political issues like justice, endorsing specific candidates undermines the conscience of congregants and reduces the church's role. Doing so risks turning sanctuaries into politically polarized spaces and entangling them in partisan wars. The essay concludes that the church best serves the state by maintaining its distinct moral authority rather than becoming a tool for political ends.</p>

The essay reflects on the Southern Baptist Convention's continued opposition to same-sex marriage, a stance that forces many LGBTQ individuals to choose between their faith community and their personal integrity. The author describes the painful process of leaving a beloved but non-affirming church, ultimately finding a deeper and more authentic faith in a community that embraces them fully.

          <p>The recently concluded FIFA Club World Cup, held in the U.S. as a dress rehearsal for the 2026 World Cup, has exposed significant problems with extreme heat. Several games were played in dangerous conditions, with players reporting dizziness and the pace of play slowing dramatically, leading to calls for schedule changes for next year's tournament. Many matches were scheduled for midday or early afternoon to accommodate European broadcast times, resulting in oppressive on-field temperatures. This has raised serious health and safety concerns for the 2026 World Cup, which will be held in the same summer window.</p>

The discovery provides the first visual record of the vessel since it was sunk by U.S. torpedo boats over 80 years ago.
