          <p>Oleksandr Usyk solidified his status as a boxing great by becoming a two-time undisputed heavyweight champion after defeating Daniel Dubois. In a masterful performance at Wembley Stadium, Usyk stopped his British opponent in the fifth round. The 38-year-old Ukrainian fighter knocked Dubois down twice in the decisive round, with Dubois failing to beat the count after the second knockdown. This victory extends Usyk's undefeated professional record to 24 wins and marks his second stoppage victory over Dubois.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler demonstrated dominant and composed play during the third round of The Open, finishing with a bogey-free 67 to establish a four-shot lead at 14-under par. A victory would mark his second major of the year and place him three-fourths of the way toward a career grand slam. If he wins, Scheffler would join the elite company of Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, and Tiger Woods as the only players to win the Masters, PGA Championship, and The Open before turning 30. His consistent performance positions him as the clear favorite heading into the final day at Royal Portrush.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has committed to a new target of reducing sewage discharges from water companies by 50% by the year 2030. This announcement follows significant public anger over waterway pollution and data showing a 60% rise in serious pollution incidents in 2024. The plan also includes measures to ban plastic-containing wet wipes and cut phosphorus pollution, which harms aquatic wildlife. This initiative comes amid scrutiny of water companies for rising consumer bills and large executive bonuses despite their environmental performance.</p>

          <p>The UK Met Office has issued multiple yellow weather warnings for rain and thunderstorms across the country, indicating a risk of flash floods, power cuts, and travel disruptions. While a more severe amber warning for London and the southeast did not result in the feared widespread flooding, localized impacts remain possible. The alerts come after a recent heatwave left the ground dry and less able to absorb heavy rainfall. Warnings are in place for Scotland, southern Wales, and much of England through the weekend and into Monday.</p>

          <p>The defense team for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering United HealthCare CEO Brian Thompson, claims that Manhattan prosecutors illegally obtained his confidential medical records. His attorneys allege the District Attorney's office used a fraudulent subpoena to compel Aetna to release the information, violating health privacy laws like HIPAA. The DA's office sources contend they requested limited information and that Aetna sent additional materials in error, which were then deleted. The defense is requesting a hearing and sanctions, potentially including dismissal of the charges.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has condemned the United States for imposing visa sanctions on a Supreme Court justice involved in the prosecution of former leader Jair Bolsonaro. The Trump administration placed restrictions on Justice Alexandre de Moraes and his family, a move Lula described as unacceptable interference in another country's justice system. The sanctions were enacted after Moraes ordered Bolsonaro to wear an electronic monitor while awaiting a verdict on charges of attempting to overturn the 2022 election. Lula expressed solidarity with the court, vowing that Brazil's democratic institutions would not be intimidated.</p>

          <p>More than 100 people have been arrested across the United Kingdom during demonstrations protesting the government's decision to proscribe the activist group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. Protesters in London, Edinburgh, Manchester, and other cities were arrested for displaying placards in support of the group, which is now a criminal offense. The government banned Palestine Action under the Terrorism Act after its members broke into an RAF base and damaged aircraft. The protests occurred ahead of a High Court challenge to the ban filed by the group's co-founder.</p>

          <p>Former major champions Bryson DeChambeau and Henrik Stenson have voiced criticism over the R&A's inconsistent approach to slow play at The Open. Both golfers were warned by rules officials during the third round, with Stenson admitting he "vented" to referees about being put on the clock after a five-minute delay, while earlier rounds ran an hour over schedule. DeChambeau called the pace of play in the first two rounds "out of control" and advocated for a new, simpler system of timing every shot for every player to ensure fairness and consistency.</p>

          <p>According to Gazan hospital officials and witnesses, Israeli troops opened fire on crowds of Palestinians near food distribution hubs in southern Gaza, killing 32 people. The incidents occurred as people gathered to seek aid from the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The Israeli military stated it fired warning shots when crowds approached its forces, while the GHF claimed the shootings happened far from its sites before they opened. The violence highlights the deadly chaos surrounding aid distribution in Gaza, where the population faces a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <h2>Gen Z Activists Promote 'Chastity Before Marriage' on the Jersey Shore</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of young, college-aged Christian activists from the organization Generation Life spent a weekend on the Jersey Shore promoting a message of chastity until marriage. Engaging with beachgoers, they sought to reframe chastity not as mere abstinence but as a countercultural movement against the superficiality and objectification they see in modern dating and social media. The activists believe that by encouraging deeper, more intentional relationships, they can address what they see as the root causes of issues like abortion. Their outreach highlights a generational effort to adapt a traditional message for contemporary anxieties.</p>
