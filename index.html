          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, maintaining a range of 4.25% to 4.5% as it continues to monitor economic conditions. The decision reflects ongoing concerns about elevated inflation, which remains above the Fed's 2% target, despite a solid GDP growth report. The committee was divided, with two members dissenting in favor of a rate cut, a rare occurrence highlighting the complex economic landscape. Officials indicated that future decisions, including a potential cut in September, will depend heavily on upcoming inflation and employment data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has articulated a new vision for artificial intelligence centered on creating "personal superintelligence" to empower individuals. This personalized AI could act as a companion, helping with personal tasks and goals, and would be integrated into devices like AI-powered glasses developed with Ray-Ban. This strategic pivot towards AI, away from the metaverse, coincides with strong financial performance, as Meta reported a 36% increase in quarterly profit. The company's focus on AI is seen as a move to future-proof its growth amid changing social media trends and antitrust scrutiny.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Canadian government has announced its intention to formally recognize a Palestinian state in September, following similar moves by France and the UK. Prime Minister Mark Carney stated the decision is contingent upon the Palestinian Authority implementing democratic reforms, including holding elections without the participation of Hamas. This significant shift in Canadian foreign policy is driven by the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. The move reflects growing international pressure and a belief that the traditional negotiated two-state solution approach is no longer viable.</p>

The IPO values the company at $19.3 billion, a figure close to the $20 billion acquisition price offered by Adobe before the deal was abandoned due to regulatory challenges. Figma's successful public offering reflects a gradually reopening market for tech IPOs and demonstrates strong investor confidence in its growth.

          <p>Brown University has settled with the Trump administration, restoring nearly $50 million in federal research funding that had been frozen. The agreement resolves several federal investigations into the university and requires Brown to reaffirm its commitment to nondiscrimination laws and provide the government with access to admissions data. As part of the deal, Brown also agreed to adhere to the administration's definitions of male and female for athletics and other campus programs. Unlike a similar settlement with Columbia University, Brown's agreement involves no financial penalty or admission of wrongdoing from the institution.</p>

          <p>Emily Damari, a former Israeli hostage released from Hamas captivity, has sharply criticized the United Kingdom's plan to recognize a Palestinian state. She argues the move effectively rewards terrorism and undermines efforts for genuine peace by legitimizing an entity while Hamas remains in power.

          <p>A significant technical failure in the UK's air traffic control system caused severe travel disruptions, grounding thousands of flights at major airports like Heathrow and Manchester. Although the radar-related outage at the NATS control center lasted only 20 minutes, it created a massive backlog, resulting in over 150 cancellations and extensive delays. This is the second major outage for NATS in two years, prompting criticism from airline executives and political leaders who are demanding an investigation. The government is now working with the air traffic control firm to understand the cause of the failure and prevent future incidents.</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. legislation prioritizing fossil fuels and nuclear power is raising questions about America's global leadership in the clean energy transition.

However, critics warn that this strategic shift could be short-sighted, potentially sacrificing long-term sustainability and competitiveness. The debate centers on whether the U.S. is securing its immediate economic and strategic interests at the cost of its role in addressing the global climate crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

The company, which provides essential items like wheelchairs and hospital beds for patients being discharged or cared for at home, is expected to run out of cash this week. Local authorities had warned the government of a "risk to life" and requested a loan to prevent service disruption, but no loan was offered. Councils are now scrambling to find alternative providers to maintain services for vulnerable individuals, highlighting systemic fragility in community care supply chains.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. is laying off 52 employees from its Motion Picture Group as part of a broader corporate restructuring at its parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery. The job cuts will impact marketing, distribution, and production departments, and are part of a strategy to create a more unified global structure. The move comes as Warner Bros. Discovery continues to manage billions in debt following the Discovery takeover of WarnerMedia. The company has been undergoing significant changes, including thousands of job cuts and a plan to split into two separate publicly traded entities.</p>

          <p>Following the conclusion of a five-day strike by resident doctors in England, the British Medical Association (BMA) and Health Secretary Wes Streeting have agreed to resume talks. The latest walkout, the 12th since spring 2023, occurred after previous negotiations broke down. Streeting has stated he is not willing to negotiate further on pay but will resume discussions on working conditions, such as career progression and rotas. In a letter, he warned the union that the recent strike had "squandered the considerable goodwill" of the government, signaling that the upcoming talks may be contentious.</p>

          <p>Pro Football Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe is leaving his role as a commentator on ESPN's "First Take," ending his brief tenure on the popular sports talk show. His departure comes less than two weeks after he settled a lawsuit from a former girlfriend who accused him of sexual assault, allegations he had strongly denied. The lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice following a private settlement, and no criminal charges were filed. Sharpe, a prominent sports media personality with popular podcasts, had been in talks for a major new podcasting deal before the lawsuit became public.</p>

          <p>Ford has reinstated its full-year financial guidance after suspending it due to tariff uncertainty, now projecting an adjusted EBIT of $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion. This new forecast incorporates an estimated $3 billion gross impact from tariffs, of which the company believes it can offset $1 billion. For its second quarter, the automaker reported revenue that beat expectations but saw net income fall due to special charges, including a major vehicle recall. The company's performance reflects resilience in its commercial "Pro" division, while its "Model e" electric vehicle unit continues to post significant losses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has reported that seven more people, including children, have died from malnutrition, bringing the total of such deaths to 154 since the war began. This comes as UN-backed experts warn that a famine scenario is "currently playing out" in the territory. Aid delivery remains critically insufficient, with reports of deadly incidents near distribution centers and the looting of aid trucks. Israel maintains it is not restricting aid, a claim disputed by the UN and its allies, as a U.S. envoy prepares to travel to the region to discuss the escalating crisis.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles's Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) has named former senior curator Ann Goldstein as its interim director, following the departure of Johanna Burton. Burton, who is leaving to become the director of the Institute of Contemporary Art in Pennsylvania, is the fifth director to leave MOCA since 2008, continuing a pattern of leadership instability at the institution. Goldstein brings deep institutional knowledge to the role, having worked at MOCA for over two decades before holding leadership positions at other major museums.

          <p>A Senate committee has advanced legislation to ban members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks, with Republican Senator Josh Hawley joining all Democrats on the panel in an 8-7 vote. The bill, which now faces an uncertain future on the Senate floor, aims to prevent potential conflicts of interest and restore public trust. The vote featured a tense exchange between Hawley and fellow Republicans who defended wealth and the use of blind trusts. Former President Trump offered conceptual support for the bill before later attacking Hawley on social media for working with Democrats.</p>
