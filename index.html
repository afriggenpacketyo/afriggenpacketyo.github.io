          <h2>Ceasefire Negotiations Between Israel and Hamas Resume in Doha Amid Ongoing Airstrikes in Gaza</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Indirect ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas are restarting in Doha, Qatar, even as Israeli military operations continue across the Gaza Strip. Recent Israeli airstrikes have reportedly killed dozens of Palestinians, including strikes on residential areas and a coastal zone where displaced people are sheltering. The negotiations focus on a U.S.-backed proposal for an initial truce involving a hostage release in exchange for increased humanitarian aid. However, significant disagreements remain, with Hamas demanding a permanent end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal, while Israel insists on retaining the ability to dismantle Hamas's military capabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Israeli military has launched airstrikes against Houthi targets in several Yemeni ports, including Hodeidah, in an operation codenamed "Black Flag." The strikes, which followed civilian evacuation warnings, targeted sites Israel claims were used to transfer Iranian weapons, including a power station and a commercial ship seized by the Houthis in 2023. Israeli officials stated the action was a response to the Iran-backed group's repeated missile attacks on Israel and commercial shipping in the Red Sea since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. The Houthi group confirmed its air defenses engaged with the Israeli strikes.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods have struck the Texas Hill Country, resulting in at least 81 deaths and leaving more than 40 people missing. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, engulfing areas including a children's summer camp, where multiple campers and a counselor remain unaccounted for. Rescue operations are extensive, with hundreds of personnel conducting air and water searches. President Trump has signed a major disaster declaration for the hardest-hit area, Kerr County, as officials warn the number of missing may be higher due to unrecorded campers in the region.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has sharply criticized Elon Musk, describing the billionaire as a "train wreck" in a social media post. The comments came after Musk announced the formation of a new political party, the "America Party." Trump stated he was "saddened" by Musk's recent actions and claimed their policy differences, particularly on electric vehicle mandates, were a point of contention. The president also defended his decision not to nominate a Musk associate to lead NASA, citing a potential conflict of interest. Trump dismissed the idea of a third party as "ridiculous" and a source of voter confusion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is planning a legislative change that will grant parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, paid leave is only guaranteed for pregnancy loss occurring after 24 weeks. The amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will ensure that all parents facing pregnancy loss, regardless of timing, have dedicated time off from work to grieve. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will give people essential time away from work, a move that has been welcomed by campaigners and advocacy groups as a significant step in acknowledging the impact of early-stage pregnancy loss.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to offer qualified early years teachers a tax-free payment of £4,500 to work in nurseries located in 20 designated disadvantaged areas. This incentive is part of a £1.5 billion "Best Start in Life" strategy aimed at improving educational standards and narrowing the attainment gap among preschool children. Currently, only about one in ten nurseries employs a specialist early years teacher. The plan also includes proposals for more frequent Ofsted inspections for nurseries. Critics argue that the government's broader tax policies have already placed significant financial strain on the childcare sector, potentially undermining the new initiative.</p>

The show follows an American woman who moves to the UK and falls for a punk musician, mirroring some of Dunham's own life experiences. In a recent interview, Dunham explained her decision to step back from acting in the series, citing the intense public scrutiny of her body she experienced in her 20s. She reflected on how society remains deeply fatphobic and misogynistic, but noted that she has developed a healthier relationship with her own body, separate from cultural pressures.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's announcement of a new "America Party" faces substantial legal, logistical, and financial challenges, making its establishment a daunting task. Experts note that creating a new national political party requires navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws for ballot access, a process that is heavily biased toward the two major parties. This effort would likely cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take years to accomplish, with no possibility of being ready for the 2026 midterm elections. While Musk has immense personal wealth, the process involves more than just funding, requiring massive signature-gathering campaigns and anticipating intense legal opposition from Republicans and Democrats.</p>

          <p>Despite possessing a better record than their World Series-winning team at the same point last year, the Los Angeles Dodgers are showing some worrying signs. A recent series loss to the Houston Astros, where they were outscored 29-6, dropped their record against winning teams to just one game above .500. This performance against potential playoff-caliber opponents is a cause for concern. The team is also battling a growing list of injuries to key players, including outfielder Teoscar Hernández and utility player Tommy Edman, further straining their roster depth as they head into the final stretch before the All-Star break.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy and tariffs has compelled numerous companies to fundamentally restructure their global supply chains. Businesses reliant on Chinese manufacturing are facing steep import taxes, prompting a shift in production to countries like Vietnam and India to mitigate costs. For example, one U.S. toymaker saw its annual import tax bill jump from $2.5 million to over $100 million during a temporary tariff hike. This shift is creating new logistical challenges and expenses, while Canadian firms face dual pressures from both U.S. tariffs and their own country's retaliatory measures, impacting their operational decisions and consumer prices.</p>

However, the rise of self-directed, internet-fueled extremism from both Islamist and far-right ideologies presents new challenges.

          <p>The death of Daniel Park, who was accused of conspiring to bomb a California fertility clinic, is being investigated as a suicide while he was in federal custody. Park was being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles following his arrest for allegedly aiding the bomber, who died in the May 17 explosion. His death closes the only prosecution in the case and comes amid growing concerns from lawyers about inhumane conditions and inadequate medical care at the facility. A recent Justice Department report had already highlighted significant shortcomings in the Bureau of Prisons' emergency responses to inmate deaths.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of the deadly Texas floods, a disagreement has emerged between state officials and the National Weather Service (NWS) over the adequacy of the storm forecasts. Some Texas officials claim the weather reports did not accurately predict the catastrophic scale of the rainfall, which saw the Guadalupe River rise 26 feet in 45 minutes. The NWS defended its performance, noting it issued a flood watch and multiple flash flood warnings, including a rare "flash flood emergency" alert, hours before the worst of the flooding occurred. Meteorologists highlight the inherent difficulty in precisely forecasting such extreme and localized precipitation events.</p>

          <p>This article highlights Chevron as an attractive stock for long-term investors, aligning with Warren Buffett's strategy of buying well-run companies at a good price. It notes that the energy sector's current volatility has made Chevron's stock, with its 4.7% dividend yield, appealing. The company's strength is attributed to its integrated business model, which smooths performance across the energy cycle, and a strong balance sheet that allows it to maintain its dividend even during industry downturns. The article suggests that now is an opportune time to invest while the stock is out of favor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British tennis player Cameron Norrie has reached the Wimbledon quarter-finals after a hard-fought, five-set victory over Chilean qualifier Nicolas Jarry.

The British number three ultimately prevailed 6-3 7-6 (7-4) 6-7 (7-9) 6-7 (5-7) 6-3 in a match lasting over four hours. The win keeps British hopes alive in the singles draw and sets up a formidable quarter-final clash against two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz.

          <p>According to expert Denis Simon, the US-China Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement (STA), first signed in 1979, has been a foundational element of the bilateral relationship. It established a framework for government-to-government cooperation, academic exchanges, and joint research in fields like health and energy, serving as a politically "safe" area to build trust when diplomatic ties were fragile. Today, the agreement's future is sensitive, as the openness it fostered is now viewed by some as a vulnerability amid rising geopolitical tensions, national security concerns, and economic competition in critical technology sectors like AI and semiconductors.</p>

          <p>In 2007, long before his presidency, Donald Trump launched a brand of steaks, burgers, and hot dogs called Trump Steaks, marketed as "The World's Greatest Steaks." The products, which were USDA Prime grade, were sold exclusively through the Sharper Image catalog and the QVC shopping channel. Despite the high-grade certification, the brand failed after just two months due to a combination of factors, including poor sales, high prices, and negative customer reviews. Consumers complained about a bland taste and grainy texture, concluding that the product did not justify its premium price tag, leading to its swift disappearance from the market.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris won his first British Grand Prix in a dramatic and challenging race marked by changing weather conditions.

Both McLaren drivers demonstrated exceptional skill, proving to be in a class of their own throughout the weekend at Silverstone. Despite the contentious circumstances, the win is a significant moment for Norris at his home race and reduces his championship deficit to Piastri to just eight points, marking his second consecutive Grand Prix victory.</p>

          <p>Wimbledon officials have issued an apology after the electronic line-calling system on Centre Court was mistakenly deactivated during a fourth-round match, failing to make three calls in a single game. The error occurred during the match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal, with one missed call on a point that could have won Pavlyuchenkova the game. The All England Club attributed the incident to human error and has reviewed its processes to prevent a recurrence. Pavlyuchenkova, who went on to win the match, expressed frustration and suggested that video reviews, similar to those in football, should be implemented in tennis.</p>

Instead, the author argues that misunderstandings and misjudgments have complicated the dynamic over the years.

          <p>England's Test cricket team is caught in a cycle of frustrating inconsistency, often following a significant victory with a heavy defeat, as seen in their recent thrashing by India. This article suggests that recurring issues are preventing the team from achieving sustained greatness. Key batters like Ollie Pope and Zak Crawley struggle with consistency, while the spin bowling of Shoaib Bashir has proven expensive. Furthermore, the workload on the pace bowlers raises questions about selection and rotation ahead of the next Test at Lord's. Until England can eliminate these crushing losses, their ambition to become a top-ranked side remains in jeopardy.</p>
