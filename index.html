          <p>Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland, a major producer of high-fructose corn syrup, fell sharply after former President Donald Trump claimed he had secured an agreement with Coca-Cola to use real cane sugar in its U.S. products. In a social media post, Trump celebrated the supposed deal as a positive move. Coca-Cola's response was noncommittal, stating they would share details on new innovations soon, while the Corn Refiners Association warned the change could lead to significant American job losses. The announcement caused a notable drop in ADM's stock price, highlighting market sensitivity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Researchers Estimate Thousands of Additional Annual Deaths Under Proposed Healthcare Law</h2>

          <p>A study by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and Yale School of Public Health has attempted to quantify the human cost of the proposed "Trumpcare" healthcare bill. Their analysis of the House version of the legislation projects that the changes could result in over 51,000 additional deaths annually by 2034. This figure, which the article notes is higher than the current annual death toll from breast cancer, stems from predicted coverage losses and the termination of enhanced insurance subsidies. The White House has strongly refuted these findings, labeling the claims as "egregious" and "deranged."</p>

          <p>A cultural analysis in The Economist explores the declining relevance of Superman in the modern era, contrasting his enduring, unchanging nature with a rapidly evolving world. The article posits that while the character was a symbol of hope and strength in the 20th century, his straightforward morality and immense power struggle to resonate in a more complex and cynical time. Using a scene from the 1978 film where Clark Kent struggles to find a phone booth, the piece argues that this moment prophetically captured the hero's current predicament. Superman's greatest challenge today is not a villain, but the battle for cultural significance.</p>

          <p>Uber has entered a major six-year partnership to deploy over 20,000 robotaxis, investing $300 million in electric vehicle maker Lucid. The deal also involves autonomous vehicle startup Nuro, which will develop the self-driving technology for the Lucid vehicles. This collaboration aims to launch a new fleet of purpose-built, Level 4 autonomous robotaxis in a major U.S. city starting next year. The move positions Uber to compete more directly with rivals like Waymo and represents a significant expansion into the autonomous ride-hailing market, causing Lucid's stock to surge following the announcement.

Mr. Campbell, who has since passed away, was jailed for theft, while Mr. De Souza was detained for attempted robbery. Their exoneration is part of a larger review that has so far overturned all 13 referred cases linked to Ridgewell's misconduct.</p>

Maher emphasized that public media is a critical component of emergency alert systems in nearly half of U.S. states, particularly in rural areas.

          <p>As Disneyland celebrates its 70th anniversary, an analysis highlights how integrating intellectual property (IP) has been the cornerstone of Disney's successful theme park strategy. From early attractions based on classic films to modern lands dedicated to Star Wars, Marvel, and Avatar, the company has consistently leveraged its vast story catalog. This approach has turned the experiences division into a primary profit driver, with operating income far surpassing its content-centric entertainment unit. Despite some fan criticism over the replacement of classic rides, this IP-fueled strategy continues to broaden the parks' appeal and is central to a planned $60 billion investment over the next decade.</p>

The increase is largely attributed to a massive $1.5 billion hack of the Bybit exchange, linked to North Korean actors. However, the report also highlights a disturbing trend: a significant spike in physical attacks and kidnappings targeting individual crypto holders to coerce them into transferring funds. This shift towards violent, real-world crime suggests that as platforms enhance their digital security, criminals are increasingly targeting individuals directly.</p>

This move comes shortly after the company reported a drop in sales for the recent quarter, which it attributed to pausing U.S. exports and winding down older Jaguar models. While the company stated the job cuts are "normal business practice," industry experts suggest the financial impact of the tariffs played a significant role in the decision.</p>

          <p>A satirical opinion piece in The Atlantic critiques the Department of Homeland Security's justification for detaining migrants in a Florida facility, even when they have no criminal convictions. The article mocks the DHS's claim that these individuals are still "criminals" because they entered the country illegally or are suspected of being terrorists or gangsters without evidence. The author uses sharp irony to highlight the logical fallacies and potential prejudices in defining someone as a criminal based on suspicion rather than proof. The piece suggests this approach undermines due process and basic principles of justice.</p>

          <p>A DW fact-check debunks recent social media claims that using sunscreen increases the risk of skin cancer. Health authorities and scientific studies confirm there is no evidence to support this assertion; in fact, UV radiation is the primary cause of melanoma, and sunscreen helps protect against it. The article explains that the rising incidence of skin cancer in countries with high sunscreen use is misunderstood. This correlation is better explained by factors like increased awareness, better diagnostics, more time spent outdoors, and the use of older, less effective sunscreen formulas in past studies.</p>

          <p>A liquor store owner in rural Utah has closed her shop rather than sign a new state contract that she says would have made her business unprofitable. The new terms required her to cover approximately $24,000 in credit card fees, which would have decimated her earnings. She is one of several operators suing the state, arguing they have been misclassified as independent contractors instead of employees. The closure highlights the fragility of small businesses operating under strict state regulations and has left the local community without a convenient outlet for liquor sales, forcing residents and other businesses to travel long distances.</p>

          <p>An article from DW explores the science behind smartphone addiction and offers evidence-based methods to combat it. With the average person spending over four hours a day on their phone, problematic use is linked to mental health issues like depression and anxiety. Scientists recommend a multi-pronged approach, including creating physical distance from the device by leaving it out of the bedroom, reducing notifications, and using apps that limit screen time. The article emphasizes that these behavioral retraining techniques, similar to those used for other addictions, are most effective when used in combination to break the cycle of dependency.</p>

According to the U.S. embassy, the site will provide repair and maintenance services for small Philippine military watercraft and is not a formal U.S. military base. However, some analysts believe the facility will directly strengthen the Philippine Navy's ability to confront China and could pave the way for shared use of naval facilities by U.S. forces.

          <p>For decades, a Kentucky resident nicknamed the "River Cowboy" has led a grassroots effort to remove thousands of discarded tires from the state's rivers. Russ Miller began his cleanup work in the 1980s after noticing the Red River was becoming a "conveyor belt of trash," and has since co-founded the group Friends of Red River. The article highlights the persistent problem of illegal tire dumping in rural areas, driven by a lack of convenient disposal options and historical habits.

          <p>At the urging of Donald Trump, Texas Republicans are preparing to redraw the state's congressional map in a bid to gain up to five additional seats for their party. This mid-decade redistricting effort is seen as a risky but aggressive move to consolidate power ahead of the midterm elections. Critics argue that any new map would inevitably weaken the influence of Texas's rapidly growing non-white population, whose voting power was already diluted in the 2021 redistricting. Legal experts have also questioned the justification for the special session, calling the Justice Department's rationale for it "concocted" and legally dubious.</p>
