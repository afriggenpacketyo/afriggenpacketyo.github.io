          <h2>Number of Missing Persons in Texas Floods Drastically Reduces</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 21:31:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following severe flooding in Texas earlier in the month, officials in Kerr County have significantly revised the number of missing individuals. Initial reports listed nearly 100 people as unaccounted for, but this figure has now dropped to just three after extensive verification efforts by state and local agencies. Despite this positive development, the overall death toll from the floods across Texas remains high, with over 130 fatalities confirmed, 107 of which were in Kerr County alone. The update provides a measure of relief amid the ongoing recovery from the devastating natural disaster.</p>

          <p>WNBA players utilized the All-Star Game to publicly express their dissatisfaction with the ongoing collective bargaining agreement (CBA) negotiations. Stars from opposing teams wore T-shirts with the slogan "Pay Us What You Owe Us" during warmups, signaling a unified front against the league. Players like Angel Reese and Sabrina Ionescu have been vocal, describing the league's latest proposal as "disrespectful" and a "slap in the face." While WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert characterized a recent meeting as "constructive," the players' demonstration highlights a significant divide between the two sides.</p>

          <p>The England national rugby team defeated the United States with a decisive 40-5 score in a match in Washington D.C. that was significantly disrupted by weather. The game experienced nearly two hours of delays due to lightning strikes in the area, forcing players and spectators to seek shelter. Despite the interruptions, England scored six tries, maintaining momentum and concluding their tour with a perfect three-win record. The match also served as an opportunity for several new players to make their debut for the English side under coach Steve Borthwick.</p>

          <p>More than three years after 13-year-old Iran Moreno was killed by a stray bullet in his Pasadena home, two suspects have been charged with his murder. Muhammad Abdul-Malik, 38, and Teraeja Laquanna Flemmings, 31, face charges for the November 2021 incident where Moreno was fatally shot while playing video games. Authorities stated that Moreno was not the intended target of the shooting. The breakthrough in the case came after recently enhanced surveillance video and detailed sketches led to the identification and subsequent arrest of the suspects.</p>

          <p>Following last year's deadly attack in Southport, UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new law to target individuals preparing for mass violence, even without a clear ideological motive. The proposed legislation aims to close a legal gap, allowing police to intervene and charge suspects who are planning attacks but do not fit the traditional definition of terrorism. This change would grant authorities similar powers to those used against terror suspects, enabling them to act on preparatory steps like researching a target, which is currently difficult to prosecute without an ideological link.</p>

The lawsuit claims the report was false and defamatory, representing clear journalistic failures.

This practice highlights public frustration with what many perceive as extortionate "kiss-and-fly" fees.

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died in Westbury, New York, after a large metallic chain he was wearing caused him to be pulled into an active MRI machine. The powerful magnetic field of the machine drew the man in, resulting in a fatal "medical episode," according to Nassau County Police. The incident is currently under investigation. The FDA warns that the strong static magnetic field of an MRI can turn magnetic items into dangerous projectiles, highlighting the critical importance of screening all people and objects before they enter an MRI environment to prevent such accidents.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Clippers are "strongly considering" signing veteran point guard Chris Paul, according to the team's president of basketball operations, Lawrence Frank. Paul, who previously played for the Clippers from 2011 to 2017, would bring additional playmaking and veteran leadership to the roster. Frank emphasized the team's desire to add more ball-handling and acknowledged Paul's history as a "great Clipper." If signed, Paul would join a guard-heavy lineup and would be expected to accept a reserve role, providing depth and relieving pressure on primary playmaker James Harden.</p>

          <p>After years of rapid growth, interest in learning the Mandarin language is declining in the United States and other Western nations. University enrollments for Mandarin in the U.S. have dropped by 25% from their 2013 peak, with similar downward trends seen in the UK and New Zealand. This shift marks a significant change from a decade ago when Mandarin was widely promoted as the language of the future, driven by China's economic rise. The waning appeal suggests a potential change in geopolitical and cultural priorities among students and educational institutions in the West.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on flights from Mexico and threatened the partnership between Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico, escalating a trade dispute over airport access. The move is a response to the Mexican government's actions forcing airlines to relocate from Mexico City's main airport to a newer, more distant one, which the U.S. claims violates a bilateral aviation agreement. Under the new rules, all Mexican airlines must seek U.S. government approval for their flight schedules. The decision could jeopardize numerous routes and have significant economic consequences for both countries.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy kept his hopes alive at The Open with an eventful third-round 66, leaving him tied for fourth place but still six shots behind leader Scottie Scheffler. His round was highlighted by a spectacular 56-foot eagle putt on the 12th hole, which sent roars through the home crowd at Portrush. However, the round also included a bizarre moment when his ball landed on another golf ball buried in the rough, leading to a bogey. Despite the deficit, McIlroy feels he has given himself at least a "half-chance" heading into the final day.</p>
