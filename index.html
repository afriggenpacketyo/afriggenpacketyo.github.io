          <p>A Ukrainian security official reported that a Ukrainian drone attack destroyed over 40 Russian military aircraft deep within Russia, an operation allegedly overseen by President Zelenskyy and taking over a year and a half to execute. The drones, transported in containers by trucks, targeted airfields including the Belaya air base in Russia's Irkutsk region, marking the first time a Ukrainian drone has been seen in the area. This attack occurred on the same day Zelenskyy announced a Ukrainian delegation would attend peace talks with Russia in Istanbul. Simultaneously, Russia launched a large number of drones and missiles on Ukraine, resulting in casualties among Ukrainian service members and prompting an investigation into the circumstances of the attack.</p>

          <p>In Dhaka, the trial of exiled former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina began in absentia, with prosecutors accusing her of crimes against humanity during last year's uprising against her rule. The International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) is focusing on her government's crackdown on the protest movement, which led to her ousting and subsequent refuge in India. Prosecutors allege Hasina directed the violent crackdown, including ordering the killing of a student protester, and have listed multiple charges against her and other top officials. Hasina claims the charges are politically motivated, and her party has been banned pending the trial's outcome.</p>
