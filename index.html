          <p>Following the murder of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, Donald Trump and his allies have been accused by legal scholars and historians of using the tragedy to justify broad attacks against political opponents. This includes launching investigations into liberal donor George Soros, targeting critics as an "enemy within," and weaponizing the Department of Justice against adversaries. Experts describe these actions as a component of an "authoritarian playbook," designed to undermine civil society and consolidate power by using political violence as a pretext for retribution. The administration's response has intensified concerns about the erosion of democratic norms and civil liberties.</p>

          <p>Jennifer Choate experienced a normal labor until she suffered an amniotic fluid embolism, a rare condition where amniotic fluid enters the bloodstream, causing catastrophic organ failure. Doctors at the University of Maryland Baltimore Washington Medical Center acted quickly, resuscitating her and delivering her daughter safely via C-section after her heart stopped. Despite a grim prognosis for many survivors, Choate made a full recovery with no long-term complications, driven by the desire to be with her newborn daughter. Her story highlights the unpredictable dangers of childbirth and the critical importance of a swift medical response.</p>

          <p>According to a report in the Chinese magazine Ordnance Industry Science Technology, China's electronic warfare (EW) forces successfully deceived a foreign spy plane during an operation in the South China Sea. The EW system allegedly simulated the radar signals of a large naval vessel, such as an aircraft carrier, from a distance of up to 300 kilometers. This action may have caused the foreign aircraft to track a non-existent target or travel toward an incorrect location. The report highlights China's advancing capabilities in electronic and information warfare within the contested region.</p>

Despite modern technology, the show maintains a massive audience of over 6.5 million listeners, far exceeding many popular television programs. Its unique, rhythmic recitation of maritime regions like Dogger, Fisher, and Malin has made it a cultural institution, referenced in music and literature for its soothing and evocative qualities. The article suggests its persistence demonstrates the profound ability of the human voice to connect people and provide a sense of shared experience in a fragmented world.</p>

          <p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has become the first of nine universities to reject the Trump administration's "Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education." The proposal offered preferential access to federal funding in exchange for adopting administration-backed campus reforms related to free speech, admissions, and gender policies. In a letter, MIT President Sally Kornbluth stated that the university could not support an approach that would restrict freedom of expression and institutional independence. She emphasized that the core principle of scientific funding should be based on merit alone, reaffirming MIT's commitment to its partnership with the U.S. government on those terms.</p>

          <p>Lithuania is developing "Tech Zity," a €100 million project in Vilnius set to become Europe's largest startup hub, aiming to host 5,000 workers by 2028. The initiative seeks to build on the success of the country's fintech sector, which has thrived due to favorable regulations and direct access to the central bank. Organizers hope the hub will foster creativity and innovation, with the ambitious goal of having the startup sector contribute 25% of the nation's GDP by 2030. However, challenges remain, including access to early-stage capital and the need for a larger talent pool to help startups scale into billion-dollar unicorns.</p>

The move follows years of growing momentum for celebrating Indigenous Peoples Day on the same date to acknowledge the devastating impact of Columbus's arrival on Native populations. The proclamation accuses "left-wing arsonists" of trying to tarnish Columbus's memory and does not mention Indigenous Peoples Day, which President Biden first federally recognized in 2021.

The creative industry argues that well-established copyright law requires explicit permission, or an opt-in, for such uses.

          <p>Following a deadly militant attack on tourists in Kashmir, India's government has reportedly initiated a crackdown that includes forcibly deporting Muslims to Bangladesh and Myanmar. Human Rights Watch reports that over 1,500 people, including Indian citizens and Rohingya refugees, were expelled without legal process between May and June. One Indian citizen, Mustafa Kamal Sheikh, was detained in Mumbai and forced across the border into Bangladesh before being allowed to return after his story gained social media attention. Critics allege the deportations are a politically motivated effort to distract from security failures and stoke anti-immigrant sentiment.</p>

          <p>A New York woman lost her cybersecurity job just hours after her social media post about slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk was targeted by a right-wing online campaign. The woman, identified as Alexandra, posted a message that mimicked Kirk's own controversial words about the 2022 attack on Paul Pelosi. A prominent X account with over 500,000 followers amplified her post, named her employer, and encouraged followers to demand her termination. Fearing for her safety after her personal information was hinted at online, Alexandra's experience highlights a trend of coordinated online pressure campaigns focused on employment consequences for political speech.</p>

          <p>The practice of scattering cremated ashes in scenic natural locations is facing scrutiny in Scotland after hikers reported an increasing number of ash piles on popular hills like Dumyat. Conservation groups, including the John Muir Trust, are asking the public to refrain from scattering ashes on the summits of mountains like Ben Nevis, citing the potential harm to fragile alpine flora and nutrient-poor soils. The presence of human remains can also be upsetting to other visitors enjoying the wild landscape. Mountaineering Scotland suggests choosing alternative locations away from popular peaks and considering burying ashes to minimize the ecological impact.</p>

          <p>As the Scottish National Party (SNP) gathers for its annual conference, First Minister John Swinney is focused on stabilizing the party and clarifying its path toward Scottish independence. After a period of turmoil following the resignations of his predecessors, Swinney has steadied the party by addressing internal controversies and shifting government focus to public service delivery. Polling suggests the SNP holds a lead over a less popular Labour party, but Swinney faces the challenge of uniting his party on a viable strategy for achieving another independence referendum. A key debate at the conference will center on whether winning a Holyrood majority should be the trigger for demanding a new vote.</p>

This move comes as Broadcom's stock has surged, raising valuation concerns for some, while Nvidia continues to dominate the AI hardware market despite ongoing questions about geopolitical tensions and the sustainability of AI infrastructure spending. The trades reflect a strategic shift in how one of Wall Street's largest players is navigating the evolving AI investment landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump described China's move as hostile and also suggested the U.S. would retaliate with its own export controls on critical American software. The announcement caused the S&P 500 to tumble, fanning fears of a renewed global trade conflict that could harm worldwide economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Social Security's 2026 cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is projected to be between 2.7% and 2.8%, an above-average increase for the fifth consecutive year. According to policy analysts, this adjustment will be modestly boosted by President Trump's trade policy, which includes global and reciprocal tariffs. These tariffs, particularly on input goods used in domestic manufacturing, are expected to increase consumer prices, which in turn lifts the inflation metric used to calculate the COLA. However, this "Trump bump" is unlikely to benefit retirees, as rising Medicare Part B premiums are expected to consume a significant portion of the increase. (not investment advice)</p>
