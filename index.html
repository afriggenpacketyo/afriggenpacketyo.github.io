        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are minimizing the impact of tariffs by leveraging the "first sale rule," a decades-old U.S. customs law. This rule allows importers to calculate duties based on the initial sale price between a manufacturer and a vendor, rather than the inflated price from an intermediary. To apply the rule, there must be at least two sales by independent parties, proof the item was destined for the U.S., and documentation of the first sale price. While this process can be complex and requires trust between parties, the potential cost savings make it worthwhile, especially for higher-value consumer goods and luxury products.

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage announced the party's intention to support more generous tax breaks for married couples and eliminate the two-child benefit limit to alleviate financial strain on families. Farage stated the goal is to assist lower-paid workers, not to promote a benefits culture. The party also plans to reinstate winter fuel payments for 10 million pensioners, reversing government cuts. Critics, like Liberal Democrat Sir Ed Davey, have raised concerns about the feasibility of these spending pledges, questioning how Reform UK plans to fund these policies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is moving to terminate all remaining federal government contracts with Harvard University, valued at a reported $100 million. The U.S. General Services Administration claimed Harvard "continues to engage in race discrimination" in its admissions process and other areas of campus life, citing this as the reason for the decision. This action follows a previous ban on Harvard enrolling international students, which was temporarily blocked by a federal judge. The administration argues that being a federal contractor requires adherence to non-discrimination principles and safeguarding taxpayer money.</p>

          <p>National Public Radio (NPR) has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump over his executive order to cease all federal funding for the non-profit broadcaster. The lawsuit argues that Trump's order violates the First Amendment's protections for speech and the press, and infringes upon Congress' authority. NPR and other public radio stations claim the order is an attempt to punish and control their news coverage, which the administration deems biased. The news outlets assert that the order threatens the existence of a public radio system that millions of Americans rely on for vital information.</p>

          <p>Sherron Watkins and Cynthia Cooper, who exposed accounting fraud at Enron and WorldCom, are cautioning against a proposal by Republican lawmakers to eliminate the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). They argue that eliminating this watchdog would increase the risk of corporate disasters and accounting fraud. The PCAOB was created after the Enron and WorldCom scandals to ensure independent oversight of public company audits and improve financial reporting credibility. The authors stress that the PCAOB's independence from the SEC is vital for its focus on audit quality and its ability to conduct international inspections, particularly in jurisdictions like China.</p>

          <p>A report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) indicates a significant disparity between the official unemployment rate and the "true rate" of unemployment, which considers underemployment and poverty-wage jobs. While the official unemployment rate stood at 4.2% in April, LISEP's measure showed a "true rate" of 24.3%. This metric encompasses individuals seeking full-time work who cannot find it and those stuck in poverty-wage positions, revealing nuances in the labor market missed by traditional indicators. LISEP argues that the official unemployment rate is misleading because it counts people as employed even if they work as little as one hour per week or earn poverty-level wages.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and House Republicans are pushing measures to restrict federal benefits for immigrant families, impacting both undocumented immigrants and legal residents. These changes, including modifications to the child tax credit and eligibility for federal health insurance programs, could affect millions of children who are U.S. citizens with noncitizen parents. Experts warn that these policies may undermine the well-being of children and families, potentially leading to worse health outcomes and reduced economic opportunities. While proponents argue these changes would remove incentives for illegal immigration, critics contend they would disproportionately harm citizen children.</p>

          <p>Tesla's European sales experienced a significant drop of 49% in April, attributed to reputational damage from CEO Elon Musk's political involvement and increasing competition. The company sold 7,261 cars in Europe, while overall battery electric car sales rose 34.1%. Tesla faces challenges from traditional automakers and Chinese players, with BYD surpassing Tesla in pure electric car sales in Europe for the first time. European consumers also show a preference for hybrid electric vehicles, a market segment Tesla does not currently serve.</p>

          <p>Conductor John Mauceri experienced rapid weight gain and swelling, leading to a diagnosis of pericardial constriction after an extensive search by his medical team. The rare condition, possibly triggered by a prior COVID-19 infection, involved thickening of the sac around his heart, preventing it from fully opening. Open-heart surgery revealed Mauceri's heart was trapped inside a thick shell of scarring, which was carefully removed. Following the surgery, Mauceri recovered and returned to conducting, feeling stronger than ever.</p>

          <p>Critics of former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running for New York City mayor, are drawing comparisons between him and the current mayor, Eric Adams. They argue that Cuomo's policies and approach would be similar to a second term for Adams, citing their moderate Democratic stances, shared donors, and similar plans for addressing mental health and housing. Opponents claim that electing Cuomo would continue the pro-business policies and perceived corruption associated with the Adams administration. Both Cuomo and Adams have faced scrutiny over their fundraising practices and ethics investigations.</p>

          <p>Food inflation in the UK has reached a one-year high, driven by increased beef and fresh produce prices, according to industry data. Beef prices have risen significantly due to high demand and low supply caused by lack of government support, with one steakhouse chain reporting a 20% increase in beef costs. Industry experts said competition between supermarkets had previously been keeping the price of beef down, so it was only a matter of time until customers were hit by cost increases. A rise in production costs and an increase in the national minimum wage was also pushing up overall costs. (not investment advice)</p>
