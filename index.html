          <h2>NASA Faces Internal Unrest and Budgetary Pressure Amid Leadership Changes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 02:49:14 EDT</div>

          <p>Hundreds of current and former NASA employees have protested against what they call "rapid and wasteful changes" to staffing, missions, and budgets. The letter, known as the Voyager Declaration, criticizes arbitrary downsizing and defiance of congressional appropriations, warning of dire consequences for the agency. This internal turmoil coincides with significant budget uncertainty, a leadership vacuum following high-level departures, and a broader White House push to shrink the federal workforce, creating a period of significant reckoning for the U.S. space agency.</p>

          <h2>UK Retail Sales Rebound in June Driven by Warm Weather</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 02:46:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom saw a 0.9% increase in June, according to the Office for National Statistics. The rise was largely attributed to warm weather, which boosted supermarket sales of items like drinks and increased fuel purchases as more people traveled. However, this rebound was smaller than economists had anticipated and followed a steeper-than-expected 2.8% decline in May. The modest quarterly growth suggests the broader economy will likely experience lackluster performance over the period.</p>

          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has reported a 29% drop in its second-quarter operating profit, falling to 3.83 billion euros, and has lowered its financial outlook for the year. The company attributes the downturn to the disruptive impact of U.S. import tariffs, restructuring costs, and increased sales of lower-margin electric vehicles. In response to these challenges, Volkswagen now projects a lower operating return on sales and expects full-year sales to be flat compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India is under intensified pressure to conclude a trade agreement with the United States before an August 1 deadline, after which U.S. tariffs are set to increase. New Delhi has been protective of its agricultural sector, a sensitive issue that also featured in its recent trade deal with the U.K. Analysts suggest the U.S. also has strategic incentives to secure a deal, viewing India as a key partner in the Indo-Pacific and a potential manufacturing alternative to China. India's role within the BRICS bloc also provides it with diplomatic leverage in negotiations.</p>

          <p>A German news roundup highlights both economic and social policy developments. Volkswagen announced a significant 36.3% drop in second-quarter profits, attributing it to U.S. tariffs and the shift to less profitable electric vehicles, while reaffirming its restructuring plans. Separately, the conservative-led government's tougher migration stance is under scrutiny, with data showing a rise in deportations in the first half of the year. A prominent migration researcher has criticized the policy as a "bluff" that undermines EU law and helps the far-right. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel has ruled that California's law requiring background checks for all ammunition purchases is unconstitutional. In a 2-1 decision, the court found the law infringes on the Second Amendment right to bear arms, stating the state failed to prove it aligns with the nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation. California Governor Gavin Newsom condemned the ruling as a "slap in the face" to gun violence prevention efforts, while gun rights advocates celebrated it as a victory against overreaching government control.

Bullingham argued that the current model already features enough interruptions to the game's flow. The FA holds a key vote on any potential rule changes, and its opposition makes any expansion of VAR's authority less likely in the near future.</p>

In contrast, 'Cloud,' from Japanese director Kiyoshi Kurosawa, is a psychological thriller about a young man whose online resale business spirals into a world of paranoia and violence.

Another contentious point is the U.K.'s digital services tax, which affects American tech giants and which Washington wants eliminated.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order targeting the shifting landscape of college athletics, directing federal agencies to enforce new rules on scholarships and athlete compensation. The order seeks to protect non-revenue and women's sports by requiring top athletic departments to maintain scholarship levels and aims to rein in "pay-for-play" name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals. This move comes after a legal settlement opened the door for direct payments to athletes, raising fears that football and basketball would absorb all resources. The NCAA and major conferences applauded the order, hoping it leads to federal legislation.</p>

          <p>Italian journalist Roberto Saviano, author of "Gomorrah," reflects on the 17 years he has lived under police protection after an Italian court upheld the conviction of a Camorra mafia boss for making threats against him. Saviano describes how the mafia fears the written word and how his reporting led to a public "proclamation" against him during a major trial in 2008. He details the profound personal cost of his work, including the loss of freedom, relationships, and privacy, describing his existence as a "life sentence." Despite the personal toll, he affirms the importance of exposing organized crime.</p>

          <p>Six university students on a field trip in Inner Mongolia, China, have died after falling into an industrial flotation tank at a copper-molybdenum mine. The students, from Northeastern University, were part of a group visiting the site when a grating panel reportedly gave way, causing them to fall into the slurry-filled tank. A teacher was also injured in the incident. In response to the tragedy, Chinese state media and the public are calling for stricter safety measures and a thorough investigation, which a government team has now begun.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has approved the $8 billion merger between Skydance Media and Paramount Global. The deal places historic brands like CBS, Paramount Pictures, and MTV under the control of Skydance. The approval, which passed in a 2-1 vote, followed Paramount's recent $16 million settlement of a lawsuit with Donald Trump and the cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," moves that critics have called politically motivated. The dissenting FCC commissioner warned the American public would "pay the price" for what she termed Paramount's "cowardly capitulation" to the administration.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its sanctuary laws that limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration agents. The lawsuit argues these policies intentionally obstruct federal immigration enforcement and lead to the release of dangerous criminals. The move comes shortly after an off-duty CBP officer was shot by an alleged undocumented immigrant in Manhattan. City officials defended the policies as essential for public safety, ensuring all residents feel safe reporting crimes, but will review the lawsuit.</p>

The president insisted the project's cost had risen to $3.1 billion, a figure Powell disputed, explaining it incorrectly included a building completed five years ago. Despite having previously suggested the project's cost overruns could be grounds for firing Powell, Trump stated on Thursday that firing him is not necessary. The exchange highlighted the ongoing tension between the two, with Trump again insisting that interest rates must come down.</p>

However, their Conservative colleagues dissented, echoing the government's position that recognition should only come as part of a long-term, two-state political solution. The call increases pressure on Prime Minister Keir Starmer, especially after France announced its intention to recognize Palestine in September.</p>

          <p>A research team in China has become the first to directly observe and measure friction between solid materials at the quantum level. Using folded graphene, the scientists discovered that, contrary to classical physics, friction did not always increase as the material got thicker; in some cases, thicker folds actually slid more easily. The team traced this unusual effect to how the material's bending changed electron movement, locking them into fixed energy levels and reducing the conversion of motion into heat. This breakthrough could aid in the design of ultra-efficient, durable nanodevices and advanced materials.</p>
