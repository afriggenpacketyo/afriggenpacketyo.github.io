            <p>Former National Security Advisor John Bolton criticized President Trump's trade policies, arguing that imposing tariffs on allies weakens the U.S. strategic position against China. Bolton suggests that Trump's approach of using tariffs against allies alienates them, making it harder to form a united front to address China's trade practices. He contends that by engaging in tariff wars with friends, the U.S. is inadvertently strengthening China's strategic advantage and that a more unified approach with allies would be more effective in influencing China's behavior.

            <p>An arson attack on Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's residence is raising concerns about the rise of political violence and the erosion of democratic norms in the United States. The incident follows a previous attempt on Donald Trump's life in 2024, underscoring the increasing vulnerability of high-profile political figures. While data on political violence is not yet showing a significant uptick, experts warn that each attack on a politician undermines the foundation of peaceful political discourse. The article emphasizes the need for a strong commitment to resolving political differences through non-violent means and cautions against rhetoric that encourages or excuses violence.</p>

            <p>A watchdog group, Protect Democracy, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for removing a public tracker that showed how the government spends funds appropriated by Congress. The lawsuit argues that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is legally required to publicly post apportionment documents to ensure transparency and prevent abuses of power. The OMB claims that the tracker reveals sensitive information, but the Government Accountability Office disagrees, stating that the data is not predecisional or deliberative. The lawsuit seeks to compel the OMB to restore the spending tracker.</p>

This initiative aligns with a broader effort to address America's diet problems and reform the welfare state, with proponents arguing that taxpayer money should not subsidize unhealthy sugary drinks. While some critics view this as a veiled attempt to cut SNAP benefits, supporters maintain that it is a way to promote healthier choices without dictating what people can buy with their own money. Several states are seeking waivers from the federal government to implement these pilot programs.</p>

            <p>Amid recent stock market volatility, investors may be tempted to move to cash as a safe haven, however, financial advisors caution against this strategy for long-term savers. While cash offers short-term stability, it historically delivers lower returns than stocks, potentially hindering the achievement of long-term investment goals. Investors are advised to maintain an appropriate balance between cash and stocks based on their individual circumstances, risk tolerance, and time horizon. A diversified portfolio that includes both safe and risky assets is recommended. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Cuts to U.S. foreign aid are hindering efforts to investigate war crimes and provide support to survivors in Syria, which is struggling to recover from a nearly 14-year civil war. The White Helmets, a first responder group, and human rights organizations are facing funding shortages, impacting their ability to clear mines, excavate mass graves, and collect evidence for future trials. These cuts have slowed down the process of gathering evidence and prolonging the pain of Syrian survivors.

            <p>A CNBC Supply Chain Survey indicates that President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to lead to a reshoring of supply chains to the U.S. Instead, most companies surveyed believe that building domestic supply chains would significantly increase costs, leading them to relocate to lower-tariffed countries. The survey also reveals concerns about consumer demand, raw material prices, and the Trump administration's inconsistent strategy. A majority of respondents feel that the Trump administration is bullying corporate America. (not investment advice)</p>
