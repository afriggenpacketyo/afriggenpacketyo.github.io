          <p>In a New York Times guest essay, John Cameron Mitchell reflects on his college speaking tour and observes that today's youth, burdened by screens and anxieties, need to rediscover the spirit of punk. He advocates for D.I.Y. collective action, community engagement, and empathy as antidotes to the isolation and division fostered by corporate-controlled culture. Mitchell encourages students to embrace the analog, seek unexpected allies, and create useful stories outside approved systems, suggesting that kindness and empathy are crucial in a world where facts are increasingly suspect.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how Dartmouth College, under President Sian Beilock, has navigated the contentious landscape of campus politics during the Trump administration. Unlike many of its Ivy League peers, Dartmouth has avoided major funding threats and investigations, possibly due to Dr. Beilock's approach of emphasizing free expression, engaging with conservatives, and taking a firm stance against disruptive protests. The article explores the debate over whether Dr. Beilock is effectively protecting the university or simply trying to appease conservatives.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco's first-quarter net profit fell by 5% due to lower oil prices and production, signaling continuing strain on the company's balance sheet. The article notes the massive dividend reduction eases pressure on Aramco itself, but means less revenue for the Saudi government as it faces widening deficits and mounting debt due to costly megaprojects and lower oil prices.
