          <p>A 37-year-old man, Marcus Monzo, has been sentenced to a minimum of 40 years in prison for murdering 14-year-old Daniel Anjorin with a samurai sword in Hainault, east London. The judge noted that Monzo's self-induced psychosis from cannabis use was a dominant factor in the 20-minute rampage, during which he also injured five other people. Daniel's family expressed that justice had been served but that no sentence could bring back their son, who was a gifted and kind student.</p>

          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency reported that the worst-case nuclear safety scenario was avoided in recent strikes on Iran, with no significant off-site radioactive releases detected. Despite this, U.S. political figures are divided on the mission's effectiveness. Former President Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson claimed Iran's nuclear program suffered a major setback, but Democratic lawmakers, including physicist Rep. Bill Foster, expressed serious concerns that Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium may not have been destroyed, potentially leaving them a short time from developing a nuclear weapon.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump celebrated a Supreme Court decision that limits the power of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions against executive actions, calling it a "monumental win." The 6-3 ruling stemmed from legal challenges to his executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship, though the court did not rule on the order's constitutionality. While Trump and his attorney general lauded the decision for reining in what they see as judicial overreach, prominent Democrats like Senator Chuck Schumer condemned it as a "terrifying step toward authoritarianism."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite fears that new tariffs would fuel inflation, U.S. prices have remained relatively stable, with key inflation gauges showing only modest increases. Economists suggest this is due to short-term strategies by companies, such as pre-ordering inventory, absorbing costs to protect consumers, and using legal loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay duty payments. However, experts warn this situation is likely temporary, and consumers may see prices rise in the latter half of the year if the tariffs remain in place. (not investment advice)</p>

By requiring schools to allow parental opt-outs for lessons involving LGBTQ-themed books, the court creates significant administrative burdens and legal risks for districts.

          <p>Amid rising consumer debt, debt forgiveness through negotiation is a potential option for relief, particularly for certain types of debt. Unsecured debts like credit card balances, personal loans, and medical bills are often the most likely candidates for settlement, as creditors have no collateral and may prefer to recover a portion of the debt rather than nothing. While buy now, pay later plans and payday loans can technically be settled, they often present more challenges due to their structure and the practices of the lenders involved.

          <p>Oliver Tarvet, a 21-year-old British qualifier at Wimbledon, has called for a change to the NCAA's rules on prize money for college athletes. As a student at the University of San Diego, Tarvet is restricted from claiming the full Â£66,000 he earned for reaching the main draw, as NCAA rules cap annual profit from professional tournaments at $10,000 plus expenses. His situation highlights a growing debate, including a class-action lawsuit, over whether student-athletes who earn significant prize money in professional events should be allowed to keep their winnings.</p>

          <p>A review of Lorde's fourth album, "Virgin," describes it as a deliberate return to the electronic sound and youthful themes of her earlier work, though filtered through the lens of her late 20s. The album is set in downtown Manhattan and focuses on visceral, personal experiences, but the article argues its potential is diluted by a self-obsession that reflects a broader cultural trend. While moments of the album are praised for their magic and craftsmanship, the overall production is seen as too safe and its intense introspection ultimately circular and isolating.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Supreme Court's 6-3 decision to curb nationwide injunctions is a "grievous blow" to the separation of powers and the rule of law. The author contends that by limiting a federal court's relief to only the specific plaintiffs in a case, the ruling makes it far more difficult to halt unconstitutional actions by the executive branch. The piece echoes Justice Sotomayor's dissent, warning that the decision renders constitutional guarantees meaningful in name only and poses an "existential threat" to the judiciary's role as a check on power.</p>

          <p>This analysis piece explores the wave of Islamophobic and xenophobic attacks from prominent Republican voices against New York mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani. The article argues that this rhetoric is strangely at odds with the party's recent electoral gains among minority voters, including Muslims and immigrants. Instead of building on this new coalition, the MAGA movement's response to Mamdani's victory seems determined to alienate these very groups, reflecting a governing agenda that prioritizes inflammatory rhetoric over solidifying its expanded voter base.</p>
