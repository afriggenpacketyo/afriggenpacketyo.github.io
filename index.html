            <p>Education Secretary Linda McMahon defended the Trump administration's decision to freeze $2.2 billion in funding to Harvard University, citing concerns about antisemitism on campus. McMahon stated the action was a "civil rights protection" measure, not an attack on free speech. The administration's Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism announced the funding freeze, while Harvard's President Alan Garber pledged to fight antisemitism. McMahon indicated openness to negotiations but emphasized the funds would remain frozen until the administration's demands, including ending DEI programs and cooperating with immigration authorities, are met.</p>

            <p>A Maryland judge is demanding the Trump administration return Kilmar Ábrego García, who was mistakenly deported to an El Salvador mega-prison. Ábrego García, who had legal protection from deportation due to potential persecution in El Salvador, was sent there along with other Venezuelans and Salvadorans. El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele refuses to allow his return, despite the US government admitting the deportation was an "administrative error." The Trump administration claims Ábrego García has ties to MS-13, allegations his family disputes, while the judge notes he has no criminal record.</p>

            <p>Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among Latinas, often due to late detection linked to cultural, systemic, and environmental factors. Dense breasts, common in younger women, increase both the risk of developing cancer and the likelihood of it being missed on mammograms. Notification laws requiring providers to inform patients about breast density exist in many states, but their implementation and effectiveness vary. Cuts to cancer research funding and DEI initiatives could further exacerbate health disparities affecting Latinas, highlighting the need for increased awareness, education, and advocacy.</p>

            <p>Following Real Madrid's 5-1 aggregate loss to Arsenal in the Champions League quarter-finals, questions are being raised about the team's future and the leadership of manager Carlo Ancelotti. Real Madrid failed to mount a comeback, losing 2-1 at home in the second leg. Ancelotti acknowledged the team's "dark side" but emphasized the need to focus on other competitions. Spanish football expert Guillem Balague suggests that the squad needs refreshing and that it may be time for Ancelotti to move on.</p>

            <p>Newcastle winger Jacob Murphy is having a breakthrough season at age 30, becoming a key player for the team. Murphy's connection with Alexander Isak has been particularly fruitful, with 11 Premier League assists this season, seven of which have been for Isak. Murphy's goal involvements are higher than several other English players who were in the last England squad. His recent performances have sparked debate about whether he deserves a place in the England squad.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has effectively shut down the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, placing all staff on administrative leave. This move, part of a broader effort to streamline the federal bureaucracy, has drawn criticism from advocates who argue the agency is vital for coordinating and improving the federal response to homelessness. The agency has played a key role in managing homelessness in cities and reducing homelessness among veterans. Critics believe the move will facilitate a shift away from "housing first" policies.</p>

            <p>Several individuals who received pardons or commutations from President Trump have subsequently been rearrested or faced new legal troubles. This includes individuals convicted of crimes related to January 6 and others who received clemency during Trump's first term. Jonathan Braun, who had his sentence commuted for smuggling marijuana, was arrested for assault. This pattern highlights a lack of vetting and a disregard for the pardon process during Trump's administration.</p>

            <p>A federal judge found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt for allegedly defying an order to halt the deportation of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador. Judge James Boasberg stated the government's actions demonstrated a "willful disregard" for his order. The ruling marks a significant rebuke of the Trump administration amid escalating tensions with the federal judiciary. The Trump administration is expected to seek immediate relief from the U.S. Court of Appeals.</p>

            <p>The Chinese embassy in Chile accused the U.S. of "hegemonism" following remarks by Trump's nominee for ambassador to Chile, who suggested limiting China's involvement in Chilean scientific projects. The embassy argued that the U.S. was interfering in Chile's right to choose its international partners and obstructing normal technological cooperation between the two countries. The dispute centers around a collaboration between China's National Astronomical Observatory and Chile's Catholic University of the North.</p>

            <p>Puerto Rico experienced an island-wide blackout, leaving all 1.4 million customers without power ahead of the Easter weekend. The source of the outage was traced to a transmission line in the southern part of the island. Hospitals are operating on generators, and officials estimate restoring power could take up to 48 hours. The blackout has sparked renewed criticism of the power company Luma Energy and calls for the government to cancel its contract.</p>
