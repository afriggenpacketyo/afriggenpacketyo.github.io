        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 4-4 decision due to Justice Amy Coney Barrett's recusal, upheld a lower court's ruling that blocked Oklahoma from establishing the nation's first taxpayer-funded religious charter school. The proposed St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School aimed to integrate Catholic teachings into its curriculum. The deadlock means the Oklahoma Supreme Court's decision stands, preventing the school's establishment, but it sets no nationwide precedent on the issue of states sponsoring religious charter schools, leaving the door open for future consideration. The case highlights the ongoing debate over the separation of church and state in education. </p>

"Treasure" is defined as objects at least 200 years old with significant historical or cultural importance. Devon, Dorset, Norfolk, Suffolk, and Yorkshire are among the counties with the highest number of finds, though new tourism-related fees have been implemented. </p>

          <p>Republicans in the House passed President Trump's tax bill, facing unanimous Democratic opposition and some Republican dissent. The bill includes tax cuts and modifications to social safety net programs. Despite the victory in the House, the bill faces a challenging path in the Senate, where several Republicans have expressed the need for significant changes. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would disproportionately benefit higher-income households. Investors on Wall Street showed concern that the bill's spending would lead to exploding federal deficits. </p>

          <p>A woman was shot and wounded at CIA headquarters after crashing into a gate early Thursday morning. The woman, identified as Monia Spadaro, is being investigated for potential intoxication. The incident prompted a temporary closure of the main gate and occurred hours after a separate shooting involving Israeli Embassy staff in D.C., though there is no evidence linking the two events. The CIA headquarters has been the site of previous security incidents, including a fatal shooting in 1993. </p>

Tyler Glasnow and Blake Snell are sidelined, leaving Yoshinobu Yamamoto as the only reliable starter. The Dodgers face a challenging stretch of games against winning teams, making Ohtani's bat crucial, and the team aims to avoid jeopardizing his offensive capabilities by exposing him to unnecessary risks on the mound.

The new draft includes exemptions for various single-use plastics, particularly those under FDA and USDA jurisdiction, and leaves open the possibility of using chemical recycling. Critics argue these changes undermine the law's original intent to reduce plastic waste and shift financial responsibility to producers.
