          <h2>Expert Argues for Introducing Smartphones to Children as Young as Three</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 06:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to popular movements advocating for delaying smartphone access until middle school, some experts propose a different approach: introducing phones to children as young as three. The article suggests this should be a highly intentional and gradual process, starting with limited functions like a family photo album and slowly adding features like a camera or parent-selected audiobooks. This method aims to make technology a managed, conversational part of a child's development, teaching digital literacy from an early age. Proponents argue this strategy better prepares children for an increasingly tech-dependent world, turning the device into a tool for learning rather than a forbidden fruit.</p>

          <p>A 53-year-old former Royal Marine, Paul Doyle, has pleaded not guilty to 31 charges after allegedly driving his car into crowds celebrating a Liverpool FC victory parade. The incident, which occurred on May 26, resulted in injuries to over 130 people, including children and babies. Doyle faces serious charges, including multiple counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and dangerous driving. His defense team has reported significant difficulties in accessing him in prison to prepare for the trial, citing systemic issues and "impenetrable red tape" that have hindered their ability to review evidence with their client. The case continues to move through the Liverpool Crown Court.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is scheduled to testify before the Senate Finance Committee, where he is expected to face intense questioning regarding recent upheavals at the CDC. The hearing follows the recent ousting of CDC Director Susan Monarez and the subsequent resignation of four top officials in protest of Kennedy's policy changes. Lawmakers are anticipated to press Kennedy on the FDA's decision to narrow access to the COVID-19 vaccine and his replacement of the entire CDC vaccine advisory committee. While Kennedy aims to focus on his "Make America Healthy Again" agenda, the turmoil and his approach to vaccine science will likely dominate the proceedings.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic accident in Lisbon has resulted in the deaths of 17 people after one of the city's historic funiculars, the Elevador da Gloria, derailed and crashed into a building. The incident, which also left 21 people injured, including multiple foreign tourists, has been described as an unprecedented tragedy for the Portuguese capital. The city has declared three days of mourning, and the national government has marked a national day of mourning. While the exact cause is still under investigation, speculation points towards a potential cable snap on the century-old tram system. All other funiculars in the city have been suspended pending safety inspections.</p>

          <p>As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with European leaders in Paris, Russia's Foreign Ministry issued a stern warning against the deployment of any Western troops in Ukraine as part of a future peace agreement. Moscow stated it would not accept foreign intervention and views Ukraine as a "testing ground" for Western military technology. The meeting in Paris, involving the "Coalition of the Willing," is part of ongoing discussions about security guarantees for Kyiv. Following the European talks, the leaders are scheduled to speak with U.S. President Donald Trump, who recently imposed tariffs on India for its purchases of Russian energy and military equipment.</p>

          <p>An exclusive report details how the Trump administration and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have allegedly buried a major government-commissioned study confirming the link between alcohol consumption and cancer. The "Alcohol Intake and Health Study," initiated under the Biden administration, found that health risks begin at low levels of drinking and increase sharply with consumption. Despite its intention to inform new federal dietary guidelines, the final report was never published after being submitted in March. This suppression is seen by public health advocates as a victory for the alcohol industry, which fears increased public knowledge about the health risks associated with its products.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court's upcoming term is expected to be dominated by cases questioning the scope of President Donald Trump's executive power. Several legal challenges are advancing toward the high court concerning the administration's actions on sweeping tariffs, immigration policies, and the attempted firing of a Federal Reserve governor. These cases test the legal justifications for Trump's expansive use of presidential authority, such as invoking emergency powers to impose tariffs and using a 1798 law for deportations. The court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, has previously sided with the administration on emergency requests, and its rulings will have significant implications for the balance of power.</p>

          <p>FIFA has confirmed it will use a dynamic pricing model for the 2026 World Cup tickets, a move that critics are calling a betrayal of fans. This model allows ticket prices to fluctuate based on demand, which will likely cause costs to soar after the initial lottery, as the tournament draw occurs months after the first sales. The article argues that by absorbing the secondary resale market, FIFA is prioritizing profit maximization over its stated mission of growing the game globally. This strategy, common in North America, is seen as another instance of the governing body treating fans as customers to be exploited rather than as integral parts of the sport.</p>

An education researcher explains that cheating has long been prevalent, with studies from before the AI era showing high percentages of students engaging in such behaviors. Early data indicates that while some students now use AI to write entire papers, AI has primarily captured a share of the existing market for plagiarism and unauthorized assistance. The article argues for a more nuanced conversation, focusing on why students cheat and how to adapt educational goals for an AI-filled future.</p>

While she has personally disagreed with Powell's policies, she emphasizes that she has never questioned the Fed's authority to make decisions based on its best judgment for the country.</p>

          <h2>Experts Evaluate the Scientific Evidence Behind Creatine Supplement Claims</h2>

          <p>Amid rising popularity on social media, the article examines the scientific backing for the benefits of creatine supplements. Decades of research confirm that creatine monohydrate can help increase lean muscle mass and improve athletic performance, particularly in activities requiring short bursts of energy. However, these benefits are contingent on combining the supplement with resistance training. While there is emerging but less conclusive evidence for other claims, such as improved bone health and cognitive function, experts consider creatine to be very safe for most adults. They advise consumers to choose pure creatine monohydrate products certified by third-party programs to avoid adulterated supplements.</p>

          <p>World number one Aryna Sabalenka has demonstrated remarkable consistency, reaching the semi-finals in 12 of her last 13 Grand Slam tournaments, a feat she continues at the US Open where she will face Jessica Pegula. However, her powerful style has often been undermined by mental errors at critical moments, resulting in only three titles from those deep runs. This year, she has fallen short in the final or semi-final of all three previous majors. To overcome this hurdle, Sabalenka has added doubles champion Max Mirnyi to her coaching team to help manage her emotions and maintain composure during high-pressure situations.</p>

          <p>Luxury automaker Porsche is set to be removed from Germany's prestigious DAX index of blue-chip companies on September 22, following a significant decline in its share price. The company's stock has fallen by over a third in the past year, with performance heavily impacted by U.S. tariffs on European autos, weakening demand in China, and a slow transition to electric vehicles. Porsche, which will move to the mid-cap MDAX index, has repeatedly lowered its financial outlook due to these pressures. CEO Oliver Blume stated the company aims to return to the DAX as soon as possible, attributing the relegation to technical factors.</p>

The shutdown is being hailed as a major victory for sports leagues and broadcasters who lose significant revenue to such large-scale piracy.

An independent commission cleared him of all four charges, and newly published written reasons criticized the FA's investigation, particularly its reliance on an internal investigator rather than an independent betting data expert.

          <p>A recent poll reveals widespread discontent among German voters with Chancellor Friedrich Merz's coalition government, with 75% of respondents dissatisfied with its performance. The survey highlights public frustration with infighting between Merz's conservative CDU/CSU bloc and their Social Democrat (SPD) partners, particularly over budget deficits and social welfare reforms. While Merz insists on cuts to the welfare state, SPD leaders have strongly pushed back. This internal conflict mirrors the issues that led to the collapse of the previous government. The poll also shows the far-right AfD gaining ground, reaching a new high of 25% support among voters.</p>

Antoni, a vocal critic of the bureau from the conservative Heritage Foundation, as her replacement. While the day-to-day operations of the BLS are conducted by career civil servants, the move is seen as an unprecedented challenge to the agency's independence and credibility, risking public confusion and mistrust in vital economic indicators.</p>

Donating a functional beater to a charity can provide transportation for a family in need. Alternatively, recycling through certified programs like SHiFT ensures that high-polluting engines are taken off the road while salvaging valuable parts for reuse and remanufacturing, minimizing landfill waste and turning an old car into a source of recycled materials.</p>
