        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy experienced a 0.7% expansion in the first three months of the year, surpassing analyst expectations of 0.6%. According to the Office for National Statistics, this growth was primarily fueled by the services sector, with significant contributions from production. Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighted that the UK's economic performance outpaced that of the US, Canada, France, Italy, and Germany during this period, indicating a positive trajectory for the nation's economy. However, shadow chancellor Mel Stride criticized the rise in employers' National Insurance payments, cautioning that such measures could potentially jeopardize the progress achieved.</p>

          <p>Hopes for direct peace negotiations between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Turkey were dashed as both Putin and former U.S. President Donald Trump decided to skip the meeting. Zelenskyy had expressed reluctance to participate without Putin's presence, while Trump had previously urged Ukraine to engage in immediate discussions with Russia. The Russian delegation will be led by Vladimir Medinsky, a hard-line aide to Putin, while the U.S. will send envoys Steve Witkoff, Keith Kellogg, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The uncertainty surrounding the talks raises questions about the future of negotiations and potential resolutions to the conflict.</p>

          <p>A seemingly ordinary manuscript housed in Harvard Law School's library for eight decades has been identified as an original 1300 version of the Magna Carta, a foundational document of modern liberties. Two British academics, David Carpenter and Nicholas Vincent, made the discovery while researching digital images of the manuscript. The document, purchased for a mere $27.50 after World War II, is now recognized as one of only seven originals from that date still in existence. This discovery underscores the importance of preserving and studying historical documents, especially in times when fundamental freedoms are under threat.</p>

          <p>A group of 21 economies, including the United States and China, has issued a warning about a potential slowdown in their collective growth, attributing the risk to trade tensions and policy uncertainty. The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forecasts a drop in growth to 2.6% in 2025, down from 3.6% in the previous year. Carlos Kuriyama, Director of the APEC Policy Support Unit, emphasized that the current environment of tariff hikes and retaliatory measures is not conducive to trade, leading to delayed investments and product launches. Restoring confidence in trade requires easing tensions, strengthening supply chains, and improving transparency in trade rules.</p>

          <p>Alabama lawmakers have approved legislation that provides enhanced legal protections for police officers, establishing legal standards for the use of force and providing for an immunity hearing. Republicans argue the bill provides a clear legal framework and support for law enforcement, while Democrats express concerns that it could lead to excessive force, particularly against Black individuals. The bill allows an immunity hearing where a judge will decide if a case can proceed based on whether the officer acted recklessly outside the scope of law enforcement duties. Governor Kay Ivey has stated her intention to sign the bill into law, underscoring the state's support for law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economic growth, driven by a surge in pharmaceutical exports, is expected to moderate in the coming years, according to the International Monetary Fund. Despite the looming threat of U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry, Denmark is expected to be shielded as most Danish drug products are neither produced in the country nor cross its borders. The IMF noted that Danish drugmakers rely on a "merchanting and processing" system, contracting manufacturers in other countries for production and shipment. The fund projects medium-term growth at around 1.5%, reflecting a maturing pharmaceutical sector and a declining working-age population.</p>

Questions remain about the surrender of weapons, the fate of PKK members, and the potential for a new organization to take its place.

This decision is driven by a poor harvest in 2023 and increased rice consumption due to a surge in foreign tourists.

          <p>Ford is recalling nearly 274,000 Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs in the U.S. due to a potential defect that may cause a loss of brake function. The front brake lines in these vehicles may come into contact with the engine air cleaner outlet pipe, leading to a brake fluid leak. Ford is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to this recall, but has received warranty reports of brake line leaks. Dealers will inspect and replace the brake line or air cleaner outlet pipe if necessary, free of charge, to address the issue.</p>

          <p>Police are conducting a door-to-door DNA search in east London to identify the parents of three abandoned newborns, including baby Elsa, who was found in January 2024. DNA tests revealed Elsa to be the sibling of two other babies found in similar circumstances in 2017 and 2019. Detectives are focusing on about 400 nearby houses and contacting people from the national DNA database who may share familial DNA with the children's mother. Police believe the mother may be restrained or have mental or physical health problems, leading to the abandonment of the babies.</p>

The conflict was triggered by alleged terrorist attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir, leading to retaliatory strikes and escalating tensions. The Trump administration intervened to de-escalate the situation, underscoring the global implications of conflict between nuclear powers and the need for continued diplomatic efforts to reduce risks.</p>

          <p>The average cost of private school education has increased by 22.6% in the last year, surpassing government estimates, following the introduction of VAT on fees. The Independent Schools Council (ISC) anticipates a decline in private school enrollment due to the increased costs. The average termly fee for a day school in January was Â£7,382, including 20% VAT. The government predicted fees would increase by about 10%, but the ISC argues that the sector has been hit by multiple financial changes, leading to higher costs for parents.</p>
