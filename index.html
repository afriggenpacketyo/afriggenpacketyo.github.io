          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs rejected a plea deal during a pre-trial hearing in New York City, where he faces sex trafficking and racketeering charges. Jury selection is scheduled to begin next week, with opening statements expected on May 12. Combs has pleaded not guilty to five counts, including transportation for prostitution and sex trafficking, and could face decades in prison if convicted. The defense team has also raised concerns about the behavior of an alleged victim's attorney, who they claim is attempting to bolster her client's credibility through media interviews. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting is facing criticism after his department reduced guaranteed funding for maternity safety improvements. Campaigners and the Royal College of Midwives have voiced strong objections, with some calling the decision a "betrayal" and a "wrecking ball" to maternity safety. The changes mean that only £2 million of the initially promised £95 million will be specifically allocated to maternity care this year, with the rest distributed among Integrated Care Boards to allocate as they see fit. Concerns are rising that this shift will lead to budget cuts and undermine progress made in improving maternity services.</p>

          <p>Defense attorneys for Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, are seeking to dismiss the state murder indictment against him, citing double jeopardy and other alleged violations. The attorneys argue that the concurrent state and federal prosecutions violate Mangione's constitutional rights. They are also challenging the terrorism upgrade added by the Manhattan district attorney's office. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to both the state charges and federal charges, which could result in the death penalty if he is convicted.</p>

Lyons emphasized that ICE will continue to prioritize the removal of violent gang members, sexual offenders, and fentanyl traffickers.

          <p>Migrant crossings at the U.S. southern border have remained at historically low levels for three months following President Trump's immigration crackdown. Border Patrol agents recorded approximately 8,400 apprehensions in April, consistent with the numbers from February and March. This represents a significant decrease compared to the record-breaking influx experienced under the Biden administration. The Trump administration attributes this decline to its strict immigration policies, including the near-closure of the asylum system and the deployment of additional troops to the border. Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh of the Migration Policy Institute suggests that the administration's tough rhetoric and actions are deterring migrants from attempting to cross the border.</p>

          <p>A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild. Due to a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding programme, the cat from Newquay Zoo has been moved to Germany's Black Forest, where it will be monitored in an enclosure to assess its survival skills. The goal is to introduce new cats to increase genetic diversity, particularly in central Europe, where habitat fragmentation has led to inbreeding. If successful, this initiative could pave the way for the reintroduction of lynx to the UK, where they were driven to extinction centuries ago.</p>

The move is aimed at tackling the illegal importation of synthetic opioids and supporting American businesses.

          <p>Donald Trump's return to power is casting a shadow over Australia's upcoming federal election, forcing candidates to address the country's relationship with the US. While domestic issues like cost-of-living and healthcare dominate the campaign, the unpredictable nature of a Trump presidency is raising questions about Australia's role in the world. The Labor Party's Anthony Albanese is attempting to reassure voters of stability and alliance strength amid growing concerns about Trump's policies and potential impact on Australia's security and trade relationships. A recent poll indicated that 60% of Australians believe Trump's victory is bad for the country.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) reported slower-than-expected growth in the first quarter, marking the third straight revenue miss. Revenue at AWS increased 17% to $29.27 billion, falling short of analysts' expectations. Despite the miss, AWS operating income totaled $11.55 billion, and the segment's operating margin was the widest it has been since 2014. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated that the cost of AI for customers will decrease over time, partly due to Amazon's custom chips. AWS has also been diversifying away from China for components over the past six years.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board argues that President Trump's first 100 days have damaged American democracy more than anything since the end of Reconstruction. The board asserts that Trump is attempting to establish a presidency unchecked by Congress or the courts, potentially altering the fundamental character of American government. They call for a broad coalition of Americans to oppose Trump's actions while acknowledging the legitimacy of his presidency and the legality of some of his policies. The editorial identifies five pillars of American democracy under attack: separation of powers, due process, equal justice under law, free speech and freedom of the press, and government for the people.</p>

The wrongful death claim filed with the federal government alleges that CBP failed to provide proper medical care to Anadith, who had sickle cell disease and a heart condition. The family's lawyers argue that Anadith's death highlights systemic problems within border facilities and medical care, and that the family hopes to ensure accountability and transparency in CBP facilities.</p>

          <p>The Chamber of Commerce is requesting the Trump administration to grant an "automatic exclusion" from new tariffs for U.S. small businesses that import goods from abroad. In a letter to the Treasury Secretary, the Chamber's president, Suzanne Clark, argues that small businesses lack the financial reserves to withstand increased tariffs. Economists warn that the Trump administration's tariff policies are already impacting economic growth and raising the risk of a recession. Senator Ed Markey has also called on the Small Business Administration to grant tariff exemptions to Main Street enterprises.</p>
