          <p>Recently released doorbell camera footage appears to show Jihad Al-Shamie, the individual responsible for a terror attack at a Manchester synagogue. The video captures a man and a car matching descriptions of the attacker and his vehicle just minutes before he drove into worshippers, killing two men, Melvin Cravitz and Adrian Daulby. The attack, which occurred on Yom Kippur, is being investigated by Greater Manchester Police, who have detained four individuals on terror offenses. Three other people remain hospitalized following the incident.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has entered into a major partnership with OpenAI, which could see the AI firm acquire up to a 10% stake in the chipmaker. As part of the deal, OpenAI will deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD's Instinct GPUs over several years, a move that sent AMD's stock price up by over 25% in premarket trading. The agreement, valued in the billions, positions AMD as a key hardware supplier for OpenAI, helping to diversify the AI company's supply chain.

          <p>A rare 4,000-year-old limestone relief has been stolen from a tomb in Egypt's Saqqara Necropolis, marking the second significant antiquity theft in recent weeks. The artifact, depicting ancient Egyptian seasons, was seemingly cut from the wall of a sealed tomb belonging to a high-ranking official named Khenti Ka. This incident follows the recent theft and melting down of a 3,000-year-old golden bracelet from the Egyptian Museum. The disappearance raises concerns about the security of Egypt's historical treasures ahead of the opening of the new Grand Egyptian Museum.</p>

The attack affected the company's ordering and delivery systems, forcing a production halt and causing stock shortages at major retailers. While the breweries are not yet at full capacity, production of the popular Asahi Super Dry beer has resumed, along with some food and soft drink manufacturing. The incident underscores the growing threat of cyberattacks on major corporate operations, affecting supply chains and product availability.</p>

          <p>Turkey, particularly Istanbul, has become a leading international destination for hair transplant procedures, attracting around one million medical tourists in 2022 for this surgery alone. The industry's boom is driven by significantly lower costs compared to the U.S. and Europe, with clinics offering all-inclusive packages that bundle travel and accommodation. While the affordability and social media promotion have normalized the procedure, concerns have been raised about "black market clinics" and unlicensed practitioners, which pose risks of botched results and health complications. The Turkish Health Ministry has acknowledged these issues and pledged stricter oversight.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, alleging a "pattern or practice" of illegally delaying or denying concealed carry weapon (CCW) permits. The lawsuit, part of a broader clash between the Trump administration and Democrat-led cities, claims that lengthy wait times, sometimes years long, infringe upon citizens' Second Amendment rights amid rising crime rates. Officials like Attorney General Pam Bondi argue that the county is unconstitutionally blocking law-abiding citizens from self-defense. The sheriff's department refutes the claims, stating it has increased the rate of permit issuance.</p>

Collins describes a "wealth defense industry" of lawyers and accountants who help the ultra-rich minimize taxes and use their immense fortunes to capture political influence. The book also examines "hyper-extraction," where private equity, controlled by billionaires, squeezes profits from essential sectors like healthcare and housing, directly increasing costs for ordinary people.

          <p>The Trump administration is set to eliminate the "roadless rule," a two-decade-old regulation that has protected 58 million acres of pristine national forests from road construction, drilling, and logging. The move is part of a broader push to increase timber harvesting from federal lands, which President Trump argues will generate revenue. Critics and former U.S. Forest Service officials warn that rescinding the rule threatens critical ecosystems, clean drinking water sources for millions of Americans, and vital carbon stores. They argue the plan is economically and environmentally senseless, as it would require building expensive new roads.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court's 2024 ruling granting former presidents broad immunity for official acts could have significant consequences for international law and justice. Historically, the legal trend has moved away from absolute immunity, particularly for international crimes like torture, as established in the 1998 case against former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. However, the U.S. court's decision creates a new precedent that could protect former American leaders from prosecution for such crimes and undermine U.S. efforts to hold other foreign leaders accountable. This shift could weaken the global framework for prosecuting atrocities.</p>

          <p>The animated film "KPop Demon Hunters" has become a surprise cultural phenomenon and Netflix's most-watched movie of all time, with its soundtrack dominating the Billboard charts. The movie follows a K-pop girl group who secretly fight demons with their music, a premise that was initially passed on by its production studio, Sony. Analysts attribute its success to its authentic celebration of K-pop culture, treating it as a global norm rather than an exotic subculture. The film's massive appeal demonstrates the global power and reach of Korean cultural exports.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw, in his final season, is drawing parallels to the end of fellow Hall of Famer Greg Maddux's career. Seventeen years ago, a rookie Kershaw and a veteran Maddux were both in the Dodgers' postseason bullpen. Now, as Kershaw concludes his own celebrated career, he has also been moved to a relief role for the playoffs, despite still being an effective pitcher. Team management noted that Kershaw embraced the move, prioritizing the team's chances to win over a starting role, a testament to his professionalism as he nears retirement.</p>

          <p>Shares in luxury carmaker Aston Martin plunged by 10% after the company issued a new profit warning, citing uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and a challenging industry outlook. The company now expects its 2025 wholesale volumes to decrease and no longer anticipates generating positive free cash flow in the second half of the year. Aston Martin specifically noted that the quota mechanism in the U.S.-U.K. trade deal adds complexity and limits its ability to forecast accurately. The company has called on the U.K. government to provide more support for small-volume manufacturers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has proposed a major overhaul of the house-buying system in England and Wales, aiming to reduce costs, delays, and the number of failed sales. Under the new plans, sellers would be legally required to provide key property information upfront, and the introduction of binding contracts could prevent last-minute withdrawals. The government estimates these changes could save first-time buyers an average of £710 and shorten the transaction time by four weeks. The proposals draw inspiration from the Scottish system, which is considered faster and more transparent.</p>

As part of the acquisition, Weiss, a prominent center-right commentator and critic of "woke" ideology, is slated for a high-level editorial position at CBS News, potentially as editor-in-chief. Since leaving The New York Times, Weiss has built The Free Press into a highly successful platform for a faction of disillusioned liberals and centrists.
