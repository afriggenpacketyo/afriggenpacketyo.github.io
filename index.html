          <p>Grammy-winning artist Chris Brown has pleaded not guilty to two new charges, including assault causing actual bodily harm, related to an incident at a London nightclub in 2023. The charges stem from the alleged beating of a music producer with a bottle, an event which prosecutors say was captured on surveillance video. Brown, who was previously released on bail, appeared in court for the hearing while he continues his international music tour. His co-defendant, Omololu Akinlolu, also denied the charge of actual bodily harm.</p>

          <p>The Unite union has suspended the membership of UK Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner amid an escalating dispute over long-running bin strikes in Birmingham. The union, a major donor to the Labour Party, took action after Rayner encouraged striking workers to accept a deal from the Labour-run city council. This move signals a significant rift between the union and senior Labour leadership, with Unite stating it will now re-examine its broader relationship with the party. The strikes began in January over proposed role changes.</p>

          <p>German backpacker Carolina Wilga, 26, has been found alive after being missing for 12 days in the remote Australian Outback. Her abandoned van was discovered a day earlier in a vast nature reserve, where it had apparently become stuck in mud. A member of the public found Wilga wandering on a trail in what police described as a "fragile" state but without serious injuries. Authorities called her survival in the hostile environment a miracle, given the challenging conditions and vast search area.</p>

          <p>In a significant move toward peace, fighters from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) have begun a disarmament process, holding a ceremony in Iraqi Kurdistan where they symbolically burned their weapons. This step follows a call from their imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, to end the 40-year armed conflict against the Turkish state and transition to democratic politics. The Turkish government has praised the event as a "critical threshold" in achieving a lasting peace in the region.</p>

          <p>Sociological research reveals that Germany's top corporate positions are overwhelmingly held by individuals from the country's wealthiest circles, with over 80% of executives coming from the top 3-4% of the population. The study shows that social origin is a more powerful predictor of career success than merit, as children of business executives are 17 times more likely to join a major company's board than working-class children with the same Ph.D. This highlights a persistent lack of social mobility in Germany's business world.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a prototype of a new magnetic levitation (maglev) train capable of reaching speeds of 600 km/h (373 mph). Developed by the China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC), the train is designed to fill the speed gap between current high-speed rail and aviation. Once operational, it could drastically reduce travel times, cutting the 1,200km journey between Beijing and Shanghai from 5.5 hours to just 2.5 hours, redefining long-distance transport within the country.</p>

          <p>Over 22 million Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace could face sharp premium increases in 2026. Enhanced premium tax credits, which have lowered costs since 2021, are set to expire at the end of 2025 and were not extended in the latest tax bill. Health policy experts warn that if the subsidies lapse, the average enrollee could see their out-of-pocket premium costs rise by more than 75%, potentially leaving millions uninsured.
