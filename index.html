          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addressed Asian military officials at the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, warning of an "imminent" threat from China to Taiwan. Hegseth urged Asian countries to increase defense spending and collaborate with the US to deter potential war. He characterized China as a hegemonic power seeking to dominate Asia, citing territorial disputes in the South China Sea and a potential 2027 deadline for China's military to be capable of invading Taiwan. Hegseth emphasized the US does not seek conflict but will ensure China cannot dominate its allies, advocating for a strong deterrent shield and warning against economic ties with China that could be used as leverage.</p>

          <p>US immigration authorities are collecting DNA information from migrants, including children, and uploading it to a national criminal database. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) is creating detailed DNA profiles on migrants that will be permanently searchable by law enforcement, leading to concerns about genetic surveillance. Experts report that CBP has added over 1.5 million DNA profiles to the Combined DNA Index System (Codis) since 2020, a 5,000% increase. Critics argue the program reinforces harmful narratives about immigrants and intensifies policing practices targeting immigrant communities, raising privacy concerns.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, accused of the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, is scheduled for trial in August, facing a potential death sentence. The case has encountered obstacles, including prosecutors' failure to establish a motive and intense media coverage, which Kohberger's attorneys claim is prejudicial. Recent court rulings have gone against Kohberger, allowing evidence such as a 911 call, a description of a man with ‚Äúbushy eyebrows,‚Äù and his Amazon shopping history to be presented at trial. The defense argues there is no motive because Kohberger did not commit the crime.</p>

          <p>Karla Flores, 19, was diagnosed with a chordoma wrapped around her brain stem, and during an MRI before surgery, doctors discovered a second chordoma on her spine. Neurosurgeon Dr. Mohammed Labib developed a unique surgical plan to remove the spinal tumor through her eye, a first-of-its-kind procedure. The surgery, called the "third nostril" approach, involved removing part of Flores' eye socket and cheekbone to access the tumor. After a 20-hour operation, the chordoma was successfully removed, and Flores is now cancer-free.</p>

          <p>Several major retailers, including Costco, Best Buy, Walmart, and Target, have announced price increases or plans to do so to offset the impact of tariffs. President Trump's trade policy has created uncertainty for retailers as they manage their supply chains. Some companies have explicitly cited tariffs as the reason for price hikes, while others have blamed "macroeconomic uncertainty." Economists agree that tariffs are inflationary and the cost will likely be passed on to consumers, with many retailers reducing or withdrawing their full-year guidance due to tariffs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the 'Mission: Impossible' franchise argues that its early films, particularly the first four, were defined by their lack of continuity and strong authorial styles, which allowed for creative freedom and unpredictability. Directors like Brian De Palma, John Woo, J.J. Abrams, and Brad Bird were given the space to put their own stamp on the series. In contrast, later installments have become more focused on franchise building and interconnected storylines, sacrificing the unique appeal of the earlier films. The article suggests that the franchise's initial inconsistency proves the value of ignoring brand-building pressures.</p>

While President Vladimir Putin has acknowledged the tragic period of Stalinist purges, an estimated 105 statues honoring the dictator have been erected since he came to power.

          <p>Consumers are taking a more frugal approach to summer vacations due to economic uncertainties. While more people plan to travel compared to last year, spending plans have been scaled back after President Trump announced widescale tariffs and the stock market dropped. The average summer travel budget initially grew by 21% year over year but declined to 13% in a second survey. Travel costs have decreased, with hotel room rates, rental car costs, and airfares all down, but inflation is causing people to spend more overall, potentially reducing funds available for travel.</p>
