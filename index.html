          <p>England's women's cricket team began their World Cup campaign with a decisive 10-wicket victory over South Africa in Guwahati. The English bowlers, led by spinner Linsey Smith, dismissed South Africa for a mere 69 runs, their third-lowest total in one-day international history. England's openers, Amy Jones and Tammy Beaumont, comfortably reached the target, providing a significant boost to their net run-rate. This commanding win places England in a strong position early in the tournament.</p>

A former chief nurse for the NHS, Mullally became the Bishop of London in 2018 and will now succeed Justin Welby, who resigned following a safeguarding scandal. In her first statement, she addressed the recent synagogue attack in Manchester and pledged to confront the church's past safeguarding failures. Her appointment marks a significant moment for the Church and the global Anglican Communion.</p>

          <p>Flight operations at Germany's Munich airport were temporarily suspended after sightings of unidentified drones, affecting nearly 3,000 passengers. This incident coincided with Belgian defense officials investigating multiple drone sightings over the Elsenborn military base near the German border. These events are the latest in a series of similar incursions near critical infrastructure in Western Europe over the past month. European leaders have expressed concern, with widespread suspicion that Russia may be responsible for probing NATO's security and air defenses.</p>

          <p>A significant fire erupted at the Chevron oil refinery in El Segundo, Los Angeles County, following reports of an explosion on Thursday night. Fire crews responded quickly and contained the blaze to one area of the facility, with no injuries immediately reported. While no evacuations were ordered, officials advised residents to stay indoors due to potential impacts on air quality, although initial readings showed no elevated levels of toxins. The El Segundo refinery is the largest on the U.S. West Coast, but the fire did not affect operations at the nearby Los Angeles International Airport.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen $2.1 billion in federal funding for two major Chicago Transit Authority projects, the Red Line Extension and the Red and Purple Modernization. Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought stated the hold was to ensure funds are not used for "race-based contracting." This action follows similar freezes on funding for projects in New York and climate-related initiatives in states won by Democrats. The move, occurring during a government shutdown, is seen by critics as targeting cities and states led by political opponents.</p>

For decades, the scene was associated with gang culture and was forced indoors during periods of intense cartel violence.

          <p>A new report from the EAT-Lancet Commission asserts that even with a full transition away from fossil fuels, emissions from the global food system will still push global temperatures past the critical 1.5°C threshold. The research concludes that the most effective way to prevent this is for people in wealthier countries to adopt more plant-based diets and consume less meat and dairy. According to the report, diets in the richest 30% of the global population contribute to over 70% of the food system's environmental pressures. The commission advocates for policy changes to reform food systems.</p>

          <p>Physical music formats like vinyl records are exempt from the Trump administration's recent rollback of the "de minimis" rule, which now applies tariffs to many imported goods valued under $800. This protection comes from the Berman Amendment, a Cold War-era law that prevents the regulation of "informational materials." The exemption is a significant relief for the booming vinyl record industry, which has seen massive growth driven by artists like Taylor Swift. While fans and labels benefit, some U.S.-based manufacturers argue that applying tariffs to foreign-pressed records would support domestic jobs.</p>

          <p>A growing number of recent college graduates in the U.S. are struggling to find full-time employment, feeling the effects of a weakening white-collar labor market. Federal data shows the unemployment rate for "new entrants" to the workforce has reached a nine-year high, with the gap between unemployment for those with and without bachelor's degrees shrinking. This trend, attributed to a "low-hiring environment" and increased competition, is forcing many young adults to move back home with their parents. The rise of AI and its potential to automate entry-level roles has added to the anxiety for this generation.</p>

          <p>An investigation by DW and De Groene Amsterdammer indicates that Volkswagen's electric vehicle supply chain likely includes "conflict minerals" sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The report found that at least six smelters linked to the conflict mineral trade, which helps fund violent groups in the DRC, appear in VW's own raw materials report. While Volkswagen is the only major European carmaker to provide such transparency, the findings raise serious questions about the ethics of its supply chain.

The bill mandates a 10-year sentence for those whose subsequent crime is punishable by up to two years in prison. While proponents call it a necessary deterrent, criminal justice reform groups argue it is an impractical and draconian measure that would lead to mass incarceration.
