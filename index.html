          <p>London-based Anglo American has agreed to a merger with Canada's Teck Resources, forming a new entity named Anglo Teck that will become one of the world's top five copper producers. The combined company will be headquartered in Canada, with Anglo American shareholders owning approximately 62.4% and Teck shareholders holding the rest. This strategic move is positioned as a merger of equals aimed at creating a global champion in critical minerals with strong Canadian leadership.

          <p>Donald Trump has shifted his stance to publicly defend the importance and effectiveness of certain vaccines, creating a notable break with his Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This move is seen as a response to intense political pressure and negative publicity following a tense Senate hearing where Kennedy's anti-vaccine views were heavily criticized by Republican senators. Trump's defense of vaccines also aligns with protecting the legacy of Operation Warp Speed, the rapid COVID-19 vaccine development program, which is considered a major achievement of his first presidential term.</p>

          <p>Paris-based artificial intelligence startup Mistral AI has achieved a valuation of nearly $14 billion following a new Series C funding round. Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML was the lead investor, injecting 1.3 billion euros to secure an 11% stake in the company. This major investment, which also included contributions from existing backers like Nvidia and Andreessen Horowitz, more than doubles Mistral's previous valuation. The funding highlights the continued investor enthusiasm for the AI sector and solidifies Mistral's position as a significant European competitor to American firms like OpenAI.

          <p>Thailand's Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra must serve a one-year prison term for past convictions of corruption and abuse of power. The court determined that his six-month stay in a police hospital after his return from exile in 2023 was unlawful and did not count as time served. The decision is a significant development for the influential political dynasty, especially after his daughter Paetongtarn was recently removed as prime minister. Thaksin, who had his original eight-year sentence commuted by the king, is now expected to be transferred to Bangkok Remand Prison.</p>

          <p>A long-standing succession dispute within the Murdoch family has been resolved, with an agreement ensuring that Rupert Murdoch's son, Lachlan, will take control of the media empire. The deal establishes a new trust controlled by Lachlan, while his more politically moderate siblings—Prudence, Elisabeth, and James—will sell their shares in Fox and News Corp and cease to be beneficiaries of any trust with company shares. This resolution ends all litigation over the family's trust and solidifies the ongoing conservative direction of prominent outlets like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal after Rupert Murdoch's eventual passing.</p>

It cites the Trump administration's efforts to remove "divisive" exhibits from museums and Reform UK's call for a more "patriotic" curriculum as examples of erasing historical context around issues like racial injustice and imperialism. The author contends that this historical revisionism is a deliberate strategy to dismantle the democratic and social protections established in the 20th century and to justify contemporary policies such as mass deportations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has announced an enhanced immigration enforcement action in Chicago, dubbed "Operation Midway Blitz," which it says will target "the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens." The move follows a social media post from President Trump threatening the city with a military-style operation. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker have condemned the action, stating they received no prior notice and accusing the administration of using fear tactics for political purposes rather than coordinating on public safety.</p>
