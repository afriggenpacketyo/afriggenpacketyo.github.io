          <p>A SkyWest flight carrying 76 passengers made an abrupt, sharp turn to avoid a B-52 bomber that was unexpectedly in its flight path near Minot, North Dakota. The bomber was conducting a pre-approved flyover for the state fair, but the commercial pilot reported not being notified of its presence. Passengers described the maneuver as feeling like a roller coaster, and the pilot later apologized for the aggressive turn, stating it was the safest course of action. The Federal Aviation Administration is now investigating the incident to determine how close the two aircraft came to each other.</p>

          <p>The executive director of the Mercator Institute for China Studies (Merics), a prominent German think tank, recently completed a visit to Beijing after being sanctioned by China four years ago. Mikko Huotari's trip, made at the invitation of a Chinese think tank, suggests a possible easing of travel restrictions imposed on the organization. European leaders have consistently urged Beijing to lift these sanctions, which have prevented Merics researchers from traveling to China. The visit is being viewed as a positive step toward re-establishing engagement and dialogue between European and Chinese researchers and policy experts.</p>

          <h2>MIT Researchers Develop Advanced Bionic Knee for Above-the-Knee Amputees</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 15:00:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at MIT have created a groundbreaking bionic knee system that anchors directly to an amputee's femur, offering more natural and intuitive movement. The technology, called e-OPRA, integrates with reconnected muscle pairs, allowing the robotic limb to respond to the user's intended movements in real-time. This direct bone and muscle connection bypasses the discomfort and instability of traditional socket-based prosthetics. Trial participants demonstrated improved mobility, such as climbing stairs and kicking a ball with ease, and reported feeling that the prosthesis was a true part of their body, enhancing their sense of control and wholeness.</p>

Negotiations over the transfer's finer points, particularly add-on payments, have slightly delayed the announcement. The 27-year-old Swedish international has already agreed to personal terms and a five-year contract with the London-based club. Gyokeres has been a prolific goal-scorer in Portugal, and his signing is seen as a key move by manager Mikel Arteta to bolster Arsenal's attacking options for the upcoming season after a drawn-out search for an elite center-forward.</p>

          <p>While interest rates for certificates of deposit (CDs) have declined from their peak a year ago, they still offer significant returns for savers seeking a predictable investment. A comparison shows that a $20,000 CD opened in 2024 with higher rates would have earned considerably more than one opened today, with the difference amounting to over $1,000 for a 3-year term. However, current rates remain exponentially higher than those from the early 2020s, making CDs an attractive option for risk-averse savers.

The author argues that this strategy of offering limited support while creating obstacles undermines Ukraine's ability to achieve a decisive victory.

          <p>For the first time since 2017, the percentage of working Americans with a side hustle has decreased, according to a new Bankrate survey. The report found that 27% of workers have a second income stream, down from 36% in 2024, a shift attributed to a solid job market and wage growth that has outpaced inflation. This suggests that fewer people feel the need to supplement their primary income to cover basic living expenses. However, economists note that if economic conditions worsen or inflation rises, the trend could reverse, particularly among younger demographics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>San Francisco is moving forward with a policy to effectively ban people from living in RVs by imposing strict new citywide parking limits. The rule, which is up for final approval, would establish a two-hour parking limit for vehicles over 22 feet long. The city is also creating a permit program for current RV residents, exempting them from the limits if they agree to work with outreach staff to find traditional housing and eventually sell their vehicles to the city. While proponents say the plan is necessary to clean up streets, critics argue it is cruel and lacks sufficient housing solutions for those who will be displaced.</p>

          <p>This opinion article laments the announced cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," framing it as a significant loss for television and political discourse. The author argues that while CBS cites financial reasons, the timing, just days after Colbert criticized parent company Paramount's legal settlement with Donald Trump, is suspect. The piece contends that Colbert's show served a vital function in the Trump era by providing a mainstream platform for moral outrage and calling out falsehoods, a role traditional news often struggles to fill. Its departure is seen as a sign of corporate fecklessness and a blow to independent political comedy.</p>

His hardline stance and rejection of ceasefire agreements have been blamed for escalating tit-for-tat violence between Druze and Bedouin communities.

          <p>This analysis by Jeremy Bowen argues that nearly two years into the war in Gaza, Israel is facing increasing isolation as evidence of war crimes mounts. While Hamas committed atrocities on October 7, Israel's subsequent actions, including the starvation of civilians and disproportionate destruction, have been condemned by international courts and longtime allies. A recent joint statement from the UK, EU, and others decried the civilian suffering and failing aid system. With even its staunchest allies like the U.S. reportedly losing patience, Israel is running out of friends, placing the nation at a critical inflection point in the conflict.</p>
