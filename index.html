          <p>A federal judge has issued an order blocking the Trump administration from withholding federal funding to dozens of "sanctuary" cities and counties across the U.S., including major metropolitan areas like Los Angeles and Chicago. This ruling expands a previous decision that deemed the president's attempt to freeze funds for local governments limiting cooperation with immigration enforcement as unconstitutional. The cities argued these policies violated the Tenth Amendment and undermined trust between police and residents, while the administration maintained that sanctuary policies hindered federal law enforcement efforts.</p>

          <p>Leaders from both Republican and Democratic parties in Virginia have strongly condemned a racist sign displayed at a protest targeting Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. The sign, which made a discriminatory comparison related to bathroom policies and historical segregation, appeared during a rally outside a school board meeting where Earle-Sears was speaking about transgender bathroom regulations. The incident has gone viral, sparking widespread outrage and prompting calls for unity against bigotry from across the political spectrum, though Earle-Sears criticized her opponent's response as insufficient.</p>

          <h2>Malaysia Bans Raw Rare Earth Exports, Eyeing Downstream Industry Growth Amid US Supply Shift</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Malaysia has implemented a ban on the export of unprocessed rare earth metals, signaling its ambition to develop domestic downstream industries for these critical minerals. This strategic move aims to retain supplies onshore, attracting foreign investment that includes local processing, job creation, and technology transfers. Analysts suggest this positions Malaysia as a significant alternative supplier for the United States, which is actively seeking non-Chinese sources for rare earth metals. The policy reflects Malaysia's intent to leverage its geoeconomic agency for national development.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong has emerged as the leading venue for Chinese companies seeking initial public offerings (IPOs), surpassing the United States for the first eight months of the year. Chinese firms raised significantly more capital in Hong Kong, with new shares experiencing higher average jumps in their trading debuts compared to US listings. This shift is attributed to Hong Kong's active capital market recovery and lingering uncertainties surrounding US-China rivalry, including the risk of delisting for Chinese stocks in American markets.

          <p>The FBI's search of John Bolton's home, publicly celebrated by FBI Director Kash Patel and downplayed by President Trump, is being interpreted by some intelligence professionals as a significant escalation in the Trump administration's campaign against the "deep state." This article suggests the raid, alongside recent firings and security clearance revocations of intelligence officials, creates a "chilling effect" and "terrorizes the workforce." Critics argue these actions politicize the intelligence community and may deter whistleblowers, raising concerns about the integrity and independence of national security institutions.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, recently released from criminal custody after being wrongly deported to El Salvador, now faces the possibility of deportation to Uganda. A senior Department of Homeland Security official confirmed this development, with a notice sent to his attorneys indicating potential removal to the East African nation. This comes despite a 2019 court order prohibiting his deportation to El Salvador due to fear of persecution. The Trump administration has increasingly utilized "third country" agreements for undocumented immigrants, raising further concerns about Abrego Garcia's long-term safety and legal status.</p>

          <p>A Colorado judge rejected a plea agreement for funeral home owner Jon Hallford, who admitted to abusing 191 corpses, after emotional testimony from victims' families. The deal, which proposed a 20-year concurrent sentence, was deemed insufficient by relatives who endured years of believing they held loved ones' ashes that were actually concrete. Hallford and his wife ran a fraudulent scheme, leaving bodies to decay and defrauding families and the government. The judge's "extreme action" allows Hallford to withdraw his guilty plea, potentially leading to a trial or a more severe sentence.</p>

          <p>President Trump's aggressive crackdown on homeless encampments in Washington D.C., involving federal agents, draws parallels to San Francisco's recent controversial policies. Following a Supreme Court ruling allowing citations for sleeping rough, San Francisco saw a dramatic reduction in visible tents, though overall homelessness figures continued to rise. While some praise the aesthetic improvement, advocates criticize the criminalization of homelessness as punitive and ineffective in addressing underlying issues. This article examines the debate over such "get-tough" strategies, questioning their long-term efficacy in solving the crisis.</p>

          <p>Ether (ETH) has achieved a new record high, its first since 2021, following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's annual address at Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

This spurred a "panicked repositioning" in the market, leading to significant short liquidations for ETH and a rally in crypto-focused company shares. The article notes Ether's recent emergence as a market leader, driven by regulatory tailwinds and institutional interest in stablecoins. (not investment advice)</p>
