          <p>Meta and Anduril, a defense startup founded by Palmer Luckey, have partnered to develop virtual and augmented reality devices for the U.S. Army. This collaboration marks Meta's significant step into government technology and a reunion with Luckey, who previously sold Oculus VR to Meta. The partnership aims to provide the U.S. military with advanced technology, potentially saving billions by using commercial components. Both companies have jointly bid on an Army contract worth up to $100 million for VR devices and are working on EagleEye, a system to enhance soldiers' hearing and vision, regardless of whether they win the contract.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is criticizing federal judges who have ruled against the president's tariff policy, with the White House Press Secretary asserting that these judges are threatening the credibility of the United States. This comes after a federal court ruling that President Trump does not have the power to unilaterally impose certain tariffs. The Department of Justice has requested a delay in the ruling, arguing that it will cause a "foreign policy disaster scenario" and limit the president's leverage in trade negotiations. The administration also plans to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students at U.S. universities amidst ongoing disputes.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from revoking Harvard's ability to enroll international students. The decision halts, at least temporarily, the administration's efforts to restrict international visas for students and scholars. Harvard, which has nearly 7,000 international students, argued that the restrictions would harm its academic environment and financial stability. The judge's ruling maintains the status quo, allowing Harvard to continue enrolling international students while the legal battle continues, providing temporary relief for international students concerned about their ability to study in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Over 100,000 kitchen faucets sold on Amazon under the brands Vfauosit, Kicimpro, and Basdehen are being recalled due to unsafe levels of lead.

          <p>Amazon has created a new team called ZeroOne, led by former Microsoft executive J Allard, to develop "breakthrough" consumer products. The team, spread across Seattle, San Francisco, and Sunnyvale, is focused on both hardware and software projects. Allard, a key architect of the Xbox game console, joined Amazon in September 2024. While expanding this area, Amazon is scaling back other areas of its devices division, including laying off employees working on Alexa and Amazon Kids.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that sexual exploitation and domestic violence soared in Lahaina, Hawaii, following the devastating 2023 wildfire. One in six female fire survivors surveyed reported feeling forced to engage in sexual acts for basic necessities. The housing crisis, exacerbated by the reopening of West Maui to tourists, compounded the issue. Calls to a crisis hotline more than doubled, and reports of sexual assault and substance misuse surged, highlighting the unequal impact of climate and environmental disasters on vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled a nearly $600-million contract with Moderna to develop a vaccine for humans against bird flu. This decision also forfeits the U.S. government’s right to purchase doses ahead of a pandemic and cancels an agreement set up by the Biden administration in January. The Department of Health and Human Services had previously stated they were reviewing the contract, suggesting the move was not entirely unexpected. The cancellation marks the latest action against vaccines by the Trump administration.</p>

The case centers on the Uinta Basin Railway, an 88-mile expansion that would connect oil and gas producers to the broader rail network. The ruling is seen as a victory for the fossil fuel industry, while environmental groups express concern about the weakening of environmental safeguards.</p>
