        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trey Hendrickson, the Bengals' edge rusher, has publicly criticized the team for a lack of communication regarding his contract. Hendrickson expressed his desire to remain in Cincinnati and build a family there, but he feels the team's offers haven't aligned with previous promises. Despite leading the NFL in sacks last season and being a Pro Bowler each year since joining the Bengals in 2021, Hendrickson feels undervalued. He is entering the final year of his contract and seeks a resolution that provides stability for his family, rather than relying on incentives or short-term deals.</p>

          <p>Six Bulgarians have been sentenced to lengthy prison terms in the UK for operating a Russian spy ring that targeted journalists, dissidents, and Ukrainian soldiers across Europe. The group, inspired by the "minions" from Despicable Me, conducted surveillance and gathered intelligence for the Kremlin, posing a serious risk to the UK's national security. Their activities included planning to intercept mobile phone data of Ukrainian soldiers training at a US military base in Germany and targeting investigative journalists. The case exposed the inner workings of a Russian operational spy cell, revealing thousands of messages and plans to kidnap and kill targets.</p>

          <p>Todd Blanche, President Trump's former personal criminal attorney, has been appointed acting Librarian of Congress, sparking controversy and raising questions about political interference in the Library's operations. The appointment follows the firing of Carla Hayden, the previous librarian, and has been met with criticism from Democrats who argue that the position should be non-partisan. Two other Justice Department officials have also been assigned roles at the Library, leading to further scrutiny and concerns about the library's independence. The library staff escorted them from the building, and Congress is engaged with the White House on the situation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an executive order urging drugmakers to voluntarily reduce the prices of key medicines in the United States, falling short of previous promises to link U.S. drug prices to those in peer countries. The order lacks a clear legal mechanism for mandating price reductions, drawing criticism for its limited scope and reliance on voluntary compliance. House Republicans also offered health care policy changes that would cut Medicaid and Obamacare funding, while Democrats advocate for legislation to align American drug prices with international standards. The pharmaceutical industry expressed relief, but analysts remain skeptical about the order's effectiveness.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing to raise the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) to $30,000 for taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less. This provision is part of President Trump's tax and spending package, aiming to address concerns from lawmakers in high-tax states. The current SALT deduction limit, set at $10,000 by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), is scheduled to expire after 2025. The proposed increase could provide tax relief to some residents in states with high income and property taxes.</p>

          <p>U.S. tariff receipts surged to a record $16.3 billion in April, driven by President Trump's trade policies, including tariffs on imports.

However, the fiscal year-to-date deficit remains high at $1.05 trillion, 13% higher than the previous year, with high interest rates contributing significantly to budgetary burdens.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced tighter British immigration rules, aiming to end what he calls a "failed experiment in open borders." The new rules will make it harder to obtain work, family, and student visas, requiring higher-level English proficiency tests and longer residency periods for citizenship. Employers will face restrictions on recruiting overseas workers, particularly for low-skilled jobs. Critics argue that Starmer's language could incite violence against migrants, while others question whether the proposals go far enough to reduce immigration numbers.</p>

          <p>The temporary trade deal between the U.S. and China, which suspends reciprocal tariffs, is expected to lead to a surge in freight shipments from China to the U.S. Retailers and logistics executives anticipate importers will rush to move forward with shipments during the 90-day pause, potentially causing container rates to increase. While the tariff pause offers a short-term reprieve, the 30% tariffs will still make for an expensive back-to-school and holiday season for most Americans, as prices are still expected to go up. Critical industries also report low inventory levels, and the tariff pause will cause a scurry of activity to replenish those inventories.</p>

Bailey's influence extends beyond business, as he has visited the White House multiple times and advises on digital asset policy. The merger represents a strategic shift for KindlyMD, with the healthcare operation eventually playing a smaller role. (not investment advice)</p>

The church views this resettlement as conflicting with its commitment to racial justice and its ties to the Anglican Church of Southern Africa, which opposed apartheid. The decision comes as the Trump administration prioritizes Afrikaners for resettlement while limiting the broader refugee program. The church will continue to support immigrants and refugees in other ways, but will wind down federally funded services.</p>

          <p>China and the United States have agreed to reduce tariffs on each other for 90 days, providing relief for investors and retailers concerned about a trade war. The temporary truce will see the U.S. lower tariffs on Chinese imports to 30%, and China reduce its import duties on U.S. goods to 10%. However, supply shortages and price increases on Chinese products may still affect American consumers due to weeks of uncertainty. The 90-day deadline for a more lasting trade deal could fuel further market volatility. The end result of the provisional agreement is a return to tariff rates that were in place before the president launched a global trade war on April 2.</p>
