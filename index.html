            <p>Severe weather over Easter weekend led to fatal flooding in Moore, Oklahoma, where two people died after their vehicles were swept off the road. Emergency responders recovered the bodies of an adult female and a 12-year-old child. The flooding occurred as more than 30 million Americans were under alert for severe weather, including tornadoes and damaging winds, across several states. The police department reported numerous high-water incidents and road closures, urging residents to stay home if possible due to the historical weather event.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>While tongue scraping is growing in popularity as a dental hygiene practice, some experts are warning of potential heart health risks. The concern stems from the possibility of causing microscopic cuts on the tongue, which could introduce bacteria into the bloodstream and increase the risk of endocarditis, an infection of the heart valves. Additionally, over-scraping can lower nitric oxide levels, potentially leading to high blood pressure. Experts emphasize that tongue scraping should not replace regular brushing and flossing, and moderation is key to maintaining oral and overall health.</p>

Denise Solis carries on this tradition, which she learned from her mother, who passed away shortly before Easter in 2003. Cascarones are playfully broken over people's heads, symbolizing rebirth and new life. Solis now shares this tradition with her son, creating a powerful link to her past and a joyful experience for her family and friends, reminding her of the love and care her mother always provided.</p>

            <p>China is taking a more direct approach in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)-Rwanda conflict, expressing concerns to Kigali about its support for the M23 rebel group. This shift, although measured, deviates from China's usual non-interference policy in African conflicts. China's involvement is driven by the need to protect its significant mining interests in the region and maintain relationships with both countries. Beijing also voted in favor of a UN Security Council resolution condemning Rwanda’s role in the conflict, indicating a growing willingness to address the situation directly.</p>

            <p>DHL Express has temporarily suspended deliveries to the US for shipments worth over $800 due to a significant increase in customs red tape following the introduction of new tariffs. The change has caused a surge in formal customs clearances, leading to multi-day delays for affected shipments. While DHL continues to deliver packages under $800, stricter enforcement is expected, potentially impacting businesses like Shein and Temu. The White House aims to address illicit substances and deceptive shipping practices, particularly from China and Hong Kong, through these measures.</p>

            <p>The increasing popularity of snail slime in beauty products raises ethical questions about the treatment of snails. While the industry claims snails are treated well, concerns persist regarding the methods used to extract the slime, which is a stress response. Studies reveal practices such as electrical stimulation and the use of force to increase slime yield, potentially causing harm to the snails. As the market for snail beauty products grows, the need for ethical extraction methods and greater transparency within the industry becomes increasingly important.</p>

The piece reminisces about the unique experiences and illusions that defined the American identity, from the vast landscapes to the quirky subcultures. It touches on themes of prosperity, disillusionment, and the pursuit of happiness, suggesting that the American dream, once a source of motivation, has become a source of betrayal for some. The author concludes by expressing a sense of loss for the America they once knew, now obscured by rising authoritarianism.</p>

            <p>Malaysian durian growers are seeing increased sales in China due to a rising demand for fresh, naturally ripened fruit. Improved logistics and a steady supply have boosted exports, with suppliers expecting a 30% increase this year. Unlike other countries that use pre-cutting methods, Malaysian durians are allowed to ripen naturally on the tree, which is preferred by Chinese consumers. This trend presents significant opportunities for Malaysian growers to expand their market share in China.</p>

            <p>Train services on Tokyo's Yamanote and Keihin-Tohoku lines have resumed after a suspension of over 24 hours due to track-switching work. The suspension, affecting around 550,000 people, was necessary for platform expansion and track relocation at Tamachi Station. This work prepares for a new route to improve access to Haneda airport, with the new line expected to open in the fiscal year starting April 2031. The resumption of services restores transportation for commuters in central Tokyo.</p>
