          <p>American Airlines has significantly reduced its 2025 profit forecast, now projecting an adjusted per-share result ranging from a 20-cent loss to an 80-cent profit, a sharp decline from its initial estimates. The airline's third-quarter outlook also disappointed investors, with an expected adjusted loss between 10 and 60 cents per share, falling short of analyst predictions. Despite these downward revisions, the company's second-quarter performance exceeded expectations, with adjusted earnings of 95 cents per share on $14.39 billion in revenue. The carrier attributes the cautious future outlook to potential macroeconomic weaknesses, while hoping for continued improvement in the domestic travel market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a comprehensive overview of the documents and investigations related to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, explaining the origins of the so-called "Epstein files" from criminal and civil cases. It clarifies that while some materials, like flight logs and redacted contact books, have been released, they contain few new revelations. The report also addresses the persistent, yet unproven, rumors of a "client list," which the Department of Justice has stated does not exist. It details the known relationship between Epstein and former President Trump, noting that being named in documents is not evidence of wrongdoing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. and the European Union are urgently negotiating to secure a trade deal before an August 1 deadline, aiming to prevent significant tariff hikes that could harm consumers and businesses. Without an agreement, the U.S. has threatened a 30% tax on EU imports, with the EU preparing retaliatory tariffs on over $100 billion of American goods. A recent U.S. trade pact with Japan, which set a 15% tariff rate in exchange for substantial investment commitments, is being viewed as a potential model for the EU talks. Economists warn that even a 15% tariff would create an inflationary shock and dampen economic activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Turkey's central bank has cut its main interest rate by three percentage points, bringing it down to 43% in a return to a monetary easing policy. This marks the first rate reduction since April, when a hike to 46% was implemented following political turmoil that impacted the Turkish lira. The move signals the monetary policy committee's confidence in its strategy to combat inflation, which has been steadily decreasing and stood at 35.05% in June. The bank stated that its tight monetary stance is designed to support disinflation by moderating domestic demand and improving inflation expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A senior NHS England director has warned that the upcoming five-day strike by resident doctors will inevitably harm patients, a consequence deemed unacceptable despite the right to strike. The industrial action, part of a long-running pay dispute, is expected to severely disrupt both emergency and non-urgent care. NHS England plans to continue with most non-urgent operations, a strategy the British Medical Association (BMA) considers unsafe, advocating for cancellations to better cover emergencies. The dispute continues after talks broke down, with the BMA seeking a pathway to restore pay value and the government refusing to revisit this year's 5.4% average pay award.</p>

          <p>The U.S. total fertility rate fell to an all-time low of 1.599 children per woman in 2024, according to final data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This rate is below the 2.1 replacement level needed for a generation to replace itself, a benchmark the U.S. has been under for nearly two decades. Experts attribute the decline to ongoing trends of women delaying childbirth and concerns over the financial stability required to raise children. While the Trump administration has proposed measures like backing "baby bonuses," some population researchers argue these are symbolic and fail to address larger issues like affordable childcare and parental leave.</p>

          <p>Australia has announced it will reduce restrictions on U.S. beef imports, a decision the Trump administration is calling a "major trade breakthrough." The eased rules, which were originally implemented to prevent mad cow disease, will now allow imports of U.S. beef sourced from Canada and Mexico. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke L. Rollins praised the move as a victory over "non-scientific trade barriers," while Australian producers expressed confidence in the government's biosecurity assessments. However, analysts are skeptical that the policy will lead to a significant increase in U.S. beef on Australian shelves due to high American prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Food giant Nestle has indicated that prices for its products, including KitKat and Nespresso, may increase further in the second half of the year. CEO Laurent Freixe stated that while significant price hikes were already implemented to counter soaring coffee and cocoa costs, additional action might be necessary, especially as U.S. tariffs could worsen margin pressures. The company reported better-than-expected organic sales growth of 2.9% for the first half, driven by price increases, but total sales declined 1.8% due to currency fluctuations. The CFO warned that second-half margins would be significantly lower than the first. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese agricultural authorities are implementing plans to reduce the country's hog breeding stock in response to a persistent oversupply that has caused a significant drop in pork prices. The industry has faced over seven consecutive months of losses, an unprecedented duration, driven by weak consumer demand and high inventory levels. At the end of June, the national breeding sow inventory was 40.43 million, which is still 3.7% above the official target of 39 million.

          <p>A new AARP survey shows that while most Americans consider Social Security important, many hold significant misconceptions about its future and benefits. For instance, 47% of respondents incorrectly believe benefits would be cut by at least half if the program's trust funds are depleted, whereas the official projection is a 19% reduction. The survey also highlights a drop in confidence about the program's future, with only 36% feeling secure, down from 43% in 2020.

          <p>The use of AI-powered personalized pricing, where the cost of a product or service varies for different individuals based on their data, is becoming more common and sparking consumer backlash. Delta Air Lines recently confirmed it is testing this technology for a small percentage of its flights, a practice critics label "surveillance pricing." While companies like Amazon and Delta claim they do not use personal information to set individual prices, investigations have found other retailers offering different discounts based on user data. This has led to legislative action in some states to require disclosure of such practices, as consumers grow wary of algorithmic price discrimination.</p>

This warning coincides with a declaration from over 100 aid groups about impending mass starvation in the territory.

          <p>This opinion column argues that President Trump has degraded the presidency by making unprecedented and baseless accusations of treason against his predecessor, Barack Obama. The author contends that Trump's claims—reviving conspiracies about the 2016 Russia investigation—are a manic attempt to distract from the controversy surrounding the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. The piece highlights that Trump's rhetoric, suggesting his political opponents should be imprisoned, erodes democratic norms and is particularly dangerous when a sitting president targets a former one. The author notes the irony that this distraction strategy is unlikely to satisfy his base, as no real case against Obama exists.</p>

The DMV is seeking to suspend Tesla's sales in California for at least 30 days, a significant threat given the state's importance to Tesla's market.

This freeze-dried product, called ErythroMer, can be stored for years and has shown promising results in animal trials, successfully resuscitating rabbits from hemorrhagic shock.
