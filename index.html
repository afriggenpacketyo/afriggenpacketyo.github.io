          <p>Canada has withdrawn its digital services tax on large tech companies just before it was set to take effect. The decision came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced he was halting all trade discussions with Canada in response to the proposed 3% levy, which would have affected American giants like Google and Amazon. Canadian officials stated the move is intended to allow for the resumption of negotiations for a new comprehensive economic and security agreement with the United States. The tax was originally introduced to address a gap where tech firms earned significant revenue from Canadians without being taxed locally.</p>

          <p>The London-based punk-rap duo Bob Vylan has generated significant outrage for leading anti-Israel chants during their performance at the Glastonbury Festival. The singer shouted "Death to the IDF" and "Free Palestine," prompting condemnation from political figures, festival organizers, and the public. British police are now reviewing footage to determine if any criminal offenses were committed, and the BBC has reportedly removed the group's set from its streaming service. Glastonbury organizers released a statement denouncing the act as "appalling hate speech" that crossed a line, reaffirming that antisemitism and incitement to violence have no place at the festival.</p>

Authorities reported that first responders came under sniper fire shortly after arriving at the scene of the blaze. Following an extensive manhunt involving multiple agencies, a SWAT team located a deceased male with a firearm nearby, believed to be the suspect.

          <p>The jury has started deliberations in the trial of Erin Patterson, an Australian woman accused of murdering three relatives and attempting to murder a fourth by serving them a meal containing poisonous death cap mushrooms. The prosecution argues that Patterson intentionally poisoned her guests with a beef Wellington in July 2023 and subsequently lied to investigators. However, the defense claims the poisoning was a tragic accident and that she panicked, leading to her dishonest statements. The case, which has captivated the public, now rests with the jury to decide Patterson's fate after a nearly two-month trial.</p>

          <p>Two tropical systems are impacting Mexico from opposite coasts, bringing heavy rain to the region.

While Flossie is expected to strengthen into a hurricane, forecasters predict it will remain offshore, moving west-northwest into open water. However, it is still projected to bring several inches of rain to Mexico's southwestern coastal states through the early part of the week.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Russia's restrained reaction to the recent conflict between its ally Iran and Israel demonstrates Moscow's declining influence on the world stage. The author contends that Russia's preoccupation with its war in Ukraine has drained its military and financial resources, weakening its ability to support its allies. Despite a strategic partnership with Iran, Russia offered only verbal condemnations and mediation efforts rather than substantive military or political backing when Iran was attacked. This pattern of strategic neglect, the article suggests, reveals that Russia is no longer the superpower it purports to be, undermining its credibility as a reliable international partner.</p>

          <p>A black bear has been spotted for the second time in Greene County, Ohio, leading local police to issue a public advisory. The Yellow Springs Police Department humorously named the bear "Mosey" and urged residents not to approach, feed, or follow the animal. Officials from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) stated that black bears are typically shy and will avoid humans. To prevent attracting the bear, residents are advised to secure trash, take down bird feeders, and keep pet food indoors. The ODNR will continue to monitor the bear's movements but does not plan to intervene.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is debating a massive legislative package central to President Trump's second-term agenda, with final votes expected on Monday. The bill, which narrowly passed the House, includes increased spending for border security and defense, offset by cuts to other programs. The legislative push is occurring under the budget reconciliation process, which allows the majority party to pass the bill with a simple majority, limiting the Democratic minority's ability to block it. Following the debate period, senators will engage in a "vote-a-rama," where they can offer numerous amendments, a process Democrats are expected to use to challenge their Republican colleagues.</p>

The purchasing managers' index (PMI) registered at 49.7, remaining below the 50-point mark that separates contraction from expansion, signaling persistent weakness in the industrial sector. This downturn continues despite government stimulus efforts and is exacerbated by sluggish consumer demand, a domestic price war, and a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. due to tariffs. The ongoing manufacturing slump and producer price deflation pose significant challenges to China's economic stability and growth prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

In response to the analysis and wavering support, President Trump has been pressuring Republican lawmakers to back the bill.

          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are now investigating. Studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs are more likely to cause queasiness compared to traditional combustion engine cars. One key factor identified is the regenerative braking system, which converts kinetic energy back into electrical energy to charge the battery. This process can result in low-frequency deceleration that provokes the symptoms of motion sickness, affecting passenger comfort and creating a new challenge for automotive engineers to solve.</p>

His decision came shortly after President Trump threatened to support a primary challenger against him for opposing the president's massive tax and spending bill. Tillis cited his opposition to the bill's proposed Medicaid cuts, which he argued would be devastating to his state. In his retirement statement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and compromise in Washington, noting that independent thinking is often scorned.

          <p>The United Kingdom is bracing for the peak of a four-day heatwave, with temperatures forecast to reach 34Â°C (93Â°F) in central and eastern England. This would mark one of the hottest June days on record. An amber heat-health alert remains in effect for five regions, indicating that the high temperatures are likely to impact the entire health service and cause travel delays. The London Fire Brigade has also warned of a "severe" risk of wildfires due to the heat and low rainfall. Authorities are advising the public to stay out of the sun during the hottest part of the day.</p>

          <p>The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, has stated that recent U.S. airstrikes caused "severe damage" to Iran's nuclear facilities but did not destroy them entirely. Grossi emphasized that Iran retains the industrial and technological capacity to restart its program if it chooses to do so. His assessment appears to contradict more absolute claims by U.S. officials about the obliteration of Iran's capabilities. Grossi also stressed the urgent need for IAEA inspectors to regain access to Iranian sites to verify the status and location of nuclear materials and equipment.</p>

          <p>Wales and British and Irish Lions scrum-half Tomos Williams has been forced to withdraw from the remainder of the tour in Australia due to a hamstring injury. Williams sustained the injury after scoring a try in the Lions' victory over Western Force. Head coach Andy Farrell described the injury as worse than initially expected and confirmed it would sideline the player for the medium to long term. Scotland's Ben White has been called up to the squad as a replacement. Williams' departure is a significant blow to the team, leaving only one Welsh player in the touring squad.</p>

The inquiry will also investigate issues like restrictive visiting policies and the controversial use of "do not resuscitate" notices.

While respecting the competitions, he noted that the lack of adequate rest for players is a significant issue. His comments echo those of other top managers who have criticized the increasingly crowded global football calendar and its toll on players.</p>

          <p>Police in Istanbul detained more than 50 people who attempted to participate in an LGBTQ+ Pride parade, which had been officially banned by the city's governor for the ninth consecutive year. Authorities cited concerns that the event would undermine "social peace, family structure, and moral values." A heavy police presence was deployed to prevent large gatherings, leading to clashes with activists. Despite homosexuality not being a crime in Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government has increasingly adopted harsh rhetoric against the LGBTQ+ community, creating a hostile environment that human rights groups warn leads to discrimination and violence.</p>

The prosecutor, identified by the pseudonym Hikari, alleges she was sexually assaulted by then-chief prosecutor Kentaro Kitagawa in 2018 and was subsequently pressured to remain silent. Kitagawa, who has been indicted for quasi-forcible sexual intercourse, initially admitted to the charge but later changed his plea to not guilty. Hikari also claims she experienced further harassment from a colleague, which she describes as a "secondary assault," after she reported the incident, highlighting systemic issues within the public prosecutor's office.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has warned that the Lifetime Individual Savings Account (LISA) needs reform, as its withdrawal penalties can cause people to receive less money than they originally invested. LISAs offer a 25% government bonus on savings for a first home or retirement, but early withdrawals for other reasons incur a charge that effectively penalizes the saver's own capital. The Treasury Committee report described the product as complex and potentially mis-sold, noting a surge in early withdrawals. It also highlighted that LISA savings can negatively affect eligibility for certain benefits, unlike traditional pension schemes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed analysis of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner's safety record, which has come under scrutiny following a recent fatal crash and years of whistleblower allegations. While the aircraft had a strong safety record for over a decade, its production has been plagued by quality control issues, particularly at its South Carolina plant. Whistleblowers have raised serious concerns about substandard parts, improper procedures, and a corporate culture that allegedly prioritized production speed over safety. Boeing has consistently denied that these issues compromise the structural integrity of the fleet, but the claims have cast a long shadow over the innovative aircraft.</p>
