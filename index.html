          <p>Hamas announced its intention to release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement in Gaza. The decision was made ahead of President Trump's visit to the Middle East and aims to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza, which has been under an Israeli blockade for 70 days. The Israeli prime minister's office confirmed being informed by the US of Hamas's intention, anticipating further negotiations on other hostages. This move is viewed as a goodwill gesture, with hopes it will lead to a comprehensive agreement securing the release of all remaining hostages.</p>

Despite political rhetoric and promises to reduce net migration, numbers have remained historically high.

Recent data indicates a potential fall in net migration for 2024, though the full impact of policy changes remains to be seen.</p>

          <p>Poland has accused Russian intelligence services of orchestrating a massive fire that destroyed a shopping centre in Warsaw last year. Prime Minister Donald Tusk stated that Poland knows "for sure" that the blaze was caused by arson ordered by Russian special services. Some of those responsible are already in custody, while others alleged to have been involved have been identified and are being searched for. The fire destroyed 1,400 small businesses, with many of the staff being members of Warsaw's Vietnamese community.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's plan to accept a luxury Boeing jet from the Qatari royal family for use as Air Force One has drawn criticism from allies and rivals. The “flying palace” is possibly the most expensive gift ever received by the American government. Critics argue that accepting the plane would be a "stain" on the administration and proof of Trump using the White House for personal financial gain.</p>
