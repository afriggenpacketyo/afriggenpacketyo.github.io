            <h2>China Urges US to End Tariff Practices</h2>

            <p>Chinese officials are pressing the Trump administration to completely remove reciprocal tariffs, criticizing them as a 'wrong practice'. This call follows Trump's recent announcement of a 90-day pause on some global tariffs, although tariffs on Chinese imports have increased. China views the U.S.'s exemptions on certain technological products as a 'small step' but insists on a full cancellation of the tariffs to restore mutual respect and dialogue. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer indicated that there are currently no plans for direct talks between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping.</p>

            <p>Hashem Abedi, jailed for life for helping his brother carry out the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, attacked three prison officers at HMP Frankland. Abedi threw hot cooking oil and used 'home made weapons' to stab the officers, resulting in life-threatening injuries. Counter-terrorism police are leading the investigation into the incident, which took place in a separation center for dangerous and extremist prisoners. The Prison Officers' Association is demanding immediate restrictions on cooking facilities in separation centers and improved protection for staff.</p>

            <p>Clinical psychologist Diana Hill and movement specialist Katy Bowman offer advice on retraining the brain to crave physical activity instead of excessive phone scrolling. They suggest using psychological flexibility, a concept from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, to manage urges and build new habits. Techniques include 'surfing' the urge to scroll, engaging in simple movements while surfing, savoring favorite activities, adding novelty to familiar movements, and turning worry into compassionate action. Combining movement with nature can also provide stress relief and grounding.</p>

            <p>Global trading businesses are facing considerable uncertainty as ports and shipping companies struggle to manage the turmoil caused by Trump's tariffs. The announcement of tariffs has prompted manufacturers to shift stock or re-route products, leading to higher short-term shipping costs and air freight rates. While the White House has paused additional tariffs for countries other than China for 90 days, complex international trade networks built over decades risk being disrupted. The situation is further complicated by the potential imposition of costly port fees on Chinese-built ships.</p>
