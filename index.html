          <p>The UK is reportedly on the verge of signing a trade agreement with the U.S., potentially making it the first country to do so under the Trump administration's new trade policies. While specifics remain unclear, the agreement is expected to involve lowering British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm products, as well as reducing taxes on U.S. technology companies. Negotiations are ongoing, with the UK aiming to secure tariff relief on key sectors before engaging in formal talks with the EU for a separate European agreement. The New York Times reports this agreement could be a starting point for future negotiations.</p>

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan remain high as overnight exchanges of fire occur in the contested Kashmir region. The conflict stems from the partition of British India in 1947, when Kashmir was given the choice to join either India or Pakistan. Despite a UN-recommended referendum, neither country has demilitarized, leading to a divided region and ongoing disputes. Recent events, including attacks on tourists, have further strained relations, highlighting the complex and volatile situation in the area, which is exacerbated by cross-border air strikes and the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's autonomy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's threat to impose 100 percent tariffs on films made in "foreign lands" has alarmed the British film industry, which relies heavily on Hollywood productions. The industry is still recovering from pandemic shutdowns and the 2023 actors' and screenwriters' strikes, and the concern is that uncertainty about tariffs could wipe out that progress. The British government is in discussions with the U.S. administration about the potential tariffs, but many trade experts question how they could be enforced, noting the increasingly international nature of film productions.</p>
