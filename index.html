        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kenya has converted US$5 billion in Chinese railway loans to Chinese yuan, a move aimed at reducing annual debt-servicing costs by US$215 million. The loans, taken in 2014 and 2015 from the Export-Import Bank of China, funded the construction of the Standard Gauge Railway from Mombasa to Naivasha. As of June 2024, approximately US$3.5 billion remained unpaid, with Kenya spending US$1 billion annually on servicing its Chinese debt. The deal is expected to halve the SGR loan rates from the existing 6.37 percent under the dollar-denominated agreement, potentially paving the way for other debt-stressed African countries to draw closer to China.

          <p>Several UK newspapers are leading with stories about Prince Andrew and new emails suggesting continued contact with Jeffrey Epstein. The Sun on Sunday reports an email from the Duke of York to Epstein saying "we are in this together", casting doubt on Prince Andrew's claims he cut ties with Epstein earlier. Other papers focus on potential tax changes in the upcoming budget, with the Sunday Telegraph suggesting the Chancellor will "tax the rich" and the Sunday Express speculating on a raid on pensions. The Sunday Mirror says Reeves is pledging to "leave no stone unturned" in her efforts to get the economy firing again. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew's reputation is further damaged by the emergence of an email suggesting continued contact with Jeffrey Epstein longer than previously claimed. The email casts doubt on his BBC Newsnight interview claims of severing ties with Epstein after a 2010 meeting. The intimate tone of the email undermines attempts to distance himself from Epstein, prompting calls for royal sanctions. The King faces pressure to distance the Royal Family, potentially excluding Prince Andrew from family gatherings and editing him out of the Christmas message.</p>

Despite a recent lawsuit settlement, many women report still being bombarded with pregnancy-related adverts, causing emotional distress. Meta's proposed subscription service to avoid adverts is seen as an inadequate solution, with critics arguing the company should prioritize user sensitivity. Former Meta employees reveal that some advert preference controls are ineffective, raising questions about the platform's commitment to user well-being.</p>

          <p>Britain is experiencing a surge in respiratory illnesses, including the common cold, flu, and COVID-19, with many people reporting symptoms. Experts attribute this to a combination of factors, including children returning to school, adults returning to work, and cooler weather leading to more time spent indoors. Data indicates that Rhinovirus, or the common cold, is the most prevalent illness, while COVID-19 is also circulating with new variants. Vaccinations are recommended for vulnerable populations to protect against serious illness.</p>
