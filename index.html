          <p>During the closing night of "Il trovatore" at London's Royal Opera House, a cast member unfurled a large Palestinian flag on stage. The unauthorized protest occurred during the curtain call, leading to a brief scuffle as an official tried to remove the flag. The Royal Ballet and Opera condemned the action as "completely inappropriate" and a violation of its commitment to political impartiality. The incident, captured on video, highlights the ongoing public expression surrounding the Israel-Gaza war.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exit polls from Japan's upper house election suggest the ruling coalition, led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, is at risk of losing its majority. Public frustration over rising prices and tense trade negotiations with the U.S. have fueled voter discontent. The Liberal Democratic Party and its partner Komeito already lack a majority in the more powerful lower house, making this potential loss a significant blow to Ishiba's influence. A defeat could undermine his ability to govern and potentially lead to his resignation.</p>

          <p>A heated verbal exchange occurred between New York Yankees player Jazz Chisholm Jr. and Atlanta Braves third base coach Eddie Perez during their Saturday game. The conflict reportedly began after Perez accused Chisholm of relaying signals to a teammate from second base. Broadcast footage showed both men shouting at each other, with Perez allegedly making a gesture that some interpreted as a threat. Yankees manager Aaron Boone stated the incident would likely be reviewed by the league.</p>

          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection, which is the ability to understand one's own emotions and needs. Raouda argues that common parental responses, such as dismissing a child's feelings, can erode their self-trust over time. Fostering self-connection builds emotional resilience, supports healthy boundaries, and promotes authentic confidence. Parents can encourage this by validating emotions, modeling self-awareness, and allowing children age-appropriate autonomy.</p>

          <p>Sources suggest that the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea is the most likely venue for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. A meeting could take place either on the sidelines of the event or during a potential visit by Trump to China beforehand. This development follows recent diplomatic engagements between the two nations aimed at stabilizing relations after a period of tension over trade and tariffs. Both leaders have expressed a desire to meet.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that traditional U.S. labor market metrics, such as job creation numbers, are becoming obsolete in the modern economy. The author contends that with the rise of the "gig economy," side hustles, and remote work, a focus on "jobs" fails to capture the full picture of economic well-being. A more relevant measure would be tracking income levels across the working-age population, using data from tax returns and private sources. This shift is necessary for making informed policy decisions in an economy transformed by AI and new work structures.</p>

To become more extroverted, Khazan forced herself into uncomfortable social situations like improv classes. This approach suggests that by consciously adopting the behaviors of a desired personality, individuals can fundamentally alter their characteristic ways of thinking and feeling.</p>

Meanwhile, most Americans, feeling the strain of inflation, believe the administration should focus more on lowering prices rather than on deportation or spending cuts.

          <p>A team of archaeologists believes it has identified the 300-year-old wreck of the 'Nossa Senhora do Cabo,' a Portuguese warship captured by the French pirate Olivier Levasseur, known as 'La Buse,' in 1721. The ship was carrying a vast treasure, estimated to be worth over $138 million today, including gold, diamonds, and pearls. The wreck was discovered near the island of Nosy Boraha off Madagascar, a known pirate hideout. While thousands of artifacts have been recovered, the main treasure remains lost, continuing a centuries-old mystery.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: US Trade Strategy with ASEAN Shifts from Partnership to Rent-Seeking</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the United States' recent trade strategy with Southeast Asian nations has shifted from fostering partnership to a transactional, rent-seeking model. The author contends that instead of promoting mutual integration, Washington is effectively monetizing access to its market by imposing higher tariffs and demanding mandatory purchases. This approach, exemplified by rising tariffs on exports from countries like Vietnam and Indonesia, threatens to undermine the economic competitiveness and sovereignty of ASEAN members, turning them into "fee for access" economies rather than strategic partners.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Lowy Institute states that China's influence in Southeast Asia is increasing as it becomes the region's largest infrastructure financier, while the U.S. and EU are significantly cutting their foreign aid budgets. With the Trump administration and European nations pulling back tens of billions in aid, the center of development finance is shifting east to Beijing, Tokyo, and Seoul. China's growing role through projects like high-speed rail links enhances its regional power, a trend amplified by Western retrenchment and trade uncertainties.</p>

          <p>A fragile calm has settled over the Syrian city of Suweida following a week of deadly sectarian violence between local Druze fighters, Bedouin gunmen, and government forces. The clashes, which killed over 1,000 people and displaced more than 128,000, reportedly ended after Bedouin tribes withdrew from the predominantly Druze city. A ceasefire was announced, and government forces have closed roads to contain tensions. However, the humanitarian situation is dire, with reports of severe shortages of medical supplies and overwhelmed hospitals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new workplace trend termed "quiet cracking" describes a state of persistent burnout, stagnation, and disengagement that can lead to poor performance. Research from TalentLMS found that one in five employees experiences this phenomenon, feeling unappreciated and seeing no path for career advancement. Unlike "quiet quitting," this gradual decline is harder for employers to detect immediately. Key drivers include economic uncertainty, unmanageable workloads, and poor leadership, costing the global economy trillions in lost productivity. The report suggests enhanced recognition and development opportunities as potential solutions.</p>

          <p>Following a court order, the Atlanta Police Foundation (APF) has released nearly 300 pages of records related to the controversial "Cop City" training center. The release came after a judge ruled the private foundation was subject to Georgia's Open Records Act in a first-of-its-kind lawsuit. The documents reveal, among other things, the APF's efforts to lobby city council members to derail a public referendum on the project. Activists see the ruling as a crucial precedent for holding private police foundations accountable and preventing them from operating as opaque entities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's aggressive push for fossil fuels is setting back environmental progress by decades, according to scholars and watchdog groups. In his first six months, the president has used a declared national energy emergency to expand oil, gas, and coal production while cutting green energy initiatives and funding for climate research. Critics argue these policies, which include gutting tax credits for renewables and shuttering NOAA research labs, ignore scientific evidence and are driven by political allegiance to the fossil fuel industry, posing long-term risks to public health.</p>

          <p>GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, known for treating diabetes and obesity, are showing potential as a game-changing treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Women with PCOS, a common hormonal disorder linked to insulin resistance and infertility, have reported significant improvements in symptoms like irregular periods, hair loss, and weight gain after using the drugs. Researchers believe the drugs' ability to improve insulin sensitivity indirectly helps rebalance hormones.

Critics argue that while the order's principles seem benign, they grant non-scientist officials the power to define scientific integrity and block regulations by demanding unattainable levels of certainty. This approach echoes tactics used by the tobacco industry and could be used to delay or prevent public health and environmental protections, such as those concerning PFAS "forever chemicals," by reshaping science to fit policy goals.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the origins of Superman, arguing that recent conservative backlash to his immigrant identity ignores the character's leftist roots. Comic book author Grant Morrison explains that creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, sons of Jewish immigrants, initially depicted Superman as a "socialist figure" and a "champion of the oppressed." Early comics from the 1930s showed him fighting corrupt bosses and forcing authorities to build low-rent housing. The character's evolution has reflected the times, from a patriotic figure in WWII to a cosmic seeker in the 1960s.</p>
