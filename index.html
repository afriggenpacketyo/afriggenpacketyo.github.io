The airline acknowledged the system failure was impacting its operations and apologized to customers for the inconvenience.

          <p>Florida has scheduled the August 19 execution of Kayle Bates, 67, for the 1982 kidnapping and murder of 24-year-old Janet White. Bates was convicted of abducting White from her workplace, attempting to sexually assault her, and then stabbing her to death. Governor Ron DeSantis signed the death warrant, marking the 10th execution scheduled in the state for the year. Bates' attorney has stated they will file further appeals, arguing the execution would be unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is introducing a new, non-waivable "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for all nonimmigrant visa applicants, effective from the 2025 fiscal year. This fee is in addition to existing visa application charges and is part of the Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." While the provision allows for reimbursement if visa holders comply with all terms, implementation details remain unclear, causing concern among travel associations. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the fee will generate significant revenue, as few are expected to seek reimbursement.</p>

          <p>Richard Tillman, the 44-year-old brother of the late NFL player and Army Ranger Pat Tillman, was arrested in connection with a fire that destroyed a post office in San Jose. Authorities allege he intentionally reversed a vehicle into the building's lobby early Sunday morning and then set it on fire. A cryptic message, "Viva La Me," was found spray-painted on the exterior, and the motive for the incident remains under investigation. The attack has left the Almaden Station Post Office a total loss.</p>

          <p>The declining Chinese city of Hegang, located in the country's rust-belt region, is investing approximately 1.2 billion yuan to construct a new airport, scheduled to open in 2027. This infrastructure project is a key part of the city's strategy to reverse its economic stagnation, which has been marked by industrial decline and a significant population decrease. Officials hope the Luobei Airport, along with increased trade with Russia, will stimulate growth and improve connectivity. The airport is projected to handle 450,000 passengers and 1,600 tonnes of cargo annually.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition, comprising the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Komeito, has lost its majority in the upper house of parliament following Sunday's election. Despite the significant political blow, Ishiba has stated he has no intention of resigning, citing his focus on trade negotiations. The result reflects voter frustration over rising prices, potential U.S. tariffs, and a series of political scandals that have plagued the LDP. This loss of control in the upper house will likely undermine the coalition's influence and could lead to political instability.</p>

The impact apparently launched the vehicle into the air, causing it to lodge in the roof of a nearby barn about three meters off the ground.

Researchers believe the drugs' ability to improve insulin sensitivity and promote weight loss indirectly helps rebalance hormones.

          <h2>Canada Experiences a Major Measles Outbreak, Surpassing US Case Numbers</h2>

          <p>Canada has become an unexpected epicenter for a measles outbreak in North America, with over 3,800 cases reported in 2025, a figure nearly three times that of the U.S. despite a much smaller population. The hardest-hit provinces are Ontario and Alberta, with many cases concentrated in communities with historically low vaccination rates. Health officials attribute the surge to declining immunization coverage, fueled by vaccine hesitancy and misinformation that has spread since the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts warn that the only way to stop the highly contagious virus is to increase vaccination rates.</p>

          <h2>Market Analyst Argues for Optimism in Stocks Despite Looming Tariff Deadlines</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite conventional wisdom suggesting market volatility ahead of tariff deadlines, some analysts argue that numerous positive factors are supporting stocks. Provisions within President Trump's "big beautiful bill," such as the extension of tax cuts and new deductions, are expected to inject billions into the economy and boost consumer spending. Other tailwinds include strong corporate earnings, tax relief for businesses, and a potential boom in sectors like energy and aerospace. This perspective suggests that pro-business policies could create economic growth that outweighs the negative impact of trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has issued a stark warning that people retiring in 2050 will be financially worse off than today's pensioners unless action is taken to increase retirement savings. According to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), nearly half of working-age adults, particularly low earners and the self-employed, are not contributing to a private pension. To address this shortfall, the government is reviving the Pensions Commission to develop a new strategy. The analysis highlights significant gaps in pension wealth based on gender and ethnicity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's mass deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the use of detention facilities. This shift corresponds with a perception that the program is targeting more than just dangerous criminals. The poll also reveals widespread public desire for the administration to focus more on lowering prices, as disapproval of Trump's handling of inflation has reached a new high. Overall, the president's approval has slipped, increasingly defined by a strong base of support versus growing doubt among the rest of the country.</p>

          <p>In one of the deadliest days for aid-seekers during the conflict, at least 85 Palestinians were killed at various locations across Gaza while trying to access humanitarian supplies, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry. The largest number of casualties occurred in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing, where crowds awaiting a UN convoy reportedly came under Israeli gunfire. The Israel Defense Forces stated they fired warning shots to disperse a crowd that posed a threat. The incident comes as Israel issues new evacuation orders for central Gaza, further complicating aid distribution efforts.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' struggles continued with a 6-5 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers, completing a three-game sweep and marking their tenth defeat in twelve games. The loss was compounded by an injury to star first baseman Freddie Freeman, who sustained a left wrist contusion after being hit by a pitch. While X-rays were negative, the potential loss of a key player adds to the team's frustration during its worst skid since 2018. The Brewers have now beaten the Dodgers in all six matchups between the teams this season.</p>

          <p>The UK's High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project, now tens of billions over budget and years behind schedule, is being cited as a case study in mismanagement. Insiders and analysts suggest the project was troubled from the start due to fundamental challenges inherent in building major infrastructure on a "small, highly populated, property-owning, democratic island." The ambition to build the world's fastest line drove up costs, while the complex planning process led to thousands of expensive compromises and delays. This has raised questions about whether the UK's political and planning systems are equipped for such large-scale endeavors.</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed it will hold a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1984-85 miners' strike. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced the inquiry will examine the clash between police and striking miners outside a coking plant in Rotherham, as well as its aftermath. This includes the failed prosecutions of 95 miners and the "discredited evidence" used against them. Campaigners, who have sought an inquiry for decades, expressed cautious elation at the news, hoping it will finally bring truth and accountability.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler's victory at The Open has solidified his status as the most dominant force in men's golf, sparking frequent comparisons to Tiger Woods during his peak. Having won four major championships in just over three years, Scheffler's consistent, machine-like performance has been described by his peers as "Tiger-like." While Scheffler himself calls the comparisons "silly," his ability to convert leads into victories and his statistical superiority from tee to green are undeniable. An improved putting game has been credited with elevating his performance to this new, commanding level.</p>
