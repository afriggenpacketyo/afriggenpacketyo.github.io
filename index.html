        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Singapore Airlines experienced a steep decline after the company reported a 59% plunge in its first-quarter net profit, largely attributed to reduced interest income and losses from its associate, Air India. The airline's stake in Air India has become a financial drag, with analysts noting that Air India's losses were deeper than anticipated and are expected to persist. Despite the profit drop, Singapore Airlines stated that demand for air travel and cargo remains strong, though it faces a volatile operating environment. However, some investment analysts have downgraded the stock, citing weaker cargo demand and higher operating costs as significant concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

The suspect, identified as a 27-year-old from Las Vegas with a documented mental health history, used an M4 rifle in the attack.

          <p>Ryne Sandberg, the legendary Chicago Cubs second baseman and Baseball Hall of Famer, has passed away at the age of 65 following a battle with prostate cancer. Remembered for his integrity and competitive spirit, Sandberg was a 10-time All-Star, a nine-time Gold Glove winner, and the 1984 National League MVP. His iconic performance in the 1984 "Sandberg Game" helped propel the Cubs to their first postseason appearance in decades. After his playing career, he managed in the minor leagues and for the Philadelphia Phillies, later serving as a beloved ambassador for the Cubs, who unveiled a statue in his honor just last year.</p>

          <p>Immigrant rights advocates have filed a class-action lawsuit against a new Trump administration policy that mandates detention without bail for immigrants arrested by ICE while their deportation cases are pending. This policy reverses the long-standing practice of allowing individuals who are not considered flight or safety risks to be released on bond. The lawsuit argues the policy is a misinterpretation of the law and violates due process rights, causing "catastrophic" harm by separating families and detaining individuals with deep community ties for extended periods. The administration defends the policy as a measure to close security "loopholes," but critics say it is an arbitrary and draconian measure.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah II to finalize plans for an airlift of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip, a day after announcing the joint effort. The move comes as Israel faces increasing international calls to ease aid restrictions amid warnings of widespread starvation in the besieged enclave. A recent survey indicates that nearly three-quarters of Germans support applying more diplomatic pressure on Israel to address the humanitarian crisis. While Germany remains one of Israel's strongest allies, the government is responding to both domestic and international demands to alleviate the suffering of civilians in Gaza.</p>

He allowed only one run in the first inning before settling in and retiring 10 consecutive hitters at one point. The Dodgers' offense provided ample support, with key contributions from Mookie Betts, Shohei Ohtani, and Teoscar Hernández, highlighting the team's potent combination of strong pitching and hitting.</p>

          <p>Under international pressure, Israel has begun allowing more humanitarian aid into Gaza, including food convoys and airdrops, to address a severe hunger crisis. However, the United Nations warns that the current volume of aid is merely a fraction of what is needed to prevent mass starvation, with at least 500 trucks required daily compared to the 120 that entered recently. The desperation is so extreme that residents are looting aid trucks in a phenomenon charities call "self-distribution."

The memo clarifies that workers can discuss religion, display religious items, and invite coworkers to services, provided the expression does not become harassing and ceases if requested. This policy, which builds on 1997 Clinton-era guidance, is part of a broader Trump administration push to protect religious expression.

          <p>A new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union is being viewed by some economists as an imbalanced deal that heavily favors the United States. The pact imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports while eliminating tariffs on American goods exported to the EU, a reversal of the previous low-tariff environment. In addition, the EU has pledged to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and make $600 billion in investments. While the Trump administration touts the deal as a win for American manufacturers and farmers, analysts project it will reduce the EU's annual GDP and hurt its exporters, who accepted the terms to avoid even higher threatened tariffs.</p>

          <p>Two senior officials in the Justice Department's antitrust division, Roger Alford and Bill Rinner, have been fired amid growing internal friction over the handling of major monopoly investigations. Both were top deputies to Assistant Attorney General Gail Slater and had been placed on administrative leave prior to their dismissal, with insubordination reportedly cited as the reason. The firings follow reports of significant tension within the division concerning its approach to cases against major corporations like Capital One, Apple, and Google. The division has been a key component of the Trump administration's efforts to enforce antitrust laws and challenge corporate consolidation.</p>

          <p>USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA, seeking an injunction that would allow him to play this season after the organization denied his waiver for a sixth year of eligibility. The lawsuit challenges the NCAA's "Five-Year Rule," arguing it is anticompetitive, especially given disruptions from the pandemic and his personal circumstances. Wingfield, who transferred to USC with the expectation of playing, claims the denial robs him of a significant NIL opportunity and a chance to enhance his professional prospects. This legal action follows similar successful court challenges by other athletes who were granted additional seasons of eligibility.</p>

Cramer also notes a potential "tariff ennui," as investors have seen President Trump's pattern of threatening high tariffs before settling for a less severe deal. With other major trade negotiations still pending and a busy week of economic news ahead, the market is unlikely to react significantly to trade deals alone. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a landmark case, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has been found guilty of witness tampering and fraud, becoming the first ex-president in the nation's history to be convicted of a crime. A Bogotá court determined that Uribe, who served from 2002 to 2010, attempted to bribe witnesses in a separate investigation into his alleged ties to right-wing paramilitary groups. The highly politicized case originated from a 2012 accusation Uribe made against a left-wing senator, which backfired and led to a probe against Uribe himself.

This reliance on media, particularly Fox News, makes him susceptible to manipulation and misinformation, a significant concern in an age of deepfakes.
