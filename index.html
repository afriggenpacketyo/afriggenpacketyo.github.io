        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Moderna has lowered the upper end of its 2025 revenue forecast, now expecting between $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion, citing a delay in Covid booster shipments to the United Kingdom. The company's CFO clarified the delivery is simply moving from late 2025 to the first quarter of 2026 to align with the UK's fiscal year, with no change to the contract's overall value. Despite the revised outlook and a 10% workforce reduction, Moderna's second-quarter results surpassed Wall Street expectations, with a smaller-than-anticipated loss and higher revenue, largely driven by cost-cutting measures and strong Covid vaccine sales.

          <p>The Trump administration has formally announced new, higher tariffs on goods from more than 60 countries, set to take effect within a week. The duties vary significantly, with rates as high as 41% for Syria, while most nations will face tariffs of at least 10%. The policy categorizes partners based on their trade balance with the U.S., imposing higher rates on countries with which the U.S. runs a larger deficit. The announcement also confirmed a tariff increase on Canadian goods from 25% to 35%, prompting disappointment from Ottawa and a rebuke of protectionism from Beijing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way to save money with returns that can outpace inflation, providing the benefit of locking in high rates for a set term. While national average yields for CDs are relatively low, top online banks are offering significantly more competitive rates, with some one-year CDs yielding as high as 4.40% APY. The article notes an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently provide higher returns than long-term ones. To maximize earnings, consumers are advised to explore online banks and consider a laddering strategy, which involves investing in multiple CDs with staggered maturity dates.

          <p>Amid a challenging housing market with high rates and limited inventory, understanding current mortgage interest rates is crucial for potential buyers and refinancers. As of late July 2025, national average rates for a 30-year mortgage are around 6.78%, while a 15-year loan averages 6.00%. To secure a favorable rate, experts recommend strengthening one's credit profile, as the best terms are typically offered to borrowers with scores in the mid-to-high 700s. Additionally, shopping around and comparing different lenders is essential, as rates and fees can vary significantly, impacting the total cost of the loan over its lifetime.

          <p>African countries are confronting economic uncertainty following the Trump administration's announcement of new tariffs, with South Africa facing a specific 30% increase. South African officials expressed frustration after months of unsuccessful negotiations, warning the tariff could lead to the loss of 100,000 jobs. Other nations like Lesotho, a major textile producer, have been severely impacted by tariff threats, leading to factory closures. The new duties, mostly ranging from 10-15% for other African countries, raise concerns about the future of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which provides duty-free access to U.S. markets for many nations.

          <p>The White House has issued an ultimatum to 17 major pharmaceutical companies, demanding they commit to lowering U.S. prescription drug prices to a "most favored nation" (MFN) level by September 29. The letters insist that firms not offer better prices to other developed countries than they do in the U.S. and that they must provide MFN prices to all Medicaid patients. This move, part of President Trump's long-standing effort to reduce drug costs, has caused healthcare stocks to tumble. While some pharmaceutical executives have publicly agreed with the principle of price equalization, the industry is scrambling to respond amid uncertainty over potential tariffs.

As the sixth named storm of the season, Floris is forecast to have its most disruptive impact on the northern half of the UK, with potential wind gusts of 60 to 70 mph, and up to 85 mph in exposed coastal areas of Scotland. The storm's development is being fueled by an active jet stream in the Atlantic.

Chevron achieved record worldwide production of 3.4 million barrels per day, with U.S. output seeing an 8% increase.

The article emphasizes that online banks can offer these higher rates due to lower overhead costs compared to brick-and-mortar institutions.

The price is influenced by a variety of factors, including global supply and demand, prevailing economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. Additionally, currency movements, particularly the strength of the U.S. dollar, and the policies of central banks, which hold significant gold reserves, play a crucial role in determining its market value.

          <p>At the urging of Donald Trump, Texas Republicans have unveiled a new congressional map designed to secure five additional seats for the party in the upcoming midterm elections. The proposed redistricting achieves this by strategically reconfiguring districts in South Texas and major metro areas like Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston, effectively diluting the voting power of Democratic and non-white communities. Critics and voting rights groups argue the map is an extreme gerrymander that diminishes the influence of Black and Latino voters, who have driven the state's population growth. The plan is already facing legal scrutiny under the Voting Rights Act for potentially creating districts that prevent minority communities from electing their preferred candidates.</p>

The new U.S. tariffs target 69 trading partners with rates ranging from 10% to 41%.

Yoon's legal team claims he is unable to participate in legal proceedings due to various health issues, including a risk of blindness from lack of medical treatment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newcastle United has turned down an initial offer from Liverpool for Swedish international striker Alexander Isak. The bid was reportedly worth £110 million plus add-ons, which is below Newcastle's valuation of approximately £150 million for the 25-year-old player. Isak, who was left out of Newcastle's pre-season tour, is said to be interested in exploring a move away from the club. It is uncertain if Liverpool will return with an improved offer, but manager Arne Slot is reportedly very keen to add the striker to his squad as the Premier League champions continue a busy summer of spending in the transfer market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant number of international aid organizations have remained publicly silent despite facing drastic budget cuts from the Trump administration, a strategy some experts term "anticipatory silence." Many groups, financially dependent on U.S. government contracts, fear that speaking out against the cuts could lead to further targeting and the loss of remaining programs. This has created a fierce internal debate within the non-profit sector about the most effective response. While some advocate for quiet, behind-the-scenes diplomacy, others argue that silence allows the administration to control the narrative and that they have a moral obligation to protest policies that harm vulnerable populations worldwide.</p>

          <p>Two massive wildfires in the western U.S. are now so large and hot that they are creating their own weather phenomena, including towering "fire clouds." The Dragon Bravo Fire on the Grand Canyon's North Rim has grown to over 164 square miles, while another fire in Monroe, Utah, has burned 75 square miles. These blazes are generating pyrocumulus and pyrocumulonimbus clouds, which can produce powerful, erratic winds and even fire-fueled thunderstorms, making firefighting efforts extremely dangerous and unpredictable. This phenomenon highlights the increasing intensity of wildfires, which scientists say may become more common due to climate change, drought, and extreme weather events.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration recently authorized the incineration of nearly $10 million worth of birth control, including IUDs, implants, and pills, that had been purchased by USAID for distribution in low-income countries. The action is a direct result of sweeping cuts to foreign aid programs by the administration, which has also restricted the transfer of such supplies to non-profits that provide abortion-related services. Critics argue the destruction of these vital contraceptives is a devastating blow to global women's health, putting women at risk of unplanned pregnancies and unsafe abortions. The move is seen as part of a broader policy shift against contraception access both abroad and domestically.</p>

Their popularity has caused new editions to sell out in minutes, driving Pop Mart's profits and leading to a recent price increase from $22 to $28. Despite rising costs and difficulties in purchasing due to high demand and measures to thwart bots, the trend shows no signs of slowing, with fans considering the dolls a form of "social currency."</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant "brain drain" of climate scientists, with many top researchers leaving American institutions for opportunities abroad, particularly in Asia. A professor at City University of Hong Kong noted that half of the recent candidates for professorships were from leading U.S. universities like Harvard, MIT, and Yale. This exodus is attributed to a hostile political climate and funding cuts for climate research in the U.S. The article suggests this trend could signal a major shift in global scientific leadership, as other nations invest heavily in attracting top talent to address the climate crisis, while American scientific progress is hampered.</p>

This marks the fourth batch of subsidies this year, bringing the annual total to the 300 billion yuan target. The funds are part of a broader trade-in program for goods like automobiles and home appliances, which has already generated over 1.7 trillion yuan in sales revenue in 2025. These measures underscore Beijing's strategy to bolster its economy by making domestic consumption a more central pillar of growth, as evidenced by a 5% rise in retail sales in the first half of the year.</p>

While the city became a hub of mass production, Pewabic focused on handcrafted tiles and vessels, gaining fame for its unique, iridescent glazes. The studio, now a non-profit, continues to use much of its original 1912 equipment to create its products by hand. In an age of automation and AI, this commitment to craftsmanship has found a renewed appreciation, allowing the historic pottery to achieve its best sales year ever in 2024 and ensuring its legacy continues.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines has begun selling its first-ever assigned seats for flights starting in January 2026, with prices varying based on the route, travel date, and seat location. This marks a major departure from its long-standing open-seating model. For example, on a peak travel route, selecting a "preferred" seat could cost an additional $41-$46 each way, while an extra-legroom seat could be $96. The move aligns Southwest with its competitors, who generate billions from ancillary fees, and follows pressure from activist investors to maximize revenue. While elite status holders and credit card users will receive some exemptions, the change could add significant costs for many travelers.</p>
