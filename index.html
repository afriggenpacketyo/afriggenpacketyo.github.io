          <p>Procter & Gamble reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations. Despite the strong performance, the consumer goods company issued a cautious outlook for the 2026 fiscal year, anticipating a significant financial headwind from tariffs. P&G projects that tariffs, along with other costs, will reduce its earnings by approximately $1 billion. This forecast comes as the company prepares for a leadership transition, with COO Shailesh Jejurikar set to take over as CEO in January. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>PayPal announced second-quarter results that exceeded analyst predictions for both earnings and revenue, leading the company to raise its full-year guidance. The digital payments firm highlighted accelerating growth in its Venmo platform, with revenue increasing over 20% and payment volume growing at its fastest rate in three years. Despite the positive report and improved outlook for profitability, the company's stock experienced a slight decline in after-hours trading. The results reflect CEO Alex Chriss's strategy to focus on more profitable revenue streams and better monetize key assets like Venmo and Braintree. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk dropped by 17% after it reduced its full-year sales and profit forecasts. The revision is primarily due to weaker-than-expected growth for its popular obesity drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic in the United States. The company cited persistent competition from compounded alternatives and a slower market expansion as key factors for the lowered outlook. This adjustment signals significant challenges for one of the company's most prominent and profitable product lines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A former senior official from Israel's Shin Bet security agency has outlined a new two-pronged strategy for securing the release of hostages held by Hamas. The proposal involves first separating Gazan civilians from Hamas through designated humanitarian zones to control aid flow, and second, conducting direct, localized negotiations with those holding the hostages, offering them money and safety. This approach comes as broader negotiations have stalled, with the U.S. and Israel withdrawing their teams from talks in Qatar. The official argues that the current negotiation process benefits Hamas and that a more direct and forceful approach is necessary.</p>

          <p>A significant overhaul of the federal student loan system has been signed into law, affecting nearly 43 million borrowers. The legislation, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, introduces new borrowing caps for graduate students and parents using PLUS loans. It also mandates the shutdown of the Biden-era SAVE repayment plan by 2028, replacing the current seven repayment plans with two new ones. The changes, conceived by House Republicans, represent a history-making shift in federal higher education financing, with full implementation of the new plans expected to take a year.</p>

          <p>Major technology companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Google are engaged in an intense and expensive competition to recruit the world's top artificial intelligence engineers. With a small pool of qualified experts, these firms are reportedly offering massive pay packages, sometimes reaching up to $100 million, to lure talent from startups and rivals. This hiring binge is reshaping the industry, as large corporations invest billions to build superintelligence labs and secure the brains behind the next generation of AI. The trend is putting immense pressure on smaller AI startups struggling to retain their key employees.</p>

          <p>The UK government is initiating a world-first study to test dog and cat feces for the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, or superbugs. Health experts are concerned that these dangerous pathogens could be spreading from pets to humans through close contact, posing a significant public health threat. The four-year study, run by Scotland's Royal College, will monitor healthy pets to understand the transmission of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The World Health Organization considers AMR one of the greatest threats to humanity, and this research aims to provide critical data to help combat its spread.</p>

          <p>A conflict is emerging within the Trump administration between the public health goals of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the deregulatory agenda of EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. While Kennedy's 'Make America Healthy Again' (MAHA) initiative targets environmental toxins like pesticides and PFAS, the EPA is simultaneously relaxing regulations on these same substances. This has led to frustration among MAHA supporters, who see the administration's actions as protecting corporate polluters at the expense of public health. The article highlights the deep ideological and policy contradictions that threaten to undermine Kennedy's stated mission.</p>

          <p>According to Chinese state media, a unit of the People's Liberation Army Air Force flew J-20 stealth fighters through the Tsushima Strait, a narrow and strategic waterway between Japan and South Korea. The transit of China's most advanced combat aircraft was notably not reported by either Tokyo or Seoul, both of which heavily monitor the area. This suggests the J-20's stealth capabilities may have allowed it to pass through the chokepoint without being detected by Japanese or South Korean radar systems. The incident highlights China's growing aerial capabilities and the potential challenges it poses to regional security monitoring.</p>

          <p>North Korea has stated that the United States should abandon its long-standing demand for complete denuclearization if it wishes to resume talks. Kim Yo Jong, the influential sister of leader Kim Jong Un, indicated that while the personal relationship between her brother and President Trump is "not bad," it cannot be used as a basis for negotiations aimed at dismantling Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal. This declaration sets a hardline position ahead of any potential diplomatic engagement, suggesting North Korea now considers its nuclear status non-negotiable and expects the U.S. to accept this "changed reality."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's comprehensive tariffs, set to take effect on August 1, are likely to lead to higher food prices for American consumers, according to a new analysis by the Tax Foundation. The report notes that while tariffs aim to boost domestic production, the U.S. does not produce certain popular imports like Brazilian coffee or enough of others, like bananas, to meet demand. As a result, consumers will likely bear the cost of the new import taxes. The analysis estimates that food costs could rise by 3.4% in the short term, impacting household budgets.

          <p>Enthusiasts at the de Havilland Aircraft Museum in the UK have completed a remarkable restoration of the world's first commercial passenger jet, the de Havilland Comet. The aircraft, which first flew with passengers in 1952, ushered in the jet age but was grounded after a series of catastrophic structural failures. Volunteers have painstakingly recreated the fuselage and its luxurious 1950s interior, offering a unique glimpse into the dawn of jet travel. The restored plane serves as a tribute to a pioneering, yet tragic, chapter of aviation history that ultimately led to safer aircraft design.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated 1,246 federally funded medical research grants worth $5.5 billion that focused on or included LGBTQ+ populations. The administration justified the cuts by labeling the research as based on "nonscientific categories" and having little return on investment. Critics, including scientists and public health advocates, argue this move will leave science in the dark and worsen significant health disparities faced by the LGBTQ+ community. The terminated studies, which had all passed peer review, covered a wide range of topics from Alzheimer's disease to cancer, raising concerns about the long-term impact on evidence-based care.</p>

The sold-out production, directed by Sergio Trujillo, is being staged as a modern rock concert and is seen by many as a powerful statement on representation and faith in today's cultural landscape. The cast and creative team hope the non-traditional casting will highlight the universal and transcendent themes of the iconic 1971 musical.</p>

However, astronomers advise that viewing conditions this year will be significantly compromised by a bright waning gibbous moon, which will be about 92% full. The moonlight is expected to wash out all but the brightest meteors, reducing the visible rate from a potential 100 per hour to far fewer. While the shower is known for producing spectacular fireballs, which may still be visible, experts recommend managing expectations for this year's display.</p>
