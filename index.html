          <p>Elliott Investment Management has taken a substantial position worth over $2 billion in the enterprise software company Workday. This move comes shortly after Workday announced a new multiyear plan focused on increasing shareholder value, which includes a $5 billion share repurchase program and significant margin expansion goals. Elliott, known for its deep research and amicable engagements in similar situations, has publicly expressed support for Workday's new CEO and strategic direction, suggesting a collaborative effort to boost the company's underperforming stock. The investment is seen as a vote of confidence in the new leadership's ability to transition from a growth-at-all-costs model to one of profitable, efficient operation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant cyberattack has targeted Collins Aerospace's 'Muse' software, a system used by multiple airlines for check-in and boarding at major European airports, including Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The disruption has forced a switch to manual processing, leading to extensive delays, long passenger queues, and some flight cancellations. This incident highlights the aviation industry's vulnerability to digital system failures, as the interconnected nature of airport operations means localized problems can quickly cascade into widespread travel chaos.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dairy farmers in Vermont are confronting a severe economic crisis due to an ongoing drought that has decimated feed crops like corn and alfalfa. With 80% of the state experiencing severe or extreme drought conditions, farmers are forced to spend thousands on supplemental feed and, in some cases, haul water for their cattle as wells run dry. This financial strain threatens the viability of many farms in a state where dairy generates $5.4 billion annually. Despite the hardship, government assistance is not yet triggered, leaving farmers to adapt to increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather patterns on their own.</p>

          <p>A new analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data shows that Tampa, Florida, experienced the fastest income growth among major cities, with a median household income jump of over 15% between 2023 and 2024. Four California cities, including Long Beach, San Jose, and San Francisco, also ranked in the top ten for income growth, largely driven by the high-paying tech sector. While some cities saw significant percentage increases, their median incomes still remain below the national average of $83,730. The data highlights varying economic dynamics across the country, with factors like retiree populations and industry-specific competition for talent influencing local wage trends.

          <p>South African police have arrested five North American citizens and a local farm caretaker after uncovering a large-scale methamphetamine lab on a farm near Johannesburg. Acting on a tip about a strange chemical smell, authorities discovered precursor chemicals, manufacturing equipment, and approximately $20 million worth of crystal meth. The five foreign nationals, who were in the country illegally, attempted to flee but were apprehended and now face drug and immigration charges.

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrats have proposed establishing emergency "Nightingale processing centres" to address the significant backlog of asylum claims and reduce reliance on costly hotel accommodations for applicants. The plan, modeled after the temporary hospitals set up during the COVID-19 pandemic, would be supplemented by doubling the number of caseworkers to expedite decisions. This initiative is part of the party's focus on law and order, which also includes a proposal to open police desks in public venues like supermarkets and libraries. The government's current goal is to end the use of asylum hotels by 2029.</p>

          <p>A 1,000-pound American-made bomb from World War II was discovered at a construction site in Hong Kong's busy Quarry Bay district, prompting the evacuation of approximately 6,000 people from 1,900 households. Police successfully defused the nearly five-foot-long device in an operation that concluded Saturday morning without any injuries. The discovery is a reminder of the city's history as a target for Allied air raids during the Japanese occupation. Such finds of unexploded wartime ordnance are not uncommon in Hong Kong and across Europe, often leading to large-scale public safety operations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent actions, particularly the FCC's threats against broadcasters critical of the president, have exposed a growing rift within the Republican party over the principle of free speech. FCC Director Brendan Carr cited a new "permission structure" provided by Trump's election to justify a more disruptive approach to media regulation, a stance that has been praised by some allies but sharply criticized by others, like Senator Ted Cruz, as authoritarian. This ideological reversal from the party's previous championing of free speech and anti-cancel culture rhetoric is creating cognitive dissonance among supporters and observers.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order imposing a new $100,000 annual fee on companies for each H-1B visa applicant, a program designed for skilled foreign workers. The administration cited program "abuse" as the reason for the drastic fee increase, which is set to take effect immediately and will apply for six years per applicant. This policy is expected to make it prohibitively expensive for many businesses, particularly smaller companies and startups, to hire foreign talent, potentially impacting U.S. competitiveness in sectors like technology.

          <p>A retired grandfather's persistent and severe heartburn, which caused nausea, a fear of eating, and significant weight loss, was ultimately diagnosed as chronic mesenteric ischemia, a rare and serious condition. The illness occurs when narrowed arteries restrict blood flow to the small intestine, leading to intense pain after meals and malnutrition. After initial diagnostic challenges, vascular surgeon Dr. Gabriel Wallace performed a minimally invasive procedure to place a stent in the affected artery, restoring blood flow and immediately relieving the symptoms. The patient's story highlights the importance of self-advocacy in healthcare and seeking further opinions when symptoms persist without a clear diagnosis.</p>

Factors cited for the decline include chronic absenteeism, increased screen time, and a general lack of student engagement with complex texts.

As a demographic that constitutes over 12% of the federal workforce—a key pathway to middle-class stability—these job losses are particularly devastating and have prompted nearly 300,000 Black women to exit the labor force in three months. The article details the psychological and financial toll on those affected, who describe the experience as traumatic and destabilizing.

These changes cater to a growing preference for cremation and more personalized memorials, though they have drawn criticism from Christian churches and conservatives concerned about the decline of traditional cemeteries.

          <h2>Financial Experts Recommend the '20-4-10' Rule for Affordable Car Buying</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To determine if a car purchase is affordable, financial planners suggest using the "20-4-10" rule as a guideline. This framework advises making a down payment of at least 20% of the vehicle's price, financing the car for no more than four years, and ensuring that total monthly vehicle expenses do not exceed 10% of your income. Adhering to these principles helps lower overall interest payments, prevents becoming "upside down" on the loan, and ensures transportation costs don't compromise other financial goals like retirement savings. While high car prices can make the rule challenging to follow, it serves as a crucial starting point for responsible budgeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At least 14 people were killed in overnight Israeli airstrikes in Gaza City, according to Palestinian health officials. One strike hit a home, killing six members of the same family, who were relatives of a local hospital director. The attacks are part of an intensified Israeli offensive in the area, where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are sheltering. Israel has been urging civilians to evacuate south to a designated humanitarian zone, but many are unable or unwilling to move, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian crisis. The ongoing operation makes a near-term ceasefire unlikely as the death toll in Gaza surpasses 65,000.</p>

          <p>Sacramento police have arrested a 64-year-old man in connection with a drive-by shooting that targeted the building of ABC affiliate station ABC10. At least three rounds struck the building's exterior on Friday afternoon, hitting a window, though no injuries were reported. The motive for the shooting is still under investigation. The incident drew condemnation from California Governor Gavin Newsom's office, which stated that "any act of violence toward journalists is an attack on our democracy itself."

          <p>This opinion article draws a parallel between the Trump administration's response to the assassination of Charlie Kirk and the Nazi party's exploitation of the 1933 Reichstag fire. The author argues that, just as the Nazis used the fire as a pretext to suspend civil liberties and crush political opposition, the current administration is using Kirk's death to justify a massive repression of the left. The piece details how officials are blaming the entire political left without evidence and threatening to dismantle non-profit organizations. While acknowledging key differences between 1930s Germany and the modern U.S., the author warns that the tactics are a classic page from the authoritarian playbook.</p>

          <h2>Evidence Indicates Charlie Kirk's Killer Was Motivated by Left-Leaning Views</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis critiques the rapid spread of a narrative on the left that the man who killed conservative activist Charlie Kirk was a far-right extremist. Charging documents and statements from the alleged shooter's family indicate the opposite: Tyler Robinson had been leaning more to the left, was supportive of trans rights, and told his parents and roommate that he acted because Kirk "spreads too much hate." The author argues that the left's embrace of the comforting but false "groyper" theory illustrates a universal human impulse toward ideological confirmation bias. The piece calls for progressives to adhere to the "reality-based community" by guarding against their own comforting fictions.</p>

          <p>In his new book, analyst Dan Wang presents a paradigm for understanding U.S.-China dynamics, contrasting America's "lawyerly society" with China's "engineering state." He argues that while China's system, dominated by engineers, has led to remarkable achievements in infrastructure, manufacturing, and technology deployment, it has also stifled service industries and contributed to youth unemployment by prioritizing national power over individual happiness. Conversely, he suggests the U.S. has become physically stagnant and should learn from China's dynamism in building and manufacturing. Wang posits that despite their differences, both nations are prone to self-inflicted harm in the name of competition.</p>

          <p>Estonia has invoked Article 4 of the NATO treaty to request urgent consultations with allies after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace over the Gulf of Finland. The jets, which had their transponders off and no flight plan, were intercepted by Finnish and Italian aircraft operating under NATO's Baltic Air Policing mission. Russia has denied the incursion, but the incident is seen as part of a pattern of escalating provocations against NATO's eastern flank. The move highlights the strategic uncertainty for European powers, who must decide how to respond to Russian aggression without triggering a wider conflict.</p>

The project demonstrates that sustainable living is achievable with off-the-shelf technologies and careful planning.

Activists state they are advising staff to be cautious but will continue to legally observe raids and provide aid, asserting their First Amendment rights.

          <p>Massive, youth-led protests in Nepal have resulted in the overthrow of the government and the appointment of Sushila Karki, the country's first-ever female prime minister. The turmoil was sparked by an anti-corruption movement on social media, led by Gen Z activists who exposed the lavish lifestyles of political elites in a country grappling with high unemployment. When the government suspended social media, thousands took to the streets, leading to violent clashes that left over 70 dead. The rapid upheaval reflects a broader trend of youth-driven political change in South Asia, fueled by economic pressure and frustration with entrenched, corrupt leadership.</p>
