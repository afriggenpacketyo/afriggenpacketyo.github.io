          <p>A mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis resulted in the deaths of an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old, with 17 others, including 14 children, injured during a morning Mass. The shooter, who fired through church windows with multiple weapons, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. Authorities are investigating the motive, examining social media accounts and notes left behind by the suspect. The community is grappling with the profound grief and shock of this "deliberate act of violence against innocent children."</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel faced significant public backlash and a nearly $100 million market value dip after unveiling a new logo that removed its iconic "Uncle Herschel" character. Brand experts criticized the redesign for abandoning the company's heritage and "brand story," which evokes a folksy, homestyle image. Following the uproar and a public urging from former President Trump, the restaurant chain announced it would scrap the new design and retain its original "Old Timer" logo. This reversal highlights the perils of altering established branding without understanding customer emotional investment.</p>

          <p>Nvidia is set to report its fiscal second-quarter earnings, with analysts expecting adjusted earnings per share of $1.01 and revenue of $46.06 billion, representing a 53% year-over-year growth. This surge is driven by insatiable demand for GPUs in the generative AI era, particularly from its data center business, which constitutes 88% of total sales. Key questions for the company include the performance of its new Blackwell chips and the state of its China business, especially after recent U.S. export controls and China's push for homegrown chips.

          <p>A new Lending Tree study reveals that nearly 6 million full-time U.S. workers without a bachelor's degree earned at least $100,000 in 2023, challenging the notion that a college diploma is essential for high-paying jobs. Occupations like software developer, sales engineer, aircraft pilot, and even chief executive were identified as fields where a significant percentage of non-graduates achieve six-figure salaries. This trend reflects a growing number of employers loosening degree requirements and highlights alternative pathways to financial success amid rising tuition costs and student debt concerns.</p>

          <p>This article details the shocking true story of Dino Guglielmelli, a successful supplement company millionaire, who hired Rick Fuhrmann to kill his ex-model wife, Monica Olsen, amidst a contentious divorce and custody battle. Guglielmelli, consumed by anger over alimony payments and perceived betrayal, repeatedly pressed Fuhrmann for Monica's death, even suggesting horrific methods. Fuhrmann, however, was not a killer and ultimately exposed the plot to authorities, leading to Guglielmelli's arrest after a sting operation.

          <p>Florida's "Alligator Alcatraz," a controversial tented immigration detention camp in the Everglades, is expected to be vacated within days, complying with a federal judge's order to shut it down.

Despite an appeal from Governor DeSantis's administration, officials are proceeding with the closure, with hundreds of detainees already transferred.

Citing the FBI raid on John Bolton's residence as a parallel, the author argues such actions, even with legal pretexts, normalize exceptional measures.

The age of claiming benefits significantly impacts the monthly payout, with delayed retirement credits ceasing at age 70.

          <p>Taylor Swift's engagement to Travis Kelce prompted a flurry of reactions from numerous brands, eager to leverage the cultural moment for promotion. Companies like DoorDash and Olipop offered Swift-themed discounts, while others created memes or referenced her songs. Marketing experts acknowledge the strategy's potential to connect with audiences but question the authenticity and saturation of such opportunistic campaigns. Some argue that while a quick, relevant response can be effective, an indiscriminate rush to capitalize risks consumer ambivalence or annoyance. Brands like Ralph Lauren and Starbucks were praised for more integrated or witty approaches.</p>

          <p>Despite speculation of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September, credit card interest rates are unlikely to fall soon. Most credit card APRs are variable, but issuers typically pass on cuts slower and less generously than hikes. With average APRs near 22% and record-high credit card debt, issuers remain cautious due to rising delinquencies and inflation. Consumers seeking lower rates should consider negotiating with their issuer, balance transfers, debt management plans, or personal loans, rather than waiting for market-wide changes.

This legal action comes after Sting sold his entire songwriting catalog for an estimated $300 million in 2022.

Robinson, who was seen on footage near a motionless person, claimed self-defense.

While initial proponents saw UBI as a poverty solution, recent findings complicate this view.

Researchers emphasize that cash alone cannot fix systemic market failures in areas like housing or healthcare, and social support networks are vital for maximizing financial aid's benefits.

The cross, found in a courtyard, provides concrete evidence linking the dwellings to a nearby monastery from the seventh and eighth centuries. Experts believe senior monks likely used these cottage-like homes for seclusion.
