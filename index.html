        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fragile truce between India and Pakistan is holding after a four-day conflict involving drones, missiles, and shelling. President Trump announced the cease-fire was achieved with U.S. mediation, a move praised by Pakistan but met with sensitivity in India, which prefers to frame relations as bilateral. India initially avoided mentioning the U.S. role, fearing domestic perceptions of succumbing to outside pressure. Despite the agreement, uncertainty remains about the long-term stability of the cease-fire, as both countries claim victory and civilians express relief but remain cautious. Relevant context: The conflict was initiated following a terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, escalating tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Miami Hurricanes linebacker Adarius Hayes was injured in a two-car crash in Largo, Florida, that resulted in three fatalities, including two children. The crash occurred when a Dodge Durango, driven by Hayes, collided with a Kia Soul making a left turn.

The driver of the Kia Soul, 78-year-old Gail Price, and two child passengers, Jabari Elijah Solomon and Charlie Herbert Solomon Rivera, died as a result of the collision; the investigation is ongoing, and no charges have been filed at this time.</p>

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the US and China have made 'substantial progress' in de-escalating the trade war following high-level talks in Geneva. Bessent and China's vice-premier He Lifeng engaged in closed-door discussions, marking the first meeting since the US imposed steep tariffs on China in January. While details remain undisclosed until Monday, President Trump praised the talks for initiating a 'total reset' in relations between the two countries.

          <p>California, despite being the fourth-largest economy globally, is facing significant challenges, including the aftermath of devastating wildfires, a $1 billion budget shortfall in Los Angeles, and a growing homelessness crisis. The state's population may decline due to the fires and stricter immigration policies, with many young people leaving due to housing shortages. The state's leaders express optimism and resilience despite these challenges, acknowledging that the coming years will be difficult due to budget deficits, higher taxes, and climate change. The state's political leadership is at a crossroads with a new gubernatorial election approaching and a shifting political landscape.</p>

          <p>A U.S.-funded charter plane carrying dozens of white South Africans, known as Afrikaners, departed Johannesburg for the United States, where the Trump administration is welcoming them as refugees. These Afrikaners claim to have faced discrimination, job denials, and violence due to their race in South Africa. This initiative contrasts with Mr. Trump's halting of virtually all other refugee admissions, raising criticism from aid groups and the South African government, who view it as a politically motivated attempt to discredit the country. The Afrikaner refugee program has strained relations between South Africa and the United States, amid ongoing tensions over land ownership and racial inequalities.</p>

European leaders had set a Monday deadline for Russia to accept a 30-day cease-fire or face additional sanctions. Mr. Zelensky responded cautiously to the Russian counteroffer of direct talks, insisting again on a halt in the fighting, but then added that he would personally attend negotiations. The flurry of exchanges came hours after Mr. Putin effectively rejected a the Monday cease-fire deadline and instead proposed that direct talks between representatives of the two countries take place on Thursday in Istanbul.</p>

President Trump issued an executive order in February directing officials to resettle Afrikaners, claiming they faced 'government-sponsored race-based discrimination,' a claim strongly denied by South Africa's government. This initiative contrasts with the Trump administration's move to ban most other refugees, and the processing of Afrikaners has been unusually fast.

          <p>Hamas announced that it would free Edan Alexander, the last living American citizen held captive in Gaza, days before President Trump is expected to arrive in the region. Khalil al-Hayya, Hamas’s lead negotiator, did not say when Mr. Alexander would be released and what, if anything, Hamas would get in exchange. U.S. officials negotiated directly with Hamas leaders to secure Mr. Alexander’s release, breaking with the traditional American boycott of the group, according to two Palestinians and a diplomat familiar with Hamas decision-making.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is reportedly prepared to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet, described as a 'palace in the sky,' as a gift from Qatar's royal family, igniting accusations of bribery and corruption. Qatar acknowledged discussions with the US about a potential transfer of a plane for Trump's temporary use as Air Force One, but denied that a final decision had been made. Democrats, including Senator Chuck Schumer and Congressman Jamie Raskin, criticized the move, with Raskin suggesting it violates the Constitution without Congressional approval.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced 'substantial progress' in trade talks with China after a weekend of meetings in Geneva, with more details expected on Monday. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer suggested a 'deal' had been reached addressing national security concerns about China's trade practices, though it's unclear if tariffs will be dropped. The Trump administration has accused China of unfair trade practices and has been pressuring China to curb exports of fentanyl precursors. Economists have warned that the trade dispute will slow global growth and fuel inflation, potentially tipping the United States into a recession.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed Special Education Simplified Funding Program raises concerns among parents of students with disabilities about reduced federal oversight and state flexibility. The budget could mean drastically reducing oversight of how states use that money. Under the proposed budget, money earmarked for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) comes with a promise to limit the federal government’s role in education and provide states with greater flexibility. Before 1979, when the education of disabled children was in the hands of the states, many chose to not educate children with disabilities at all.</p>

Some royal watchers warn that unless Charles finds a way to heal the rift with Harry, it could define his reign and undercut messages of tolerance and inclusiveness.
