        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A California parole board denied Erik Menendez's request for release, citing his prison conduct as a primary factor in the decision. The board acknowledged Menendez's claims of past abuse but concluded he still poses an unreasonable risk to public safety, pointing to violations including drug smuggling and inappropriate behavior. Menendez, who along with his brother Lyle was convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, must wait three years for his next parole hearing. His family expressed disappointment but maintained their unwavering support for his eventual release.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has reportedly instructed suppliers to suspend production of its H20 AI chips, which were specifically designed for the Chinese market following U.S. export restrictions. This move comes after Beijing raised national security concerns, suggesting the chips could contain "backdoors," and urged local tech companies to stop purchasing them. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang acknowledged the discussions, expressing hope for a resolution, while the company faces navigating complex trade tensions between the U.S. and China. The halt casts doubt on the chip's future in the lucrative Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

The cautious sentiment follows a five-day losing streak for the S&P 500 in the U.S. market.

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, has begun to move northeastward away from the North Carolina coast after bringing tropical storm conditions to the Outer Banks. While the hurricane is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., officials are warning of life-threatening surf and rip currents along most of the East Coast. Evacuation orders were issued for parts of the Outer Banks due to the risk of significant storm surge and coastal flooding. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that Erin will gradually weaken and transition to a post-tropical storm over the weekend.</p>

          <p>A recent meeting of European leaders at the White House is viewed as a significant display of continued support for Ukraine, though it does little to advance immediate prospects for a fair peace. The gathering served to contrast with a prior, less productive meeting between Presidents Trump and Putin. For many Ukrainians, the visual unity between European allies and President Zelenskyy is more important than specific outcomes, providing a sense of solidarity. However, the article notes that a just resolution, involving the full restoration of Ukrainian territory, remains a distant and challenging goal.</p>

          <h2>Scientific Study Reveals Corn Plants Communicate to Adapt to Their Environment</h2>

          <p>A new study has found that corn plants can communicate with each other by releasing a gas called linalool, which signals neighboring plants to alter their soil composition. This mechanism appears to be a response to planting density, as researchers observed that corn in the inner rows of dense fields suffered less damage from herbivores but also exhibited reduced growth. The international team of scientists suggests that understanding and optimizing this communication process could lead to new strategies for managing pests and potentially increasing crop yields in agricultural settings.</p>

Despite the cooling, this marks the 40th consecutive month that the inflation rate has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with cutting $783 million in research funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The 5-4 decision lifts a lower court's order that had blocked the cuts, which are part of a broader administration effort to eliminate federal spending related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Public health advocates and state attorneys general argued the cuts would cause irreparable harm to scientific progress. The ruling is a significant victory for the administration's agenda, allowing it to cancel numerous grants while the underlying lawsuit continues.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Supreme Court Ruling on Canceled Federal Grants Creates Legal Confusion</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Supreme Court decision regarding the Trump administration's cancellation of NIH research grants has been described as legally convoluted and confusing. The ruling, which involves a jurisdictional dispute between federal district courts and the Court of Federal Claims, creates a complex and lengthy process for plaintiffs seeking to challenge the policy and recover funds. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's dissent criticized the outcome as "Calvinball jurisprudence," suggesting it creates arbitrary rules that ultimately favor the administration and make it difficult to hold government action accountable. The decision could jeopardize critical public health research.</p>

          <p>Families campaigning for an independent inquiry into maternity care at University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust feel "ignored and dismissed" after a meeting with Baroness Amos, the chair of a new national review. The group, who lost babies under the trust's care, stated that the chair seemed unprepared and that no progress was made on their specific demands, including the appointment of senior midwife Donna Ockenden to lead their local inquiry. Their frustration was compounded by the appointment of a former regulator to the review team, which they believe compromises the investigation's independence.</p>

          <p>A lawyer for the online message board 4chan has declared that the company will refuse to pay a proposed £20,000 fine from Ofcom, the UK's media regulator. The fine, which includes daily penalties for non-compliance, was issued for failing to provide information as part of an investigation under the new Online Safety Act. The lawyer argues that as a U.S. company, 4chan is protected by the First Amendment and that American courts will not enforce foreign censorship codes or penal fines. The stance sets up a significant international clash over the extraterritorial reach of the UK's internet regulations.</p>

Newsom stated that California is "neutralizing" the Texas plan to ensure a fair chance for Democrats to control the House of Representatives. The move represents an unprecedented political battle between the nation's two largest states over the drawing of electoral boundaries ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released new voluntary guidelines for baby food manufacturers, urging them to reduce sugar and salt content in their products. The guidance also calls for an end to the promotion of snack foods for babies under one year old and restricts the use of unsubstantiated health claims on packaging. This action follows a BBC investigation that found many popular baby food pouches were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients. Companies have been given an 18-month timeframe to comply, after which the government may consider alternative measures if improvements are not made.</p>

          <p>Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart U.S., stated he was puzzled by the company's stock dropping 4.5% despite what he called an exceptionally strong quarterly performance. Walmart raised its full-year sales and earnings forecast, demonstrating robust topline growth and expanding margins even while absorbing the impact of tariffs. Simon suggested investors may have overreacted to a one-time earnings miss caused by restructuring costs rather than systemic issues. He argued that the retailer's ability to attract and retain shoppers with low prices positions it for continued success. (not investment advice)</p>
