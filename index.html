        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cross-party group of 220 Members of Parliament has signed a letter urging Prime Minister Keir Starmer to formally recognize Palestinian statehood. The letter, backed by over half of Labour's MPs and figures from eight other parties, argues that UK recognition would be a powerful step towards a two-state solution. While Starmer has stated that recognition must be part of a broader peace plan, the letter increases pressure on his government, especially after France committed to similar action. The joint statement from the UK, France, and Germany calls for an immediate ceasefire but does not mention statehood.</p>

          <p>The recent killing of Officer Phillip Wagner in Lorain, Ohio, is part of a disturbing increase in ambush-style attacks on police across the United States. Wagner was fatally shot while parked in his vehicle, an incident that also wounded two other officers. Data analysis reveals that at least 50 officers have been shot in ambushes this year, putting 2025 on track to surpass previous totals. The FBI is studying this trend to develop new training, emphasizing constant situational awareness for officers who are increasingly targeted in unprovoked assaults.</p>

          <p>Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi confidently predicted that Democrats will reclaim the House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm elections, with Hakeem Jeffries becoming the next speaker. Speaking at a summit for young activists, she emphasized the importance of early preparation, drawing parallels to the party's successful campaigns in 2006 and 2018. Pelosi identified mobilizing voters, strong messaging, and fundraising as crucial elements for victory. She also stressed the need to lower former President Trump's approval ratings ahead of the election.</p>

          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the SHARE Act, has been introduced in Congress to encourage public companies to distribute stock to their non-executive employees. The legislation would offer a 3% corporate tax rate reduction to large firms that grant at least 5% of their stock to the lowest-paid 80% of their workforce. Proponents, like Rep. Tom Suozzi, argue the bill could transfer nearly $4 trillion in wealth to about 40 million middle-class Americans, aiming to address wealth inequality. The plan is designed to offset the cost of share dilution with the significant tax cut, potentially boosting employee loyalty and expanding ownership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Balance transfer credit cards offer a temporary 0% APR period to help consumers pay down high-interest debt, but failing to clear the balance before the promotion ends can have costly consequences. Once the introductory period expires, the card’s standard, often high, interest rate applies to the remaining balance, potentially negating any savings. Some cards may even charge deferred interest retroactively from the original transfer date, significantly increasing the debt. To avoid these pitfalls, experts advise creating a strict payment plan and considering debt relief options if the balance remains overwhelming. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Guardian criticizes President Trump's five-day trip to Scotland, arguing it is primarily a taxpayer-funded junket to promote his private business interests. The article notes that the visit is focused on his two golf resorts, including the dedication of a new course named after his mother, with official state business appearing secondary. The author highlights the secrecy surrounding the itinerary and frames the trip as the latest example of Trump exploiting the presidency for personal profit. It contrasts the high cost of such trips with the administration's rhetoric about cutting government spending.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Justice has reversed course on police reform, ending federal investigations and consent decrees for nearly two dozen police departments, including those in Louisville and Minneapolis. These legally binding agreements were a key tool for federal oversight to curb patterns of police misconduct and civil rights violations. The move, announced by the DOJ's civil rights division head, ends a process initiated under the Biden administration following widespread racial justice protests.

          <p>A reflective obituary for professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, who passed away at 71, examines his legacy as arguably the most famous wrestler of all time. The article credits him with popularizing the cartoonish, heroic style of wrestling in the 1980s, becoming a cultural icon who embodied an outlandish, patriotic persona with unwavering conviction. It notes that Hogan, born Terry Bollea, rarely broke character, blurring the lines between his public identity and private life. This commitment to his persona helped him weather numerous controversies, but his later years were marked by racist remarks and polarizing political alliances.</p>

          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has reduced its 2025 financial outlook after reporting a 29% drop in second-quarter operating profit. The company attributed the decline to a €1.3 billion hit from U.S. tariffs in the first half of the year and an additional €700 million in restructuring costs. Consequently, VW lowered its expected operating return on sales for the year. Despite the challenges, the company noted strong product performance, with a 19% rise in order intake in Western Europe and a 62% increase in orders for all-electric vehicles globally.

This theory attempts to explain why Goncalves suffered more than 30 stab wounds and was left disfigured.

Polling suggests a Corbyn-led party could capture around 10% of the vote, primarily drawing support from Labour and the Green Party.

He expresses concern that gaining this expertise will become more difficult as AI automates the foundational tasks through which apprenticeships traditionally occur.
