        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst rising stress levels among young people due to societal pressures and increased media coverage of negative events, the debate around allowing mental health days in schools is intensifying. While proponents highlight the importance of prioritizing mental well-being and destigmatizing mental illness, concerns about absenteeism and potential academic setbacks remain.  Experts suggest that mental health days should be used proactively, rather than reactively, to prevent crises and identify underlying issues, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach that supports both students' mental health and their education.</p>
