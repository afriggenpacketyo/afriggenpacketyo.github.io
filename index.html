            <h2>Retail Sales Exceed Expectations in March Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-16 10:06:23 EDT</div>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Retail sales surged by 1.4% in March, surpassing expectations and indicating robust consumer spending despite concerns about looming tariffs and a weakening economy. The increase, the largest since January 2023, was driven by a 5.3% jump in motor vehicle and parts sales, suggesting consumers were trying to get ahead of potential price increases due to President Trump's tariffs. While sentiment readings have shown widespread fear about the economy, the retail report suggests that consumers are still spending, possibly anticipating higher prices in the future. Other sectors, such as sporting goods, building materials, and food services, also saw significant increases. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Justice Department, under Attorney General Pam Bondi, has filed a civil suit against the state of Maine challenging its policy regarding transgender athletes competing in girls' and women's sports. The lawsuit alleges that Maine's policy violates Title IX by prioritizing gender identity over biological reality, thereby depriving girl athletes of fair competition and exposing them to potential harm. This action is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to highlight the issue of transgender athletes, which they view as politically damaging for Democrats. Maine's governor, Janet Mills, has criticized the administration's efforts as executive overreach and has vowed to fight the lawsuit in court.</p>

            <p>TikTok Shop's sales in the United States have experienced a significant decline following the announcement of reciprocal tariffs on Chinese imports. Gross merchandise volume (GMV) on TikTok Shop fell from US$290.8 million in late March to US$197.4 million last week, reflecting the impact of the trade tensions. This decline is further exacerbated by the planned end of the de minimis exemption, which has allowed duty-free shipments valued below US$800. Many Chinese vendors are now halting their US operations and shifting focus to Europe and Southeast Asia due to concerns about profitability under the new tariff regime. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Container shipping traffic along transpacific routes is experiencing a sharp decline as US tariff policies create uncertainty in global trade.

The drop follows President Trump's announcement of reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries, making it difficult for Chinese exporters to sell to America. Many transpacific shipping companies are resorting to blank sailings, and the upcoming Labor Day holiday is expected to further dampen cargo demand. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The UK government is engaged in negotiations with France to establish a scheme for returning illegal migrants who have crossed the Channel in small boats. In exchange, the UK would accept legal migrants seeking family reunification. The proposed pilot scheme is based on a "one-for-one principle" to discourage smuggling networks. While the Conservatives argue this addresses illegal immigration, others suggest the deterrent effect depends on the number of transfers from the UK to France. The talks follow previous efforts to curb illegal migration, including financial support to France and the controversial Rwanda scheme.</p>

This criticism follows Harvard's refusal to comply with demands from the Department of Education regarding antisemitism and other issues on campus. Trump also criticized Harvard's hiring of former mayors Bill de Blasio and Lori Lightfoot. He suggested that Harvard should lose its tax-exempt status and be taxed as a political entity, arguing that the university is not acting in the public interest.

            <p>The CEO of WH Smith believes that President Trump's tariff war is more likely to lead to price cuts than inflation for many retailers in the UK, as East Asian suppliers seek alternatives to the US. He suggests that stock will free up, potentially leading to lower prices. He added that the company had not seen any disruption to deliveries from overseas suppliers owing to the rapidly changing news on tariffs. The company's stock orders were "locked and loaded" until after Christmas.</p>

            <p>A colossal squid has been filmed in its natural environment for the first time since the species was discovered 100 years ago. The 30cm-long juvenile was caught on camera at a depth of 600m near the South Sandwich Islands in the south Atlantic Ocean. Scientists believe colossal squid can grow up to 7m in length and weigh up to 500kg. Researchers also captured footage of a glacial glass squid for the first time ever.</p>

            <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) is widely expected to trim interest rates for the third time this year as global tariff tensions and uncertainty threaten the euro zone's economic growth. Markets are pricing in a roughly 94% chance of a quarter-point interest rate cut from the central bank. The series of relatively fast-paced interest rate cuts have played out as inflation in the euro area has consistently sat below 3%, recently closing in on the ECB's 2% target. The ECB estimates its neutral rate sits between 1.75% and 2.25%. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Nvidia's stock has been difficult to own during the second Trump administration, according to Jim Cramer, due to the AI chipmaker's latest China hit. The U.S. government will require the company to obtain an export license to ship its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, resulting in a $5.5 billion charge in its fiscal 2026 first quarter. The H20 export controls were exactly why he has recommended trimming Nvidia in recent days, according to Cramer. This development reinforces the notion that Nvidia finds itself in an increasingly precarious moment. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Saving money can be a challenge in an economy with persistent inflation, but a certificate of deposit (CD) can help, as today's leading accounts come with higher returns than the current inflation rate.
