          <h2>Chevron CEO Dismisses Recession Fears Despite Tariff Impact</h2>

          <p>Chevron's CEO, Mike Wirth, stated that the company is not currently seeing signs of an impending U.S. recession, even as President Trump's tariffs are expected to impact oil demand. Wirth acknowledged that growth may be slowing, and the oil market anticipates reduced demand due to tariffs and increased OPEC+ production. Despite these factors, Chevron is maintaining its capital spending plans, and Wirth believes that U.S. onshore oil production will likely decrease if prices fall to $60 per barrel. Chevron anticipates that the macroeconomic effects of the tariffs will have a greater impact on its business than direct levies on energy.</p>

          <p>Matthew Podolsky, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, has agreed to step down, paving the way for President Trump to appoint Jay Clayton as interim United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. This move marks another shake-up for the prominent prosecutor's office, with Clayton serving in an interim capacity until Senate confirmation or appointment by federal judges. Clayton's nomination faces potential opposition from Senate Democrats, who express concerns about Trump's intentions for the Justice Department. By naming Clayton as an interim choice, Trump may bypass the confirmation process.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its growth forecast for the U.S. economy in 2025 to 1.8%, citing the escalating trade war as a significant factor. This projection is down 0.9% from January and a full percentage point from the previous year's estimate. The IMF also reduced its global economic growth forecast to 2.8% for the year. While the organization does not anticipate a U.S. recession, it has increased the probability to 37% and notes that uncertainty surrounding Trump's trade policy is driving the economic slowdown.</p>

The spokesman clarified that the Labour government is consistent in protecting single-sex spaces, and the ruling allows for the exclusion of transgender women from women-only spaces if deemed proportionate.

          <p>Major Russian banks have established a netting payments system called "The China Track" for transactions with China, aiming to reduce visibility to Western regulators and mitigate the risk of secondary sanctions. This system involves a network of intermediaries registered in friendly countries and settles trade in both directions without using SWIFT or accounts in Western banks. China has been supporting Russia economically since 2022, providing consumer goods to replace those from Western companies. The system has been in place for some time and has not yet suffered any major setbacks.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has surpassed the $90,000 level, reaching its highest point since March, as investors seek refuge in the cryptocurrency amid stock market volatility and a weakening dollar. The recent surge coincided with a sell-off in U.S. equities, driven by President Trump's pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. U.S. ETFs tracking the price of spot bitcoin recorded significant inflows, decoupling from risk assets. Analysts suggest that bitcoin's resilience may be supported by long-term holders and increased buying activity, but light trading volumes could limit its ability to break above the $93,000 resistance level.

          <p>Margaret Sullivan argues that Donald Trump's attacks on National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) are predictable and align with his authoritarian playbook of controlling the political narrative by undermining the reality-based press.

Player wages are a key predictor of on-the-pitch performance, and promoted clubs often have significantly lower revenues and wage budgets compared to top-tier teams.

This asteroid is bigger than scientists anticipated, about 5 miles long and 2 miles wide at its widest point — resembling a deformed peanut. It's so long that the spacecraft couldn't capture it in its entirety in the initial downloaded images. NASA also released a timelapse of images captured about every 2 seconds, showing the asteroid rotating very slowly, apparently due to the spacecraft's motion as it flies by.</p>
