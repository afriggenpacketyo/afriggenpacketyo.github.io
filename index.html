        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California's Public Utilities Commission has stated that Tesla is not authorized to operate a public robotaxi service using autonomous vehicles in the state. While Tesla notified regulators of its plan to offer a 'friends and family' car service in the Bay Area, it must use human drivers, as its current permit is for a charter-party carrier service, not an autonomous one. This clarification comes amid Tesla's ongoing testing of a more automated robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, and a separate legal dispute with the California DMV over the marketing of its 'Full Self-Driving' technology. Local officials also expressed concerns about a lack of communication from the company regarding its plans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Inter Miami's owner, Jorge Mas, has publicly condemned Major League Soccer's decision to suspend star player Lionel Messi and teammate Jordi Alba for one game. The suspension was enforced because both players, following a club decision, skipped the MLS All-Star game, which is a violation of league rules. Mas described the punishment as "draconian," arguing that the league doesn't understand the players' need for rest, especially with a congested game schedule. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged Messi's importance to the league but stated the long-standing policy had to be enforced, though he added the rule will be reevaluated.</p>

          <p>Disgraced former U.S. Representative George Santos has surrendered to a federal correctional facility in New Jersey to begin his 87-month prison sentence. Santos pleaded guilty to multiple federal charges, including wire fraud and identity theft, for fabricating his background to defraud donors and enrich himself. Prosecutors detailed how he used campaign funds for personal luxury expenses, from Hermès products to Botox treatments, after creating a fictitious biography to win his congressional seat. Following his sentencing, Santos appealed to former President Trump for a future pardon, claiming his sentence was politically influenced.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility has resulted in the deaths of three deputies. The blast was caused by a grenade that the deputies had recovered from a garage, believing it was inert. Authorities have now confirmed that a second grenade recovered at the same time is missing, prompting a wide-scale search and a public safety warning. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is leading the investigation into the missing device and the tragic incident, which represents the largest single loss of life for the department since 1857.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Illinois has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration that challenged Chicago's sanctuary city laws. The lawsuit alleged that the city's policies, which limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents, illegally obstruct federal immigration enforcement efforts. Judge Lindsay Jenkins granted the city's motion for dismissal, a decision praised by Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who stated the ruling affirms the legality of the ordinance and enhances public safety. The administration has filed similar lawsuits against other cities with sanctuary policies as part of a broader push against such local laws.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society explores the infamous Hollywood blacklist era of the 1940s and 1950s. The display focuses on the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigation into alleged Communist influence in the film industry, which led to the blacklisting of the "Hollywood Ten" and many others. The exhibit showcases how individuals like screenwriter Dalton Trumbo were imprisoned for refusing to testify, while others, including Walt Disney and Ronald Reagan, cooperated with the committee. It highlights the devastating professional and personal consequences for those accused and raises enduring questions about free speech, political persecution, and democracy.</p>

          <p>Convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche for nine hours over two days after being granted a limited form of immunity. This "proffer immunity" allowed her to answer questions about Jeffrey Epstein's network without her statements being used against her, a common step when prosecutors seek cooperation. Maxwell's attorney stated she answered all questions about approximately 100 different people and that no promises were made in return. The highly unusual meeting has drawn criticism from victims and prompted questions about potential clemency from the Trump administration, though the President said he has not considered it.</p>

The disease, spread from non-native animals, has decimated the native species. In a rescue mission, biologists captured dozens of healthy sheep from the last disease-free herd and airlifted them over 200 miles to an isolated, safe mountain range. A recent follow-up revealed the relocated herd is not only surviving but also growing, with newborn lambs spotted, offering a hopeful sign for the species' future in the region.</p>

Research shows that inadequate breast support can shorten a runner's stride, making a proper sports bra a crucial piece of performance equipment. Scientists are also studying how hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle affect performance and how to mitigate a higher risk of certain injuries, like ACL tears, which are more common in female athletes. This shift marks a significant change from a time when female athletes were often treated simply as "mini-men" in sports science.</p>

          <p>While visiting his golf resorts in Scotland, U.S. President Donald Trump issued a stark warning to European nations regarding immigration. Speaking to reporters, Trump stated that Europe "better get [its] act together," claiming that immigration amounts to an "invasion" that is "killing Europe." The comments were made during a five-day working trip that mixes business with meetings with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. During his visit, Trump also reiterated his opposition to wind power, claiming that windmills are "killing the beauty" of Scotland.</p>

          <p>Following two days of deadly cross-border fighting, Cambodia has called for an unconditional and immediate ceasefire with neighboring Thailand. The clashes, which have involved heavy weapons, have killed at least 16 people and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the border. Thailand, which has declared martial law in the border region, has not yet publicly responded to the ceasefire proposal and accuses Cambodia of firing first. The conflict stems from a century-old border dispute, and international leaders, including the U.S. and the chair of ASEAN, are urging a peaceful resolution.</p>

          <p>Six Democratic lawmakers from Texas met with California Governor Gavin Newsom to strategize against what they call a Republican effort to "rig" the 2026 midterm elections through partisan redistricting. The meeting comes after President Trump urged Texas to redraw its congressional maps to favor the GOP. In response, Newsom is exploring options to counter-gerrymander California's districts to favor Democrats, a move that would upend the state's nonpartisan redistricting process. The Texas Democrats pledged to use every available tool to fight the proposed changes, which they argue are designed to dilute the power of minority voters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A worldwide craze for matcha, the powdered Japanese green tea, is causing global demand to outstrip supply, leading to significant price increases. Fueled by social media trends and a post-pandemic tourism boom in Japan, the demand has been exacerbated by poor harvests due to heatwaves and a shortage of tea farmers. Retailers in Japan are limiting purchases, while importers report that supplies are running out in days instead of months. The situation is expected to worsen due to new U.S. tariffs on Japanese products, further impacting the cost for consumers and businesses reliant on the popular tea.</p>

          <p>A wave of intense sectarian violence has devastated the Druze-majority city of Sweida in Syria, resulting in approximately 1,380 deaths and the displacement of over 120,000 people. The fighting, which involved summary executions and heavy bombardment, erupted between local Bedouin clans and the Druze religious minority. The new Syrian government's forces intervened but were accused by Druze residents of siding with the Bedouins and engaging in a sectarian killing spree. The conflict highlights the deep instability and factionalism facing Syria's interim government following the ouster of Bashar Assad, turning a once-spared city into a slaughterhouse.</p>

          <p>According to Jeremy Konyndyk, president of Refugees International, Gaza is on the verge of a mass starvation crisis that will be nearly impossible to stop once it begins. He argues that after 21 months of war and inadequate nutrition, the population is extremely vulnerable, and the current blockade by Israel has created a death spiral. Konyndyk criticizes the aid model of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation as ineffective and dangerous, forcing desperate people to risk their lives for meager supplies. He asserts that Israel is explicitly using starvation as a weapon of war and that the international community has failed to prevent the catastrophe.</p>

          <p>Unidentified gunmen have killed 14 people in an attack on a vehicle in Nigeria's central Plateau state. The victims, which included women and children, were returning from a weekly market when their vehicle was intercepted and fired upon. The region has long been plagued by violent conflicts between farming communities and herders over limited land and resources, with armed gangs killing hundreds in recent years.

          <p>For the first time, multiple Christian Contemporary Music (CCM) artists are simultaneously charting on the Billboard Hot 100, signaling a significant cultural moment. This article explores the multi-million dollar industry behind CCM, which mirrors mainstream styles but avoids traditionally objectionable content. Experts note the rise of a "barstool conversion rock" subgenre, blending masculinity, country music, and conservative politics. The economic engine of megachurches like Hillsong and Bethel, which provide plug-and-play resources for smaller churches to replicate their worship experience, is identified as a key driver of this trend and its growing influence on popular music.</p>

The new ownership has promised $2 billion in cost savings, signaling impending layoffs and major restructuring across the media giant. Key questions facing the new company include whether it will invest enough to make Paramount+ a true competitor in the streaming wars and how it will manage the decline of traditional broadcast and cable television. The deal will also test creative and journalistic freedom at institutions like '60 Minutes' and 'The Late Show'. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will release $5.5 billion in education funds to states after abruptly freezing the congressionally approved money earlier this month. The funds support programs for educator training, arts education, and English language support. The White House had initially withheld the funds, claiming it discovered money being used for a "radical left-wing agenda." The decision to freeze the funding triggered widespread outrage from educators and drew bipartisan pushback from lawmakers, including 10 Republican senators who urged the administration to release the critical funding for schools.</p>

Jeff Dillen and Stephen Volz led the 2020 investigation into "Sharpiegate," which found that the former NOAA chief violated scientific integrity by altering a hurricane forecast to align with the president's incorrect statements. The move comes just days before the same former chief, Neil Jacobs, is set to face a confirmation hearing to lead the agency again, fueling concerns about the erosion of scientific independence at the agency.</p>
