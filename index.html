          <p>The Indiana Fever were defeated by the New York Liberty with a score of 98-77, playing without their star player Caitlin Clark who was ruled out due to a groin injury. This marks the team's third game missed by Clark this season due to various injuries. Fever coach Stephanie White emphasized the team's need for consistency and resilience in the face of adversity. Clark's participation in the upcoming All-Star weekend, where she is a team captain and 3-point contest participant, is now uncertain pending further evaluation of her health.</p>

          <p>Israel has launched airstrikes against Syrian military targets in Damascus and southern Syria for the third consecutive day, stating the action is to protect the Druze minority. The strikes follow deadly clashes between Druze militias and Bedouin tribes in Suweida province, which have reportedly killed over 350 people. While Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu pledged to save "Druze brothers," Syria's interim government accused Israel of a major escalation. The United States announced that "specific steps" have been agreed upon to de-escalate the violence in the region.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated his intention to supply China with more advanced chips than the current H20 model, following the recent reversal of a sales ban on that specific AI chip. Huang argued that as technology evolves, the chips available to the Chinese market should also improve over time, despite ongoing U.S. export controls. The company has been navigating the complexities of U.S.-China trade tensions, developing compliant chips to maintain access to the significant Chinese AI market. U.S. officials have suggested a strategy of allowing sales to keep China reliant on American technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has clarified that a key federal grant program for fentanyl overdose prevention, which is currently underfunded by about $140 million, will receive its full allocation in increments rather than a single annual payment. This announcement came after NPR reported on concerns from CDC staffers that the funding might be delayed or cut, potentially disrupting public health services. While the administration insists the Overdose Data To Action (OD2A) program is not at risk, some state health officials and CDC staff remain worried about operational uncertainties caused by the unpredictable funding schedule.</p>

          <p>Despite a congressional push to fund equipment modernization for the nation's air traffic control system, many controllers feel the plan overlooks more critical issues. They cite severe staffing shortages, grueling six-day workweeks, stagnating pay, and difficulties in taking time off as the primary causes of plummeting morale. Current and former controllers told NPR that while new technology is welcome, it won't solve the deep-seated problems leading to burnout and stress. The FAA and the controllers' union are focusing on hiring and equipment, but many in the workforce feel their immediate quality-of-life concerns are being ignored.</p>

The data reflects the impact of a 25% U.S. tariff on Japanese imports, which has particularly hurt the crucial automobile sector.

The investigation revealed that the suspect had likely gained entry to the fortified property through an unlocked door during a prior burglary attempt and was inside when the couple returned home. The attack is believed to be a random act of violence, and the suspect was identified using surveillance footage and facial recognition technology.</p>

          <h2>Immigrant Advocacy Groups Sue Administration Over Arrests at Courthouse Hearings</h2>

          <p>A coalition of immigrant advocacy groups has filed a class-action lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging a coordinated effort to unlawfully arrest and deport immigrants who appear for their immigration court hearings. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of twelve plaintiffs, claims that the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security are weaponizing the courts, turning them into traps. This practice violates due process rights and discourages people from complying with their legal obligations. The plaintiffs argue this sets a chilling precedent that undermines the promise of a fair judicial process for those seeking asylum and other legal protections.</p>

          <p>In an innovative approach to meet the massive energy demands of the artificial intelligence boom, companies are repurposing used electric vehicle batteries to power data centers. Nevada-based Redwood Materials is recovering batteries that have lost some capacity for automotive use but are still effective for stationary energy storage. These recycled batteries are being used by AI cloud platform Crusoe to power its data centers with renewable energy, offering a sustainable alternative to building new gas-fired power plants. This solution addresses both the growing need for reliable power and the challenge of recycling millions of old EV batteries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent Israeli airstrikes in Syria have been framed as a protective measure for the Druze, an Arabic-speaking ethno-religious minority caught in renewed sectarian violence. This article explains that the Druze, who have communities in Syria, Lebanon, and Israel, occupy a precarious position in Syria's fractured political landscape and have resisted the authority of the new government. Israel's intervention is seen as a move to prevent Islamist fighters from establishing a presence near its border and to create a demilitarized zone. The violence and Israeli strikes highlight Syria's deep-seated instability and the risk of wider regional conflict.</p>

          <p>Recent large-scale immigration raids on businesses have highlighted critical flaws in the federal E-Verify system, which is intended to confirm employment eligibility. One business owner, whose meat processing plant was raided, stated he used the system in good faith but was still penalized when dozens of his employees were arrested for using stolen identities. Experts argue that E-Verify is easy to fool because it vets documents, not people, making businesses that use it vulnerable and contributing to identity theft. Critics call it a "wink-and-nod" system that allows politicians to appear tough on immigration without effectively addressing the issue.</p>

          <p>In a rare display of bipartisanship, Congress has passed legislation to help thousands of military veterans avoid foreclosure on their homes. The bill addresses a crisis created after the Department of Veterans Affairs ended a key homeowner assistance program, leaving veterans with fewer options than other Americans to manage missed mortgage payments. The new law will create a permanent program allowing veterans to move delinquent payments to the end of their loan term, making their mortgages current. This provides a crucial safety net and resolves an issue that had left many veterans in financial peril.</p>

          <p>A mother and her 9-year-old son were successfully rescued after becoming lost in a remote California forest, thanks to a trail of notes she left for searchers. The pair became stranded after their vehicle's GPS led them down a remote road in Stanislaus National Forest where they lost their signal. The woman strategically left handwritten notes asking for help, which a volunteer search-and-rescue team discovered and followed. The successful outcome was also attributed to the mother having notified someone of their travel plans beforehand, a crucial step that helped authorities narrow the search area.</p>

The lawsuit argues that the administration unlawfully shut down the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, a power that belongs to Congress. The states claim the cuts jeopardize critical projects designed to protect communities from natural disasters like floods and hurricanes. A recent analysis showed the funding cuts disproportionately affect counties that supported the president in the last election, raising questions about the rationale behind the decision.</p>
