Despite the challenges, the report concluded that the policing response was appropriate and found no evidence of 'two-tier policing'. The report did highlight the need for better anticipation of potential disorder and addressed the spread of misinformation online following the attack.</p>

            <p>Singapore has eased its monetary policy for the second time in a row, anticipating potential zero growth this year following a lower-than-expected first-quarter GDP expansion.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore will reduce the rate of appreciation of its policy band, the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate, while maintaining a modest and gradual appreciation policy.

            <p>Goldman Sachs suggests that ESG investors should reconsider their approach to oil and gas companies, similar to how attitudes toward defense companies have shifted. The analyst argues that the energy transition will be longer than expected, requiring new oil and gas development into the 2040s. Oil and gas companies are also major investors in low-carbon energy. However, some argue that oil and gas stocks should not be favored, citing the negative impacts of fossil fuels and the climate crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Baby boomers and first-time travelers are driving a trend toward 'coolcations,' avoiding Europe's peak summer hotspots in favor of cooler climates such as the Nordic and Baltic countries. Concerns about extreme heat, cost, and overcrowding are influencing travel decisions. Bookings to Iceland, Estonia, and Scandinavia have increased, while bookings to southern Europe have shifted to shoulder seasons. This trend is expected to continue as the effects of climate change worsen and become more unpredictable, creating economic opportunities for northern European countries.</p>

The author argues that the world needs to build a new global order where all nations have a stake, recognizing that the US's definition of peace and prosperity was always its own, enforced through power and propaganda.
