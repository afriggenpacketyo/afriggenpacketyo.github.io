          <p>Verizon customers across the United States experienced a significant service outage, leaving many of their mobile devices stuck in SOS mode, which only allows for emergency calls. The company acknowledged a software issue as the cause and reported that its engineers were actively working to resolve the problem. Reports of the disruption, tracked by sites like DownDetector, peaked with nearly 23,000 complaints, indicating a widespread impact from coast to coast. This incident follows a similar large-scale outage the company experienced in October 2024, raising concerns about network reliability.</p>

          <p>A new tropical storm, named Kiko, has formed in the eastern Pacific Ocean, approximately 1,000 miles off the coast of Mexico. According to the U.S. National Hurricane Center, the storm currently poses no immediate threat to land. Forecasters predict that Kiko will gradually strengthen over the next few days, likely reaching hurricane status by Tuesday. With maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, the storm is moving westward and is the eleventh named storm in the Eastern North Pacific this season, highlighting an active period for tropical weather systems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump has stated his intention to issue an executive order that would mandate identification for all voters in U.S. elections, a move widely expected to face immediate legal challenges over its constitutionality. The U.S. Constitution primarily grants states the authority to regulate elections, giving the president no explicit power in this area. This push is rooted in Trump's unsubstantiated claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. Critics argue that such laws disproportionately disenfranchise minority, low-income, and disabled voters who may lack the required forms of identification.</p>

          <p>Israel's defense minister has claimed that an airstrike in Gaza killed Abu Obeida, the prominent spokesperson for Hamas's armed wing, the Qassam Brigades. This strike is part of an intensified Israeli military offensive in Gaza City, which has been declared a combat zone. The operation aims to dismantle Hamas's military capabilities following the October 7th attack. Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to worsen, with local officials reporting dozens of new Palestinian casualties and the U.N. warning of a devastating famine in the region.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge issued an emergency order to block the Trump administration's plan to deport hundreds of unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala without formal deportation proceedings. The ruling by Judge Sparkle Sooknanan came just as planes were reportedly preparing for takeoff, following a lawsuit alleging the effort would bypass legal protections for these minors. The Justice Department argued it was repatriating children at their families' request, a claim disputed by lawyers who stated the children could face abuse and persecution if returned.</p>

While Putin patiently employs a strategy of attrition and obfuscation, Trump's focus on image over strategy risks ceding the advantage to Moscow, ultimately harming Ukraine and diminishing U.S. global standing unless a clear, coercive policy is adopted.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated Old Firm derby between Rangers and Celtic ended in a forgettable 0-0 draw, characterized by a lack of quality and creativity from both sides. Rangers manager Russell Martin praised his team's fight and resilience, which secured a much-needed clean sheet after recent defensive struggles. In contrast, Celtic's attack was described as feeble and powder-puff, failing to create any significant chances and highlighting the team's urgent need for new talent before the transfer window closes. The result was seen as more favorable for Rangers despite their poor start to the season.</p>

          <p>The article from The Economist examines the potential impact of Donald Trump's policies on public universities in the United States. It suggests that the administration's focus on culture war issues and challenges to established academic norms could create a new front in the nation's political battles. The piece explores how institutions like UCLA, which recently saw campus protests over the war in Gaza, might navigate an environment where their funding, curriculum, and principles of academic freedom come under increased scrutiny from a hostile federal government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to widespread anti-government protests, Indonesian political parties have agreed to reduce some state-funded perks for lawmakers. The demonstrations, which have turned violent in several cities, were partly fueled by public anger over a new monthly allowance for politicians that is nearly ten times Jakarta's minimum wage. President Prabowo Subianto announced the reversal, which includes smaller allowances and a moratorium on overseas trips, while also ordering security forces to take strong action against looting and property damage during the unrest.</p>

          <p>One of the world's largest kelp restoration projects has successfully revived a vital marine ecosystem off the coast of Southern California. Over the past 13 years, a team led by The Bay Foundation has removed nearly 5.8 million invasive purple sea urchins from an 80-acre area. These voracious urchins had created barren underwater landscapes by devouring the kelp. By culling the urchins, divers have allowed the "sequoias of the sea" to regrow, restoring critical habitat for hundreds of marine species and demonstrating a successful model for marine conservation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Peter Navarro, a trade adviser to President Trump, has sharply criticized a recent appeals court decision that ruled most of the administration's sweeping tariffs are illegal. Calling the ruling "weaponized partisan injustice," Navarro warned that if the decision is upheld by the Supreme Court, "it will be the end of the United States." The U.S. Court of Appeals found that Trump overstepped his authority in using a 1977 law to justify the broad tariffs. The administration is expected to appeal the ruling, setting up a major legal battle over a core component of its economic agenda.</p>

This policy directly challenges the UK's legally mandated 2050 net zero target and has drawn sharp criticism from opposition parties and environmental groups, who label it as irresponsible and environmentally damaging.</p>
