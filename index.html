          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed surprise at AMD's decision to offer OpenAI 10% of its company as part of their recent partnership. Huang acknowledged the deal as "clever," especially considering AMD's enthusiasm for its next-generation products. The agreement involves OpenAI purchasing 6 gigawatts of chips from AMD over several years, potentially granting OpenAI a 10% ownership stake in AMD if warrants are fully exercised. Huang also confirmed Nvidia's involvement in xAI's funding round and praised Nvidia's investment in AI data center operator CoreWeave, highlighting Nvidia's commitment to building out the AI infrastructure for the world. The CEO expressed excitement about opportunities to collaborate with Elon Musk. Optimism centers on the continued growth and investment in the AI sector. </p>

          <p>Federal law enforcement sources have announced an arrest related to the Pacific Palisades fire in Los Angeles, which resulted in 12 deaths and widespread destruction. The fire decimated the Pacific Palisades and parts of Malibu, destroying over 6,800 buildings, prompting demands for answers from affected residents. The arrest follows an investigation into the cause of the fire, which had a devastating impact on the community. The Los Angeles Mayor delayed the release of the Palisades fire report at the Department of Justice’s request, amidst the probe into the fire's origins. Further details are expected to be disclosed during a press conference. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty to charges of lying to Congress during his 2020 testimony, appearing in court for his arraignment. The charges stem from a federal grand jury indictment alleging that Comey made false statements and obstructed a congressional investigation. Comey's lawyer indicated they will seek to have the indictment dismissed, citing vindictive prosecution and the legality of the acting U.S. Attorney's appointment. The case may involve classified information, potentially complicating the proceedings, and a trial date has been set for early January. The Justice Department's prosecution is seen by some as a result of President Trump's efforts to target his political adversaries. </p>

She stood by her husband during the Chappaquiddick scandal but eventually divorced him, later becoming an advocate for the arts and mental health awareness.

          <p>With credit card debt reaching record levels, this article outlines practical strategies for individuals struggling with balances over $10,000. Options include working with credit counseling agencies to negotiate lower interest rates and create debt management plans. Debt consolidation loans can replace high-interest credit cards with a single, fixed-rate loan, potentially saving thousands in interest. Zero-percent balance transfer cards offer a promotional period without interest, allowing borrowers to pay down principal faster, and debt settlement can reduce the amount owed through negotiation with creditors.

          <p>Dutch authorities discovered two hand grenades, dating back to 1925, hidden in a shipment of French onions destined for a factory in the Netherlands. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) examined the grenades and identified them as old chemical weapons of French and German manufacture. The type of chemical fill could not be identified, and the reason for the weapons' presence in the delivery remains a mystery. The grenades will be destroyed at a specialized facility in Belgium. </p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty to federal charges of making false statements and obstructing a congressional proceeding. Comey's lawyer, Pat Fitzgerald, entered the plea during his arraignment in federal court, and a trial date was set for January 5, 2026. Comey, a vocal critic of President Trump, was indicted last month on two counts stemming from his 2020 Senate testimony. The Justice Department secured the indictment shortly after Trump demanded a faster pace in the investigation against Comey. </p>

          <p>Attending a wedding, including bachelor or bachelorette weekends, can cost as much as a typical month's rent, exacerbating financial challenges for young adults. A report found that attending just one wedding and related events can cost $2,010, comparable to the average monthly rent. Many young adults make housing sacrifices, such as living with roommates or saving less for a down payment, to afford these celebrations. Financial experts recommend budgeting, reallocating funds, and considering which weddings to attend to avoid financial strain. </p>

          <p>The UK's National Health Service (NHS) is considering increasing payments to pharmaceutical firms by up to 25% to resolve a dispute over drug pricing. The proposal aims to address concerns from drugmakers and the Trump administration, potentially reversing recent investment cancellations. The plan involves raising the cost-effectiveness thresholds for new medications assessed for use on the NHS. Critics question the cost and potential impact on other NHS services, while supporters argue it is necessary to encourage innovation and improve patient care. </p>

          <p>The German government has revised its economic growth forecasts upward, anticipating modest growth of 0.2% in 2025 and 1.3% in 2026. The updated projections indicate a slight recovery after two years of economic contraction. Economic Minister Katherina Reiche attributed the growth to increased state financing, particularly for infrastructure investments and defense. However, critics have raised concerns that the growth is primarily fueled by public debt, highlighting the need for decisive reforms to lower energy prices and reduce taxes. </p>

          <p>The Bank of England has cautioned about the increasing risk of a "sharp market correction," particularly in artificial intelligence-focused tech firms, due to stretched valuations. The central bank highlighted heightened geopolitical tensions, fragmented trade and financial markets, and pressures on sovereign debt markets as contributing factors. Equity market valuations are near all-time highs, driven by strong earnings from U.S. tech companies, but the concentration of market share and high expectations for AI could lead to a pullback. The private credit market and political uncertainty add to the Bank of England's cautious outlook. </p>
