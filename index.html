          <p>After more than three years of war, Ukraine and Russia will meet for a second round of talks in Istanbul, Turkey, aiming to find a path toward ending the conflict, but their positions remain significantly divergent. The meeting follows a surprise drone attack by Ukraine on strategic bomber bases deep inside Russian territory, demonstrating Ukraine's continued capacity to strike back. Ukraine seeks a full 30-day ceasefire for negotiations, while Russia insists on maximalist war goals including annexation of Ukrainian regions and a block on Ukraine joining NATO. The renewed talks, brokered by the U.S., have so far failed to achieve a sustained ceasefire despite pressure on both sides.</p>

          <p>Nottinghamshire Police have initiated a corporate manslaughter investigation into the maternity units at Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS trust following failings in care. The investigation will focus on whether the maternity care provided by the trust, which oversees the Queen's Medical Centre and Nottingham City Hospital, constituted gross negligence. This action comes amidst the largest maternity inquiry in NHS history, led by independent midwife Donna Ockenden, examining approximately 2,500 cases. The police investigation will aim to determine if systemic failures within the trust led to preventable deaths or harm to newborns and mothers.</p>

          <p>Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, has been booked on multiple felony charges, including use of an incendiary device, after allegedly carrying out an "act of terrorism" on a pedestrian mall in Boulder, Colorado. The FBI is investigating the incident as a "targeted terror attack" motivated by ideology, after Soliman allegedly yelled "Free Palestine" while using a "makeshift flamethrower" and throwing an incendiary device at a crowd of pro-Israel demonstrators. Eight people were hospitalized with burns, ranging in age from 52 to 88, and one victim is in critical condition. The attack occurred during a Run for Their Lives walk, an event organized to raise awareness about hostages in Gaza.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vox's Eric Levitz argues that Democrats should prioritize effective governance and policy solutions over simply focusing on populist rhetoric. He cites a poll suggesting voters prefer candidates who address corporate power over those who focus on regulatory bottlenecks, but contends that this doesn't negate the importance of "abundance" reforms like zoning liberalization and permitting reform. Levitz argues that improving the party's reputation for economic management and boosting confidence in the public sector's efficacy are crucial for long-term political success. Ultimately, he believes the "abundance" debate is primarily about policy and effective governance, rather than just political messaging.</p>

Taiwan, which has never been officially invited, has expressed its wish to participate for the first time, but Nagasaki plans to send invitations only to countries and regions with diplomatic missions in Japan or representative offices at the UN. This contrasts with Hiroshima, which indicated it would include Taiwan after Taipei expressed its interest. The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 resulted in over 200,000 deaths.</p>

          <p>A fire at a drug rehabilitation center in Guanajuato, Mexico, resulted in the deaths of 12 people and injuries to at least three others. Authorities are investigating the cause of the fire, which occurred in the town of San Jose Iturbe, with local media reporting that victims were locked inside the facility. Guanajuato has been plagued by violence between the Jalisco New Generation cartel and the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel, and drug rehab centers have been targets of attacks in the past, with cartels sometimes executing patients who refuse to join their ranks. Mexico's privately run drug rehabilitation centers are often unregulated and underfunded.</p>

Desert-adapted lions roam the remote northwest of Namibia, and their numbers have decreased due to drought and conflict with humans.

Verstappen's penalty dropped him from fifth to 10th in the final result, leaving him 49 points behind championship leader Oscar Piastri.

          <p>Right-wing historian Karol Nawrocki has been elected Poland's new president, narrowly defeating Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski. The election commission announced Nawrocki won 50.9% of the votes, a surprising turnaround from initial exit polls that favored Trzaskowski. As president, Nawrocki is expected to use his veto power to block Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda and supports traditional Catholic and family values. While the Polish president's role is largely ceremonial, Nawrocki's victory is likely to energize the national conservative Law and Justice (PiS) opposition.</p>

Tesla has still not released the low-cost EV that Musk once called pivotal to the company’s future.

          <p>Katrina vanden Heuvel argues that President Trump's proposed tax bill disproportionately benefits the wealthy while harming the poor and significantly increasing the national deficit. The bill would cut taxes for the top 1% of wage earners by over $600 billion, leading to the largest upward transfer of wealth in American history. Simultaneously, it proposes drastic cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid and Snap, leaving millions uninsured and without food assistance. This aligns with a historical pattern of Republican presidents increasing the federal debt while cutting social programs, reflecting a governing philosophy of hypocrisy rather than conservatism or populism.</p>

          <p>This year's WorldPride in Washington, D.C., is causing mixed emotions within the LGBTQ community due to the Trump administration's policies and rhetoric.

          <p>Policy experts anticipate potential changes to the child tax credit as the Senate considers President Trump's multi-trillion-dollar tax and spending package. The House-approved bill would make permanent the maximum $2,000 credit passed in 2017, with a temporary increase to $2,500 from 2025 to 2028. The Senate, however, may have different plans, leading to complex negotiations. This comes as the U.S. fertility rate hovers near historic lows, prompting lawmakers to consider financial incentives, like a bigger child tax credit, as a potential solution (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A university teaching assistant grapples with the ethical dilemma of enforcing rules against AI-generated writing when students seem to view it as acceptable.

The best training they can get now is training in how to wisely make this type of choice. Instead of strictly banning AI, the author suggests offering students the choice to use it while requiring them to reflect on how it changed their thinking and learning process.</p>

The move comes after decades of debate and controversy surrounding literacy instruction in the state, with some districts already seeing improvements in reading test scores after embracing phonics-based learning.
