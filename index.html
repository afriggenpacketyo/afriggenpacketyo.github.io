          <p>Goldman Sachs is piloting an AI program named Devin, developed by Cognition, to function as an autonomous software engineer. This marks a significant milestone for AI adoption on Wall Street, with the bank planning to deploy hundreds, and potentially thousands, of these AI agents. The technology is expected to augment the firm's human developers by handling tedious tasks like code updates, potentially boosting productivity by three to four times. The move signals a broader shift towards a "hybrid workforce" where humans supervise complex AI agents.</p>

          <p>Two elderly women, aged in their 80s and 90s, have died following an incident where a stolen BMW crashed into their care home in Sunderland. The crash occurred during a police pursuit, causing significant structural damage and forcing the evacuation of residents. Eight other residents were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. Two 21-year-old men, initially arrested in connection with the crash, have been rearrested on suspicion of manslaughter as police investigate the circumstances.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record of over $118,000, driven by the largest single-day inflow into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the year. The rally was also fueled by speculation about a more dovish Federal Reserve policy and legislative actions expected to increase the federal deficit. This upward movement triggered over $650 million in short liquidations, further accelerating the price increase. The article notes that institutional interest has grown significantly, contributing to a nearly 10% gain for the week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla is set to officially enter the Indian market with the opening of an "Experience Center" in Mumbai on July 15. This move marks the electric vehicle giant's first official showroom in the country, where it will likely begin direct sales to customers. The launch follows high-level discussions between CEO Elon Musk and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Tesla will face challenges, including a 70% import duty on EVs and competition from established players like BYD and Tata Motors, as it currently has no manufacturing operations in India.</p>

          <p>A new robot designed for cotton topping has debuted in Xinjiang, China, promising to advance the automation of cotton production. The machine uses advanced lidar and machine vision to identify and remove the plant's top bud with a high-powered laser, a process that boosts yield. Developed by Xinjiang University, the robot can perform this delicate task on moving plants with high precision, achieving a 98.9% accuracy in bud detection. While still in the pilot phase, this technology aims to overcome the inefficiencies and crop damage associated with manual topping.</p>

These films often generate over 20% of their total box office from IMAX screens, despite them representing less than 1% of screens worldwide.

          <p>The Trump administration has eliminated nearly $15 million in federal funding for research into PFAS contamination on U.S. farms. The move halts ten studies led by various universities that were investigating how these "forever chemicals" from sources like sewage sludge contaminate soil, crops, and livestock. Public health advocates and researchers argue this work is essential for ensuring food safety, noting that a crisis in Maine has already forced some farms to close. Critics call the decision dangerous, as it will slow understanding of a widespread food contamination source linked to serious health problems.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reignited global trade tensions by threatening new tariffs on numerous countries, creating significant uncertainty for American businesses. This article details how companies, especially small businesses that rely on imports, are struggling to navigate the unpredictable trade policy, which has included sudden high levies followed by temporary pauses. While the stock market has often dismissed these announcements, businesses face real consequences, including rising consumer costs and disrupted supply chains. Analysts warn that as inventories deplete, the full inflationary impact of these tariffs will become more apparent to consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analyst Argues Israeli Jubilation Over Iran Conflict is Premature Amid Ongoing Gaza War</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 07:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that any celebration in Israel over its recent military operation against Iran is premature and overlooks persistent dangers. It suggests the strikes may have redoubled Iran's motivation to develop a nuclear weapon, as its conventional deterrents proved ineffective. The author highlights the stark contrast between Israel's preparedness for Iran and its intelligence failure before the October 7 Hamas attack. The analysis concludes that the unresolved Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains the core issue, and the ongoing war in Gaza prevents any true return to peace or stability for Israel.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Israel Adopts 'Mowing the Grass' Military Strategy on a Regional Scale</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 07:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israel appears to be expanding its long-standing Gaza strategy of periodically using military force, or "mowing the grass," to a broader regional conflict. This approach involves intermittent military action to degrade the capabilities of adversaries in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and even Iran itself. While the recent 12-day war with Iran was viewed as a success, this multi-front engagement raises questions about its sustainability for a nation of 10 million. The strategy risks perpetual conflict and strains the economy and military, even as the devastating war in Gaza continues with no clear end in sight.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Board of Trustees has raised its forecast for the 2026 cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), reflecting persistent inflation. In its latest annual report, the board's intermediate estimate for the 2026 COLA is now 2.7%, up from 2.2% in last year's projection. The COLA is calculated based on the third-quarter inflation rate, with the official announcement made in October. While other analysts predict a 2.5% increase, the trustees' updated forecast suggests that beneficiaries could see a slightly larger bump in their benefits to counteract rising living costs.

          <p>The UK economy contracted by 0.1% in May, marking the second consecutive month of decline and confounding analysts' expectations of slight growth. The Office for National Statistics reported the downturn was driven by a drop in manufacturing and weak retail sales. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called the figures disappointing, adding pressure on the government's priority to boost economic growth. While the UK was the fastest-growing G7 economy in the first quarter, this new data suggests that momentum was short-lived and that the overall outlook for growth remains fragile.

Tuggar argued that Nigeria has its own significant population and problems and that it would be unfair to ask it to take in prisoners from a third country. His comments come amid threats from Washington to impose visa restrictions and tariff hikes on nations that do not comply with its deportation policies. The minister suggested these pressures were tactics related to its deportation goals rather than other diplomatic issues.</p>

          <p>A hosepipe ban affecting over five million households across Yorkshire is now in effect and is expected to last until winter. The restriction, the first regional ban in the UK this year, was implemented by Yorkshire Water due to record dry and warm weather that has left reservoirs low. The company's CEO stated the ban is necessary to protect supplies until rainfall can recharge them in the winter. The move has drawn criticism from some customers, who point to the company's high rate of water loss due to leaks.</p>

As devout Muslims, they require full-body uniforms, which were not previously allowed in collegiate and national competitions. Through their perseverance and with the support of their coaches at Life University, they successfully advocated for rule changes at the collegiate (NAIA) and national (USA Wrestling) levels. Despite facing obstacles with international rules, their efforts have paved the way for other modest athletes to compete in the sport.</p>
