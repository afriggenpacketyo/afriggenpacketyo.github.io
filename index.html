          <p>President Trump signed an executive order to expedite deep-sea mining, aiming to reduce reliance on China for critical minerals like nickel and copper. The order directs the administration to fast-track mining permits and establish a process for issuing permits beyond national jurisdiction. Critics argue that this move disregards global environmental efforts and could lead to ecosystem destruction and species extinction. The unilateral action intensifies geopolitical tensions over mineral control and international waters. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The NFL's performance of "Lift Every Voice and Sing," often referred to as the Black national anthem, before the NFL Draft in Green Bay sparked debate among fans on social media. The song has been a regular feature at NFL events since 2020, following a summer of heightened racial tensions in the United States. The NAACP originally promoted the song as the Black national anthem in 1917, aiming to celebrate Black culture and history.

The appointment comes after a court stay was issued on a restraining order that prevented the city from filling the seat. The legal battle continues, with Castillo alleging a politically motivated removal and the city maintaining its commitment to due process.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deportation policy of sending alleged gang members to a maximum security prison in El Salvador faces a legal challenge. Critics argue that this constitutes punishment without a trial, violating constitutional rights. The Alien Enemies Act of 1798 is cited by the administration, but concerns remain about the legal basis for imprisoning individuals without criminal convictions. The unusual mix of civil deportation and criminal-style punishment raises significant constitutional questions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has tightened security restrictions on sponsorships for migrant children, making it harder for families to reunite. New rules require families to provide proof of income, U.S. identification, and DNA tests. These changes have left some undocumented families in desperate situations, causing children to remain in custody longer. Advocates argue that the policies create impossible barriers and expose families to immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A new analysis casts doubt on claims of detecting life-associated gases in the atmosphere of exoplanet K2-18b.

The reanalysis indicates that the data is consistent with a flat line, suggesting that more observations are needed. While the original researchers stand by their findings, the new work highlights the importance of model-independent analysis for robust detections of biosignatures.</p>
