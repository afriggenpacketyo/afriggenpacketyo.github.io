          <p>A recent report indicates that Social Security's trust fund is projected to be depleted by 2034, a year earlier than previously estimated, which may result in a 19% reduction in benefits if Congress does not intervene. This financial strain is partly attributed to the Social Security Fairness Act and an increase in early benefit claims, with demographic shifts also playing a significant role as more baby boomers retire and the U.S. population ages. Experts suggest that Congress could address the shortfall by raising taxes, cutting benefits, or a combination of both, and some propose taxing higher income earners to sustain full benefits. The Social Security Administration faces challenges with staff cuts, exacerbating service issues amid these financial concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon's autonomous vehicle startup, Zoox, has inaugurated a new manufacturing facility in Hayward, California, to significantly increase its robotaxi production. The facility aims to produce one robotaxi per day initially, with plans to accelerate to a capacity of 10,000 robotaxis per year. Zoox intends to deploy a commercial ride-hailing service in the U.S., operating between 500 and 1,000 robotaxis in selected cities. The company, acquired by Amazon in 2020, has been testing its robotaxis on public roads since 2023 and currently has a few dozen vehicles in operation in Foster City, San Francisco, and Las Vegas.</p>

          <p>The UK is preparing for a heatwave with temperatures predicted to reach 30C (86F) in some areas, prompting the Met Office to issue yellow heat-health alerts for most of England. The rising temperatures are attributed to a developing area of high pressure drawing in hot weather from Western Europe, where France and Spain may experience temperatures close to 40C. For a heatwave to be declared, threshold temperatures must be reached for at least three consecutive days, varying from 25C in the north and west to 28C in parts of eastern England. A Met Office study also indicates an increasing risk of temperatures exceeding 40C in the UK in the coming years due to climate change.</p>

The game featured a fight in the final minute, resulting in three ejections, and coaches from both teams expressed concerns about the officiating. Despite the physical play, the Fever secured an 88-71 victory, earning a spot in the Commissioner’s Cup championship game against the Minnesota Lynx.</p>

          <p>NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory captured an image of an intense X-class solar flare, the most powerful type, erupting from the sun on Tuesday evening. Solar flares are giant explosions that release energy, light, and high-speed particles into space, potentially disrupting radio communications, electric power grids, and navigation signals. These flares are often associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are large bubbles of plasma that can also disrupt communications and cause geomagnetic storms on Earth. In May 2024, a strong CME caused the most significant geomagnetic storm in over 20 years, leading to radio blackouts and visible northern lights as far south as Florida.</p>

The decision is expected to have nationwide implications, as 25 states have similar laws in place. Dissenting justices argued that the ban leads to medical discrimination and abandons transgender children to political whims, while the Trump administration expressed its support for the case to continue so the court could weigh in.</p>

          <p>Destroying Iran's nuclear program is a complex undertaking, as Iran's most advanced facility, Fordo, is built inside a mountain and reinforced with concrete. Only the U.S. possesses the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) and the B2 Spirit stealth bomber capable of deploying it, but multiple strikes may be needed to ensure complete damage. Military experts suggest that ground forces may ultimately be required to secure and destroy the facility from the inside. Such a strike by the U.S. could trigger retaliatory actions from Iran, potentially escalating the conflict and drawing the U.S. deeper into a regional war.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats largely boycotted a Republican-led hearing on President Biden’s mental decline, with only Senator Peter Welch attending. The hearing, titled “Unfit to Serve,” began with Democratic ranking member Dick Durbin critiquing Donald Trump’s cognitive abilities before leaving. Republicans framed the hearing as addressing a “constitutional crisis” and alleged cover-up during Biden’s final months in office, questioning who was in charge. Welch argued that the constitutional crisis stemmed from Congress’s abdication of its legislative responsibilities, rather than any Biden cover-up, and focused on the Senate's lack of debate on critical issues.</p>

This marks Trump's third delay in enforcing the bipartisan law passed last year, which initially required ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. business by January 19th.

          <p>As Israel continues its assault on Iran's nuclear program, the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant has become a key target, although it has not yet sustained serious damage. Located deep underground, Fordow is protected by tunnels drilled into the mountains, making it difficult to destroy. The IAEA has accused Tehran of increasing its production of 60% enriched uranium, raising concerns about the potential for rapid weapons-grade enrichment.

          <p>The Supreme Court rejected a challenge by Texas and landowners against the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval of a nuclear waste storage facility in the state. The court ruled 6-3 that Texas and the landowners lacked standing to seek judicial review because they were not parties to the commission's licensing proceeding. The decision reverses a lower court ruling and leaves open the question of the commission's authority to license private companies for offsite nuclear waste storage. The issue of nuclear waste storage has been politically contentious, with efforts to establish a permanent facility at Yucca Mountain facing significant pushback.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers have expressed concerns about the USDA's intent to collect personal data from millions of federal food assistance recipients, demanding answers on the effort's scope and justification. The lawmakers are questioning the USDA's plan to collect sensitive data on SNAP recipients, including citizenship status, citing privacy and cybersecurity risks.
