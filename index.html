        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China experienced a more significant than anticipated drop in consumer prices in August, with the consumer price index falling by 0.4% year-over-year. This data, coupled with a persistent decline in factory-gate prices, underscores the deflationary pressures challenging the nation's economy. The sluggish domestic demand and weakening export growth have prompted economists to increase their calls for Beijing to implement substantial fiscal support measures. These latest figures suggest that more aggressive action may be necessary to stimulate economic activity and restore price stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles has secured victory in the Democratic primary, allowing her to advance to the general election. Her win comes during a period of intense national focus on the city following the widely publicized stabbing death of a Ukrainian refugee on a light-rail train. The incident has intensified the political debate around crime, with Lyles facing criticism for her response and Republicans leveraging the event to argue for stricter law enforcement policies. The mayor will now face Republican nominee Terrie Donovan, who has also made crime a central issue of her campaign.</p>

          <p>NATO deployed fighter jets as a precautionary measure after Russia launched a large-scale drone and missile attack on Ukraine, with some projectiles reportedly nearing Polish airspace. In response to the threat, Poland elevated its military readiness and temporarily closed four airports, including Warsaw's Chopin Airport, citing "unplanned military activity." While Ukraine's air force initially reported that Russian drones had entered Polish airspace, the statement was later removed. The incident highlights the persistent risk of the conflict spilling over into neighboring NATO territories, demanding constant vigilance from the alliance.</p>

          <p>Nepal's Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has resigned following massive, youth-led protests that erupted across the country, resulting in violent clashes and at least 22 deaths. The demonstrations were initially triggered by a government ban on popular social media platforms but quickly evolved to voice widespread anger over systemic corruption. Protesters, largely identifying as Gen Z, have engaged in acts of civil unrest, including setting fire to government buildings. With the prime minister's departure, the country faces a period of political uncertainty as it remains unclear who is in control.</p>

          <p>A plan to distribute the remaining £25 million fortune of the disbanded Jesus Army sect could result in alleged child abusers receiving larger payments than their victims. The evangelical group, which has already paid £7.7 million in compensation to over 600 survivors through a redress scheme, intends to divide its remaining assets among loyal members who stayed until the end. Survivors and critics have described the proposal as sickening, highlighting that the initial compensation was largely funded by insurers and represented a small fraction of the cult's total wealth. The trust overseeing the process maintains it is acting according to its legal obligations.</p>

          <p>Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have signed a technical agreement aimed at resuming cooperation, including the potential for renewed inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities. The deal was announced after a meeting in Cairo and described by IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi as "a step in the right direction." This development occurs amid heightened tensions, as European nations have threatened to reimpose UN sanctions over Iran's non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear accord. Iranian officials warned that any "hostile act," such as new sanctions, would terminate the agreement.</p>

          <p>A recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai reveals that nearly half of U.S. businesses have redirected investments originally planned for China, the highest proportion on record. The primary beneficiary of this shift is Southeast Asia, as companies seek to mitigate risks associated with ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions and a slowing Chinese economy. Despite a temporary trade truce, the persistent uncertainty and increased competition within China's domestic market are diminishing confidence. The survey noted some improvements in regulatory transparency, but concerns about the long-term business outlook in China remain low. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review the legality of President Trump's broad-based tariffs, setting the stage for a major legal showdown over his economic policies. The case centers on whether the president exceeded his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose duties on goods from nearly every country. Lower courts have ruled against the administration, finding that the law was not intended to grant unlimited tariff power. The Justice Department argues that overturning the tariffs would disrupt sensitive diplomatic negotiations and expose the nation to economic risks.</p>

Researchers attribute this trend to the global shift away from traditional diets towards cheaper, high-calorie, ultra-processed foods.

          <p>Recently released data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows a decline in academic performance among U.S. eighth and twelfth-grade students in science, math, and reading. The assessment, known as The Nation's Report Card, found that average scores dropped in all three subjects between 2019 and 2024. The results also revealed the widest performance gaps ever recorded between the highest- and lowest-achieving students. Officials described the findings as "sobering," noting that the downward trend in student achievement began even before the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>Chinese robotics startup Unitree is planning an initial public offering that could value the company at up to $7 billion, positioning it as a major contender in the global humanoid robot market. The company, which specializes in AI-powered machines designed to resemble humans, has seen rapid growth and has reportedly been profitable since 2020. An IPO of this size would be one of China's largest recent tech listings and comes as Beijing actively supports domestic champions in the AI sector. Unitree's affordable robots are already being deployed in factories, giving it an early lead in commercialization. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian government has lifted a wartime ban that prevented men aged 18 to 60 from leaving the country, now allowing those between 18 and 22 to travel abroad. President Volodymyr Zelensky explained the decision as a way to prevent young people from losing their connection to Ukraine by being taken out of the country by their parents before they turn 18. The move has sparked a debate about its potential impact on the war effort, as Ukraine faces significant manpower challenges. While some young men are eager to leave, others remain committed to staying and contributing to the country's defense.</p>

          <p>A district court judge in Michigan has dismissed all criminal charges against 15 Republicans who signed documents falsely claiming to be the state's official electors in the 2020 presidential election.

The ruling stated that the group genuinely believed there were election irregularities and did not attempt to forge official seals.

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed a memorandum aimed at compelling pharmaceutical companies to comply with existing transparency laws in their advertising, especially on social media platforms. The action will be followed by hundreds of cease-and-desist letters to companies and influencers who fail to clearly disclose risks or identify paid promotions. Administration officials highlighted the issue of misleading social media ads that do not properly disclose side effects or sponsorship.

          <p>The Republican-controlled Missouri House has passed a new congressional map designed to increase the party's advantage in the state's U.S. House delegation from 6-2 to 7-1. The proposal, part of a mid-decade redistricting push encouraged by President Trump, redraws the district of the state's sole Black congressman, Democrat Emmanuel Cleaver, to make it more conservative. The measure now moves to the state Senate, where it is also expected to pass. This effort is part of a national trend where both parties are attempting to use mid-decade redistricting to gain an edge in Congress.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed a plan that would allow banks and payment providers to remove the current £100 cap on contactless card transactions. If implemented, the change would permit unlimited payments via a simple tap, aligning card payments with the unrestricted limits already available through digital wallets on smartphones. The FCA stated that card issuers would be responsible for fraud and would only permit higher-value payments for transactions deemed low-risk. Despite consumer concerns about security, the regulator argues the move reflects evolving payment habits and would reduce "payment friction" for shoppers.</p>

          <p>Apple's newly unveiled iPhone Air, which replaces the physical SIM card slot with eSIM technology, may face a limited or staggered release in the crucial Chinese market. This potential delay is due to regulatory hurdles, as only one of China's three major telecom carriers currently supports eSIM technology. Chinese regulators are reportedly taking a cautious approach to approving the standard, which allows for thinner devices and makes it easier for users to switch carriers. This situation could create a temporary competitive advantage for domestic phone manufacturers, none of which currently use eSIM technology.</p>

The article highlights the case of Istanbul's popular mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu, who is viewed as Erdoğan's most significant political rival and is currently imprisoned on corruption charges that his supporters claim are politically motivated. Critics argue that Erdoğan has dismantled human rights protections and is turning Turkey into an autocracy by arresting hundreds of opposition figures. The international community's response has been muted, potentially due to Turkey's strategic geopolitical importance.</p>

          <p>A leading UK planning lawyer has argued that it would be "unlawful" for the government to approve China's plan to build a massive embassy near the Tower of London. The legal opinion, commissioned by local residents, contends that planning permission cannot be granted because China has redacted, or "greyed out," the intended use of certain rooms in the plans. Opponents, including Hong Kong dissidents, fear these rooms could be used for interrogations. The lawyer asserts that without full disclosure, a proper assessment of the building's use and safety implications is impossible, especially given the diplomatic immunity the site would enjoy.</p>

Industry leaders, organized under the British Horseracing Authority (BHA), argue that raising the tax rate would cost the sport millions in revenue and lead to significant job losses. They fear it would make betting on racing less attractive, reduce sponsorship, and potentially drive customers to unregulated black markets.
