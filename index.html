          <p>Internet services have been restored across Afghanistan following a two-day nationwide blackout imposed by the Taliban government without explanation. The shutdown severely disrupted daily life, impacting communications, banking, and air travel. While the Taliban has not commented on the outage or its restoration, the move was condemned by the United Nations for exacerbating the country's severe humanitarian crisis. This event occurs amidst the Taliban's broader crackdown on rights and public dissent since regaining power in 2021.</p>

          <p>The 10-year Treasury yield decreased after an ADP report revealed a surprise decline of 32,000 private payroll jobs in September, contrary to economists' expectations of an increase. This economic data has gained significance due to the U.S. government shutdown, which is delaying the official September jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The shutdown resulted from a failure by Congress to agree on a temporary spending bill, with ongoing political negotiations adding to economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Idaho has ruled that a public charter school violated the First Amendment rights of Truth Family Bible Church by canceling its lease for Sunday services. The school, Sage International, terminated the agreement over concerns that it could jeopardize a $15 million bond application due to a state amendment preventing public funds from benefiting religious groups. However, Chief U.S. District Judge David Nye determined the church's benefit would have been incidental and that canceling the lease unconstitutionally stifled its religious speech. The ruling affirms that government agencies cannot discriminate against organizations solely based on their religious nature.</p>

A researcher uncovered testimony detailing horrific procedures, such as fatal intravenous injections of soy milk, which had long been documented but largely overlooked. The non-profit organization Pacific Atrocities Education is working to bring greater awareness to these atrocities and the immense human toll of the war in the Pacific theater. The findings highlight a dark and often forgotten chapter of wartime history.</p>

His performance has set a new record for the fastest player this century to score 100 goals for a club in one of Europe's top five leagues, achieving the milestone in just 104 games. Kane's current goal-scoring rate surpasses the best seasonal starts of renowned players like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.

          <p>U.S. private payrolls experienced their largest decline in over two years, falling by 32,000 in September, according to a key report from ADP. This figure starkly contrasts with economists' forecasts of a 45,000 job increase and signals a significant weakening in the labor market. The report gains added importance as the U.S. government shutdown is expected to delay the official Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs data, leaving markets to rely on this private-sector metric. The job losses were concentrated in small businesses and the leisure and hospitality sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A British High Court judge has ordered PPE Medpro, a company linked to entrepreneur Michelle Mone, to repay the government over £121 million ($163 million) for breaching its contract. The company failed to supply sterile surgical gowns as agreed upon during the COVID-19 pandemic, rendering the 25 million items unusable by the National Health Service. The ruling found that the gowns were not properly validated as sterile and therefore did not meet contractual standards.

          <p>Ski areas in Vermont, such as Jay Peak, are turning to an eco-friendly solution for managing overgrown vegetation on their slopes: livestock landscaping. Dozens of sheep and goats are being used to clear acres of land, gradually reducing the reliance on fossil-fuel-powered mowers. The animals are contained by invisible fences with special collars and their movements are tracked via GPS. This method, sometimes called 'goatscaping,' helps reduce the carbon footprint, minimizes soil erosion, and has proven to be a popular and charming addition for resort staff and visitors.</p>

          <p>In an economy marked by persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a way for savers to protect and grow their money with returns that can outpace the inflation rate. Current national average yields are around 1.99% for a one-year CD, but top online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some reaching over 4.40% for shorter terms. Due to an inverted yield curve, short-term CDs of about six months to one year currently provide higher interest rates than longer-term options. Experts suggest laddering CDs to take advantage of high short-term rates while saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

These financial products allow homeowners to borrow against their property's value, often with lower rates and potential tax benefits.

However, the article argues it is filled with holes, most notably the lack of Hamas's agreement and the absence of concrete details on funding for reconstruction or the composition of a proposed international stabilization force.

Zahid, known as 'Boss Man,' was one of seven men who received lengthy sentences for a series of sexual offenses committed between 2001 and 2006. The court heard how the men exploited the vulnerable girls, who were as young as 13, treating them as 'sex slaves' and plying them with drugs and alcohol. The judge described the men's actions as 'appalling,' noting they abused, degraded, and then discarded their victims.</p>

          <p>The popular UK bakery chain Greggs has announced it will raise prices on some items for the third time this year, citing mounting cost pressures. The CEO stated the increases are a response to higher staffing costs, including an unexpected £20 million rise in National Insurance payments. Starting Thursday, the price of breakfast meal deals will increase by 20p, with smaller hikes of about 5p on other products like biscuits. The company plans to continue its expansion with 120 new stores in 2025, while hoping for cost pressures to ease next year.</p>

          <p>This analysis suggests that despite President Trump's Gaza peace plan being heavily skewed in Israel's favor, Hamas has strategic reasons to accept it. The plan demands Hamas disarm and places Gaza under Western control, terms that seem unacceptable. However, accepting the deal would bring immediate relief to Palestinians and allow Hamas to shift its focus to gaining political influence in the West Bank, the true center of Palestinian power. By agreeing, even with conditions, Hamas could put Israel in a difficult position and reposition itself as a more reasonable political actor on the world stage.</p>

          <p>A 24-hour general strike across Greece has halted public transportation, including trains, ferries, and taxis in Athens, causing widespread disruption. The strike was called by the country's largest trade unions to protest proposed labor reforms that could allow employers to extend the workday up to 13 hours. Unions argue the new rules would make workers vulnerable to exploitation and undermine labor rights. Thousands of protesters, including teachers and seafarers, marched to the parliament in Athens to voice their opposition to the government's bill.</p>

          <p>According to investment experts, some ultra-rich Americans are adjusting their portfolios, slightly reducing their exposure to stocks and real estate in favor of assets perceived as safer during volatile times. While equities remain the dominant long-term holding, there is a growing interest in alternatives like gold, private credit, and Bitcoin as a hedge against market choppiness. This strategic shift reflects a short-term effort to 'steady the boat' amid economic uncertainty. The article notes that for most people, a simple, low-cost S&P 500 index fund remains a recommended long-term investment strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the failure of the Senate to pass a funding measure, the U.S. government officially shut down, prompting an immediate and intense blame game between the two major political parties. Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, accused Democrats of voting to close the government over partisan demands. Conversely, Democrats argued that Republicans, who control the White House and Senate, are solely responsible for the shutdown due to their inability to negotiate a bipartisan solution. The impasse centers on a dispute over including healthcare provisions in the federal funding extension.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission has filed an antitrust lawsuit against real estate companies Zillow and Redfin, alleging they illegally conspired to limit competition in the online multifamily rental listing market. The complaint centers on a $100 million deal where Zillow paid Redfin to stop competing and instead feature Zillow's rental listings on its platform. The FTC claims this arrangement eliminated Redfin as an independent competitor for up to nine years, harming renters and property managers in an already concentrated market. Both companies have stated they disagree with the FTC's allegations.</p>
