        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European officials and experts are debating solutions to address China's economic overcapacity, which they fear will flood global markets with subsidized goods. The EU is concerned that decades of overinvestment, state subsidies, weak domestic consumption, and trade wars have created a situation where China's excess industrial output will harm European industries and jobs. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has expressed concerns about a new 'China shock' as China's slowing economy leads to subsidized overcapacity being dumped on global markets. This situation could potentially strengthen populist parties in Europe's manufacturing heartlands if industries are decimated. The EU insists Beijing should address these issues or face a backlash similar to that in the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A SpaceX Starship upper stage exploded during a test at Starbase in Texas, potentially due to a nitrogen tank rupture, according to Elon Musk. The explosion, fueled by methane propellant, caused a large fireball and debris, reminiscent of a 2016 Falcon 9 explosion. Musk stated that preliminary data suggests a nitrogen COPV failed below its proof pressure, which is unprecedented for this design. This test was a precursor to the 10th integrated flight test, and the explosion's impact on the launch schedule is uncertain. NASA is relying on Starship for its Artemis moon mission, requiring multiple launches and propellant transfers in orbit, adding complexity and risk to the mission.</p>

          <p>Comedian Sebastian Maniscalco poked fun at Jeff Bezos' physical transformation during a stand-up routine at Cannes Lions 2025. Maniscalco joked about Bezos' evolution from a "complete nerd" to a "shredded" billionaire on his yacht. He also humorously commented on Amazon's packaging practices, highlighting the contrast between large boxes and small items. The comedian's routine coincided with Bezos and his fiancÃ©e Lauren SÃ¡nchez's public appearances ahead of their wedding, and Maniscalco praised Bezos as a "genius" for his business acumen.</p>

          <p>This article examines the Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA) and the reasons behind the U.S.'s withdrawal from it. The JCPOA, signed in 2015, imposed restrictions on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the deal in 2018, arguing it was defective and did not prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Since then, Iran has reduced its breakout time, and negotiations to return to the JCPOA have stalled. The White House has stated that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a couple of weeks if given the order, and Trump will decide within two weeks whether to take military action against Tehran.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft has resigned as a government whip in protest against planned cuts to disability benefits. She stated that while she understands the need to address the welfare bill, cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit should not be part of the solution. The government insists it is fixing a broken welfare system, ensuring those who can work are supported, while protecting those with severe disabilities. The government's bill tightens the criteria for personal independence payments and cuts the sickness-related element of universal credit, which has faced criticism from Labour MPs.</p>

          <p>Democratic members of Congress are being denied access to immigrant detention facilities, which experts say is an illegal shift from past practice. A federal statute states that funds may not be used to prevent a member of Congress from entering facilities used to detain aliens for oversight purposes. ICE guidelines request 72 hours' notice from lawmakers, but the statute doesn't require it. Lawmakers believe ICE is trying to hide poor conditions and lack of attorney access, while DHS claims the restrictions are due to safety concerns and disruptions. Some lawmakers are considering a lawsuit to compel access, arguing the administration is operating outside the bounds of the law.</p>

The Dodgers have faced criticism for not speaking out in support of the immigrant community, and they plan to announce plans to help those affected by recent raids later this week.

          <p>A newer COVID-19 variant, NB.1.8.1, is associated with a severe sore throat, nicknamed "razor blade throat," and has been detected in several states. This variant, derived from the omicron variant XVD.1.5.1, is classified as a "variant under monitoring" by the WHO. It accounts for an estimated 37% of cases in the U.S. and appears more transmissible due to changes in the spike protein. Experts recommend high-risk individuals receive bi-annual vaccinations and practice good hygiene, although there is no evidence that this variant causes more severe disease or hospitalization.</p>

In response to the raids, marches have taken place to condemn anti-immigrant policies, and organizations are providing resources and assistance to those affected.

The study found that fee-based policies were more effective than full or partial bans. California's experience shows that stricter laws with fewer loopholes are needed to make a measurable difference in reducing plastic waste, as the state is now implementing a statewide ban on single-use plastic bags.</p>

          <h2>Why Israel Might Strike Iran's Fordo Nuclear Facility</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 16:53:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses why Israel might target Iran's Fordo nuclear facility, which is buried deep underground and suspected of being a site for clandestine nuclear weapons development. Despite U.S. intelligence assessments suggesting Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon, Israel claims Iran is "racing towards a nuclear bomb." Experts believe Fordo is crucial to Iran's efforts, and destroying it may require the U.S.-produced Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb. President Trump is considering military action and will make a decision within two weeks.</p>

          <p>'28 Years Later,' directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland, is praised as an excellent horror film that shakes and moves viewers in equal measure. The film adopts an ambitious approach, expanding its geographic scope and immersing viewers in a supposedly idyllic rural community that serves as a seemingly secure refuge for those who have evaded the virus. The film stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer, and Alfie Williams, with Williams's performance particularly highlighted. The film's visual style, shot largely with iPhones 15 Pro Max, is described as constantly engaging, and the overall result is considered explosive and outstanding.</p>

          <p>Vehicles from the Department of Homeland Security with masked agents were stationed outside Dodger Stadium on Thursday morning, indicating intense immigration raids in Southern California. It is unclear what operation the federal agents were carrying out or whether anyone was detained in the area. According to sources familiar with the situation, the agents were denied entry to the Dodger Stadium grounds when they attempted to access the parking lots. The Dodgers have been under pressure to make a statement in support of immigrants since the raids began earlier this month.</p>
