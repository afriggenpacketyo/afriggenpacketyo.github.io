          <p>America First Legal, a group established by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, has formally requested that the Department of Justice investigate Johns Hopkins School of Medicine for what it calls "illegal DEI practices." The complaint alleges that the university uses diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives to unlawfully implement race-based preferences in admissions, scholarships, and hiring, thereby circumventing the Supreme Court's ban on affirmative action. The group is asking the DOJ to compel the university to end these programs and to conduct an audit of federal funding it has received.</p>

          <p>A former Kentucky police officer, Brett Hankison, has been sentenced to 33 months in federal prison for violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights during the 2020 raid that led to her death. The sentence was delivered despite a controversial recommendation from the Trump administration's Justice Department for only a one-day term. Hankison is the only officer to be criminally convicted in connection with the raid, which became a focal point for the Black Lives Matter movement. Taylor's family expressed mixed feelings, acknowledging the sentence as a small measure of justice while criticizing the government's initial light sentencing request.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines has announced a significant change to its long-standing business model, confirming it will eliminate its open seating policy and introduce assigned seating starting January 27, 2026. This move, which follows the recent elimination of its "bags fly free" policy, is part of a broader strategy to generate new revenue amid financial pressures. The airline will also overhaul its boarding process, grouping passengers by seat location and offering priority options for a fee. Customers will be able to book flights with the new assigned seating system beginning July 29 of this year.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys star Micah Parsons has publicly amplified criticism of team owner Jerry Jones after Jones made surprising comments about player availability and injuries. Jones took an apparent jab at Parsons and quarterback Dak Prescott, noting their time missed due to injuries while discussing contract negotiations. Former NFL star J.J.

The incident adds a layer of tension as Parsons, one of the league's top defensive players, is seeking a significant contract extension.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from The Atlantic argues that President Trump's second term is characterized by a culture of pettiness and retribution rather than coherent policy goals. The article points to recent actions, such as barring former DNI James Clapper from a CIA event and pushing to fire the Fed Chairman, as examples of personal grievances driving executive decisions. It contends that even major foreign policy shifts, like the approach to the war in Ukraine, are often rooted in emotional reactions to being slighted rather than strategic planning. This governing style, animated by anger and vengefulness, is reportedly internalized by administration officials, creating a culture of purges and loyalty checks.</p>

In a letter to the president, Cantwell outlined bipartisan recommendations, including upgrading Doppler radar and weather satellites, to provide more timely and accurate warnings for extreme events. The plea comes as the administration has proposed a 27% budget reduction for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which could terminate research programs aimed at improving flood and precipitation predictions.

The potential appointment of Bove, who is seen as one of Trump's most contentious nominees, may signal a continuation or even an escalation of this strategy to reshape the federal judiciary.

          <p>A new analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that President Trump's latest tax bill will add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The legislation makes permanent the 2017 corporate and individual tax cuts, while introducing new deductions for tipped and overtime workers. To partially offset the $4.5 trillion in lost revenue, the bill implements major cuts to Medicaid and food stamps through stricter eligibility, which the CBO estimates will leave 10 million Americans without health insurance by 2034. The bill also boosts funding for immigration enforcement and the southern border wall. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has confirmed the withdrawal of all 700 active-duty U.S. marines who were deployed to Los Angeles over a month ago by the Trump administration. The deployment, which was made against the objections of local and state leaders, followed violence that occurred during protests against federal immigration sweeps. A Pentagon spokesperson stated that the marines' presence had achieved its goal of sending a clear message that lawlessness would not be tolerated and that stability was returning to the city. This withdrawal follows the recall of 2,000 National Guard troops from the city last week.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Harvard University and the Trump administration have faced off in a Boston federal court over the president's decision to strip the university of over $2 billion in federal research grants. The administration claims the cuts are a necessary measure to combat antisemitism on campus, a justification the presiding judge appeared to find skeptical, calling the government's claims "mind-boggling." Harvard's lawyers argued the move unlawfully interferes with the university's operations and will harm vital public research into medicine, space travel, and AI. The case is being closely watched and is likely to be appealed regardless of the outcome.</p>

The signatories, which include France, Canada, and Japan, expressed that the suffering of civilians has reached "new depths" and warned of potential further action to support a permanent ceasefire.

This policy change comes amid delays in trade negotiations with the U.S. and growing American unease over Argentina's strengthening relationship with China.

          <p>A new report from San Jose State University reveals a staggering level of economic inequality in Silicon Valley, where just nine households now control 15% of the region's total wealth. The annual "Silicon Valley Pain Index" finds that the wealth gap in the tech hub has widened at double the rate of the rest of the United States over the past decade. While the nine wealthiest households saw their collective wealth increase by $136 billion in the last year, 110,000 local households reported having little to no assets. The report also highlights the extreme cost of living, with San Jose ranked as one of the most unaffordable cities worldwide. (not investment advice)</p>

At the sentencing, Etan's father condemned Hernandez as a "monster," finally finding a measure of accountability after decades of uncertainty.

However, a key difference is that HELOC rates are variable and can change with market conditions, while home equity loan rates are fixed, providing payment stability.
