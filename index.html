          <p>At least 16 people have died after a multi-story residential building collapsed in southern Pakistan. Rescue operations are ongoing, with emergency workers using heavy machinery to search for at least eight more people believed to be trapped in the rubble. The incident highlights the recurring issue of poor construction standards and lack of safety regulation enforcement in the country, which has led to numerous similar tragedies in recent years. Relatives of the missing remain at the scene as the difficult search continues in a narrow street hampering rescue efforts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ESPN analyst Carolyn Peck has drawn significant criticism for suggesting the Indiana Fever are a "more dangerous" team without their injured star rookie, Caitlin Clark. Peck argued that Clark's absence allows other players like Kelsey Mitchell and Aliyah Boston to showcase their talents, making the team's offense less predictable. Her comments sparked a strong negative reaction on social media from Clark's supporters and sports commentators, who pointed to team statistics showing a decline in offensive rating without Clark. The backlash highlights the intense media scrutiny and passionate fanbase surrounding the WNBA phenom's professional career.</p>

          <p>A doctor working at a public hospital in California provides a first-hand account of the severe challenges faced by Medicaid patients. The article argues that newly passed federal work requirements, intended to curb fraud, will disproportionately harm the most vulnerable individuals who, despite qualifying for exemptions, cannot navigate the bureaucratic hurdles due to issues like homelessness, lack of internet access, or disability. Citing CBO projections, the author warns that nearly 12 million Americans could lose insurance, leading to devastating consequences for both patients and the safety-net hospitals that serve them.

          <p>James McMurdock, the Reform UK Member of Parliament for South Basildon and East Thurrock, has had the party whip removed following allegations of improper business conduct. According to chief whip Lee Anderson, the allegations pertain to the period during the pandemic, before McMurdock was elected. McMurdock reportedly "removed the party whip from himself" and has agreed to cooperate with a full investigation. This development reduces Reform UK's number of sitting MPs to four, marking the second time an MP from their 2024 intake has lost the whip.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Inspired by a trip to Denmark, a professor at Emory University's Goizueta Business School undertook a year-long experiment of trying 17 different hobbies to combat burnout and a "Type-A" mindset. The experience led to significant personal changes, including breaking a doomscrolling habit, feeling less lonely by connecting with hobbyist communities, and redefining self-care away from passive appointments toward active engagement. The author concludes that actively pursuing hobbies, rather than waiting for work-life balance to appear, is a key secret to a happier, more confident, and fulfilled life, forcing individuals to set healthy boundaries.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the mixed verdict in Sean "Diddy" Combs' federal sex-trafficking trial highlights the legal system's inability to effectively handle cases of intimate partner violence and coercive control. While Combs was found guilty on lesser charges, his acquittal on the most serious counts demonstrates how prosecutors often resort to trafficking charges due to outdated domestic violence statutes and short statutes of limitation. The author suggests that both the legal framework and media narratives often fail to grasp the complexities of abuse, especially when the accused is wealthy and powerful. The article uses the word 'sexual assault' in its text.</p>

          <p>This feature explores the work of Reverend William Barber and the revived Poor People's Campaign, a national "fusion movement" using nonviolent protest and moral theology to challenge systemic inequality and poverty. The article details a "Moral Monday" protest in Washington D.C., where a diverse group of activists gathered to oppose proposed budget cuts to social programs, which Barber terms "policy murder." Drawing on the tradition of prophetic witness, the movement aims to force a moral reckoning in the public square, arguing that true national healing requires confronting injustices against the poor, regardless of the ruling political party.</p>

          <p>Credit scoring company Fico has announced that it will begin incorporating buy now, pay later (BNPL) loan data into its credit score models, a change that could significantly impact consumers. For users who make their payments on time, this could provide a new avenue to build a positive credit history, especially for younger consumers or those with limited credit. However, it also means that late payments on BNPL loans from services like Affirm and Klarna will now negatively affect credit scores, which could harm borrowers who are already financially constrained or struggling with debt.

          <p>A Guardian investigation has revealed the existence of the Old Glory Club (OGC), a nationwide network of at least 26 far-right, men-only clubs across 20 states. The network, which includes military personnel, lawyers, and civil servants among its "literally hundreds" of members, promotes extremist ideologies through podcasts, conferences, and online platforms. Key figures in the organization have openly expressed racist and antisemitic views, and the group's structure is designed to build offline social networks to advance a far-right political agenda. Experts warn that such groups represent a new, dangerous breed of extremist organization.</p>

          <p>Michigan's tart cherry farmers, who produce 75% of the U.S. crop, are facing a confluence of threats that endanger their livelihood and a key part of the state's identity. Climate change is causing more volatile weather, including early thaws followed by damaging frosts, which devastated this year's harvest. Additionally, farmers are struggling with rising land prices due to development pressure, labor shortages for harvesting and processing, and the economic impact of tariffs. These challenges create a precarious situation for the multi-generational family farms that are the backbone of the region's $6.3 billion specialty crop industry.</p>

          <p>At least 24 people have died in a "mass casualty event" after catastrophic flash floods struck the Texas Hill Country. The Guadalupe River rose an astonishing 26 feet in just 45 minutes, inundating the area with little warning. A children's summer camp, Camp Mystic, was severely affected, with 23 to 25 campers still reported as unaccounted for. Hundreds of people have been evacuated, many by helicopter, as extensive search and rescue operations continue. Governor Greg Abbott has signed a disaster declaration for the affected counties to provide state resources for the response.</p>

          <p>Fears of a potential serial killer are growing in Austin, Texas, after the discovery of 38 bodies in or near Lady Bird Lake since 2022, with 30 of the victims being men. Despite police attributing most deaths to accidental drownings, often involving alcohol, the pattern has fueled public speculation and concern. Some forensic experts argue that the high number of male victims is statistically significant and that the possibility of a killer targeting men, perhaps using date-rape drugs near the popular Rainey Street bar district, cannot be prematurely dismissed, even as authorities maintain there is no evidence of foul play.</p>

          <p>This opinion column criticizes the recent rise of "tradwife" (traditional wife) influencers and conservative conferences that encourage young women to prioritize marriage and homemaking over careers. The author argues this is not a new phenomenon, but a recycled anti-feminist argument, similar to those made by Phyllis Schlafly decades ago, that ignores the extensive legal and social progress secured by feminism. The piece points out the hypocrisy of successful career women like Dana Loesch telling other women they "cannot have it all," while also highlighting the hidden stresses and exhaustion faced by prominent tradwife figures.</p>

          <p>A high school student explores why many of her male peers are drawn to the "manosphere" and right-leaning ideologies promoted by figures like Joe Rogan and Andrew Tate. Through interviews with classmates, she finds that these figures appeal to boys through a projection of masculinity and powerful, simple rhetoric that frames white men as being "under siege." The author argues that many boys feel unwelcome on the left due to a fear of "cancel culture" and that the Democratic Party must do more to make them feel included, rather than allowing them to be exclusively courted by the right.</p>

          <p>Following a 12-day military conflict, analysts question the permanence of Israel's declared "historic victory" over Iran. While U.S. and Israeli strikes significantly damaged Iran's nuclear facilities and killed key personnel, the fundamental knowledge and a stockpile of enriched uranium likely remain, allowing for a potential reconstitution of the program. Iran has already moved to suspend cooperation with IAEA inspectors, signaling defiance. Experts suggest the conflict is merely an intermission in a long-running shadow war, with both sides facing a future of perpetual cat-and-mouse games, costly defense, and difficult, distrustful diplomacy.</p>
