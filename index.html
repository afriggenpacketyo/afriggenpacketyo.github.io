            <p>New tariffs imposed by the Trump administration could significantly impact the availability of baby products, according to Munchkin CEO Steve Dunn. The high tariffs are forcing companies to halt orders and cut jobs, potentially preventing essential baby products from reaching parents. Dunn argues that the U.S. lacks the necessary manufacturing infrastructure and expertise to onshore production. He is calling for an exemption or carve-out for the juvenile industry to support parents. (Optimism Score: 30)</p>
