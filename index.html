        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, minimum salaries will be implemented in England's top two women's football tiers, the Women's Super League (WSL) and WSL 2, starting this season. This new requirement, described as a "full-time wage," is part of a broader effort by WSL Football to professionalize the sport and ensure players do not need to juggle part-time jobs. The salary thresholds will consider factors like age, league, and experience, developed in consultation with the Professional Footballers’ Association. This move accompanies increased criteria for high-performance environments and welfare support, including a new partnership with Nike to provide equipment to players without endorsement deals.</p>

          <p>A forensic psychologist and clinical traumatologist explores the significant, often unseen, psychological trauma inflicted upon Jewish children due to rising antisemitism in schools and online. The article argues that persistent exposure to hate acts as a chronic stressor, leading to anxiety, depression, and academic impairment, with recent surveys indicating one in four American Jewish students has experienced antisemitic incidents. This modern hostility can also reactivate intergenerational trauma from past persecutions like the Holocaust, embedding fear biologically across generations. The author calls for educators, parents, and community organizations to recognize antisemitism as a serious mental health risk and implement robust support and prevention programs.</p>

          <p>The primary podcast of the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC), a denomination associated with US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has been featuring guests who advocate for Christian nationalist and other far-right ideologies. The podcast, CrossPolitic, recently hosted a theocratic Canadian pastor calling for the U.S. to absorb Canada and another guest who supports Russia's rise and the criminalization of homosexuality. This platform raises questions about the influence of such extremist views on Hegseth's policy perspectives, particularly as the movement openly opposes liberal democratic principles. The podcast's hosts are close associates of Douglas Wilson, a prominent and controversial pastor within the CREC.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Demand for mortgages to purchase homes has decreased, ending a four-week period of gains, even as average interest rates fell to their lowest point since April. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, purchase applications dropped by 3% for the week, although they remain significantly higher than a year ago. Refinance applications saw a slight increase, but the overall market activity pulled back, suggesting that high home prices and affordability challenges continue to be a major barrier for potential buyers. These market dynamics persist despite a greater inventory of homes for sale compared to last year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Survey Data Suggests Married Mothers Report Higher Levels of Happiness</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to a prevailing narrative that single, child-free women are happiest, a new nationally representative survey indicates that married mothers report the highest levels of happiness. The study found 19% of married mothers describe themselves as "very happy," compared to smaller percentages of married women without children, unmarried mothers, and unmarried child-free women. This happiness is linked to a greater sense of purpose and meaning in life, which mothers reported at significantly higher rates than non-mothers. Additionally, married women reported less loneliness and more physical affection, a factor strongly correlated with happiness, challenging the negative messaging surrounding marriage and motherhood.</p>

          <p>A growing number of influential figures on the American right, including podcasters and commentators associated with the MAGA movement, are actively working to rehabilitate the historical image of Adolf Hitler. This trend involves downplaying Nazi atrocities and suggesting the Allied powers were the true villains of World War II, a narrative that has found a platform on popular shows. This revisionism is seen as an attempt to dismantle the post-war consensus against antisemitism, which became a core American value after the horrors of the Holocaust were revealed. The article argues this effort aims to normalize conspiratorial prejudice by changing how America understands its own past.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Party's strategy of forging an exceptionally tight alliance with organized labor under President Biden has not successfully reversed the party's declining support among working-class voters. Despite significant policy concessions, including a major pension fund bailout, these voters have continued to drift away, often prioritizing cultural issues over economic ones. The article argues that unconditional deference to union demands can lead to policies that increase the cost of living, such as tariffs and restrictive construction rules, which ultimately harms the very voters the party aims to attract. A more balanced, pre-Biden approach that supports labor rights without sacrificing the broader public interest is proposed as a wiser path forward.</p>

          <p>An optimistic outlook for the Los Angeles Rams suggests they are poised for a Super Bowl run, defying conservative win projections. The team's potential is bolstered by key offseason acquisitions, including receiver Davante Adams and center Coleman Shelton, who address weaknesses exposed in last season's narrow playoff loss to Philadelphia. The defense, which showed significant improvement late last season, is expected to continue its ascent with young stars and the addition of run-stopper Poona Ford. With quarterback Matthew Stafford's proven resilience and coach Sean McVay's leadership, combined with a relatively favorable schedule, the team is considered a strong contender in a weakened NFC.</p>

          <p>The yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond briefly surpassed the 5% threshold as investors grapple with multiple sources of economic and political uncertainty. Market sentiment is being influenced by a recent court ruling that deemed many of President Trump's tariffs illegal, potentially requiring billions in refunds. Additional concerns stem from the president's efforts to dismiss a Federal Reserve Board Governor, which traders fear could undermine the central bank's independence and its credibility in fighting inflation. This nervousness in the U.S. bond market reflects a broader global sell-off in government bonds ahead of the upcoming monthly jobs report. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democratic strategists' focus on messaging and polling misses a more fundamental problem: the party is consistently fighting political battles on terms defined by Republicans. Drawing on E.E. Schattschneider's 1960 theory of conflict, the article argues that the side that determines what the dominant political fight is about ultimately wins. While Republicans successfully frame conflicts around potent themes like "the people vs. corrupt institutions," Democrats have been relegated to a defensive posture, defending the status quo and arguing over policy details. To regain ground, the party must proactively define new, compelling conflicts, such as "builders vs. extractors," to scramble existing coalitions and create a more favorable political terrain.</p>

The site's mundane appearance is intentional, a result of post-war decisions by Soviet and East German authorities to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine.

          <p>Human bodies are not naturally equipped for long-duration spaceflight, presenting a major obstacle to ambitions of colonizing Mars. The emerging field of space medicine is working to address these challenges, which include heightened risks of osteoporosis, muscle loss, and radiation-induced cancers from existing in microgravity. As commercial space tourism increases, scientists will have more opportunities to study a wider range of health conditions in space, but significant knowledge gaps remain, particularly regarding reproduction and mental health. Advances in this field, from AI-assisted diagnostics to creating organoid "avatars" for testing, are essential for ensuring human survival on interplanetary missions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A proposal for a new marijuana dispensary in Chicago's West Ridge neighborhood has been effectively blocked by the local alderman due to the ownership group's background as retired police officers. Alderman Andre Vasquez cited a "fundamental justice concern" raised by residents, questioning the fairness of former officers profiting from cannabis sales when they were once paid to arrest people for the same activity. The ownership group, which is 85% Black and won a state social equity license, argued that its members served their communities for decades and have a right to pursue the business. The alderman's opposition to the necessary zoning change halts the project.</p>

          <p>The personal wardrobe of the late Venezuelan-born painter Luchita Hurtado, crafted entirely by herself over 80 years, is being shared publicly for the first time. Hurtado developed a signature uniform, typically a boxy, four-pocket shirt inspired by Japanese workwear, which she adapted with various fabrics and details throughout her life. Her journey into making her own clothes began out of necessity when she couldn't find maternity wear she liked, and it evolved into a core part of her daily practice of self-expression, alongside her painting and journaling.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the Republican Party, including its physician members in Congress, has abandoned scientific principles, exemplified by the confirmation of anti-vaccine activist Robert F.

Today, Republican doctors like Senator Bill Cassidy are criticized for enabling the spread of disinformation and supporting policies that cut Medicaid and renewable energy funding. This trajectory is presented as a dangerous shift from evidence-based policy to self-defeating denialism that threatens America's public health infrastructure.</p>

Gutfeld credits his success to recreating the unpredictable, panel-based humor of his earlier cult show, "Red Eye," but for a broader prime-time audience. He argues that other late-night shows created an opportunity for him by neglecting a large portion of the country and focusing on making viewers angry rather than entertaining them.</p>

          <p>A historical review of California politics reveals a consistent pattern of extremely wealthy candidates failing to win the state's highest offices, such as governor or U.S. senator, despite spending vast personal fortunes. Over the past 50 years, numerous multimillionaires and billionaires, including Meg Whitman and Carly Fiorina, have been defeated in their bids for these top positions. Political strategists suggest that while wealth provides name recognition, voters are often suspicious of candidates who seem out of touch with the lives of average people, creating an "empathy gap." This trend provides important context as billionaire developer Rick Caruso considers entering the race to succeed Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>

The proposed 6,000-foot tunnel would be the longest highway tunnel in California, bypassing the eroding cliffs that have caused constant closures and claimed lives.

However, new strategies are emerging to lessen these effects, such as improved dilution and dispersal techniques used at plants like the one in Carlsbad, California.

With just 7.3 million tonnes produced in 2024, about half the level of 1990, the MPA is calling for government action to create a level playing field for domestic manufacturers.
