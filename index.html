          <p>Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York Mellon are collaborating to provide institutional investors with access to tokenized money market funds, marking a significant move to integrate blockchain technology into the $7.1 trillion industry. This partnership enables BNY Mellon's clients to invest in funds where ownership is recorded on Goldman's digital platform, aiming for more efficient and seamless transactions. Key financial players, including BlackRock and Fidelity, are already participating, highlighting the appeal of these yield-bearing digital assets compared to stablecoins. This initiative establishes a foundation for a future real-time, digital ecosystem for trading money market funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A coalition of 115 international aid organizations has issued a stark warning about "mass starvation" in Gaza, attributing the crisis to the ongoing Israeli government siege. The joint statement highlights the severe food shortages that have forced even aid workers into food lines and led to record rates of acute malnutrition, especially among children and the elderly. According to the Gaza Ministry of Health, the death toll from hunger and malnutrition has surpassed 100, with a significant number of these deaths occurring in recent days. Groups like Doctors Without Borders and Oxfam are calling for immediate action to address the catastrophic humanitarian situation.</p>

          <p>U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff is set to travel to Europe to continue diplomatic efforts aimed at securing a ceasefire and peace agreement in the Israel-Hamas conflict. Indirect negotiations are ongoing, with mediators awaiting Hamas's response to a recent proposal for a 60-day truce that would involve the release of hostages and an increase in humanitarian aid to Gaza. A key sticking point remains the positioning of Israeli Defense Forces during any potential ceasefire. The Trump administration is reportedly cautiously optimistic about a breakthrough, as diplomatic pressure mounts to resolve the 21-month-long war and alleviate the civilian crisis.</p>

          <p>Two former London-based traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for manipulating the Libor and Euribor interest rates overturned by the UK's Supreme Court. After a ten-year legal fight, the court ruled that their original trials were unfair due to misdirection of the jury, rendering the convictions unsafe. The men, who were jailed following the 2008 financial crisis, had consistently argued they were wrongly prosecuted for what were then common commercial practices. The Serious Fraud Office has stated it will not seek a retrial, a decision that vindicates the traders and may pave the way for others convicted in the scandal to appeal.</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has agreed to a retrial for Choi Mal-ja, a woman convicted in 1964 for injuring her attacker in self-defense. At 19, Choi bit off part of a man's tongue to escape a sexual assault but was subsequently found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm, while her aggressor received a lenient sentence. Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi, now 80, has fought for years to clear her name, arguing her actions were a legitimate act of self-defense. In the new hearing, prosecutors have asked the court to acquit her, marking a pivotal moment for victims' rights and the legal perception of self-defense in South Korea.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board has determined that the 2023 plane crash that killed Eugene Peltola Jr., husband of former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, was likely caused by multiple factors. The investigation found the aircraft was overweight from carrying moose meat and experienced significant drag from a set of antlers affixed to the wing strut. These conditions, combined with turbulent downdrafts, probably resulted in the plane having insufficient power to clear the terrain. The report noted that while carrying antlers externally is a common practice in Alaska, it requires formal FAA approval, which was not documented for the accident aircraft.</p>

This shift is expected to prompt a restructuring of supply chains as businesses seek to minimize costs and diversify risks in response to the new U.S. trade posture.

          <p>This article explores the potential long-term consequences of the expanded presidential powers asserted during the Trump administration, questioning how a future Democratic president might wield them. The analysis suggests that while a new administration could reverse many policies, such as by firing political appointees or reconstituting dismantled agencies, the powers are primarily destructive rather than creative. Firing experts is easier than hiring them back, and the resulting instability could lead to a "pendulum swing" of retaliatory actions between parties. This cycle could ultimately favor a conservative agenda of shrinking government, as destruction is structurally easier than rebuilding, leading to an ever-diminishing federal government.</p>

          <p>David Geier, appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to investigate a CDC vaccine database, has a history of controversial and discredited research. Geier and his late father were previously sanctioned for promoting an unproven autism treatment and had their access to the same CDC database revoked for unauthorized research. Experts have identified fundamental statistical errors in Geier's past studies that used this data, rendering their conclusions about vaccine harms meaningless. Critics are concerned that Geier's appointment is politically motivated and that he will use his new position to resurrect debunked claims rather than conduct an objective scientific inquiry.</p>

          <p>A Berlin court has acquitted German comedian Sebastian Hotz, known as "El Hotzo," of charges that he condoned a criminal offense through satirical online posts made after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump. Prosecutors had argued his posts, which joked about the attempt, constituted hate crimes that could disrupt public order. However, the judge ruled that the posts were clearly recognizable as satire, albeit in bad taste, and were not intended to incite violence. The verdict affirms the protection of satire within a liberal democracy, with the judge noting that robust debate over differing opinions is a desirable societal feature.</p>

Originally the HMS Hind, a 24-gun Royal Navy frigate, the ship participated in the American War of Independence before being sold and repurposed as a whaling ship in the Arctic. Using dendrochronology and archival research, a team of archaeologists and local historians pieced together its identity. The ship ultimately wrecked in a storm in 1788, but all 56 crew members survived, adding another chapter to the vessel's remarkable journey.</p>

          <p>The upcoming EU-China summit in Beijing is set against a backdrop of escalating trade tensions and diplomatic friction, with low expectations for any significant breakthrough. The EU is frustrated by a massive €400 billion trade deficit, restrictive market access in China, and the dumping of subsidized Chinese electric vehicles. Furthermore, China's control over rare earth mineral exports and its tacit support for Russia in the Ukraine war have deepened the divide. With Beijing showing limited willingness to engage on these issues, analysts believe the summit is more about damage control than fostering a deeper partnership, as both sides remain deadlocked.</p>

The lenient sentence was attributed to a psychological assessment concluding she was under "extreme emotional distress" at the time, having recently been homeless and facing financial pressure.

The automotive sector is highly vulnerable to tariffs, and Germany's auto industry association is now intensifying its call for a negotiated solution to the ongoing tariff conflict with the U.S. The U.S.-Japan deal is seen as a potential precedent for reducing trade barriers with other key exporters.

While a massive amount of capital is flowing into AI, the primary exit trend has been frequent, lower-value acquisitions of smaller companies by larger firms looking to integrate AI capabilities.
