          <p>An active-duty sergeant allegedly opened fire on his coworkers at Fort Stewart, Georgia, wounding five soldiers before being subdued by other soldiers on site. The suspect, identified as Quornelius Radford, reportedly used a personal weapon, and a motive is still under investigation. All five victims are in stable condition and expected to recover, with officials praising the quick actions of soldiers who tackled the gunman, preventing further casualties. The White House and Department of Defense have been briefed on the incident.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services, led by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has terminated approximately $500 million in federal funding for 22 projects developing mRNA vaccines for viruses like COVID-19 and the flu. Kennedy, who has a history of vaccine skepticism, claimed the technology poses more risks than benefits for respiratory viruses, a statement strongly contested by leading infectious disease experts. Critics, including the former surgeon general, condemned the decision, warning it will cost lives and leave the U.S. vulnerable to future pandemics by defunding a proven, life-saving technology.</p>

          <p>Following pressure from the White House, Apple has announced plans to invest an additional $100 billion in its U.S. operations, aiming to bolster its domestic supply chain and manufacturing capabilities. The announcement came after President Trump threatened a potential 100% tariff on foreign-made semiconductors for companies not building facilities in the United States. As part of the commitment, Apple plans to increase spending on its domestic supply chain, create new data centers, and establish a smart glass production line in Kentucky.</p>

          <p>A UK charity commission investigation has cleared Prince Harry of bullying allegations at Sentebale, an African charity he co-founded. The probe found no evidence of systemic bullying or misconduct by the prince, though it criticized all parties for allowing the internal dispute with the charity's current chair to become public. In a blistering statement, a spokesperson for Harry noted the findings but expressed concern that the chair's actions have damaged the organization, ultimately harming the children it supports. The dispute led to Harry and his co-founder resigning as patrons earlier this year.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated there is a "good chance" he will soon meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to press for an end to the war in Ukraine.

An envoy for the president recently held what was described as a "highly productive" meeting in Moscow. The White House confirmed it is open to a summit, though neither Russia nor Ukraine has publicly commented on the prospect.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the escalating technology and trade rivalry with the United States, China is leveraging its dominance over the global supply of rare earth minerals. As the U.S. has imposed export bans and tariffs to slow China's progress in artificial intelligence and semiconductors, Beijing has retaliated with export controls on key rare earth elements.

          <p>A human foot found inside a hiking shoe on the shore of Utah's Fish Lake has been identified as belonging to David White, a man who went missing 28 years ago. White disappeared in 1997 after going fishing alone; his boat was later found empty. The recent discovery of the shoe, a model made for only one year in 1996, provided a crucial link to the cold case. DNA from the remains was matched to White's daughter with 99.9994% certainty, finally providing some closure for the family and the original search and rescue members.</p>

          <p>Claire’s, the mall-based accessory chain for teens, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time since 2018, citing pressure from online competitors and shifting consumer trends. The company, once a staple for ear piercings and affordable jewelry, plans to keep its North American stores open during the process while it seeks financial partners. Experts attribute the decline to the decreasing popularity of shopping malls and intense competition from low-cost online retailers like Shein and Temu. The company has also been impacted by steep tariffs on goods imported from China.</p>

          <p>With home equity loan rates currently averaging over 8%, this article outlines several strategies for homeowners to obtain a more favorable rate. Key recommendations include improving one's financial profile by boosting their credit score and lowering their debt-to-income ratio to appear as a more attractive borrower to lenders. Additionally, homeowners are advised to shop around and encourage lenders to compete for their business, rather than simply accepting the first offer from their current mortgage provider.

          <p>The White House's apparent decision to block Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te from making a transit stop in New York has drawn sharp criticism from prominent Democrats, but has been met with relative silence from Republicans. In a letter to the Secretary of State, three senior Democratic representatives called the move a "stark departure from precedent" that sends a "dangerous signal to Beijing." The muted response from Republicans, who are typically strong supporters of Taiwan, is a notable shift and comes amid sensitive U.S.-China trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>As Republicans aggressively pursue mid-decade redistricting in states like Texas to secure their House majority, Democrats find themselves constrained by their own past good-government reforms. This article explores how Democratic support for independent redistricting commissions in blue states like New York and California has made it much harder for them to retaliate against GOP gerrymandering. While Republicans can quickly redraw maps through legislative action, Democrats face lengthy processes involving constitutional amendments to undo the nonpartisan systems they championed, a delay that could prove costly in the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>The commission for America's 250th anniversary celebration, America250, is reportedly in turmoil amid accusations of a partisan takeover by the Trump administration. The conflict escalated after the commission's top political appointee asked four Republican-appointed commissioners to resign, a move allegedly coordinated with the House Speaker's office to install new members. This has backfired, creating a struggle for control within the supposedly bipartisan organization. The turmoil threatens to undermine the national unity envisioned for the 2026 semiquincentennial celebrations, which have already been marked by partisan political rallies.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that fraudulent scientific research is being produced and published at an industrial scale, with unethical authors and editors colluding to pollute academic literature. Researchers identified clusters of problematic papers, finding that a small number of editors at one journal handled a disproportionate number of retracted articles. These fraudulent papers, often sold by organizations known as "paper mills," are a response to institutional pressures in some countries where promotions are tied to publication counts. Experts warn this trend erodes trust and makes it difficult for legitimate scientists to build upon reliable research.</p>

Arwen Greenlaw's brother, Fiongal Greenlaw-Meek, and his husband were among the 242 people killed on the flight. After their mother traveled to India for identification, the returned casket was found to contain the remains of two different people, neither of whom was her son.

          <p>The runway at Birmingham Airport was shut down for over six hours after a small aircraft experienced landing gear problems and made an emergency landing. The plane's main undercarriage collapsed on touchdown, but the two crew members and one passenger on board were not seriously injured. The closure led to significant disruptions, with thousands of travelers facing delayed and canceled flights. Many inbound flights were diverted to other airports. The runway reopened in the evening after the aircraft was safely removed, and the Air Accidents Investigation Branch is now investigating the incident.</p>
