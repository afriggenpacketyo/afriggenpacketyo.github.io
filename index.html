          <p>Republicans in Congress are considering legislation that could cut billions from the Affordable Care Act (ACA), potentially affecting millions of Americans. A KFF poll reveals that 45% of adults enrolled in ACA marketplace plans identify as Republicans, with a significant portion identifying as "MAGA" Republicans. The proposed cuts could lead to 15 million people losing health insurance if tax credits are not extended. This situation arises as many self-employed individuals and those in states that did not expand Medicaid rely on ACA plans for coverage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million lawsuit against Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and Lively's publicist, Leslie Sloane. Baldoni alleged civil extortion and defamation after Lively accused him of sexual harassment and retaliation, accusations he denies. A similar lawsuit against The New York Times, which initially reported Lively's complaint, was also dismissed. Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a complete victory, while The New York Times expressed gratitude for the court's protection of honest reporting. Baldoni can amend claims related to Lively allegedly breaching her contract by June 23.</p>

          <p>Israel deported activist Greta Thunberg after its military seized a Gaza-bound ship carrying aid and activists. Thunberg was among 12 passengers on the Madleen, aiming to protest Israel's war in Gaza and highlight the humanitarian crisis. Israeli naval forces seized the boat in international waters, a move condemned by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition and rights groups. Three activists, including Thunberg, were deported, while eight others were detained, prompting legal challenges and international criticism. Israel maintains its actions align with international law, viewing the ship as a publicity stunt, but critics argue the blockade inflicts collective punishment on Gaza's population.</p>

Bull, a former NHS doctor and Brexit Party MEP, emphasized his commitment to the party's volunteers.

          <p>Asian needle ants, an invasive species with a potentially deadly sting, continue to spread across the U.S., particularly in the Southeast. These ants, first detected in the U.S. almost a century ago, are now found from Washington state to Florida and are increasingly noticed in Texas. Their sting can cause anaphylactic shock, posing a significant risk to those with allergies to bee and ant stings. These ants outcompete native ant species, disrupting seed dispersal and potentially causing long-term negative effects on forest ecosystems, making them a serious ecological threat.</p>

          <h2>Keir Starmer Denies Bowing to Political Pressure on Winter Fuel Payments</h2>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer denied that his government's reversal on winter fuel payments was due to political pressure, claiming it was possible because of an improved economy. The government had initially withdrawn the payments from most pensioners but expanded eligibility following criticism. Starmer stated that difficult decisions were necessary to fix the UK's finances, and better-than-expected growth allowed for the change. However, critics argue that the move creates new complexity and that any savings would be offset by administrative costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A veteran Greek hiker died after falling into a ravine in northern Greece following an encounter with a bear. The hiker was with another experienced hiker when the incident occurred in Fraktou forest. The other hiker reported that a bear attacked him and his dog, then knocked his friend into the ravine. Wildlife experts suggest the bear was likely defending itself, as brown bears are protected under Greek law.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing anti-diversity and anti-transgender executive orders in grant funding requirements. The ruling prevents the government from forcing recipients to halt programs that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) or acknowledge the existence of transgender people in order to receive grant funding. The judge stated that the executive branch cannot weaponize congressionally appropriated funds to suppress ideas it dislikes. The plaintiffs include health centers, LGBTQ+ services groups, and the Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Historical Society.</p>
