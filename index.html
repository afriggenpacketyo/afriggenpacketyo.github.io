            <p>Seven Florida residents have been arrested in connection with a global child sexual abuse material (CSAM) crime ring investigation led by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The investigation revealed that the men allegedly purchased the material through ads on TikTok, with the ringleader believed to be in Turkey. An undercover agent purchased 6.7 terabytes of child pornography, comprising roughly 1.2 million videos and pictures. Authorities are working to extradite the alleged ringleader from Turkey and are urging social media companies to combat the spread of CSAM on their platforms.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariffs are negatively impacting Southeast Asian economies, particularly those heavily reliant on exports to the United States. Countries like Vietnam and Cambodia face some of the highest tariffs, posing challenges to their economic growth. Vietnam, which depends on US exports for 23% of its GDP, is attempting to negotiate with the US to mitigate the impact. Peter Navarro, President Trump's senior counsellor on trade, has expressed skepticism about Vietnam's offer of zero tariffs, citing trade imbalances and concerns about trans-shipped Chinese products.</p>

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cited increased uncertainties and new headwinds for global growth and inflation due to the tariffs. HSBC predicted that the tariffs will directly reduce India's full-year growth for the financial year ending March 2026 by 0.5 percentage points. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's new round of steep tariffs has taken effect on imports from numerous countries, with rates exceeding a base of 10% imposed earlier. Imports from 86 countries now face higher tariffs ranging from 11% to 84%, with China facing a net total tariff of 104% on its exports to the US. China's Commerce Ministry has condemned the tariffs, stating that China will "fight to the end." Lesotho and Cambodia are also subject to significant tariff rates, at 50% and 49% respectively.</p>

            <p>President Trump's sweeping set of tariffs, initiated on April 2, have sent shockwaves through global markets. A baseline tariff of 10% on almost all foreign imports to the US kicked in on April 5, with some countries and goods exempt. Specific reciprocal tariffs have come into effect on April 9 for roughly 60 of the "worst offenders", with the European Union facing a 20% tariff. China once again faces large tariffs, with the total tariff on Chinese goods imported into the US now at 104%.</p>

            <p>Nascent hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal are fading fast, with analysts now talking not just of a war over trade, but one that could spread beyond technology to investment and geopolitics. Tariffs on Chinese exports to the U.S. have soared above 100%, and stocks have plunged around the world over worries about the economic fallout. China has chosen to hit back on the U.S.' 34% tariff increase with reciprocal duties across the board, instead of levies targeting specific U.S. products. The White House has confirmed that 104% tariffs on China were set to be effective from Wednesday.</p>

            <p>President Trump's latest round of sweeping tariffs, affecting more than $2 trillion worth of imports, is causing uncertainty among US businesses. Key consumer goods could see huge price rises, and analysts are warning of near-certain global economic damage. The White House has floated the possibility of trade talks, but Trump has signaled resistance to exemptions. The US already appears set on a collision course with China, which has shown little willingness to back down, describing Trump's moves as "bullying". Shares in the US resumed their downward slide on Tuesday, giving up early gains spurred by Trump comments about trade talks.</p>

Using Origin Wukong, China’s third-generation superconducting quantum computer with 72 qubits, a team in Hefei achieved an 8.4 per cent improvement in training performance while reducing the number of parameters by 76 per cent. The improved AI model also delivered better results on specific tasks, such as mental health conversation data and maths problem-solving tests. Quantum computing brings unique advantages by leveraging quantum principles such as superposition and entanglement, making AI training much faster and more efficient.</p>

            <p>The tiny country of Liechtenstein is facing a significant trade challenge as it is subjected to 37% tariffs by President Trump, nearly double the rate applied to its European neighbors. The tariffs target Liechtenstein's premium products, including power tools, cables, connectors, and high-quality fillings and false teeth. The country is being punished for making things Americans want to buy, and its ability to defend itself is limited. Liechtensteiners express confusion and frustration, viewing the tariffs as irrational and a bigger crisis than the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

The MMR vaccine is safe and highly effective, with two doses providing 97% protection. Lower vaccination rates are contributing to the outbreak, and experts emphasize the importance of getting vaccinated to prevent the spread of measles.</p>

This includes expanding the trade dispute to include the services sector, where China runs a substantial deficit with the US. Measures may include placing restrictions on purchases of services from US firms, increasing tariffs on US soybeans, banning imports of US poultry and Hollywood films, suspending cooperation on controlling the illegal drug fentanyl, and investigating US companies in China over intellectual property-related issues.</p>
