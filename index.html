          <p>The family of Alejandro Carranza, a Colombian fisherman killed in a U.S. military strike in the Caribbean, is disputing claims that he was a drug trafficker. His wife insists he was a "good man" devoted to fishing, questioning why he wasn't detained instead of killed. The incident has escalated into a diplomatic row between the U.S. and Colombia, with President Gustavo Petro labeling the strike an "assassination" and a violation of sovereignty. This event is part of a broader U.S. strategy against drug cartels, which has been criticized for a lack of evidence and for constituting extrajudicial executions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fourth survivor has resigned from the UK's national grooming gangs inquiry panel, citing concerns that the investigation is being diluted and their voices are being silenced. The resignations stem from fears that the inquiry's scope is being broadened to general child sexual abuse, rather than focusing specifically on grooming gangs as intended. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has insisted the inquiry's remit will not be "watered down" and will examine offender ethnicity. However, departing survivors have expressed a lack of trust in potential chairs with backgrounds in policing and social work, institutions they feel failed them.</p>

          <p>British bank Barclays has raised its full-year financial guidance and announced a surprise £500 million share buyback, causing its stock to trade nearly 5% higher. The bank now anticipates a Return on Tangible Equity (RoTE) of over 11% for the year, signaling confidence despite a 7% decline in third-quarter pre-tax profit compared to the previous year. This performance was slightly below analyst expectations, partly due to a £235 million charge related to the UK's car loans scandal. The positive outlook is supported by an 8% year-on-year income increase in its investment banking division. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv to discuss the ongoing ceasefire with Hamas and the future of Gaza. Both leaders emphasized their partnership, with Netanyahu dismissing suggestions of control by either nation as "hogwash." Vance expressed optimism that the fragile truce will hold but stressed the difficult task ahead, which involves disarming Hamas while rebuilding Gaza. The meeting occurs as both sides have accused the other of ceasefire violations, and the U.S. continues to push for the return of deceased hostages held by Hamas.</p>

          <p>The European Parliament has awarded its prestigious Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to two imprisoned journalists, Andrzej Poczobut of Belarus and Mzia Amaglobeli of Georgia. European Parliament President Roberta Metsola praised their courage as symbols in the struggle for freedom and democracy. Poczobut, a correspondent for a Polish newspaper, was sentenced to eight years for his critical reporting on protests against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Amaglobeli was jailed for two years in what is seen as a response to her investigations into public spending and abuse of office in Georgia, a nation critics say is moving toward authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>The grandchildren of Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be executed in Britain, are formally requesting a posthumous pardon, arguing she was a victim of domestic abuse. Ellis was hanged in 1955 for murdering her lover, David Blakely, after a tumultuous relationship in which he physically abused her, leading to a miscarriage. Her family's legal team contends that in a modern court, she would have been able to plead a defense of diminished responsibility or loss of control, factors not legally recognized at the time. The application to the justice secretary aims to correct what they see as a historic injustice for Ellis and other abuse victims failed by the legal system.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic multi-vehicle crash in western Uganda has resulted in the deaths of at least 46 people, marking one of the country's deadliest road accidents in recent years. The incident occurred when two buses, attempting to overtake other vehicles, collided head-on, leading to a chain reaction involving two other vehicles. Police have urged motorists to exercise caution, citing dangerous overtaking as a leading cause of crashes in the nation. This tragedy highlights a worrying trend of rising road fatalities in Uganda, which critics attribute to reckless driving, poor infrastructure, and a lack of traffic rule enforcement.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a series of intense drone and missile strikes across Ukraine, killing at least seven people, including two children, and injuring 26 others. The attacks, which damaged a kindergarten in Kharkiv and residential buildings in Kyiv, targeted energy infrastructure and caused widespread power outages. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated the bombardment proves Moscow does not feel enough pressure to end the war. The assault occurred shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that his planned summit with Vladimir Putin was being put on hold, a development Zelensky linked to Russia's diminished interest in diplomacy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research suggests that having a high-quality best friendship is a significant predictor of individual well-being, often more so than the total number of friends one has. Best friends are characterized by deeper levels of trust, support, and intimacy, providing a crucial defense against emotional loneliness. While the concept of ranking friends may seem calculating, psychologists note that humans naturally categorize social connections to manage limited emotional energy, investing more in a small inner circle. This prioritization helps maintain strong, reliable bonds that can function like kin, offering stability and support through life's transitions, which ultimately enhances happiness and resilience.</p>

Police officials described the violence as "thuggery" incited by groups on social media and distinguished the violent actors from peaceful protesters who also attended.

This information enabled a coordinated effort between Mexican officials, Phoenix police, and the U.S. Marshal Service to capture the suspect. Arredondo has since been returned to the U.S. to face a second-degree murder charge and has reportedly confessed to the killing, bringing a long-awaited break in the case for the victim's family.</p>

          <p>Scientists have officially identified a nearly perfect skeleton discovered in 2001 on the UK's Jurassic Coast as a new species of ichthyosaur, naming it Xiphodracon goldencapensis, or the "Sword Dragon of Dorset." The marine reptile, which lived around 190 million years ago, measured approximately 10 feet long and is distinguished by its long, sword-like snout. The fossil is considered the world's most complete prehistoric reptile from the Pliensbachian period and fills a significant gap in the evolutionary record of ichthyosaurs. This discovery helps researchers better understand a complex faunal turnover and extinction timeline during that era.</p>

This trend, an evolution of the long-form video essay popular on YouTube, is adapted for TikTok's fast-paced, algorithm-driven format, which often rewards confident, reductive takes over nuanced discussion. While professional critics face job insecurity, these content creators use academic language and visual aids to project authority on topics from pop culture to social issues. This behavior suggests a generation trying to educate itself in an era of inaccessible higher education and distrust in traditional media.</p>

          <p>New research provides compelling evidence that intensive cognitive training can increase levels of acetylcholine, a key brain chemical associated with attention and memory that typically declines with age. In a 10-week study of adults aged 65 and older, participants who engaged in challenging daily brain exercises from the BrainHQ program saw a 2.3% increase in acetylcholine levels. This rise effectively turned back the clock on age-related decline in that brain region by about a decade. The findings suggest that targeted mental workouts, unlike more passive games like solitaire, can induce significant neurochemical changes that support cognitive performance in older adults.</p>

Despite this, prices for items like petrol and airfares saw upward pressure, and the overall inflation rate remains significantly above the Bank of England's 2% target.

During a recent workshop in Shanghai attended by over 20 countries, a senior Chinese diplomat stated that AI should benefit all of humanity, not just be a "game for the wealthy and affluent," in a veiled criticism of the United States. A foreign ministry spokesman added that the event demonstrates China's credibility and commitment to promoting inclusive AI development. This positioning comes as most Americans, according to the article, view U.S. leadership in the field as crucial for global stability and technological advancement.</p>

          <p>Methane (CH4) is a powerful greenhouse gas responsible for about 20-30% of global warming since the Industrial Revolution, trapping roughly 84 times more heat than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. While it degrades in the atmosphere in about 12 years, its short-term impact is significant. Approximately 60% of methane emissions come from human activities, primarily agriculture, landfills, and the energy sector, where it leaks during the production and transport of oil and gas. Experts state that simple measures, such as detecting and fixing leaks in fossil fuel infrastructure, could slash energy-sector methane emissions by 75%, representing a critical opportunity for rapid climate action.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government shutdown has reached its 22nd day, with many federal employees set to miss their first full paycheck and no resolution in sight between Republicans and Democrats. The shutdown stems from a partisan dispute over extending subsidies for the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. The impacts are being felt nationwide, with funding for programs like WIC and SNAP at risk, National Parks operating with limited services, and potential disruptions to air travel due to staffing shortages. While essential services like Social Security have seen temporary fixes, the prolonged closure is causing significant uncertainty and hardship.</p>

          <p>Hospital trusts in Shropshire and Leeds have been dropped from a national rapid review of maternity failings across England, a decision that has shocked some families. The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust (SaTH) was removed due to an ongoing police investigation into its maternity services, where catastrophic failures may have led to hundreds of deaths. The Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust was removed after a separate, dedicated inquiry into its services was announced following a BBC investigation. Critics are concerned that excluding these trusts means the national review cannot learn from two of the most significant cases of maternity care failures.</p>

          <p>The New York City mayoral race between 34-year-old Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani and 67-year-old independent Andrew Cuomo is showcasing a significant generational and ideological battle within the Democratic party. Cuomo, a former governor with a long political resume, is running on experience, while Mamdani has built a commanding lead by appealing to younger voters with ambitious progressive ideas and a message of integrity. Mamdani's success reflects a broader trend of disillusionment with the party establishment among younger Democrats, who are drawn to his energetic social media presence and policies like freezing rents, contrasting sharply with Cuomo's more traditional campaign style.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows President Trump's Frequent Use of 'Common Sense' as a Populist Political Tool</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump frequently employs the phrase "common sense" as a powerful rhetorical tool to frame his policies as inherently correct and to dismiss opposition as nonsensical or elitist. This strategy has deep roots in American political history, dating back to Thomas Paine, and appeals to a populist sentiment that values lived experience over academic or expert knowledge. According to political analysts, Trump uses the term more than most politicians to justify his positions, create a dichotomy between ordinary people and the establishment, and excuse norm-breaking behavior. This approach resonates strongly with his base, reinforcing a narrative of a simpler past and casting political opponents as ideological and out of touch.</p>

          <p>Paul Ingrassia has withdrawn his nomination by President Donald Trump to lead the Office of Special Counsel after allegedly sending a series of offensive text messages. Ingrassia, 30, stated he was withdrawing due to a lack of sufficient Republican votes for his confirmation. The decision followed a report that revealed messages in which he allegedly described having a "Nazi streak" and denounced holidays celebrating Black Americans, such as Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Top Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, had indicated he would not be confirmed, marking a rare instance of the party breaking with a Trump nominee.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury has awarded golf legend Jack Nicklaus a $50 million verdict in his defamation lawsuit against his former business partners at Nicklaus Companies. The 85-year-old claimed the company and its executives damaged his reputation by spreading false stories that he was considering a deal with the Saudi-backed LIV Golf league and was suffering from dementia. While the jury found the company liable for damaging Nicklaus's reputation, its owner and another executive were not found personally liable. This verdict follows a separate case where a New York judge dismissed a lawsuit from the company that had attempted to stop Nicklaus from using his own name.</p>

The Spanish football federation reversed its decision after players protested the move, which they felt was made without proper consultation. La Liga president Javier Tebas called the cancellation a lost opportunity for Spanish football to expand its global reach and strengthen its future. Critics, including players, argued that playing a league game abroad would compromise the integrity of the competition and raised logistical concerns that were never addressed by the league.</p>

Casparij credits the open and accepting environment of women's football with helping her understand and embrace her identity.

Cavenagh clarified that the club pursued five candidates simultaneously and did not rank them, pushing back against the perception that Rohl was a third choice.
