          <p>This New York Times podcast episode discusses several key headlines, including President Trump's flurry of pardons for over two dozen individuals, including political allies, as reported by Zolan Kanno-Youngs and Luke Broadwater. It also covers the federal judicial panel's ruling that Trump's tariffs were illegal, as detailed by Tony Romm and Ana Swanson. The podcast further addresses Edward Wong's report on the U.S.'s plan to aggressively revoke visas of Chinese students and Tyler Pager, Maggie Haberman, Theodore Schleifer, Jonathan Swan, and Ryan Mac's piece on Elon Musk's disillusionment and departure from Washington. The episode also features a segment on the increasing security measures for French crypto chiefs following a series of violent kidnappings, covered by Aurelien Breeden, Catherine Porter, and Liz Alderman.

          <p>A new report reveals a significant increase in complaints regarding substandard living conditions in social housing in England, with numbers more than five times higher than five years ago. Housing Ombudsman Richard Blakeway warns of a growing imbalance of power between tenants and landlords, leading to frustration and potential social unrest due to poor conditions like asbestos, leaks, and mold. While social landlords are investing record amounts in repairs, historic underfunding and communication issues persist, contributing to a breakdown in trust. The ombudsman calls for a transformative overhaul, including an independent funding review and a national tenant body to amplify tenant voices and ensure landlord accountability, emphasizing the human cost of inadequate housing. </p>

          <p>Nvidia shares experienced a significant jump in premarket trading following strong earnings reports, which sparked a global rally in semiconductor stocks. Despite a $4.5 billion write-off due to U.S. export restrictions to China, Nvidia's financial results exceeded market expectations, alleviating concerns about dwindling demand for its GPUs. The surge in Nvidia's stock also boosted shares of other U.S. companies like Marvell and Qualcomm. The semiconductor industry has been grappling with headwinds from tariff policies and export limitations, but Nvidia's performance suggests continued strong demand for AI-related technologies. </p>

          <p>The Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) is holding events in Poland and Hungary, aiming to promote a transatlantic political culture shaped by President Trump's right-wing populism.

In Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban is positioning himself as a key figure in exporting MAGA tactics. These events occur amidst growing transatlantic tensions due to Trump's planned tariffs on EU goods, potentially straining the relationship between the MAGA movement and its European allies. </p>

          <p>Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren, are calling for an investigation into potential ethics violations by employees of Elon Musk's "department of government efficiency" (Doge). The senators allege that Doge employees at the Treasury, IRS, and CFPB hold significant stock in companies that stand to directly benefit from their efforts to dismantle these agencies. Concerns have been raised regarding conflicts of interest, with examples cited such as Tom Krause, the Doge team leader at Treasury, holding stock in major financial institutions and tech giants. The senators argue that these cases suggest a widespread issue within Doge, where ethics rules are disregarded for personal financial gain. </p>

          <p>Scientists are expressing concern that proposed budget cuts to NASA under the Trump administration could significantly impede the exploration of fundamental questions about the universe, such as the potential for life on Mars and Venus. The proposed 24% reduction in NASA's budget, with over 53% slashed from space and Earth science missions, threatens to halt ongoing projects and prevent new discoveries. Key missions like the Mars sample return and Venus exploration projects are at risk, along with the Nancy Grace Roman space telescope, which could discover thousands of new planets. Experts also fear a brain drain from NASA and the United States falling behind other nations in space exploration. </p>

          <p>President Trump's preference for praising and excusing President Putin has not led to progress toward peace in Ukraine, despite his claims he could end the war quickly. After weeks of claiming he could leverage his relationship with the Russian leader, Putin's continued aggression has prompted Trump to question whether he has been strung along. Trump has hinted at new sanctions but has yet to take action, facing growing pressure to adopt a harder line. Foreign policy experts and members of Congress increasingly believe Trump is being duped, with some calling for penalties on Russia. </p>

          <p>A House Republican budget bill proposes expanding the qualified business income (QBI) deduction, a tax break for "pass-through" businesses like partnerships, S-corporations, and sole proprietorships. Currently, certain white-collar professionals cannot claim the QBI deduction once income exceeds certain limits. The House bill would change the phaseout calculation, potentially providing a bigger tax break for some of these professionals.

The strategy involves buying stocks after Trump announces tariffs and selling them when he inevitably reverses course. The article highlights several instances where Trump's tariff threats caused market downturns, followed by rallies when he backed down. The author argues that Trump's habit of acting through bluster has permeated his policymaking, and investors have learned to anticipate his reversals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the World Meteorological Organization warns that the planet is poised to get even hotter, with a high likelihood of surpassing the 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit warming target set by the Paris Agreement within the next five years. This projection means the world can expect more frequent and severe natural disasters, including droughts, heat waves, and intense wildfires, particularly in the western U.S. The report highlights the need for drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the worst consequences of climate change. The U.S. faces these challenges with reduced forecasting abilities due to staffing cuts at NOAA and a shift away from climate mitigation efforts. </p>

          <p>This article recounts the story of Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee, childhood friends from Palos Verdes who became spies for the Soviet Union in the 1970s. Boyce, working at TRW Defense and Space Systems, gained access to sensitive CIA communications and, disillusioned with the U.S. government, decided to sell secrets to the Soviets with the help of Lee. Their operation lasted over a year, during which thousands of classified documents were passed to the Soviets in exchange for money. Eventually, Lee's arrest led to their exposure and conviction, highlighting the intersection of the Cold War aerospace industry and anti-establishment sentiments in Southern California. </p>

          <p>A contributor argues that President Trump's appointee to lead the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Bill Pulte, is considering ending the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac without addressing core structural flaws. The author warns that this could expose taxpayers to significant financial risks and set the stage for a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. The author advocates for strengthening capital reserves, enhancing transparency and oversight, and removing government guarantees to prevent moral hazard. The author asserts that market discipline, fiscal responsibility, and genuine reform are needed to avoid another taxpayer-funded bailout. (not investment advice)</p>

Instead, Trump should increase pressure on Russia and Ukraine to reach a deal, leveraging potential sanctions and support for Ukraine.
