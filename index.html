          <p>U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson defended his characterization of recent anti-Trump protests as "hate America" rallies, clarifying that his criticism targeted the message, not the participants themselves. He asserted that the demonstrations featured hateful and violent rhetoric, which he distinguished from the broader Democratic Party, although he also claimed there is a rising Marxist influence within it. Johnson maintained his position that while he does not consider political opponents enemies, he found the content of the protests to be objectively hateful. The Speaker's comments continue to fuel debate over political discourse and the nature of dissent in the country.</p>

          <p>The Haskell Free Library and Opera House, a unique institution built straddling the U.S.-Canada border between Derby Line, Vermont, and Stanstead, Quebec, is facing new access rules. For over a century, it has allowed people from both nations to enter freely through its American-side main entrance. However, following a visit from the Secretary of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection has mandated that Canadians must now first report to a legal port of entry before using the main door. This change, attributed to security concerns, has saddened local communities who view the library as a symbol of unity and cooperation.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from actor Tim Curry's upcoming memoir, "Vagabond," reflects on his identity as a lifelong wanderer and performer, shaped by an itinerant upbringing and a career playing varied roles. He recounts a humorous yet telling incident where he was accused of being an imposter at a screening of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show," the film that launched him to fame. Curry explains that the book is not a traditional Hollywood tell-all but a mosaic of his life, exploring his creative journeys and his recovery from a debilitating stroke in 2012. He embraces the term 'vagabond' to describe his restless spirit and constant reinvention.</p>

          <p>Four years after the Taliban's return to power silenced women's sports in Afghanistan, a newly formed women's refugee football team is set to represent the country in a FIFA-sanctioned tournament in the UAE. Players, who now live in countries like the UK and Australia, view this as a significant responsibility to represent Afghan women whose rights have been stripped away. The team's participation marks a major step toward official recognition by FIFA, following tireless advocacy from exiled players. For many on the squad, it will be an emotional reunion and a powerful statement of resilience against the oppressive regime in their homeland.</p>

          <p>Pakistan and Afghanistan's Taliban government have agreed to an immediate ceasefire following more than a week of intense and deadly fighting along their shared border. The agreement, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, aims to establish mechanisms for lasting peace and stability in the region. The clashes, the most severe since the Taliban regained power in 2021, were fueled by Pakistan's accusations that the Taliban harbors militant groups. Under the new terms, the Taliban has reportedly agreed not to support groups that carry out attacks against Pakistan, with further talks scheduled to take place in Istanbul.</p>

          <p>Following the U.S.-brokered Gaza peace deal, the Middle East faces several potential futures, ranging from widespread prosperity to renewed conflict. One optimistic scenario envisions an economic renaissance, with Arab nations and Israel collaborating on trade and innovation under a "New Abraham Corridor." Conversely, a resurgent Iran could re-ignite its "Axis of Resistance," funding proxies like Hamas and destabilizing the region. Other possibilities include Hamas rebranding itself while quietly regrouping, or a stagnant "cold stability" where peace exists without meaningful progress. The article argues that sustained American leadership and regional cooperation are crucial to prevent a relapse into conflict. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jared Kushner, a key negotiator of the Israel-Hamas peace agreement, stated that the success of the 20-point plan hinges on establishing a "viable alternative" to govern Gaza. In a "60 Minutes" interview, Kushner acknowledged that Hamas will likely use violence to try and reassert control, a prediction underscored by recent clashes and a U.S. warning about potential Hamas attacks on Palestinian civilians. The peace plan calls for an interim governing body of Palestinians and international experts to run Gaza. Kushner emphasized that if this new governance structure is successful, Hamas will ultimately fail, ensuring long-term security for the region.</p>

The piece contrasts these lower court rulings with what it calls the Supreme Court's deference to the president.

The case against Bolton, a vocal critic of the former president, centers on proving he knowingly transferred classified material.

          <p>English golfer Tommy Fleetwood won his eighth European tour title with a two-shot victory at the DP World India Championship. Fleetwood carded a final round of 65 to finish at 22 under par, fulfilling a personal goal of having his young son, Frankie, run onto the 18th green to celebrate with him. He started the final round two shots behind the leader but a strong performance, including four consecutive birdies around the turn, secured his win. The victory continues a successful season for Fleetwood, which also included a key role in Europe's Ryder Cup victory over the United States.</p>

He affirmed that China is on track to meet its economic development target of around 5% for the current year. His optimistic forecast comes as the nation's leaders prepare for a crucial party plenum to set economic priorities amid ongoing rivalry with the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American consumers are feeling the financial impact of the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs, reporting higher prices on everyday goods from groceries to car tires. A recent study estimates that these tariffs will cost U.S. households nearly $2,400 more per year, with consumers absorbing the majority of increased costs. Many shoppers describe having to shrink their budgets, visit multiple stores to find deals, and forgo non-essential purchases. The financial pressure contradicts the administration's promises of affordable living, fueling apprehension about the future state of the economy as trade disputes, particularly with China, continue to escalate.

          <p>Georgia is experiencing an unprecedented surge in demand for electricity, largely driven by the rapid construction of datacenters for artificial intelligence. The state's primary utility, Georgia Power, is seeking approval for a nearly $16 billion plan to add 10 gigawatts of energy capacity, with about 80% of it designated for these new facilities. This has sparked concerns among consumer and environmental groups about rising utility rates for residential customers and an increased reliance on fossil fuels. Public hearings are scheduled to address the plan, which has become a focal point for debates on energy policy, corporate accountability, and the economic trade-offs of the AI boom.

          <p>A Chinese robotics company, MyActuator, has experienced a significant increase in orders from American clients rushing to purchase components before potential new U.S. tariffs take effect.

A company source noted that clients explicitly cited the tariff threat as the reason for their emergency purchases, forcing the manufacturer's factories to work overtime. The surge in demand highlights how businesses are preemptively navigating the volatile trade relationship between the U.S. and China. (not investment advice)</p>

David Sacks, President Trump's AI czar, has accused Anthropic of "fear-mongering" to promote a restrictive regulatory agenda that he believes hinders innovation and cedes ground to China. Anthropic, founded on the principle of AI safety, has advocated for stronger guardrails and opposed the administration's efforts to block state-level AI regulations.

          <p>As Medicare's open enrollment period continues, beneficiaries are advised to carefully evaluate their coverage options for the upcoming year rather than automatically renewing their current plans. Experts stress the importance of comparing traditional Medicare with private Medicare Advantage plans, weighing tradeoffs between provider networks, out-of-pocket costs, and supplemental benefits like dental or vision. It is also crucial to verify that all necessary prescription drugs are covered under new Part D plans, as formularies can change annually. The ongoing federal government shutdown may cause delays in accessing information, so beneficiaries are encouraged to be patient but thorough in their research.</p>

While she has not criticized President Trump directly, her independent streak has fueled speculation about her motives and future ambitions.
