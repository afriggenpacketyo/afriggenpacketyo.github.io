          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts' rebuke of President Trump's attack on a federal judge is analyzed. While the Chief Justice correctly points out the inappropriateness of using impeachment to challenge judicial decisions, the analysis highlights the omission of addressing the underlying issue of the Trump administration potentially defying court orders.  The author argues that Roberts' focus on personal attacks rather than systemic attacks on the judiciary is a recurring pattern.</p>

          <p>Retail investors are abandoning their "buy-the-dip" strategy during a recent market correction, with significant outflows from US equities. This shift is attributed to increased market volatility stemming from President Trump's policies and growing economic concerns.
