          <h2>South Korean Women Feel Invisible Despite Role in Ousting President</h2>

          <p>South Korean women, who played a crucial role in protests leading to the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol, express feeling overlooked as the country prepares to elect a new president. Despite their significant involvement in anti-Yoon rallies, the main candidates remain largely silent on gender equality issues, with one candidate gaining popularity among young men for his anti-feminist stance. Many women feel their voices are being erased, particularly after Yoon's term saw the disappearance of government departments focused on women's rights and a rise in anti-feminist sentiment among young men. The lack of female candidates and the limited focus on women's issues in the current election campaign further contribute to this sense of abandonment, leaving many women disillusioned about the future of gender equality in South Korea. The political climate is such that the voices of women who led the protests against Yoon and celebrated his impeachment say they feel overlooked in this election campaign. The overall impact has been polarising.</p>

          <p>AVZ Minerals, based in Perth, has put its arbitration case against the Democratic Republic of Congo on hold to facilitate discussions encouraged by the US government regarding the Manono lithium project. The US is supporting KoBold Metals, funded by tech billionaires, in its bid to acquire AVZ's stake in the project, with a pledge of US$1 billion for development. This move is aimed at countering China's Zijin Mining, which currently controls the northern section of the project after Congo revoked AVZ's rights in 2023. Washington's increasing efforts to secure critical minerals in Congo reflect a direct challenge to China's dominance in the region, as lithium and copper are vital for the global green energy transition.</p>

Musk expressed disappointment at the decision, while Lt Gen Steven Kwast is being considered as a potential replacement. The space agency released new details of the Trump administrationâ€™s 2026 budget plan that proposed killing dozens of space science programs and laying off thousands of employees, a controversial overhaul that space advocates and lawmakers described as devastating for the agency.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that tough choices are unavoidable as the UK government finalizes its spending plans for key sectors, including the NHS, defense, and education. Increased spending on health could lead to cuts in "unprotected" areas, while government commitments to reduce borrowing and not raise taxes limit options. The IFS highlights that the government has "front-loaded" its spending, meaning that additional funding will slow down. Concerns arise over funding for initiatives like increasing police numbers to combat violence against women, as well as the potential for spending cuts to be made.</p>

Business travel is a significant revenue source for the U.S. economy, generating billions in spending and supporting millions of jobs.
