          <p>Over 260 firefighters are combating a major wildfire near Athens that has resulted in one fatality and the destruction of several homes and farmlands. The blaze, fueled by winds up to 80 km/h, prompted evacuations in the Keratea area. The severe weather also contributed to the deaths of two tourists on the island of Milos. This event highlights the heightened wildfire risk across the Mediterranean, including neighboring Turkey, with scientists attributing the increased intensity of fires to climate change and calling for better cross-border collaboration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid catastrophic hunger in conflict zones like Gaza and Sudan, health experts are highlighting the dangers of "refeeding syndrome." This potentially fatal condition can occur when severely malnourished individuals resume normal eating too quickly, causing a rapid shift in electrolytes that can lead to organ failure. Aid organizations use specially formulated, low-nutrient therapeutic foods (RUTFs) to slowly stabilize patients and prevent this outcome. Experts stress that safe access for aid agencies is crucial to manage the crisis and prevent widespread death, urging international pressure on governments to allow humanitarian work.</p>

          <p>Samuel Kangethe, a Kenyan immigrant who has lived in Michigan for over 16 years, has chosen to self-deport, leaving his American wife and children. Despite having a master's degree and a stable job, his unresolved immigration case from a previous marriage makes him deportable under the Trump administration's stricter enforcement policies. Fearing detention, he opted to leave on his own terms rather than use a government app offering an exit payment. His decision has devastated his family and community, who see it as the loss of a valuable member of society due to rigid policies.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece analyzes recent statements by Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has begun publicly criticizing her own party's direction. Greene has lamented the treatment of female colleagues, become the first Republican lawmaker to label the situation in Gaza a genocide, and denounced Fox News as "propaganda." The author suggests her motivations may not stem from genuine empathy or progressive alignment but rather from internal political maneuvering and personal ideology. The article posits that this infighting, rather than Democratic opposition, could be what ultimately fractures the MAGA movement from within.</p>

According to an internal email, this move would remove the only vaccine available for all children in this age group, creating a potential gap in protection. Moderna is reportedly in discussions with the CDC to increase its supply to fill this void, though its pediatric shot is currently only approved for children with underlying health conditions. Public health experts express concern over the timing and potential impact on vaccination availability for young children.</p>

          <p>Etiquette expert Elaine Swann provides advice on how to be a good houseguest, emphasizing respect for the host's space regardless of familiarity. Key recommendations include giving ample notice, being prepared for a "no," and keeping visits to a manageable length, typically around four days. Swann advises guests to be self-sufficient, communicate plans clearly, and be mindful of their footprint by staying tidy. A thoughtful thank-you gift and a follow-up invitation are also suggested to ensure a positive experience and a future welcome.</p>

          <p>The implementation of new U.S. tariffs, reaching an average rate of 18.6%, is expected to have widespread economic effects. While U.S. companies have absorbed most initial costs, higher consumer prices are considered inevitable, with one estimate suggesting an average household cost of $2,400 this year. The tariffs are also projected to increase inflation, slow job growth, and potentially weaken the labor market as businesses become more cautious. Despite these concerns and an expected economic slowdown, most forecasters do not anticipate a full recession, though the impacts will be felt across businesses and households.

          <p>The term "grifter" has become a ubiquitous insult in modern political discourse, used to accuse opponents of being con artists profiting from their beliefs. The article traces the word's increased usage, noting its application to figures from Nigel Farage to the Sussexes, and its debut in the UK Parliament. This trend is linked to the rise of influencer culture, where sowing insecurity for profit is a common business model, and a broader societal paranoia fueled by scam warnings and true-crime stories about fraud. The insult reflects a deep-seated suspicion of opponents' motives, assuming they are driven by nefarious personal gain.</p>

          <p>A DeKalb County police officer was killed during a shooting incident near the CDC headquarters and Emory University in Atlanta. The officer, David Rose, was fatally shot after responding to reports of an active shooter. The suspect was later found dead from what may have been a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The incident prompted a lockdown at the CDC and a shelter-in-place order at the university, though no civilians were shot. Officer Rose was remembered for his courage and dedication, leaving behind a pregnant wife and two children.</p>

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bomb attack, Nagasaki Mayor Shiro Suzuki made an impassioned appeal for an end to global conflicts. During a solemn ceremony, he warned that the world's current trajectory of confrontation could lead to nuclear war. The 1945 bombing killed an estimated 74,000 people and caused long-term suffering from radiation effects for survivors. The commemoration included a moment of silence and the symbolic offering of water to honor the victims, reinforcing the city's enduring message of peace and nuclear disarmament.</p>

          <p>A fast-moving wildfire, named the Canyon Fire, has forced evacuation orders for thousands of residents in Southern California, near the border of Ventura and Los Angeles counties. Igniting on Thursday, the blaze quickly grew to nearly 5,400 acres, fueled by extreme heat and dry conditions, and injured one firefighter whose truck rolled down a hillside. While favorable weather later allowed firefighters to gain 28% containment and reduce evacuation orders to warnings, the fire remains active. With temperatures forecast to remain high, authorities are urging residents to stay vigilant.</p>

          <p>In a highly anticipated matchup between two of their generation's greatest pitchers, Clayton Kershaw led the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 5-1 victory over Max Scherzer and the Toronto Blue Jays. Both veteran aces delivered strong six-inning performances, with Kershaw allowing only one run to Scherzer's two. The pivotal moment came when Mookie Betts hit a go-ahead, two-run homer off Scherzer in the fifth inning. The game was a nostalgic showcase for the two pitchers, who first competed against each other in 2008 and continue to perform at a high level for first-place teams.</p>

          <p>One year after a catastrophic landfill collapse in Kiteezi, Uganda, killed 34 people and left over 220 homeless, victims are still awaiting compensation and living in fear. The disaster highlighted the country's urgent waste management crisis, as Kampala produces 2,000 tonnes of trash daily. The city has since closed the Kiteezi site and acquired new land for a landfill, but this move is mired in controversy over whether the new site is on a protected forest reserve. While plans for modern recycling and composting facilities exist, they lack funding, leaving Uganda's waste problem unresolved.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The EU's recent sanctioning of an Indian refinery for processing Russian crude has raised questions about the future of a long-delayed EU-India free trade agreement. However, experts suggest that the threat of much larger U.S. tariffs on Indian goods poses a greater challenge and may paradoxically strengthen India's resolve to finalize a deal with the EU. As India seeks reliable economic partners, the EU's more measured approach becomes more attractive. This dynamic could benefit the EU-India relationship while potentially pressuring India to reduce its reliance on Russian oil. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has reformed its competitive civil service summer internship program to restrict applications to candidates from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The move is intended to make the civil service more representative of society, but it has drawn mixed reactions from students. Some, like a student from Newark, feel the change gives them a fair chance and will now apply. Others, like a student from King's Lynn whose parents are a nurse and a town planner, feel unfairly excluded despite considering themselves working class, arguing the criteria are too rigid and discouraging.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully created high-purity hexagonal diamonds, a rare structure first discovered in a meteorite in 1967. This type of diamond, also known as lonsdaleite, is believed to form under intense heat and pressure and has a distinct atomic arrangement compared to common cubic diamonds. Previous attempts by global research teams to synthesize the material often resulted in mixed-phase samples. The Chinese team's breakthrough, published in the journal Nature, produced pure hexagonal diamond crystals up to 100 micrometers in size, providing definitive proof of the material's macroscopic existence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's consumer price index (CPI) was unchanged in July compared to the previous year, while the producer price index (PPI) continued to show deflation. This data suggests that domestic demand in the world's second-largest economy remains weak amidst ongoing trade turbulence. The flat CPI reading was slightly better than market expectations of a minor decline. While service prices saw a modest increase of 0.5%, food prices fell by 1.6% and consumer goods prices declined by 0.4%, indicating persistent economic headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>
