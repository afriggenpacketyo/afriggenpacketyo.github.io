          <h2>ACA Premiums Projected to Soar by 114% if Enhanced Subsidies Lapse</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-30 18:25:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A KFF analysis reveals that health plan premiums on the Affordable Care Act marketplace are expected to more than double, increasing by 114% in 2026, if enhanced federal subsidies expire as scheduled at the end of 2025. These subsidies currently make health insurance significantly more affordable for 22 million ACA enrollees, saving them an average of $705 annually. The potential expiration is a key point of contention in ongoing government funding negotiations, with Democrats advocating for their extension and Republicans pushing for later discussions. This looming increase, combined with other factors like changes in tax credit calculations and insurers' proposed rate hikes, could severely impact millions of Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The impending government shutdown is largely driven by a partisan dispute concerning the Affordable Care Act's enhanced premium tax credits. Democrats insist on extending these subsidies, which benefit millions of Americans, as part of any short-term funding resolution. Republicans, however, are framing the debate around whether these benefits should extend to "lawfully present" immigrants, accusing Democrats of wanting to fund healthcare for "illegal aliens." Democrats refute this, stating federal law prohibits coverage for undocumented individuals and they only seek to restore options for legally present immigrants that were removed by a previous tax bill. This contentious issue highlights deep divisions in Congress over healthcare policy and immigration.</p>

          <p>The UN Security Council has voted to authorize a significantly larger multinational force to address Haiti's escalating gang violence. The resolution, co-sponsored by the United States and Panama, will transform the existing Kenya-led Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission into a "Gang Suppression Force" (GSF) of up to 5,500 uniformed personnel, including police and soldiers. This move was welcomed by Haiti's transitional presidential council, seeing it as a crucial turning point against criminal groups that are paralyzing the economy and terrorizing the population through murder, pillaging, and sexual assault. The international community aims to share the burden and offer hope to a nation in crisis.</p>

          <p>Actress Nicole Kidman has filed for divorce from her husband, country musician Keith Urban, after nearly 20 years of marriage, citing "irreconcilable differences" in court documents filed in Nashville. The couple has reportedly reached a co-parenting arrangement for their two teenage daughters, designating Kidman as the primary residential parent. Both Kidman and Urban are required to attend a parent education class within 60 days as part of their agreement. This news marks the end of a long-standing Hollywood marriage, with both stars having previously spoken fondly of their supportive relationship.</p>

          <p>The federal government is on the brink of a midnight shutdown as President Trump and congressional leaders remain deadlocked over funding. Democrats are refusing to pass a short-term agreement without addressing Medicaid cuts and extending healthcare tax credits, while Republicans accuse them of playing politics. A shutdown could see up to 4 million federal employees, including military personnel, working without pay or furloughed, causing widespread financial strain. Essential services like airport security would continue, but national parks might close, and economic activity could suffer significantly, echoing the record-long 2018 shutdown.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that his administration has reached a $500 million deal with Harvard University to settle a protracted dispute over federal funding. The agreement follows months of accusations from Trump regarding the university's alleged failure to address antisemitism on campus, which had resulted in billions in frozen federal grants. A federal judge had previously ruled against the administration, stating it unlawfully terminated $2.2 billion in grants and accusing it of an "ideologically motivated assault." As part of this settlement, Harvard is expected to establish trade schools focused on AI and other technical fields, although the full details of the agreement are not yet finalized.</p>

          <p>The global interest in deep-sea mining for valuable metals and rare earths is surging, with the US actively exploring this frontier, while China faces its own challenges. Despite the vast potential of ocean deposits like polymetallic nodules, commercial exploitation is currently stalled due to a critical lack of legal clarity and significant environmental concerns. The International Seabed Authority (ISA), a UN body, is responsible for developing a comprehensive mining code. However, the finalization of these essential legal, environmental, and operational regulations has been hampered by widespread environmental objections, preventing the full-scale development of this potentially lucrative industry.

Hegseth's email aggressively promotes a "warfighter ethos," criticizing "fat troops," diversity initiatives, and rules of engagement, while encouraging bullying and a "loose, improvisational feel to war." Trump's response, also an imagined email, veers into characteristic tangents about changing the "Gulf of Mexico" to "Gulf of America," his signature, and tariffs, while critiquing ship aesthetics and Biden's perceived clumsiness.

Internal emails to federal employees and a prominent banner on the Department of Housing and Urban Development's website explicitly state that "Radical Left" Democrats are responsible for the funding lapse. Ethics experts suggest this overtly partisan messaging departs from historical norms during shutdowns and could contravene the Hatch Act.

Backers argue that increased wages and benefits are crucial to protect non-union, often foreign-born, construction workers who are vulnerable to wage theft and exploitation within multi-layered contracting systems.

As part of its restructuring, Spirit plans to reject leases on 27 Airbus aircraft and 12 airport leases, along with cutting 40 routes and furloughing a third of its flight attendants. CEO Dave Davis expressed gratitude for stakeholder support, aiming to build a stronger Spirit and ensure future high-value travel options for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

The text included a link to a grain trader's criticism, suggesting Bessent was perceived as "stupid."

However, the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey (CCGNJ), the original owner, refused to renew NCPG's lease, demanding the number back. NCPG argued that reverting control would devastate access to help, citing CCGNJ's lack of resources.
