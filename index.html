          <p>Florida Rep. Kat Cammack reported that her offices were evacuated due to credible death threats against her and her family. The threats reportedly began after she shared a personal story with the Wall Street Journal about her experience with an ectopic pregnancy and the complexities surrounding Florida's abortion laws. Cammack clarified that she did not vote on the state law, as she serves in the U.S. House, and attributed the threats to misinformation from pro-abortion activists. The U.S. Capitol Police are actively investigating the situation in coordination with local and federal agencies.</p>

A new position, head of editorial content for American Vogue, will be created to manage the U.S. publication's daily operations.

Pompeo praised the Trump administration's execution of the military operation and its messaging, arguing that it significantly increased American deterrence against global adversaries. He also criticized what he described as isolationist tendencies in both political parties, emphasizing the importance of U.S. global leadership.</p>

          <p>Apple has announced significant changes to its App Store policies in Europe in response to the Digital Markets Act (DMA), aiming to avoid a potential â‚¬500 million fine. The new rules introduce a complex system of fees, including a "core technology commission" on digital purchases made outside the App Store, which critics argue violates the spirit of the regulation. Apple stated it disagrees with the European Commission's requirements and plans to appeal, but implemented the changes to ensure compliance. The Commission is currently assessing whether Apple's new terms are sufficient to avoid penalties.</p>

          <p>For savers considering where to deposit a significant sum like $10,000, the choice between a short-term CD and a high-yield savings account presents a nuanced decision. While short-term CDs currently offer slightly higher fixed rates for terms like three or six months, high-yield savings accounts provide greater flexibility with comparable, albeit variable, rates. Calculations show that for shorter durations, CDs may yield marginally more interest, but for a nine-month period, a high-yield savings account could prove more profitable. The best option depends on an individual's outlook on future interest rate trends and their need for liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mexico's Supreme Court has issued a landmark ruling in favor of singer Sasha Sokol, setting a precedent for civil cases involving child sexual abuse. The court upheld a civil conviction against artistic producer Luis de Llano for the abusive relationship he had with Sokol when she was 14 and he was 39. This decision establishes that the statute of limitations does not apply in such civil cases, opening a path for other victims to seek justice. Sokol celebrated the ruling as a crucial step toward repairing the harm, stating it transcends her personal case and validates the experiences of many others.</p>

          <p>A new study from the Pew Research Center suggests that President Trump would have won the 2024 presidential election even if every eligible American had voted. The analysis, based on a large survey of validated voters and non-voters, found that non-voters in 2024 preferred Trump over his Democratic opponent, a reversal from previous election cycles. This finding challenges the long-held political assumption that higher turnout universally benefits the Democratic party. The study also highlighted a shift in Trump's coalition, which became younger and more ethnically diverse compared to his 2016 base.</p>

          <p>As extreme heat events become more common, transportation infrastructure faces significant stress and potential failure. An engineering professor from Arizona State University explains that high temperatures can cause materials like asphalt and railway tracks to soften, buckle, or expand, leading to service disruptions and safety hazards. This affects everything from roads and bridges to airports and public transit systems, which were often designed for a milder climate. The discussion highlights the urgent need for infrastructure upgrades and new engineering solutions to adapt to the realities of a warming planet.</p>

Critics argue the focus on thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative long proven safe in vaccines, is an orchestrated effort to sow public distrust in immunizations.

These models, intended to solve complex problems through logical steps, appear to fail when tasks reach a certain level of complexity, with one paper calling their performance "the illusion of thinking." Researchers have found that the models struggle with generalization, suggesting they may be memorizing patterns rather than developing true problem-solving skills.

          <p>Millions of federal student loan borrowers are facing a "default cliff" as involuntary collections resume, according to a new analysis by TransUnion. The report found a record-high 31% of borrowers with a payment due were in late-stage delinquency as of April, and millions more are at risk of defaulting in the coming months. Borrowers who fall behind are already seeing significant drops in their credit scores, and those who enter default status face potential wage garnishment. Experts at Pew Research Center echoed the warning, anticipating a substantial wave of defaults beginning this fall.</p>

Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt explained that the president could choose to extend the pause on tariffs for countries engaged in good-faith trade negotiations with the U.S. This provides flexibility on the July 8 expiration of a reduced 10% tariff rate on most countries and a July 9 deadline regarding a potential 50% tariff on the European Union.

          <p>This month marks the tenth anniversary of the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which established a constitutional right to same-sex marriage across the United States. The article reflects on the rapid shift in public opinion, from widespread opposition in 2004 when the first legal gay marriage took place in Massachusetts, to majority support by 2015. However, it also notes that a decade after this civil rights milestone was achieved, the legal foundation for gay marriage is facing renewed attacks and political challenges. The anniversary serves as a moment to consider both the progress made and current vulnerabilities.</p>

A legitimate credit counseling agency will conduct a thorough review of your entire financial situation before making recommendations and will be honest about the potential impact on your credit score.
