          <p>In response to a Republican effort in Texas to redraw congressional maps for political advantage, California Democrats are exploring a counter-move. Governor Gavin Newsom has threatened to lead an effort to redraw California's maps to favor Democrats, aiming to offset potential GOP gains in Texas. However, California faces significant legal and procedural hurdles, as changing its redistricting process, which is managed by an independent commission, would likely require a constitutional amendment approved by voters.</p>

          <p>Despite its total assets approaching $1 trillion, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) recorded an $8 billion writedown on its ambitious "gigaprojects," including the futuristic Neom development. This decline in investment value reflects challenges from lower global oil prices and a growing national fiscal deficit, which has forced the kingdom to scale back some of its Vision 2030 plans. The fund is reportedly shifting its focus more toward domestic investments and high-growth sectors like artificial intelligence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores why Alaska serves as a historically and geographically suitable location for the high-stakes summit between President Trump and President Putin regarding the war in Ukraine. The state was a former Russian colony sold to the U.S. in 1867, giving it deep ties to both nations. Its strategic location on the former Cold War frontier, home to significant U.S. military installations, adds to its relevance as a neutral yet symbolic meeting ground.</p>

These higher costs are expected to be passed on to consumers in the coming months as the products finally move to retail shelves. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article condemns President Trump's federal intervention in Washington D.C. as a hypocritical power grab built on false pretenses about crime, which is reportedly at a 30-year low. The author likens the move to the January 6th Capitol attack, arguing both were instigated by Trump based on lies to assert illegitimate authority. The piece posits this action is part of a broader right-wing assault on diverse, Democratic-run cities, using fear to justify authoritarian measures.</p>

          <p>This analysis details the unique legal basis that permits President Trump to deploy the National Guard and federalize the police in Washington, D.C. Unlike states, the District of Columbia is a federal enclave where the president has direct authority to take control during emergencies under the Home Rule Act. The article clarifies that replicating this action in other major U.S. cities would be significantly more difficult, as state governors command their own National Guard forces.</p>

          <p>Yue Wa, a vital and affordable grocery market in Los Angeles's Chinatown for 18 years, is set to close its doors. The owner attributes the closure to a confluence of pressures, including repeated burglaries, the economic fallout of the pandemic, and the changing demographics of the historic neighborhood. The store served as a crucial source of fresh, culturally relevant produce for the area's elderly and low-income residents, and its loss marks a significant blow to the community.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the history of the word "genius," tracing its meaning from an innate personal spirit to a quantifiable trait studied by science. It examines how 19th-century thinkers, influenced by Darwin, attempted to link genius to heredity, leading to the problematic and biased field of eugenics. The piece reflects on how the concept has always been subjective and often exclusionary, questioning who society has historically chosen to label with this extraordinary term.</p>

Biden made the comment in a recent interview, attributing it to a since-retracted news story, and has so far appeared unwilling to apologize.</p>

          <p>This article contrasts two common strategies for handling significant debt: forgiveness and management. Debt forgiveness involves negotiating with creditors to pay back less than the full amount owed, which can provide substantial relief but damages credit and has tax implications. In contrast, debt management through credit counseling creates a structured repayment plan with lower interest rates, which preserves credit but requires paying the principal in full, making it better for those with steady income.
