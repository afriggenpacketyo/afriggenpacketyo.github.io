          <p>The SEC has dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, concluding one of the last remaining crypto enforcement actions by the agency. The original complaint, filed in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds, as well as enabling trading in unregistered securities. This dismissal marks a symbolic end to aggressive crypto crackdowns and coincides with the Trump administration's efforts to support the crypto industry. Binance is also deepening its involvement in Pakistan, with Zhao advising the country's Crypto Council. (not investment advice)</p>

The mother and child, the first grandchild of the crown prince and the first great-grandchild of former Emperor Akihito, are reported to be in good health. Japanese law stipulates that female members of the imperial family forfeit their royal status upon marrying commoners, thus Mako no longer holds her title.</p>

          <p>Enormous early-season wildfires in Canada's prairie provinces have led to a state of emergency and mass evacuations, with over 17,000 people being airlifted from affected areas. These fires have already burned approximately 200,000 hectares in Manitoba alone, significantly exceeding the recent full-year average, and First Nations communities in Saskatchewan have been severely impacted. The resulting smoke is expected to drift into the United States, potentially causing unhealthy air quality in cities like Chicago, Detroit, and Washington D.C. The health effects of wildfire smoke, including impacts on the heart, lungs, and brain function, are an increasing concern.</p>

Zhou achieved this breakthrough while working as an algorithm engineer, with Professor Ivan Fesenko now mentoring him at Westlake University. Fesenko declared that Zhou's results are stronger than Andrew Wilesâ€™ famed 1995 proof of Fermatâ€™s Last Theorem.</p>

She argues that Machiavelli's focus was on understanding human nature to create a politics that allows people to coexist, rather than advocating for cruelty.

The Amazon Fire Stick is identified as a major piracy enabler, allowing access to illegal streams. The report also highlights that users of illegal streams often provide sensitive information, making them vulnerable to malware and phishing scams.</p>

          <p>Vladimir Motin, the Russian captain of a cargo ship, pleaded not guilty to manslaughter in a U.K. court regarding the death of a crew member following a collision with a U.S. tanker in the North Sea. The collision occurred off the coast of northeast England in March, resulting in a fire and the presumed death of a Filipino crew member. Motin's trial is scheduled for January, and authorities have stated there is no indication the collision was related to national security. The environmental impact was less severe than initially feared, though plastic production pellets have washed up along the English coast.</p>

          <p>India's economy grew at an annual rate of 7.4% in the quarter ending in March, surpassing expectations despite global economic uncertainties. This marks the strongest quarterly growth in the government's fiscal year 2025, with the full fiscal year expanding by 6.5%. The robust growth is attributed to strong domestic consumption and a relatively lower dependence on exports, which has cushioned the impact of U.S. trade policies. While the U.S. imposed tariffs on goods imported from India, these were later reduced to allow for deal negotiations.</p>

The chemicals are linked to various health problems, including cancer and birth defects.

          <p>Adam Riess, a Nobel Prize-winning cosmologist, is challenging the standard model of cosmology, which includes the concept of dark energy driving the accelerating expansion of the universe. Riess's precise observations of distant galaxies have revealed a discrepancy in the expansion rate, known as the Hubble tension, which suggests the standard model may be flawed. If the standard model is incorrect, it could significantly alter our understanding of the universe's fate, potentially changing the dominant theory of heat death. Other scientists are approaching the new claims with caution and saying it's too early to call.</p>
