          <p>A devastating fire at a new shopping mall in Kut, Iraq, has resulted in at least 61 deaths, with many victims dying from suffocation. The mall had only been open for a week, and the blaze reportedly started on the floor selling flammable cosmetics. In response, the Iraqi Prime Minister has ordered an investigation, and legal action has been initiated against the building and mall owners. This tragedy highlights ongoing concerns about poor building standards and lax safety enforcement in Iraq, echoing a deadly 2023 wedding hall fire.</p>

          <h2>Experts Predict Mortgage Rates Unlikely to Fall Significantly After July Fed Meeting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 10:07:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite hopes from prospective homebuyers, experts do not anticipate a substantial drop in mortgage rates following the Federal Reserve's July meeting. Mortgage rates are more closely tied to the 10-year Treasury yield than the federal funds rate, and markets may have already priced in any potential minor adjustments. For significant rate decreases to occur, conditions such as a sustained decline in inflation toward 2% and a weaker job market would be necessary. Financial experts advise that waiting for lower rates could be a mistake, as falling rates often lead to rising home prices, eroding affordability gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reportedly made a third offer for Brentford's forward, Bryan Mbeumo, valued at up to £70 million, consisting of a £65 million initial payment plus add-ons. The club is confident in securing the 25-year-old Cameroon international, who scored 20 Premier League goals last season. The deal is a priority for United, who aim to finalize it before their pre-season tour in the United States. This move addresses the team's struggles with goal-scoring, as they recorded their worst domestic campaign goal tally since the 1973-74 season.</p>

This crackdown affects a community that has been part of Iranian society for decades, often working in demanding jobs but treated as an underclass with no path to citizenship.

The experiences division, which includes parks and resorts, is a major profit center, fueled by attractions based on characters and stories from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. The company plans to invest $60 billion in this division over the next decade, with a heavy focus on creating new lands and rides based on popular franchises. While this sometimes means replacing older, non-IP attractions, the approach successfully broadens the parks' appeal and boosts revenue.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has passed a rescissions package requested by President Trump, clawing back $9 billion in previously approved funding. The measure, which passed 51-48, primarily targets foreign assistance programs and includes about $1 billion in cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The vote followed a lengthy session with numerous rejected amendments aimed at preserving the funding. The bill, slightly modified from the House version to restore some AIDS prevention funds, must now be approved by the House before a Friday deadline to prevent the funds from being spent as originally intended.</p>

          <p>Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis has raised its full-year profit forecast, driven by a dramatic increase in sales for its breast cancer treatment, Kisqali. The company reported a 64% surge in global sales for the drug in the second quarter and expects it to become a new blockbuster. This growth is crucial as Novartis prepares for the U.S. patent expiry of its top-selling heart failure drug, Entresto, next year. The strong performance of Kisqali and other pipeline drugs has given the company the confidence to announce a new share buyback program of up to $10 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Katherine Maher, the CEO of National Public Radio, has warned that the $1.1 billion in funding cuts to public broadcasting passed by the Senate could endanger public safety. She emphasized that public media is a critical component of emergency alert systems in nearly half of U.S. states, especially in rural areas. The cuts, part of a larger rescissions package, could force smaller stations that rely heavily on federal funds to lay off staff or even close. Maher argued that losing these stations would diminish the ability to disseminate life-saving information during natural disasters and other emergencies.</p>

The policy is designed to stop Chinese goods from being rerouted through other countries to evade U.S. tariffs. The economic impact will depend heavily on how broadly the U.S. defines transshipment; a strict definition targeting products with any Chinese components could be calamitous for regional economies deeply integrated with China's supply chain.
