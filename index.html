The company has cancelled new orders and is struggling to find alternative foreign vendors due to tariffs imposed on dozens of other countries.

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will be traveling to Switzerland to meet with their Chinese counterparts in order to discuss the ongoing trade war between the two nations. The meeting comes after China's government pushed back against President Donald Trump's previous comments that the two countries were actively discussing trade. The Chinese Commerce Ministry has stated that China is willing to engage with the U.S. while also maintaining its determination to protect its own interests. The discussions will be focused on de-escalation rather than on creating a big trade deal.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new law that will make it a criminal offense to climb on the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square, as well as other war memorials across Britain. The legislation is part of the Crime and Policing Bill and aims to protect these monuments from desecration by protesters. Offenders could face imprisonment and fines for disrespecting the monument to Britain's wartime leader. The law is being introduced as the country prepares to celebrate VE Day, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressing his support for the protection of Churchill's legacy.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's staff sought to keep details about his Texas mansion private, including correspondence with West Lake Hills officials, after neighbors complained about unpermitted construction. Emails obtained by The New York Times reveal that Musk's employees argued his property records should be exempt from public records laws, citing his work with the Trump administration. The dispute centers on a 16-foot fence and gate erected without proper permits. The effort to keep the matter private was unsuccessful, and Musk ultimately lost an appeal to keep the structures on his property.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is planning to eliminate the Energy Star program, according to internal documents and a recording of a staff meeting. The decision is part of an agency reorganization that will eliminate divisions overseeing climate change and energy efficiency. The Energy Star program, known for its recognizable blue label, has helped households and businesses save billions in energy costs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Critics argue that eliminating the program is counterintuitive to the administration's pledge to reduce household costs and address the growing energy crisis.</p>
