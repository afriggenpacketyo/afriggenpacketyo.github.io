          <h2>IMF: German Fiscal Measures Insufficient to Counteract Tariff Impact on Eurozone</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggests that while increased infrastructure spending in Germany will moderately boost economic growth in Europe, it will not be enough to offset the negative impact of U.S. tariffs. According to Alfred Kammer, the head of the IMF's European department, the IMF has downgraded its growth outlook for the Eurozone due to President Trump's tariff policies, which are expected to have a more significant drag on the economy. Despite Germany's fiscal boost through defense spending and infrastructure funds, the tariffs are projected to have a more substantial impact on the region's economic performance. The IMF reduced its Eurozone growth forecasts for the next two years by 0.2 percentage points, projecting growth at 0.8% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026.</p>

          <p>A Syrian man, Majdi Nema (also known as Islam Allouch), is on trial in France for alleged war crimes committed during the Syrian civil war. Nema, a former spokesperson for the rebel group Jaysh al-Islam (JAI), is accused of complicity in the war crime of enlisting minors and participating in a group formed to prepare war crimes. The trial is the first to examine atrocities JAI is suspected of committing during the Syrian conflict, which began in 2011. While Nema's lawyers deny his involvement in strategic or military command, civil parties claim he held a leadership role within JAI. This trial highlights the efforts to bring justice for war crimes committed during the Syrian conflict, particularly in the absence of an international tribunal.</p>

While Virgil van Dijk is expected to stay, additions at center-back are also being considered to provide depth and future security. Arne Slot's evaluation of current players like Joe Gomez and Jarell Quansah will influence the decision to bring in new talent, with names like Micky van de Ven, Marc Guehi, and Jarrad Branthwaite mentioned as potential targets.

The incident occurred at the Lapu Lapu Day festival, and police have ruled out terrorism as a motive, citing the suspect's history of mental health issues. Prime Minister Mark Carney canceled Liberal Party gatherings in response to the tragedy, which has deeply impacted Vancouver's Filipino community.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study suggests that the Han dynasty's conquest of the Nanyue kingdom in southern China in 112 BC may have contributed to the decline of the Chinese swamp cypress. Researchers analyzed geological evidence, pollen, and historical records to understand how the Han's riverine warfare tactics impacted the Pearl River Delta's ecosystem. Sediment samples from ancient battlegrounds showed a significant decrease in swamp cypress pollen around 100 BC, coinciding with the Han's assault on Panyu, which involved setting the city ablaze. This research connects military history with environmental consequences, revealing the long-term ecological impact of ancient conflicts.</p>

This statement follows an incident where an Aboriginal elder was booed during a welcome ceremony, sparking public outrage. Dutton believes that these ceremonies should be reserved for significant events to avoid diminishing their importance and causing division. While condemning the heckling incident, Dutton has previously referred to the tradition as "virtue signalling," indicating a shift in how Indigenous history is acknowledged if he is elected.</p>

The opinion piece warns that losing the auto industry's supply chains and manufacturing capabilities could also jeopardize the U.S.'s capacity to produce vital technologies and military equipment.

          <p>The absence of China's top general, He Weidong, from a recent Politburo study session has fueled speculation regarding his whereabouts. He Weidong, the second-ranked vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), has not been seen publicly since March 11. While no official explanation has been provided for his absence, analysts do not expect it to affect China’s political stability. His absence from key events where top CMC leaders are typically present has further intensified the speculation.</p>

          <p>Populist politics, while initially appearing liberating and simple, often lead to increased complexity and chaos when applied to real-world problems. Brexit has resulted in more border hassle and paperwork, while stricter immigration controls create new bureaucracies and enforcement bodies. The Trump administration's attempts to micromanage various institutions and impose ideological conformity demonstrate the impracticality and potential for overreach. While some voters may find satisfaction in challenging elites, the increased intervention and potential expense of a more controlling state may disillusion others. Populism's promise of simplicity often clashes with the complexities of governing.</p>

          <p>Laboratory testing of baby food pouches from leading UK brands reveals that many are low in essential nutrients like vitamin C and iron, while some contain excessive amounts of sugar. The investigation found that savory pouches often lack sufficient iron, while fruit pouches can lose significant amounts of vitamin C during manufacturing. Experts suggest that the marketing of these pouches can be misleading to parents, as they are not replacements for homemade meals and should be used sparingly. The brands maintain that their products are intended as a complementary part of a varied weaning diet and meet UK regulations.</p>

          <p>Tess Segal, a Jewish student at the University of Florida, faced arrest and suspension for participating in a protest calling for the university to divest from weapons manufacturers and boycott academic institutions in Israel.

The university's dean of students later increased her suspension to three years, citing disruption to university functions and interference with law enforcement. The case highlights the tensions surrounding protests related to Israel and the consequences faced by students involved.</p>

          <p>Planned changes to school uniform policy in England are expected to affect over four million pupils by limiting the number of compulsory branded items. The government aims to reduce costs for families, estimating savings of around £50 per child, with the new rules potentially introduced in September 2026. However, uniform retailers warn that the changes could lead to increased costs if lower-quality generic garments need more frequent replacement. While the government hopes to make uniforms more affordable, concerns remain about the impact on school wear manufacturers and the potential for increased expenses for families.</p>

Kim stated that the troops were sent to "annihilate and wipe out the Ukrainian neo-Nazi occupiers" and has ordered the construction of a monument in Pyongyang to commemorate their service.
