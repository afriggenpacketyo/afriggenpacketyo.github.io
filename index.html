        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is determined to push forward with plans to cut the benefits bill by £5 billion by 2030, despite potential rebellion within the Labour Party. The Welfare Reform Bill includes proposals to make it harder for disabled people with less severe conditions to claim Personal Independence Payment (PIP) in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Starmer insists the current system is not working for those needing support or taxpayers, emphasizing the necessity for reform to address these issues. The Prime Minister maintains that everyone agrees the system needs reform, and the government intends to deliver on that promise. Optimism for the bill's success hinges on addressing the concerns of both beneficiaries and taxpayers.</p>

          <p>The owners of Kiichi, a formerly Michelin-starred restaurant in Osaka Prefecture, Japan, have been arrested for violating the Food Sanitation Act after ignoring an order to temporarily shut down following multiple food poisoning incidents. Hirokazu Kitano, his son Hirotoshi, and his wife Noriko are accused of continuing to sell bento boxes despite a suspension order issued after 33 customers experienced vomiting and diarrhea, with norovirus detected. Subsequent investigations revealed that the restaurant continued operating even after being ordered to close indefinitely. This incident raises concerns about food safety standards and regulatory compliance within the restaurant industry.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts predict that up to 100 truckloads of Scotland's waste will be exported to England daily after Scotland's landfill ban on biodegradable municipal waste comes into effect at the end of the year. The Scottish government acknowledges a capacity gap due to insufficient incinerators to handle the extra waste. Environmental consultants estimate that 600,000 tonnes of rubbish will have no disposal solution in the first year of the ban. While the ban aims to reduce greenhouse gases from landfills, the short-term impact will be increased emissions from transporting waste to England, raising concerns about the overall environmental benefit.</p>

While forward prices are already experiencing significant effects, the CEOs emphasize the unpredictable nature of geopolitical events and their impact on oil markets. The Strait of Hormuz remains open, but any potential blockade would have significant effects on prices as customers around the world would be scrambling to meet their own energy needs (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Demonstrators in Barcelona and Mallorca, Spain, protested against mass tourism by spraying tourists with water pistols, demanding a reevaluation of the economic model that they say is driving up housing costs and eroding local culture. Protesters argue that the influx of tourists is displacing residents and transforming traditional neighborhoods into tourist-oriented zones. The demonstrations were part of a coordinated effort across southern Europe, with similar rallies occurring in Venice, Italy, and Lisbon, Portugal. The activists are calling for measures to address the negative impacts of overtourism on local communities and ensure the sustainability of their cities.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has added China's Huawei and SMIC to its trade blacklist, a move that further aligns the country with U.S. trade policy amid growing tensions with Beijing. The International Trade Administration of Taiwan included Huawei and SMIC, along with their subsidiaries, on its "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List." This regulation requires domestic firms to obtain licenses before shipping products to these entities. The action is likely aimed at reinforcing existing U.S. export restrictions and tightening loopholes, potentially increasing penalties for future breaches, as both Huawei and SMIC are already on a U.S. trade blacklist.</p>

          <p>Nesrine Malik argues that Israel's response to the October 7, 2023, attack and subsequent actions, including the conflict in Gaza and attacks against Iran, have damaged its international reputation. The author contends that Israel's actions have stretched justifications beyond plausibility, leading to a breakdown in trust with key allies. By opening a new front with Iran, the Israeli government seeks to restore its historical narrative as a victim acting in good faith, but this strategy risks further destabilizing the region. Malik suggests that Israel's actions are driven by domestic politics and reputation management, disregarding the security needs of other nations in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Analysts are warning that Donald Trump's proposed “revenge tax” could discourage foreign investment into the United States. The provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would allow the US to impose higher taxes on foreign entities connected to jurisdictions that levy “unfair foreign taxes” on US individuals and companies. This measure, known as Section 899, targets digital service taxes and diverted profits taxes, potentially alienating foreign investors and undermining the dollar's safe haven status. UK companies, with significant revenue exposure in the US, could be particularly vulnerable, prompting some to consider redomiciling in New York to avoid the tax (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Japan is strengthening its cyber defense capabilities, with a new law allowing preemptive measures to protect critical infrastructure. The legislation enables the government to monitor online communications and take early action against harmful servers, involving police and the Self-Defense Forces. This shift from reactive to preemptive defense is driven by increasing cyber threats from state-backed hackers, prompting the private sector to enhance its cybersecurity measures. The government plans to develop a comprehensive strategy by the end of the year to implement a full-fledged preemptive defense system by 2027.</p>

          <p>Shared ownership schemes, designed as a stepping stone to homeownership, face growing criticism as complaints about repairs, costs, and selling difficulties have surged. Many shared owners feel trapped, bearing the obligations of homeowners without the rights. Complaints to the housing ombudsman have risen nearly 400% in the past five years, with common issues including rising service charges and lengthy repair times. Some shared owners find themselves unable to increase their share due to increasing costs, while others struggle to sell their properties, leading to financial losses and disillusionment with the scheme.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are facing criticism for their silence on recent ICE raids that have instilled fear in many parts of Los Angeles. Despite having a large Latino fan base, the team has not issued a statement of support or solidarity with those affected. This silence contrasts with statements from other local sports teams like Angel City FC and LAFC, who have expressed concern for residents experiencing fear and uncertainty. The Dodgers' refusal to comment has led to accusations of being ungrateful, disrespectful, and cowardly, particularly given the significant support they receive from the Latino community.</p>

While the EU still promotes multilateralism and climate leadership, its policy direction is converging with Trump's on issues like migration and climate. The EU's new pact on migration and asylum reframes asylum as a security risk, while the European Commission has quietly dismantled key green deal initiatives. The author contends that this ideological convergence weakens Europe's ability to respond to threats and fails to articulate a compelling alternative to far-right messaging.</p>
