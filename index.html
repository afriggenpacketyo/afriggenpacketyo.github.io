          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 18:48:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year, citing health concerns. The FDA is looking to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and work with the food industry to eliminate six others found in common foods. While some industry groups question the timeline, others are willing to collaborate, but scientists caution that the evidence for health risks is not definitive. The plan is contingent on cooperation from major food companies to transition to natural alternatives. Optimism in the food industry is high, and this is seen as a win for the Kennedy administration.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that the recent bear market rally could evolve into a genuine recovery, identifying several key indicators to watch. These include productive trade negotiations, a drop in oil prices potentially leading to Federal Reserve rate cuts, and positive economic data. Cramer emphasizes that recoveries often begin as skeptical bear market rallies and that a resolution with China would be especially beneficial. He also notes that increased IPOs and mergers could signal a sustained market upturn. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk faces mounting pressure from investors to refocus on the electric car maker as first-quarter results reveal declining sales and profits. Investors are concerned about Musk's focus on the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and its impact on Tesla's performance. Musk announced plans to scale back his time spent on DOGE starting next month, but will still continue his involvement with DOGE throughout Mr. Trump's term. Analysts suggest that Musk's political activities have negatively impacted Tesla's brand and demand for its vehicles.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk will decrease his involvement with Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from May, focusing more on Tesla. This decision comes as Tesla's first-quarter profits declined due to falling sales, partly attributed to President Trump's tariffs. Musk's role at DOGE, aimed at cutting federal spending, has sparked controversy and a public backlash against his company. Tesla's value has significantly decreased amid financial market turbulence, competition from Chinese EV rivals, and concerns over Musk's divided attention.</p>
