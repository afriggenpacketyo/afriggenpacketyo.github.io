            <h2>Indian and Chinese Students File Lawsuit Against Trump Administration Over Visa Terminations</h2>

            <p>Three Indian and two Chinese students have initiated legal action against the Trump administration, challenging the termination of their F-1 visas. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU, alleges that the administration terminated the visas of international students without proper notice, potentially leading to deportation and financial hardship. The students claim that their research assistantships have been terminated and that they may be unable to complete their degrees due to the visa issues. The Trump administration's tightening of student visa policies has raised concerns among international students and universities, particularly affecting Chinese and Indian students who constitute a significant portion of the international student population in the US.</p>

            <p>Dozens of police officers in Tonawanda, New York, are facing fines for allegedly participating in an unauthorized labor strike during a snowy period this winter, with the union claiming the fines are retaliatory. The officers allege the fines are an abuse of power because they showed up to work every day, participated in training, and even made a drunken driving stop. The police union president claims the town is upset that the officers didn't issue enough tickets to meet a perceived quota, which is illegal under New York law. The town supervisor and police chief maintain the allegations are without merit and that the officers intentionally reduced ticket issuance as a form of strike.</p>

            <p>The article explores the ethical concerns surrounding the use of snail slime in beauty products, a trend popular among millennials and Gen Z for its purported anti-aging benefits. While the industry assures consumers that snails are treated humanely, some extraction methods involve acidic solutions or force, raising animal welfare concerns. The author questions the normalization of industrialized snail labor for uncertain benefits, especially given the limited curiosity about the industry's practices. The piece also touches on the potential impact of tariffs on Korean beauty products, highlighting the trade-off between snail and human wellbeing in the pursuit of 'glass skin'.</p>

            <p>This article reflects on the author's experiences with America, contrasting the past with the present. The author describes a time of openness and generosity, where the 'American Dream' felt attainable. However, the author laments the current state of affairs, where authoritarianism and careerism have eroded the country's motivating ideals, replaced by a sense of loss and betrayal among the elite. The author recalls various encounters, from militia members to human-fairy enthusiasts, to illustrate the diverse 'bubbles' that once characterized America. The piece is a meditation on the fading illusion of the American Dream and the country's changing identity.</p>

            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 03:43:59 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Despite Russia's declared Easter truce, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported ongoing attacks by Russian forces. According to Zelenskyy, Russian forces conducted shellings and assaults, and deployed drones even during the supposed ceasefire period. Zelenskyy reiterated Ukraine's willingness to reciprocate a full and unconditional ceasefire, even proposing an extension beyond the initial 30-hour period. The announcement of the truce came shortly before it was due to take effect, making an immediate and complete cessation of hostilities unlikely, and raising skepticism about Russia's true intentions.</p>

            <p>This article critiques Donald Trump's attempts to impose political authority over academic institutions, particularly Harvard University, by demanding viewpoint diversity through mandated hiring practices. The author argues that Trump's approach is a form of identity politics disguised as a challenge to 'woke' beliefs, undermining the principle of hiring based on qualifications. The piece also discusses the complexities and contradictions inherent in the broader debate around viewpoint diversity, suggesting that affirmative action for certain political viewpoints can be counterproductive and may subvert scholarly objectivity.</p>

Unlike Thailand and Vietnam, Malaysian durians are typically allowed to ripen on the tree before harvesting, which is highly valued by consumers. The increase in durian exports is supported by steady supply and improved logistics, with fresh durians being transported to China by air within 48 hours of pickup.
