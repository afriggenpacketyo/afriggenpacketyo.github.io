          <p>Moody's Ratings has lowered the United States' sovereign credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns about the increasing federal budget deficit and the rising costs of debt refinancing amid high interest rates. The rating agency highlighted the failure of successive administrations and Congress to address the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs, also mentioning that if the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is extended, it will add around $4 trillion to the federal fiscal primary deficit over the next decade. This downgrade aligns Moody's with other major agencies like Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings, which had previously lowered the U.S. rating. This article reports that market reaction included a slight increase in Treasury yields and a dip in stock futures following the announcement.</p>

          <p>Ten inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish Jail in New Orleans, prompting a large-scale manhunt involving local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies. According to this article, authorities believe the inmates received inside help and that the escapees are considered "armed and dangerous." One inmate has been apprehended, and officials are working to locate the remaining nine. The inmates reportedly broke out of their cell by removing a toilet and breaching a wall, leaving taunting messages for the guards. The sheriff's office claims that the city has not provided sufficient funding for prison security upgrades.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's announcement that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on Syria caught senior officials at the Treasury Department by surprise. According to this article, the announcement lacked specifics, leading to internal discussions to determine the speed and extent of the rollback. The decision came after months of lobbying from Syria's transitional government, which argues that sanctions have hindered its ability to pay salaries and rebuild infrastructure. Turkey and Saudi Arabia have supported normalizing relations with Syria and have provided aid, potentially conflicting with existing sanctions. Relief may come in the form of waivers, allowing business in Syria without penalties.</p>

          <p>President Trump has been actively engaged in peace brokering, including lifting sanctions on Syria, negotiating the release of a U.S. citizen held by Hamas, ending military strikes on Houthi fighters in Yemen, slashing tariffs on China, ordering Ukraine to hold talks with Russia, and claiming responsibility for a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. This article suggests this flurry of activity reveals Trump's desire for a world of interstate relations based on trade rather than war, with a focus on American interests. The author notes that Trump's approach often involves impulsive decision-making without wider internal government discussion, which can lead to inconsistencies and confusion among diplomats.</p>

          <p>A Republican-backed tax bill is touted by the White House as delivering permanent tax cuts and bigger paychecks, but analyses suggest it would disproportionately benefit the highest income earners while offering more modest gains to lower-income Americans. Households with over $1 million in annual income would see a 4.3% increase in after-tax earnings, while the lowest-earning 20% would see a 0.6% increase. The fate of the GOP tax bill is unclear after some Republican members of the House Budget Committee voted against advancing the measure. This article does not give investment advice.</p>

          <p>A top adviser to the Director of National Intelligence ordered a senior analyst to redo an assessment of the relationship between Venezuela’s government and a gang after intelligence findings undercut the White House’s justification for deporting migrants. President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants relied on a claim that U.S. intelligence agencies think is wrong. The analyst reaffirmed the original findings after re-examining the evidence. The official’s intervention was seen by some as an effort to produce a narrative that would support Trump’s agenda.</p>

          <p>A brain-dead pregnant woman in Georgia has been kept on life support for three months to allow the fetus to grow, due to the state's strict abortion law. The family says the hospital told them it was required under the state's anti-abortion law, which restricts abortion once cardiac activity is detected. Doctors told the family that they are not allowed to stop or remove the devices that are keeping her breathing because state law bans abortion after cardiac activity can be detected. There is nothing in the LIFE Act that requires medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death, and that removing life support is not an action 'with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy'.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's "big, beautiful" tax bill has stalled in the House of Representatives due to Republican disagreements over spending cuts and Medicaid. The bill's tax breaks total about $4.9 trillion, partly paid for by cuts to Medicaid and green energy tax breaks. Some Republicans want steeper cuts to avoid swelling America's public debt, while others object to cuts to Medicaid. Another point of contention is a tripling of a local tax deduction from $10,000 to $30,000 for couples.</p>

With 60, Tottenham and United will both play more matches than any other Premier League club this season following their runs in the Europa League. The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss suggested his side have been chosen to play FA Cup semi-finals on a Saturday so often because broadcasters feel there are "more followers" for the Sunday game, with Guardiola saying: "They are tired to see us."</p>
