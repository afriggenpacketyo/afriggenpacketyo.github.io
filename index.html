        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, speaking at the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Istanbul, denounced recent American strikes in Iran as "outrageous" and held the U.S. responsible for any resulting consequences. Araghchi stated that the U.S. betrayed diplomacy and negotiations, further criticizing both the U.S. and Israel for attacking Iran amidst ongoing diplomatic talks. He also accused former President Trump of deceiving his voters by engaging in what he called "forever wars" through joining Israel in attacking Iran. Araghchi appeared to shut down the possibility of diplomatic solutions for the time being, stating that the door to diplomacy should always be open, but that "this is not the case right now".</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance clarified the U.S. position on Iran, stating that the recent strikes targeted Iran's nuclear program rather than initiating a war with the country itself. Vance told ABC News that the president took decisive action to destroy that program. When asked if Iran's nuclear program has been definitively destroyed, Vance asserted that the U.S. has substantially set back Iran's nuclear ambitions, suggesting it would take a considerable amount of time for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon, if they even want to. Vance's comments aimed to reassure the public that the U.S. strategy is focused on preventing nuclear proliferation rather than engaging in a broader conflict.</p>

          <p>Pentagon officials provided details on Operation Midnight Hammer, the U.S. mission targeting three nuclear sites in Iran, with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff calling it the "largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history." The mission involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers flying from Missouri to Iran, requiring multiple in-flight refuelings and coordination with U.S. fighter jets. The operation included the launch of Tomahawk cruise missiles from a U.S. submarine against targets in Isfahan, along with deception tactics and fighter jets clearing the airspace. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth hailed the attack as an "incredible and overwhelming success," emphasizing that it did not target Iranian troops or the Iranian people.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is facing difficulties in the Tokyo assembly election, which is seen as an indicator for the upcoming House of Councillors race. Exit polls suggest that Tomin First no Kai, a regional party established by Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, is likely to perform well among independent voters. The Tokyo assembly election often influences the national political landscape, reflecting voters' views on leadership and economic policy. The LDP held 30 seats before the election, followed by Tomin First with 26.</p>

          <p>Just hours after the U.S. announced that it had attacked three nuclear sites in Iran, effectively joining Israel, digital alerts sounded in Israel, followed by air raid sirens warning of incoming missiles. In a large underground car park in central Tel Aviv, many people had slept there overnight in small tents pitched on the fourth underground floor. Others made their way to the shelter from the neighborhood. This conflict is much more destructive than previous ones with the militant group Hamas in Gaza or the Lebanese group Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that the U.S. carried out a "successful" bombing attack on three nuclear sites in Iran, claiming they have been "obliterated." Israel stated they were in "full co-ordination" with the U.S. in planning the strikes. US Gen Dan Caine, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said Operation Midnight Hammer involved 125 US military aircraft including seven B-2 stealth bombers. Iranian officials have confirmed the facilities were struck but denied it had suffered a major blow. The strikes mark a significant escalation in the ongoing war between Iran and Israel.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the potential impact of U.S. military strikes on Iran's nuclear program, noting that while such actions can delay progress, they may not eliminate a determined push for nuclear weapons. Experts suggest that destroying physical infrastructure is easier than eliminating the knowledge a country has acquired. The article also raises concerns that the strikes could strengthen Iran's resolve to reconstitute its nuclear activities, potentially leading to withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty and weaponization. The comparison to North Korea's nuclear ambitions is made, highlighting the potential for a similar outcome.</p>
