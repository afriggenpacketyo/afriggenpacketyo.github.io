          <p>Facing setbacks from unfavorable trade policies in the U.S., Temu and Shein are shifting their focus to Europe, increasing advertising and expanding warehouse capacity. However, they are encountering regulatory scrutiny in the EU and U.K. reminiscent of the U.S., including a proposed â‚¬2 customs fee on small packages, which could significantly impact their operations. Additionally, complaints have been filed against both companies in the EU, accusing them of deceptive business tactics and overconsumption promotion, while France is considering an "anti-fast fashion" bill targeting ultra-cheap platforms. The companies must invest more in compliance and operational transparency to navigate stricter European regulations on product safety and consumer protection. Optimism regarding Temu and Shein's prospects in Europe is tempered by these challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Israeli Foreign Ministry announced that passengers aboard the intercepted Gaza aid boat, including Greta Thunberg and other activists, are being deported. The yacht, carrying 12 people attempting to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, was seized by Israeli forces and towed to Ashdod. Israel has dismissed the vessel as a "selfie yacht" and stated that passengers who refuse to sign deportation documents will face judicial authorities. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which operated the vessel, reported that campaigners might be permitted to fly out of Tel Aviv soon, emphasizing the symbolic amount of aid aimed to defy the Israeli naval blockade. The situation underscores ongoing tensions surrounding aid delivery to Gaza and Israel's security measures.</p>

          <p>China's relations with Niger have faced strain following the 2023 coup, despite Beijing's initial embrace of the military junta and provision of a substantial oil-backed loan. Disputes have arisen over salary disparities between expatriate and local workers, leading to the expulsion of Chinese oil executives and the revocation of a Chinese-owned hotel's license. Niger has also ordered China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) to terminate contracts of expatriate employees with over four years' service. Observers suggest that these disputes highlight the limits of China's non-interference policy, which, while intended to avoid entanglement in domestic affairs, can incur significant economic costs amid rising nationalism. The situation underscores the complexities of China's economic and diplomatic engagement in Africa.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent government report indicates that Japan continues to lag behind many other countries in addressing gender inequality, particularly in increasing the representation of women in leadership positions. The report, reviewed by a task force led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, acknowledges that efforts to close gender gaps by 2030 remain insufficient. Japan ranked 118th out of 146 economies in the 2024 Global Gender Gap Index, the lowest among G7 nations. The government plans to intensify efforts to promote gender equality by ensuring more opportunities for women in decision-making roles, focusing on local economies and small businesses and addressing the female brain drain in rural areas.</p>

          <p>Official figures suggest that UK companies are delaying hiring or not replacing departing employees, leading to a decline in job vacancies. The number of available jobs decreased by 63,000 between March and May, while the unemployment rate increased to 4.6%, the highest in almost four years. The Office for National Statistics notes a weakening in the labor market, with some firms holding back on recruitment due to rising employment costs, including increased National Insurance Contributions and a higher minimum wage. Economists expect the unemployment rate to rise further in the coming year as businesses seek to offset rising costs.</p>

Newsom and other Democratic leaders have denounced the arrest, while SEIU officials held a large protest in Washington, D.C., in support of Huerta's release.

          <p>President Trump's combative approach and public feuds, such as his recent spat with Elon Musk, continue to dominate media coverage and create challenges for journalists. Musk's criticism of Trump and subsequent deletion of a controversial tweet have added to the media frenzy. Meanwhile, ABC suspended correspondent Terry Moran for a scathing attack on White House domestic policy chief Stephen Miller. Trump's controversial policies, including a travel ban and pardons, also drive significant news cycles, while investigations into Joe Biden and Harvard University add to the ongoing media storm. The president's ability to move from one controversial topic to another keeps the media scrambling and boosts ratings, but also deflects scrutiny on other issues.</p>

          <p>Faced with increasing import tariffs from the US, Chinese manufacturers are expanding their exports to Southeast Asian countries, including Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia. Exports to these countries have risen by double-digit percentages in the first five months of the year, driven by growing consumer markets and offshore factory investments. Analysts suggest that Chinese manufacturers are increasingly shipping goods to factories in Southeast Asia for local sale or re-export to Western countries, including the US. While some exports may be transshipped to avoid US tariffs, factories often incorporate enough local content to declare re-exports as made in the respective Southeast Asian countries.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has initiated a lawsuit against the Trump administration to challenge the deployment of the National Guard and Marines in Los Angeles, arguing that it violates federal law and state sovereignty. Newsom has described the deployment as a "red line" and asserts that the courts and Congress must act to maintain checks and balances. Trump has defended the decision, claiming the city would have been "completely obliterated" without the Guard's presence. Despite the presence of the Guard, local law enforcement continues to manage crowd control, with interactions between the Guard and protesters remaining minimal. The legal challenge highlights the ongoing conflict between state and federal authority in response to the protests.</p>

Tighter border controls and anti-smuggling policies have increased the demand for smugglers' services, with prices rising exponentially. Violence linked to organized immigration crime is escalating in Serbia and along the Western Balkans route. As migrant reception centers close and border controls tighten, migrants are forced to rely on smugglers for every step of their journey, increasing their vulnerability. The situation underscores the unintended consequences of restrictive migration policies.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States are planning summit talks between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump in Canada, during the Group of Seven leaders' meeting. Before the summit, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, will visit Washington for the sixth round of ministerial-level negotiations on Trump's tariffs. Japan is seeking the removal of tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, but is considering accepting reduced tariff rates as the U.S. has consistently refused to eliminate the duties. Both countries aim to reach a deal as soon as possible, with Ishiba emphasizing the need to boost investment and create jobs in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Criminal gangs are exploiting a loophole in Europe's classification of ketamine to traffic the drug across borders, with seizures of ketamine disguised as salt or sugar becoming increasingly common. While ketamine is classified as a narcotic in some countries, it is regulated as a medicine in others, leading to less scrutiny during import and transit. Smugglers ship ketamine from India, where it is legitimately produced, into Germany, through the Netherlands and Belgium, then on to the UK, diverting it into illicit markets. The challenge for law enforcement is compounded by ketamine's dual use as a legitimate anaesthetic and a recreational drug, with organized crime groups now making more money from ketamine than other illegal drugs.

This release, consisting of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons. The move is intended to supply smaller supermarket operators and specialty shops, as well as major retailers, with the farm ministry beginning to accept applications on Wednesday. The government hopes that the cheaper rice will bring down overall prices, addressing public frustration over the soaring cost of rice. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns of an "unprecedented decline" in global fertility rates, with many people unable to have their desired number of children due to financial constraints and lack of suitable partners.

The UNFPA urges caution in response to low fertility, warning against panicky policies and the use of low fertility as an excuse for nationalist and anti-migrant policies.

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have experienced a significant decline, with fatal overdoses among those under 35 plummeting from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 last year. The trend is particularly notable among Gen Z, with a 47% reduction in fatal overdose risk for those aged 20 to 29. Experts attribute the decline to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less deadly fentanyl being sold, more accessible addiction healthcare, and increased awareness of the dangers of fentanyl. While the improvement is dramatic, challenges remain for those struggling with severe addiction, and potential cuts to addiction services could jeopardize the progress.</p>
