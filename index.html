          <p>Alaska Airlines initiated a system-wide ground stop for its entire fleet, as well as that of its subsidiary Horizon Air, following a significant IT outage on Sunday evening. The airline confirmed the operational disruption in a statement, apologizing for the inconvenience and warning of residual impacts on travel throughout the night. The Federal Aviation Administration acknowledged the carrier's request for the temporary grounding. The specific cause of the computer issues and the full extent of the impact on airports were not immediately detailed.</p>

          <p>Owen Farrell is set to captain the British and Irish Lions in their upcoming match against the First Nations and Pasifika XV in Melbourne. This marks his first start of the tour, where he will play at inside centre in a completely changed lineup from the first Test against Australia. The squad for this midweek game includes nine Scottish players and all of the tour's "geography" call-ups, with no players from the first-Test victory starting. The match provides an opportunity for players on the fringe to contend for a spot in the upcoming second Test.</p>

          <p>The family of legendary England batter Graham Thorpe, who died by suicide last year, is organizing an event to celebrate his memory and raise mental health awareness. Titled 'A Day for Thorpey,' the tribute will take place on what would have been his 56th birthday during the fifth England-India Test at The Oval. The event, in partnership with the charity Mind, will feature the sale of headbands to fund mental health initiatives, aiming to destigmatize conversations around suicide and grief. Thorpe’s family shared his struggles with depression, particularly after his coaching career ended.</p>

          <p>Financial analysts are increasingly viewing the Singapore dollar (SGD) as a "quasi safe-haven" currency, particularly within Asia, due to its stability and strong institutional backing. While it currently lacks the global status of the US dollar, Japanese yen, or Swiss franc, the SGD has shown defensive qualities during financial stress. Experts point to Singapore's prudent fiscal policies and unique monetary management, which controls the currency's value against a trade-weighted basket, as key strengths. However, the relatively small size of the SGD market and its managed nature present hurdles to it becoming a primary global safe haven. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Armed Bedouin clans have withdrawn from the Druze-majority city of Sweida in southern Syria following a week of deadly clashes and a U.S.-brokered ceasefire. The conflict, which killed hundreds and displaced over 128,000 people, threatened to destabilize Syria's fragile post-war transition and involved sectarian violence. Humanitarian aid convoys have begun entering the city to address shortages of food, fuel, and medicine caused by the fighting. Despite the withdrawal, tensions persist, with some Bedouin fighters remaining on the city's outskirts, demanding the surrender of a local Druze leader they blame for the conflict.</p>

Residents blame a series of management companies and a "broken leasehold system" for the building's deterioration despite soaring service charges. The local council spent nearly £400,000 on safety patrols, but Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service has now ordered the closure, deeming the buildings unsafe.</p>

          <p>GLP-1 agonists, the class of drugs including Ozempic and Wegovy, are showing potential as a breakthrough treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder in women. While not yet an approved use, some patients and small studies report significant improvements in PCOS symptoms like irregular periods, weight gain, and hormonal imbalances after using the drugs. Researchers believe the drugs' ability to improve insulin sensitivity and promote weight loss indirectly helps regulate hormones, addressing a core metabolic issue linked to PCOS. However, experts call for larger clinical trials and note that high costs and limited insurance coverage remain significant barriers.</p>

It is unclear how close the two aircraft came to colliding or why air traffic control did not provide a warning, especially given the proximity to Minot Air Force Base.

          <p>A stark contrast has emerged in the energy policies of China and the United States, particularly concerning the transition to green energy. As global demand for electricity rises, driven by technologies like AI, China is aggressively investing in and expanding its renewable energy capacity to secure a technological lead. In contrast, the Trump administration is moving to cancel tax credits for wind and solar power, labeling them as unreliable and a compromise to the nation's electric grid. This divergence in strategy could have significant long-term implications for the global energy landscape and the ongoing tech rivalry between the two superpowers. (not investment advice)</p>

In a social media post, Trump demanded the team change its name back to the "Washington Redskins," claiming there is significant public support for the move. He stated he might impose a restriction on the stadium deal, which involves redeveloping a site on federal property, if the change is not made. The team dropped the controversial name in 2020 following years of criticism that it was a racist slur against Indigenous people.</p>

          <p>Canada has become an epicenter for measles in North America, with over 3,800 cases in 2025, a figure far surpassing that of the much more populous United States. The outbreak, concentrated in Alberta and Ontario, is primarily linked to low vaccination rates, particularly within some conservative Mennonite communities where vaccine hesitancy has been amplified by post-pandemic misinformation. Health officials note that while there isn't a single prominent anti-vaccine figure like in the U.S., a general distrust in the healthcare system and the virus's rapid spread have created a public health crisis not seen since measles was declared eliminated in Canada in 1998.</p>

Cramer also highlights massive required investments in data centers and the electric grid, a loosening of bank lending restrictions, and a renaissance in the U.S. energy sector.

          <p>The UK government is reviving the Pensions Commission to tackle a looming crisis where future pensioners are projected to be worse off than today's retirees. New analysis from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) warns that people retiring in 2050 could be £800 a year poorer, as four in ten working-age adults are not saving enough. The commission will address stark disparities, noting that millions of self-employed workers and most low earners are not contributing to a private pension. It aims to build a national consensus on a strategy to boost retirement savings for all. (not investment advice)</p>

SpinQ, founded in 2018, develops and sells a range of quantum products, from small-scale educational computers to more powerful industrial-grade superconducting systems.
