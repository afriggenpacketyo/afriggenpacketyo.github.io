          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing heightened tensions following immigration sweeps, leading to protests against the Trump administration and ICE. The deployment of federal troops has escalated the situation, drawing criticism from California's governor who described it as a dictatorial move. ICE has increased enforcement actions, resulting in a record number of arrests, while local advocates claim families are being torn apart. The unrest has sparked looting and violence, with authorities responding with rubber bullets and tear gas, creating a volatile situation in the city, as well as a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the deployment of the National Guard.</p>

          <p>U.S. officials have outlined the rules of force for the National Guard and Marines deployed to Los Angeles amidst protests, emphasizing their role in protecting federal buildings and personnel. Troops are instructed to de-escalate situations and are not authorized to engage crowds unless necessary, with weapons carried but not loaded, and the use of rubber bullets or pepper spray prohibited. The Los Angeles Police Department expressed concerns about logistical challenges due to the federal military presence and urged continuous communication between agencies.

          <p>President Trump has authorized the deployment of 2,000 more National Guard troops to Los Angeles, prompting California Governor Gavin Newsom to file a lawsuit challenging the federalization of the state's National Guard. Newsom criticized the deployment as unnecessary and politically motivated, while the ACLU condemned the mobilization of Marines. Trump also suggested arresting Newsom for obstructing federal immigration enforcement actions, leading to further escalation of tensions between the state and federal government. The lawsuit argues that Trump's action violates the U.S. Constitution and exceeds his authority, citing the absence of an invasion or rebellion.</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of MPs has criticized the UK's statutory parental leave system as one of the worst in the developed world, citing fundamental flaws and outdated gender stereotypes. The report recommends increasing paternity pay and leave, highlighting the financial strain on new fathers and the complexity of shared parental leave. The report has been released on the eve of the world's first dad strike. The government said its forthcoming review would look at all current parental leave entitlements and is already in the process of ensuring dads no longer need to be employed for 26 weeks to be entitled to paternity leave.</p>

The lawsuit argues that the deployment is unwarranted and stokes fear, as local police have effectively managed the protests. Attorney General Rob Bonta asserts the president lacks the authority to deploy troops under the cited law, as there is no invasion or rebellion. The lawsuit also states that the law cited by the Trump administration explicitly requires orders to call up the National Guard to go through governors.</p>

The sludge, used as cheap fertilizer, may contain cancer-linked chemicals, microplastics, and other industrial pollutants. There is no routine testing for chemicals, including "forever chemicals", which have been developed over the last three decades and are getting into the sewage network from both from domestic and industrial users.
