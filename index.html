          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel faced a contentious Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where he was questioned about the investigation into the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Patel defended his decision to publicly release the suspect's photo against law enforcement recommendations, which he credited for the swift capture. He also testified that the FBI is investigating everyone in a Discord chat linked to the alleged shooter. Additionally, Patel addressed the Jeffrey Epstein case, blaming a former U.S. Attorney for the initial mishandling of the investigation and confirming Epstein was not an FBI informant, leading to heated exchanges with senators.</p>

This move could raise up to $908 million and reflects a strong market for tech and cybersecurity IPOs, following successful debuts by other companies. The planned Nasdaq debut, under the ticker "NTSK," comes amid a surge in major cybersecurity acquisitions, such as Google's purchase of Wiz and Palo Alto Networks' acquisition of CyberArk. The company, which specializes in cloud security, reported a net loss of $170 million for the first half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set for an unprecedented second state visit to the U.K., featuring a formal dinner at Windsor Castle hosted by King Charles III. The visit's timing is challenging for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who recently fired his U.S. ambassador, Peter Mandelson, over newly revealed ties to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This has resurfaced questions about Trump's own past association with Epstein. The visit also coincides with significant political divisions in Britain, highlighted by recent far-right demonstrations, creating a complex diplomatic landscape for the two leaders to navigate during their meetings.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of energy production costs reveals that renewables like onshore wind and solar are the most affordable forms of energy, according to the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) benchmark. While the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act provided significant subsidies for clean energy, the Trump administration is phasing them out while expanding tax breaks for fossil fuels and imposing tariffs that raise costs for projects reliant on imports. Despite these policy changes and the higher upfront capital costs, the lower operating expenses and free fuel source for renewables make them more cost-competitive than coal, natural gas, or nuclear power.

          <p>The 1979 disappearance of 6-year-old Etan Patz, a case that transformed national awareness of missing children, haunted investigators for decades. After years of focusing on suspect Jose Ramos, a breakthrough occurred in 2012 when a tip led police to Pedro Hernandez, a former corner store employee.

          <p>House GOP leaders have introduced a plan to prevent a government shutdown by funding federal agencies until November 21. The short-term continuing resolution maintains current spending levels and includes an additional $30 million for lawmaker security, a response to the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The bill faces a tight deadline of September 30 and potential opposition from some Republicans and Democrats, who are demanding extensions for Affordable Care Act subsidies. President Trump has urged Republicans to unite and pass the measure, which requires 60 votes to advance in the Senate, necessitating some Democratic support.</p>

          <p>A senior Labour MP stated that "red flags were missed or ignored" in an emergency parliamentary debate following the dismissal of Peter Mandelson as the UK's ambassador to the US. Mandelson was fired by Prime Minister Keir Starmer after emails revealed his supportive messages to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Critics in Parliament accused Starmer of poor judgment and called on him to apologize to Epstein's victims. The government deflected blame, stating the Cabinet Office conducted the due diligence and raised no concerns, highlighting a significant failure in the vetting process for the high-profile diplomatic appointment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key feature of reverse mortgages, particularly federally insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs), is the "6-month rule." This rule dictates that after the borrower dies or permanently leaves the home, their heirs have six months to repay the loan balance, typically by selling the property or refinancing. Lenders must issue a "Due and Payable" letter within 30 days of this qualifying event, starting the clock. While extensions are possible, this timeline emphasizes the need for homeowners with reverse mortgages to engage in careful estate planning and communicate clearly with their families to avoid a stressful deadline or potential foreclosure.</p>

          <p>According to a CNBC Fed Survey, 82% of economists and market strategists believe President Trump's actions are aimed at limiting or eliminating the Federal Reserve's independence. A majority of respondents predict this pressure will lead to negative economic outcomes, including weaker growth, higher inflation, and increased unemployment. Despite these concerns, the survey shows a near-unanimous expectation that the Fed will cut interest rates by a quarter point at its upcoming meeting. The perceived threat to the central bank's autonomy is now considered a significant risk to the economic expansion, alongside trade policy uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

The scheme, agreed upon by the two countries in July, allows the UK to return certain migrants in exchange for accepting vetted refugees who have not attempted to cross the Channel.

          <p>Recent Wall Street research provides a positive outlook on three major companies, reinforcing reasons for investor confidence. Truist raised its price target for Amazon, citing credit card data that suggests North American revenue is tracking ahead of estimates. Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo increased his price target for Goldman Sachs, highlighting strength in the capital markets business. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced a 10% dividend increase, which, combined with its earnings growth and share repurchase authorization, points to a strong total return profile for the software and cloud computing giant.

          <p>For the first time since it sank in 1916, artifacts have been recovered from the wreck of the Britannic, the sister ship of the Titanic. A deep-sea diving team retrieved items including the ship's bell, a navigation light, and first-class silver trays from the vessel, which lies nearly 400 feet deep in the Aegean Sea. Launched in 1914, the Britannic was serving as a hospital ship during World War I when it struck a mine and sank. The recovered artifacts are now undergoing conservation in Athens and will be featured in a new Museum of Underwater Antiquities.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, a number of individuals have faced professional consequences for their public comments about the event. A sports reporter, an MSNBC analyst, and a university employee are among those who have been fired, while a Secret Service agent was placed on leave. Legal experts note that private-sector employees have limited First Amendment protections and can be terminated for speech that an employer deems harmful to its reputation. These incidents highlight the significant career risks associated with commenting on politically charged and sensitive topics in the current climate.</p>

          <p>A public inquiry into the Southport attack, where Axel Rudakubana murdered three young girls at a dance studio, has revealed significant failures by multiple agencies to intervene despite numerous warning signs. The inquiry heard that the killer had a history of violence, including assaulting other children and being caught with knives, but his case was passed between police, social services, and counter-extremism programs without decisive action. A teacher's email from 2023 expressed frustration over the "frightening red tape" that prevented her from getting him help. The inquiry will focus on why no single agency took responsibility for the clear and escalating risk he posed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that President Trump's readiness to let TikTok be banned in the U.S. was the crucial factor that prompted China to agree to a deal framework. Bessent revealed that commercial terms had been in place for months but were stalled by China after Trump's tariff announcements. The President's willingness to prioritize national security over the deal itself "turned the tide" in negotiations. With a divestment deadline approaching, this hardline approach appears to have successfully pushed ByteDance and the Chinese government toward finalizing an agreement for the app's U.S. operations.</p>

          <p>The 1995 Ryder Cup at Oak Hill saw one of golf's greatest upsets, as Europe, led by captain Bernard Gallacher, defeated a favored American team on their home turf. Despite internal team selection controversies and trailing 9-7 heading into the final day's singles matches, the European squad mounted a stunning comeback. Key performances from players like Nick Faldo, who won a pivotal match on the 18th hole, and rookie Philip Walton, who secured the winning point, sealed the dramatic 14.5 to 13.5 victory. The win marked only the second time Europe had won the Ryder Cup in the United States.</p>

          <p>In an emotional speech at the reopening of a Munich synagogue, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz addressed the resurgence of Jewish life in Germany while acknowledging the persistent and rising threat of antisemitism. With his voice breaking, Merz spoke of his shame that Jewish institutions still require police protection and condemned the "new wave of antisemitism" visible in public spaces and online. He highlighted the challenges faced by the Jewish community, particularly since the October 7th Hamas attack, and emphasized the need for society to confront hatred, some of which he noted was imported by immigrants from countries where antisemitism is state doctrine.</p>

The Olympic and world silver medallist, who had complained of a hip issue after his heat, finished sixth in his semi-final. His exit, along with those of teammates Charlie Dobson and Sam Reardon, adds to a difficult start for the British team, which remains without a medal after four days of competition. The team has also seen world indoor pole vault champion Molly Caudery withdraw due to injury, increasing the pressure to perform in the remaining events.</p>

          <p>Lancashire police have dropped their investigation into former Conservative MP Mark Menzies, who was accused of misusing campaign funds to pay "bad people." The decision came after Menzies agreed to repay the money. The allegations stemmed from a late-night call in which Menzies claimed he was locked in a flat and needed thousands of pounds, with reports suggesting the funds were used to pay male sex workers. A separate inquiry by the parliamentary expenses watchdog into an alleged fraudulent bonus payment to an aide has also concluded the case was "not proven," officially closing both investigations into the former MP's conduct.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has initiated a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times and publisher Penguin Random House, accusing them of a coordinated effort to harm his reputation before the 2024 election. The lawsuit cites a series of articles and a book that Trump's attorneys claim contain falsehoods and amount to libel. The New York Times responded by stating the lawsuit lacks merit and is an intimidation tactic designed to stifle independent journalism and discourage reporting.
