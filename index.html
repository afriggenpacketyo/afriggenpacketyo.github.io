          <p>A federal jury acquitted Sean 'Diddy' Combs of the most severe charges he faced, including racketeering and sex trafficking, but found him guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. Following the seven-week trial, the hip-hop mogul reacted with prayer and relief as the verdict was read, which spared him a potential life sentence. However, the judge immediately denied his request for bail pending sentencing, where he faces a maximum of 10 years for each conviction.</p>

          <p>A new book argues that Apple made a strategic error by consolidating its operations so heavily in China, effectively becoming trapped by the authoritarian state. However, some analysts discussed at a think tank event counter this view, suggesting the tech giant likely had no better alternative to achieve its current scale and innovation. They argue that missing out on China's production ecosystem would have prevented Apple from becoming the company it is today, highlighting the complex and perhaps unavoidable nature of its strategic choices.</p>
