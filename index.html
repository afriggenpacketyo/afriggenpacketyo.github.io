          <p>A French court found Marine Le Pen guilty of embezzlement, though the sentencing and its political ramifications remain unclear.  The verdict also impacts other party members, and Le Pen's potential 2027 presidential candidacy is in jeopardy.  The court's decision might be seen as politically motivated by some, given Le Pen's far-right stance and growing electoral support.</p>
