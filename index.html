          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro, speaking at the UN General Assembly, has called for a "criminal process" against former US President Donald Trump. This demand arises from US missile strikes on alleged drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean, which Petro claims resulted in over a dozen deaths, some potentially Colombian citizens, and were described by UN experts as "extrajudicial executions." Trump had previously vowed to "blow [drug smugglers] out of existence." Petro argued that such actions warrant an investigation into US officials, including Trump, highlighting the contentious nature of international anti-drug operations and the complex legal and ethical considerations surrounding military engagements in sovereign or international waters. The incident underscores global concerns about unilateral military force.</p>

Major indices like Australia's ASX/S&P 200, Japan's Nikkei 225, and South Korea's Kospi registered losses, though South Korean defense stocks bucked the trend with gains linked to US support for Ukraine. The article also highlights the historic appointment of Anna Breman as New Zealand's central bank governor and the ongoing impact of Super Typhoon Ragasa on Hong Kong.

          <p>Alibaba Group Holding plans to significantly increase its capital expenditures on artificial intelligence infrastructure, surpassing its initial 380 billion yuan ($53 billion) commitment over the next three years. CEO Eddie Wu Yongming, also chairman of Alibaba Cloud, announced this at the Apsara Conference, aiming for Alibaba Cloud to become a global leader in full-stack AI services. Wu believes Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will usher in a new era, potentially automating 80% of existing jobs and empowering "super scientists" to tackle global challenges like healthcare and climate change. This move reflects a broader trend of increased AI investment by tech giants, including Nvidia's $100 billion pledge to OpenAI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democrat Adelita Grijalva has won a special election in Arizona's 7th Congressional District, successfully filling the congressional seat left vacant by her late father, Raul Grijalva. This victory significantly narrows the Republican Party's razor-thin majority in the US House of Representatives. Grijalva, who garnered support from progressive figures like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, campaigned against President Trump's policies and advocated for the release of Jeffrey Epstein's files. Her win in this heavily Democratic district, which she secured over Republican Daniel Butierez, shifts the House balance to 219 Republicans and 214 Democrats, with two seats still open.</p>

          <p>During President Trump's appearance at the UN General Assembly, an escalator abruptly halted, compelling him and the First Lady to ascend stairs, followed by a teleprompter malfunction during his address. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt publicly questioned the incidents, suggesting they might not be accidental and citing unconfirmed reports of UN staff joking about disruptions, calling for an investigation. Conversely, a UN spokesman indicated that a US delegation videographer might have inadvertently triggered the escalator's safety mechanism. The UN also clarified that the teleprompter was managed by the White House, creating a dispute over the responsibility for these technical glitches.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury found Ryan Routh guilty on all five charges, including attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, in connection with an attempt on Donald Trump's life in 2024. Routh, who represented himself, was arrested at Trump's golf course after aiming a rifle at a Secret Service agent. Following the verdict, Routh reportedly attempted to harm himself with a pen in court, highlighting the dramatic conclusion to the trial. This conviction, the second assassination attempt against Trump in 2024, sends a "clear message" against political violence, according to Attorney General Pam Bondi.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump returned to the United Nations rostrum, asserting a dramatically changed relationship with the world since his previous term. His speech, described as meandering and grievance-filled, belittled climate change, warned against immigration, and touted his role as peacemaker, despite escalating conflicts. Trump emphasized national sovereignty and a transactional approach, aligning with a Republican consensus that views global institutions as broken. He criticized allies, reiterated warnings against Palestinian state recognition, and notably shifted his stance on Ukraine, suggesting they could reclaim territory with European and NATO support, while the US would continue selling weapons to NATO.</p>

          <p>Greece's "Watergate" spyware scandal, involving the targeting of government ministers, military officers, judges, and journalists with Predator software, has seen four individuals appear in court on misdemeanor charges. Despite Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis calling it a scandal, no government officials have been charged, leading to accusations of a cover-up. The scandal revealed that many surveillance targets were simultaneously monitored by Greece's National Intelligence Service (EYP), which was under the Prime Minister's direct supervision. Critics argue the new law legalizing state security surveillance under strict conditions effectively prevents citizens from learning if they were previously targeted.</p>

          <p>Legendary pop star Lulu, 76, has openly revealed her decades-long struggle with alcoholism in her new memoir, "If You Only Knew." Now nearly 12 years sober, she sought help in 2013 after confiding in her family, leading to a six-week rehab stay and commitment to Alcoholics Anonymous. Lulu described herself as a "highly functioning alcoholic," even participating in "Strictly Come Dancing" while secretly drinking. She attributes her secretiveness to shame and a desire to maintain a "squeaky clean" image, and her childhood experiences with an alcoholic, abusive father. Sharing her story aims to break the generational pattern for her grandchildren.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults in the UK are finding themselves unable to move out of their parents' homes due to escalating living costs. Leoni Clancey's experience, where her savings were depleted by rental expenses, highlights this struggle. Research from the Skipton Group indicates that nine out of ten young adults living with parents would face housing costs consuming nearly half their income. This trend, with 4.9 million adults living at home in 2021, underscores a significant social and economic challenge. Experts call for more affordable housing and increased minimum wage to address this "lost opportunity" for young people. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The dismembered remains of a woman found along Oregon's Willamette River in 1946 are now believed to be those of Oak Grove Jane Doe, the state's oldest unidentified person case. The case, which went cold in the 1950s after critical evidence went missing, received national attention due to its grisly nature. The discovery of the remains under a headstone reading "Unknown Woman 1946" by the Oregon state police medical examiner's office has reignited hopes for identification. Advanced forensic testing is now underway, aiming to restore the victim's name and provide closure after nearly 80 years.</p>

Critics highlight the perceived hypocrisy, questioning how someone with a DUI conviction can direct such harsh policies while a paralegal was fired for throwing a sandwich.
