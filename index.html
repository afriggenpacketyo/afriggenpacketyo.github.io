        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to hold its policy rate steady at 0.5% for the second consecutive meeting, as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs cast a shadow over Japan's economic outlook. While Japan's inflation has remained above the BOJ's 2% target, providing room for rate hikes, the central bank acknowledges that trade tensions complicate these plans. The BOJ will continue to raise rates if economic and price forecasts are realized, but cautioned that drastic changes to tariff policies would affect the monetary policy outlook. The central bank expects growth to moderate due to global economic slowdown and declining domestic corporate profits, with inflation projected to range between 2-2.5% in fiscal year 2025.</p>

          <p>Seven months after Hurricane Helene devastated towns across the South, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is still leading cleanup efforts in western North Carolina, including Lake Lure. The hurricane caused record rainfall and historic flooding, leaving up to ten feet of debris in some areas of Lake Lure. The USACE has removed more than 5 million cubic yards of debris in western North Carolina, clearing roadways and hauling debris from homes and businesses. While the town had an emergency management plan, the power of Hurricane Helene was unexpected, and officials aim to remove all debris by July.</p>

The Wall Street Journal reported that Tesla's board began looking for a successor due to concerns about Musk's focus on his role in President Donald Trump's administration and Tesla's declining share price. Tesla chair Robyn Denholm stated the report was "absolutely false" and that the board has full confidence in Musk's ability to lead the company.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared a national emergency as rapidly spreading wildfires near Jerusalem threaten to reach the city. The fires have injured several people, prompting the military to deploy troops and resources to help control the blazes.

Fire chief Eyal Caspi stated that this is potentially the largest fire in Israel in a decade, with aircraft unable to assist due to weather conditions, and the foreign ministry has requested assistance from nearby countries.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the UK's strategy of appeasing Donald Trump and how it has not yielded the desired results in trade negotiations. Despite efforts to align with Trump's demands, the UK has been placed behind South Korea and Japan in trade talks. The article draws parallels to Columbia University's experience, where concessions to Trump did not guarantee the restoration of federal funding. The author suggests that belligerence may be more effective with Trump, as seen with tech companies and business leaders who have challenged his policies. The article questions whether Britain's attempts to humor Trump will ultimately succeed in changing his behavior.</p>

They cite the war in Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and operations against the Houthis in Yemen as examples of the demands of modern warfare.

          <p>In her first major address since leaving office, Kamala Harris criticized President Trump's policies, warning of a constitutional crisis if the courts and Congress fail to stand up to the president. She delivered her remarks in San Francisco at an event for Emerge, an organization that lifts up Democratic women running for office. Harris acknowledged her monthslong departure from public life and focused her speech on national matters. She saluted other Democrats who have been speaking out against Trump and said that the American people would have to serve as the ultimate check on executive power if the courts and Congress could not.</p>

          <p>South Korea's former President Yoon Suk Yeol is facing additional charges of abuse of authority, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. This indictment comes as Yoon is already on trial for leading an insurrection after his declaration of martial law in early December. The country's Constitutional Court stripped Yoon of all power and privileges in April and upheld a parliamentary motion to impeach him. The additional charge was announced a day after investigators raided Yoon's private residence in Seoul, part of a probe into bribery allegations involving Yoon's wife.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has revised its economic and inflation projections downward for the current fiscal year, while maintaining its benchmark interest rate, due to concerns about the potential impact of U.S. tariffs on the Japanese economy. The central bank anticipates a decline in domestic corporate profits and a slowdown in overseas economies due to trade frictions. The BOJ now projects the Japanese economy to grow by 0.5 percent in the current fiscal year, with core consumer prices expected to rise by 2.2 percent. Despite the revisions, the BOJ remains committed to raising interest rates if the economy and prices align with its expectations.</p>

Speaking to an audience of Democrats in San Francisco, the former vice-president struck a defiant posture as she praised the leaders and institutions pushing back against Trump and his aggressive agenda. She accused Trump of deliberately sowing fear and chaos to consolidate his own executive power, in a “high velocity” start to his presidency that hurled the country toward a constitutional crisis.</p>

          <p>European auto giants are reporting a sharp drop in first-quarter profit and are suspending or cutting full-year financial guidance, attributing the industry pain partially to U.S. President Donald Trump's trade tariffs. The corporate updates followed Trump's imposition of a 25% tariff on automotive imports into the U.S. in early April. Stellantis, Mercedes, Volvo Cars, and Porsche are among the automakers affected, with companies citing tariff-related uncertainties and volatility. While Trump has sought to water down these levies, analysts warn that the fast-changing nature of Trump's trade tariffs will likely keep long-term corporate investment decisions at bay.</p>

The extent of the mosquito population is being understood through a citizen science project, Mosquito Scotland. Public reports of nuisance biting led to the discovery that many areas were swarming with mosquitoes. Researchers have found the insects in woodland areas and even in urban settings like Glasgow, where larvae were found in stagnant water. Public reporting has guided the placement of traps, which can catch over 1,000 mosquitoes in just two days.</p>
