          <p>U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli of California has initiated "Operation Guardian Angel," a task force comprising ICE, HSI, DEA, FBI, ATF, and Border Patrol agents, to identify and charge arrested undocumented immigrants with felony illegal re-entry. This program aims to counteract sanctuary policies that hinder ICE's ability to detain and deport criminal undocumented immigrants. Essayli intends to issue up to 50 warrants a week in his jurisdiction, which includes Los Angeles, making California a "testing ground" for other sanctuary jurisdictions. He emphasized that local authorities must comply with federal warrants, and felony re-entry prosecution, which was largely not pursued during the Biden administration, is now a priority. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request to lift a lower court's injunction, allowing them to end the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for approximately 350,000 Venezuelan migrants while legal proceedings continue. The TPS program, established in 1990, provides temporary immigration protections to migrants from countries facing wars, natural disasters, or other extraordinary conditions. The Biden administration had previously extended the designation, but Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem vacated the extension, citing that continuing the program was "contrary to the national interest." Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, and legal challenges continue regarding the termination. </p>

          <p>Wendy McMahon, President of CBS News, resigned due to disagreements with the company's direction, particularly concerning settlement negotiations with President Trump over a $20 billion lawsuit against "60 Minutes." The lawsuit stems from differing excerpts of a Kamala Harris interview aired on "60 Minutes" and "Face the Nation." McMahon and veteran "60 Minutes" executive producer Bill Owens, who also resigned, reportedly opposed settling with Trump, believing it would compromise journalistic independence. Paramount Global executives, influenced by Shari Redstone's concerns about CBS's coverage of Israel, are reportedly seeking to resolve the lawsuit before a potential sale to Skydance Media. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) were unlawful and represented a "gross usurpation of power." The judge found that the administration's takeover, which involved DOGE officials assisted by law enforcement, violated the statute establishing USIP and exceeded presidential authorities. The ruling declares the removal of USIP's president, replacement by DOGE officials, termination of staff, and transfer of property to the General Services Administration as null and void. The administration is likely to appeal the ruling. </p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an advanced stage of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones, prompting questions about his condition and prior screenings. The cancer is categorized as aggressive, with a Gleason score of 9. Biden did not undergo prostate cancer screening during his last medical checkup in February 2024, as screenings are not routinely recommended for men 70 or older. His diagnosis came after he saw a doctor due to urinary symptoms, which led to the discovery of a nodule in the prostate. Treatment will aim to control the cancer, slow its progression, and preserve quality of life. </p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields increased after Moody's downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating, with the 30-year Treasury yield briefly topping 5%.

Investors initially reacted with concern, but bond buying later drove yields lower. The Moody's downgrade aligns with other major credit rating agencies that have already given the U.S. their second-highest rating. </p>

          <p>Spain has ordered Airbnb to block over 65,000 holiday rental listings on its platform for violating rules, according to the Consumer Rights Ministry. Many listings did not include their license number or specify whether the owner was an individual or a company. This action is part of Spain's efforts to address a housing affordability crisis, with rising rental costs driven by short-term rentals. Airbnb plans to appeal the decision, arguing that the ministry lacks the authority to rule on short-term rentals. </p>

Success is not guaranteed for House Speaker Mike Johnson, as he is navigating negotiations with fiscal conservatives and coastal moderates within his caucus to secure enough votes within his razor-thin majority.

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to remove protections from nearly 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants with Temporary Protected Status (TPS). The court's brief order was unsigned and gave no reasons, though Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson noted her dissent. The justices clarified they would preserve individual immigrants' ability to bring legal challenges if the government tried to cancel their work permits or remove them from the country. The case began when Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem terminated an 18-month extension of TPS granted by the Biden administration, with the plaintiffs arguing the move violated administrative procedures and was influenced by racial bias. </p>

The AWACS, known for its large rotating radar dish, coordinates air battles and detects enemy aircraft and missiles.
