        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official figures indicate that UK companies are reducing hiring and not replacing departing employees, resulting in a decrease in job vacancies. The number of available jobs decreased by 63,000 between March and May, while the unemployment rate slightly increased. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), there is a weakening in the labor market, with a noticeable decrease in the number of people on payrolls. This trend coincides with an increase in National Insurance Contributions paid by employers and a rise in the minimum wage in April. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Temu and Shein are increasingly focusing on European markets due to unfavorable trade policies in the U.S., where consumer spending on these platforms has declined.

          <p>Following immigration enforcement operations in Los Angeles, protests erupted, leading to clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement, prompting President Trump to deploy the National Guard.

LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell emphasized the department's compliance with the California Values Act, restricting assistance to federal immigration enforcement, while Democratic U.S. Rep. Nanette Barragán stated that ICE enforcement operations are expected daily for the next 30 days. Governor Newsom criticized Trump's deployment as inflammatory and accused the president of illegally activating the National Guard, confirming plans to sue the administration.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' ex-girlfriend, testifying under the pseudonym "Jane," provided testimony in his federal trial for sexual assault, alleging instances of abuse and coercion during their relationship. Legal experts suggest her testimony could powerfully corroborate Cassie Ventura's account if the jury finds their experiences similar, especially with the addition of voice memos as evidence. Jane described feeling coerced into hotel nights with Diddy, who allegedly continues to pay for her legal fees and rent, and detailed violent behavior, including a chokehold and physical attacks, with video evidence presented in court. While some experts note potential weaknesses in the prosecution's case due to the focus on emotional manipulation, others emphasize the impact of evidence suggesting Combs blackmailed women into complying with his sexual demands. </p>

          <p>Criminal gangs are exploiting loopholes in European regulations to smuggle ketamine, often swapping it for salt during transit across multiple borders. Ketamine is legally regulated as a medicine in some countries, making it easier to divert into illicit markets. This has led to a surge in ketamine consumption, particularly in the UK, where it has been linked to several deaths and can cause severe health issues. Law enforcement agencies are struggling to combat this due to the dual classification of ketamine as both a legitimate anesthetic and an illegal recreational drug, requiring greater international cooperation to address the problem.</p>

The yacht, carrying 12 people attempting to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, was seized by Israeli forces and towed to Ashdod. Israel has dismissed the effort as a "selfie yacht" and stated that those refusing to sign deportation documents will face judicial authorities. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which operated the vessel, reported that the campaigners are being processed and transferred into Israeli custody, with potential flights out of Tel Aviv soon.</p>

          <p>Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit in bankruptcy court to prevent the sale of personal genetic data by 23andMe without customer consent. The lawsuit argues that biological samples, DNA data, and medical records are too sensitive to be sold without explicit, informed consent. This action comes as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals seeks court approval to acquire the struggling firm for $256 million, raising concerns about the safety and privacy of customer data following 23andMe's bankruptcy filing and staff layoffs. A court-appointed ombudsman is reviewing the proposed sale's impact on consumer privacy.</p>

Newsom has announced plans to sue the Trump administration for illegally mobilizing the National Guard without state consent.

Data from the CDC shows a massive reduction in fatal overdose risk among Gen Z, with ages 20 to 29 experiencing a 47% decrease in overdose deaths. Experts attribute this trend to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, weaker fentanyl potency, increased access to addiction healthcare, and a shift towards less risky drug and alcohol use among teens. However, some clusters of young people, particularly those born between 2005 and 2011, have seen a slight increase in deaths, indicating the need for further research and targeted interventions.

          <p>The Smithsonian Institution has asserted its independence by stating that it, not the President, controls personnel decisions, including the appointment and dismissal of the National Portrait Gallery director. This statement is seen as a direct challenge to President Trump's announcement that he was firing the director. The Smithsonian emphasized that the Board of Regents and the Secretary are responsible for the governance and management of the institution, underscoring its commitment to remaining a nonpartisan entity.</p>
