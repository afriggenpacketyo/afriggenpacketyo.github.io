            <p>In response to the Trump administration's increased tariffs, China has announced a retaliatory increase, raising tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%. The Chinese government stated that further tariff escalations from the U.S. would be disregarded, arguing that at current rates, American goods are no longer economically viable in the Chinese market. They emphasized that China will resolutely counter any actions that substantially harm its interests and will continue to defend the multilateral trading system. Goldman Sachs has cut its China GDP forecast to 4% given the drag from U.S. trade tensions and slower global growth.</p>

            <p>Senator Jim Justice's English bulldog, Babydog, made an appearance before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, drawing attention from lawmakers and social media. Justice discussed his priorities for America’s energy sector, including support for President Donald Trump’s recent executive order aimed at bolstering domestic energy production. Justice also warned that America faces serious decisions within the next 18 months if energy production isn’t scaled to meet demand, suggesting a potential doubling of electricity demand. Babydog has previously appeared at Senate Agriculture Committee hearings and remains a constant presence in the halls of Congress.</p>

            <p>Chinese brands, exemplified by electric vehicle giant BYD, are increasingly focusing on inspiring global audiences rather than just impressing them with scale and speed. BYD, which recently surpassed Tesla in global sales, is evolving into a brand with a clear lifestyle focus, using globally appealing names and shifting its marketing from technical specs to emotional experiences. This shift signifies a move beyond exporting products to exporting ideas and identities that resonate emotionally with consumers beyond China's borders. Success will be measured not only in sales but in the narratives being told and the connections they spark.</p>

The law aims to reduce gun violence and accidents while protecting Second Amendment rights.

The measure, effective August 2026, was a concession from a proposed flat ban on the sale of most semiautomatics.</p>

            <p>A new drug, capivasertib, has been approved for use on the NHS in England to treat advanced breast cancer. The drug has been shown to slow the progression of the disease and shrink tumors in some patients. Clinical trials demonstrated that when combined with hormone therapy, the drug doubled the time it took for the cancer to grow, from 3.6 months to 7.3 months. The drug is suitable for those with certain gene mutations that affect up to half of people with hormone receptor positive secondary breast cancer.</p>

            <p>Morgan Stanley warns that the US-China trade war may undermine overseas demand for Chinese goods and negatively impact corporate earnings. The analysts expect the impact on corporate earnings to be more visible from the second quarter of 2025. They see downward risk to their base case earnings growth outlook for 2025, despite improved quarterly results from the fourth quarter. Stocks in mainland China and Hong Kong have suffered following the imposition of reciprocal tariffs by the US and China.</p>

            <p>Economists believe China is unlikely to aggressively devalue its yuan to offset the impact of U.S. tariffs due to concerns about financial market instability and capital outflows. Analysts expect the central bank to engineer an orderly and gradual depreciation instead. A rapid outflow of capital from the country may complicate policymakers' jobs even further. There are also limits to the benefits a weaker yuan could unlock now that the U.S. tariff rate on Chinese imports currently stands at 145%. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Donald Trump’s trade tariffs have raised concerns that climate action could be a casualty of the trade war. Fears of a global recession have tanked oil and gas prices, making it cheaper to pollute and harder to justify clean energy investments. Trump’s tariffs against China, the largest manufacturer of clean energy technologies, threaten to throttle green investment in the US. However, some argue that the global energy transition is unstoppable, even with Trump's policies.</p>

Salling Group, a Danish grocery chain, has labeled European-owned brands to help shoppers identify them. Travelers are also increasingly avoiding trips to the U.S. amid political tensions. Trump last week slapped 20% duties on all imports from Europe as part of wider reciprocal tariffs against more than 180 countries. The move, which sparked days of market turmoil, was later temporarily paused, but is nevertheless expected to upend global supply chains and consumer spending habits worldwide.</p>
