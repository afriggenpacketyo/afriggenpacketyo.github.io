          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence received the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for his role in certifying the 2020 election results despite pressure from Donald Trump and his supporters. The JFK Library Foundation praised Pence for prioritizing the constitutional transfer of power during the January 6th Congressional session, targeted by rioters. Pence resisted calls to overturn electoral votes cast for Joe Biden, even as Trump publicly criticized him and some rioters chanted threats against him. The award recognizes Pence's principled stand, reminiscent of the senators profiled in Kennedy's book, 'Profiles in Courage,' and acknowledges the political isolation he has faced since leaving office. Pence expressed feeling deeply humbled and honored upon receiving the award.</p>

          <p>The mayor of Teuchitl√°n, Mexico, Jos√© Murgu√≠a Santiago, was arrested as part of an investigation into a suspected drug cartel training camp where human bones and clothing were discovered. The probe focuses on potential omissions or complicity of authorities with the Jalisco New Generation cartel, known for its violence and rapid expansion. The "ranch of horror" in Teuchitl√°n was initially discovered in September 2024, but a subsequent search by relatives of missing persons revealed more remains, raising concerns about the thoroughness of the initial investigation. The cartel allegedly used the ranch to train recruits, torturing and killing those who refused to cooperate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's approach to executive power, arguing it goes beyond traditional conservative legal theories and draws from radical right-wing thinkers like Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss. These philosophers, critical of liberalism, advocate for a strong executive capable of decisive action, even in emergency situations. The article suggests Trump's administration, influenced by figures like Russell Vought, seeks to consolidate presidential power by dismantling the administrative state and challenging the independence of executive branch employees. The author warns this expansive view of executive authority risks transforming the American presidency into a dictatorial office that disregards the separation of powers and operates under a perpetual state of emergency, undermining liberal democracy.</p>

          <p>Rodney Hinton Jr. has been charged with aggravated murder after allegedly hitting and killing a sheriff's deputy with a car, a day after his 18-year-old son, Ryan Hinton, was fatally shot by police in Cincinnati. Prosecutors allege the father deliberately accelerated his car toward the deputy, who was directing traffic outside the University of Cincinnati graduation. The incident occurred hours after Mr. Hinton and his family viewed police footage of his son's shooting, which left him understandably distraught, according to his lawyers. Police claim Ryan Hinton brandished a gun at officers during a stolen vehicle investigation, justifying the shooting, though the footage is blurry.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes Canelo √Ålvarez's recent performance against William Scull and questions the potential entertainment value of his upcoming fight against Terence Crawford. Experts and fans criticized √Ålvarez's fight with Scull for being uneventful, with Scull focused on survival rather than engaging in a competitive match. Crawford, despite being a highly skilled boxer, will be moving up two weight divisions to fight √Ålvarez, leading to concerns that the fight will be unbalanced due to the size difference. The article draws parallels to previous fights where √Ålvarez faced opponents with a significant size disadvantage, suggesting that Crawford may need to adjust his style to avoid a similar outcome.</p>

          <p>President Trump clarified his stance on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, stating he will not fire him before his term ends in May 2026, despite previously criticizing Powell for not lowering interest rates. Trump claimed Powell "doesn't like me" and is a "total stiff," but acknowledged he will be able to appoint a new chair in a short period of time. This statement comes after repeated calls from Trump for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, which he believes would benefit the economy.</p>

          <p>This article explores the ongoing challenges of California's high-speed rail project, highlighting delays, cost overruns, and the impact on landowners in the Central Valley. Despite voter approval in 2008, no track has been laid, and initial cost estimates have tripled, leading to reduced ambitions of connecting Bakersfield and Merced by 2033. The article focuses on the experiences of farmers and landowners who have been affected by eminent domain, disputing claims that they are to blame for the project's delays. The author suggests that a more sensible route along Interstate 5 and a focus on building from end points could have been more effective.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has begun calling up tens of thousands of reservists to "intensify and expand" its operations in Gaza, aiming to return hostages and defeat Hamas militants. Critics argue the offensive has not secured hostage releases and question Netanyahu's objectives. The plan involves operating in new areas and destroying infrastructure, while international negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release have failed. Aid agencies report acute shortages of food, water, and medicine, leading to accusations of starvation as a war crime. The expanded offensive raises concerns about reservists, hostage families, and Netanyahu's intentions.</p>
