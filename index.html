          <p>A new food aid system in Gaza, designed to bypass the United Nations and described as neutral, was conceived and largely developed by Israelis with the aim of undermining Hamas. Foreign contractors, including a security group run by a former C.I.A. officer, will manage the distribution, replacing established aid agencies. Israeli officials claim the plan will prevent aid from falling into the wrong hands, but the UN warns it could restrict aid to limited areas and endanger civilians. The project's origins trace back to private meetings among Israeli officials and business people seeking a strategy for Gaza's future.</p>
