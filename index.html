          <p>A growing number of major Jewish American organizations, including some that traditionally offer staunch support for Israel, are publicly urging for more humanitarian aid to be allowed into Gaza. Citing warnings of famine and a worsening humanitarian crisis, groups like the American Jewish Committee and the Reform movement have issued statements expressing deep concern for Palestinian civilians. This shift reflects broadening discomfort within the community over the civilian toll of the war, moving beyond left-wing activist circles. The calls for action align with recent polls showing declining support for Israel's military operations among the American public, particularly younger generations.</p>

          <p>Baristas at four Blue Bottle coffee shops in the San Francisco Bay Area have voted decisively to unionize, joining a growing movement of cafe organizing across the United States. The workers, who will be represented by the Blue Bottle Independent Union, are seeking higher wages to cope with the high cost of living, as well as improved benefits and greater transparency from the company. This victory for the independent union follows its first success in Boston and adds to the wave of unionization efforts seen at other chains like Starbucks. The company, owned by Nestlé, has stated that it respects the workers' right to representation.</p>

          <p>Businesses in Southern California's 'Little India' are bracing for the impact of a new 25% tariff on Indian goods, a move that is forcing local grocers and retailers to raise prices for consumers. Owners express anxiety about their ability to absorb the costs, with some already seeing a slowdown in customer traffic amid broader economic and immigration-related fears. The tariffs affect a wide range of products, including food, jewelry, and textiles, which are central to the cultural and economic life of the Indian American community. This article highlights how international trade policy is creating direct financial pressure on small, family-run businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion column pushes back against recent comments and sentiment questioning the legitimacy of the Los Angeles Lakers' 2020 NBA championship, won inside the pandemic-era "Bubble." The author argues that dismissing the title is a form of jealousy and disrespect, ignoring the immense courage and mental fortitude required for players to compete while isolated during a global health crisis. The article points out that the unique challenges, including daily testing and separation from family, made the victory more, not less, impressive. It concludes that the win should be honored with an exclamation point for its resilience, not an asterisk for its circumstances.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the disappearance of a cherished Los Angeles street vendor, known for selling watermelon and coconuts, following a ramp-up in immigration enforcement activities. The author expresses personal concern and anxiety after the vendor, Ivan, vanishes from his usual corner, highlighting the broader climate of fear affecting immigrant communities. After weeks of silence, the vendor confirms he was lying low due to the heavy presence of immigration agents, a situation the author finds absurd for someone simply trying to earn a living. The story personalizes the impact of immigration policy, portraying the vendor's eventual return as a small but significant moment of relief for the community.</p>

          <p>A California man in desperate need of a kidney transplant discovered an extraordinarily rare match in his own wife, Mirna, with whom he shares four of twelve genetic markers. Jim Irish, 66, faced declining kidney function and a cancer diagnosis, making the need for a transplant urgent and the odds of finding a donor slim. His wife immediately volunteered, and against 1-in-100,000 odds, she was confirmed as a compatible donor, a development the couple sees as a blessing. After overcoming several health hurdles, the couple is now scheduled for the transplant surgery, a profound test of their wedding vows to support each other in sickness and in health.</p>

          <p>Colombia's former President Álvaro Uribe has been sentenced to 12 years of house arrest for witness tampering and bribery, marking the first time a Colombian head of state has been convicted in a criminal trial. The court found him guilty of paying jailed paramilitaries to retract testimony linking him to the creation of right-wing militia groups during the country's civil war. Uribe, who denies the charges and plans to appeal, is also barred from public office for over eight years. The verdict has been hailed by human rights groups as a landmark moment for accountability in a nation long plagued by impunity.</p>

Ruben was arrested as part of a police investigation into the events that occurred between July 25 and July 29. He has been remanded in custody and is scheduled to appear in crown court later in August, while the police watchdog investigates the force's handling of the incident.</p>

          <p>Syria is set to hold its first parliamentary elections in mid-September since the ousting of the Assad regime, a moment seen as historic but fraught with challenges. The new 210-member parliament will serve for a three-year transitional period, but concerns remain over the electoral process and the influence of interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, who will appoint 70 members directly. Political experts note that building trust among Syria's diverse ethnic and religious groups, especially after recent violence, will be crucial for the election's legitimacy. The success of this transition hinges on whether the new government can demonstrate genuine inclusivity and representation for all Syrians.</p>

          <p>Police in several German states are increasing their use of Gotham, a powerful surveillance software from US tech company Palantir, sparking major privacy concerns among civil rights advocates. The software uses AI to rapidly analyze vast amounts of data, creating comprehensive profiles of individuals, but critics argue it ensnares innocent people and violates constitutional rights to privacy. The Society for Civil Rights has filed a constitutional complaint, arguing the technology enables mass analysis of data without specific cause.

Warner noted that Root has yet to score a century in Australia and is often challenged by bowler Josh Hazlewood, humorously advising him to "take the surfboard off his front leg." Warner, who retired from international cricket last year, also remarked on facing former rival James Anderson, noting the white-ball format of The Hundred will be a different challenge.

While second-quarter GDP showed robust growth, it followed a contraction in the first quarter, and key indicators like private investment have fallen sharply. The administration's unpredictable tariff strategy has caused wild swings in trade, with imports surging and then plunging. A significant slowdown in job creation, revealed in the latest employment report, has further complicated the picture, leading policymakers to rethink their assumptions about the economy's health.

It features insights from social psychologist Erica Boothby and behavioral scientist Xuan Zhao, who explain the science behind this reaction.

Ultimately, the comic makes a case for learning to graciously accept kind remarks from others.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes a growing trend in international diplomacy where world leaders are increasingly using praise and flattery to engage with President Trump, a shift from the more skeptical approach of his first term. Examples include the UK Prime Minister highlighting the 'unprecedented' nature of a state visit invitation and the Israeli Prime Minister nominating Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize. Analysts suggest this strategy is a pragmatic recognition that Trump is the sole decider on key issues like trade and security, and appealing to his desire to be seen as a winner is effective. This approach has yielded results, such as increased NATO defense spending commitments.</p>

The club recently rejected a £110m bid from Liverpool for the 25-year-old Swedish international, whom they value closer to £150m. Isak was left out of the team's pre-season tour due to a minor injury and has been training alone at his former club, a development Howe learned about through the media. Howe expressed his wish to see Isak in a Newcastle shirt again but acknowledged he is removed from the dealings being handled back in England.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, just hours after the agency released weaker-than-expected jobs data for July. On social media, the president claimed without evidence that the figures were 'rigged,' a move that sent stock markets plunging and drew accusations of politicizing vital economic data. The jobs report showed far fewer jobs were created than forecast and included significant downward revisions for previous months, fueling concerns about the impact of the administration's tariff policies. Critics condemned the firing as a tactic used in authoritarian countries to suppress unfavorable information. (not investment advice)</p>

The infant was found abandoned but safe in a car seat after Drummond allegedly dropped her off and alerted people to her presence, an act officials described as a sign of 'compassion' amidst the violence. Drummond, who has a prior criminal record and was out on bond for other charges, is considered armed and dangerous.

          <p>A Chinese-led research team has uncovered the ancient genetic origins of the potato, revealing that it evolved from a hybridization event that occurred approximately nine million years ago. By conducting a 'DNA paternity test' on various potato species, scientists found that an ancestor of the modern tomato crossbred with a tuberless, potato-like plant group. This ancient fusion was the key driver for the development of tubers, the starchy, edible part that has made the potato a global staple food. The findings, published in the journal Cell, shed new light on the evolutionary history of one of the world's most important crops.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a temporary restraining order that blocks federal agents from conducting indiscriminate immigration stops in Southern California. The 9th Circuit panel affirmed a lower court's ruling that found there was a 'mountain of evidence' that enforcement tactics were unconstitutional, often based on factors like race or language. The court rejected the government's argument that the injunction hindered its operations, stating that if agents were already following the law, they would not be harmed by an order preventing unconstitutional stops. This decision is a significant setback for the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement strategy in the region.</p>

While the UK Foreign Office currently deems it safe to travel to these areas, the situation can change rapidly. This article explains that standard travel insurance should cover cancellations or curtailments if official advice changes to 'do not travel.' However, if travelers decide to cancel on their own due to unease, they likely won't be covered unless they purchased specific natural catastrophe add-ons. The key advice is to communicate directly with airlines, hotels, and insurers to understand bespoke options.</p>
