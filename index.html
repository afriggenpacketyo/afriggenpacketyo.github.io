          <h2>Supreme Court Sides Against Trump Administration in Alien Enemies Act Case</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 18:15:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court ruled 7-2 against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan nationals, citing insufficient time and resources for detainees to challenge their deportations. The court barred the removal of the men, alleged to be members of the Tren de Aragua gang, pending a new decision from a lower federal appellate court, but noted the government could pursue removal under other lawful authorities. President Trump criticized the ruling, while dissenting Justices Alito and Thomas questioned the detainees' imminent danger of removal. The case returns to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to determine the extent of notice required for those targeted for removal under the AEA.</p>

          <p>Moody's has downgraded the US credit rating to 'Aa1' from 'Aaa', citing a failure by successive administrations to address growing federal debt and interest costs over the past decade. This action signifies the loss of the US's last triple-A credit score from a major ratings firm. The downgrade reflects concerns about the US's ability to manage its financial health and repay its debts, as deficits continue to balloon. Moody's had warned of this possibility back in 2023, and other agencies like Fitch and S&P Global Ratings had already downgraded the US in previous years.</p>

          <p>A brain-dead pregnant woman in Georgia is being kept on life support to allow her fetus to develop, a decision her family attributes to the state's restrictive abortion law. The hospital believes the law, which bans abortion after cardiac activity is detected, mandates this course of action. The family is distressed that they cannot decide whether to remove life support. The Georgia Attorney General's office stated that the law does not require keeping a brain-dead woman on life support, raising ethical and legal questions about fetal rights versus the rights of the deceased. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" has stalled in the House of Representatives due to disagreements among Republicans regarding the extent of budget cuts. Some conservative congressmen are demanding steeper cuts to avoid increasing the national debt, while others oppose cuts to Medicaid, a healthcare program for lower-income Americans. The bill also faces contention over state and local tax deductions, with lawmakers from high-tax states arguing the proposed cap is insufficient. Trump has urged Republicans to resolve their differences and pass the bill, but internal divisions persist.</p>

          <p>Eric Council Jr. of Alabama was sentenced to 14 months in prison for his role in the January 2024 hack of the Securities and Exchange Commission's X account, which briefly inflated Bitcoin's price. Council executed a SIM swap attack to gain control of a phone number linked to the SEC's account. Prosecutors highlighted a video where Council downplayed his culpability, blaming the SEC's cybersecurity practices. Council's defense argued for a shorter sentence, citing his lack of prior criminal history and marijuana use for mental health struggles.</p>

Surveillance footage showed the men greeting Barrientos before the shooting, and an FBI agent was on the phone with Barrientos when he was shot.</p>

The agency pointed to political gridlock and the failure to address long-term financial challenges like Social Security and Medicare underfunding.
