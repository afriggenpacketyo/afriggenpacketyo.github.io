            <p>A unanimous Supreme Court ruling defined 'woman' as biological sex, leading to widespread reactions and potential policy revisions across Britain. News outlets highlight the ruling's implications for single-sex spaces like NHS wards and sports. While some celebrate the victory for women's rights and common sense, others express concern for transgender rights. The ruling prompts organizations to revisit their equality policies, potentially causing chaos and intensifying the fight for trans rights, as campaigners urge calm. Optimism score: 60</p>

            <p>Dr. Kevin Hall, a top NIH researcher on ultra-processed foods, resigned after alleging censorship by aides to HHS Secretary Robert F.

HHS denies the allegations, stating that NIH scientists continue to conduct interviews and that Hall's claims are a distortion of facts.

            <p>Instead of focusing solely on tariffs, China is now employing non-tariff measures targeting the U.S. services sector and specific American companies. These measures include tightening export controls on rare-earth minerals, initiating antitrust probes into U.S. firms like DuPont and Google, and restricting Chinese airlines from taking deliveries of Boeing jets. This strategic shift signals Beijing's intent to retaliate against Washington on multiple fronts.
