        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Car buyers are rushing to dealerships to capitalize on federal tax credits for electric vehicles before they expire at the end of September. The credits, part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, are being phased out by new legislation, leading to record EV sales in August. Automotive industry data shows a significant increase in demand for both new and used EVs as consumers and dealers look to benefit from the financial incentives. While sales are expected to remain high through September, there is concern among dealers about a potential drop-off once the credits are no longer available.</p>

          <p>In a notable shift from his previous stance, President Trump stated in a social media post that he believes Ukraine is now in a position to win back all of its territory from Russia. He cited Russia's economic troubles and weakening military appearance as key factors for his change in perspective. The same live update report also covered Senate Democrats launching a probe into White House border czar Tom Homan over alleged corruption. Additionally, it noted discussions between Trump and the European Commission president about accelerating Europe's move away from Russian energy sources.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has strongly refuted an NBC News report claiming that ICE agents used a 5-year-old autistic girl as "bait" to arrest her undocumented father. A DHS official called the allegation a "disgusting smear," stating that the father, who had prior arrests for domestic abuse, abandoned his child in a car while fleeing from officers. According to the official's account, agents rescued the child and called local police to report the abandonment. The father was apprehended two days after the initial incident.</p>

          <p>Disney has announced upcoming price hikes for its various streaming packages, including the ad-supported and premium tiers of Disney+ and Hulu. The monthly cost for most plans will increase by two to three dollars beginning in late October.

Some viewers had called for boycotts of Disney's services in response to the network's actions.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 15:55:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the controversy ignited by President Trump's emphatic warnings for pregnant women and children to avoid acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, due to a supposed link to autism. It delves into the scientific background, noting that while some studies suggest an association, they do not prove causation, and better-controlled research has found no such link. Medical groups have pushed back against the president's claims, highlighting that untreated fever and pain during pregnancy pose known, significant risks to both mother and fetus, and acetaminophen remains one of the few safe options available.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly costs for homeowners to borrow against their home's equity have slightly decreased. The article breaks down the current monthly payments for a $40,000 home equity loan over 10- and 15-year terms, comparing them to costs from earlier in the year to illustrate the savings. It serves as a guide for homeowners considering this type of loan, explaining the stability of fixed-rate payments and contrasting them with the variable rates of a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC).

          <p>A BBC analysis characterizes President Trump's speech at the United Nations as a clear and raw exposition of his nationalist ideology. During the address, Trump criticized the UN's effectiveness, attacked European allies over their immigration and green energy policies, and promoted his own record on ending wars. The article notes that his claims were met largely with silence from the audience of world leaders, a shift from the laughter his speeches drew in previous years. This reaction suggests a world that has become accustomed to, though not necessarily accepting of, his distinct worldview.</p>

          <p>President Trump has called off a planned meeting with top Democratic congressional leaders, significantly raising the probability of a federal government shutdown. The negotiations were intended to find a compromise on a funding deal before the September 30 deadline. A key point of contention is the Democratic insistence on including an extension for enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits in any agreement. In a social media post, Trump attributed the cancellation to what he termed the "unserious and ridiculous demands" from Democrats, placing the responsibility for negotiations back on them.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic argues that threats by FCC Chair Brendan Carr to revoke broadcast licenses over the Jimmy Kimmel controversy are largely unenforceable due to First Amendment protections. The article suggests the real power Carr wields is regulatory, particularly over media company mergers and acquisitions. This indirect pressure may be the true reason why major station owners like Nexstar and Sinclair preempted Kimmel's show, as they have business before the FCC and an incentive to remain in the chairman's good graces. This creates a coercive environment without direct censorship.</p>

          <p>A Long Island judge has ruled that Rex Heuermann, the accused Gilgo Beach serial killer, will face a single trial for all seven murders he is charged with. The defense had argued for the cases to be split, citing disparities in the evidence across the different alleged killings, but the motion was denied. The judge also rejected a second defense challenge to the admissibility of advanced nuclear DNA evidence used in the investigation. Due to these motions and new charges, the trial has been delayed, with a new deadline for pretrial motions set for January 2026.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball's competition committee has officially approved the implementation of an Automated Ball/Strike (ABS) System for the 2026 season. The technology, often called "robot umpires," will not replace human umpires but will be used as a challenge system. Each team will be allowed two challenges per game to contest ball and strike calls, with the ABS making the final determination. The system, which has been tested extensively in the minor leagues since 2019, is intended to increase the accuracy of crucial calls.</p>

The potential deal is viewed as a key component of the broader trade discussions between the U.S. and China. President Trump has frequently promoted such purchases as a way for other nations to reduce their trade deficits with the United States. If finalized, this would represent the first major aircraft sale from Boeing to China since Trump's first presidential term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell issued a strong defense of the central bank's independence, pushing back against accusations that its decisions are politically motivated. While not mentioning President Trump by name, Powell characterized such claims as a "cheap shot." His comments come during a period of intense pressure from the Trump administration, which has sought to influence the Fed's interest rate policies and install its own officials on the board of governors. Powell maintained that the Fed's decisions are driven by economic data, not politics. (not investment advice)</p>

This updated release improves upon a decade-old project with significantly enhanced graphics, spatial audio, and more intuitive navigation. The project is an example of using VR as a medium for deep artistic expression rather than just for entertainment or concert simulation.</p>

          <p>According to a new report from CDC scientists, infections caused by highly drug-resistant bacteria, known as "nightmare bacteria," have surged by almost 70% in the U.S. between 2019 and 2023. The increase is largely attributed to bacteria carrying the NDM gene, which makes them resistant to nearly all available antibiotics, including last-resort carbapenems. Researchers believe the rise may be linked to the widespread use of antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic and warn that these dangerous germs could spread more widely in the community, making common infections difficult to treat.</p>

The decision follows the committee's recent work on topics such as servicewomen's access to reproductive healthcare after the overturning of Roe v. Wade.

The move has created an awkward contrast, allowing Team Europe to position themselves as playing for pride and tradition. While some American players, like Keegan Bradley and Scottie Scheffler, have confirmed they will donate their stipends to charity, the policy itself has introduced a financial element that critics say undermines the event's spirit and adds pressure on the U.S. team.</p>
