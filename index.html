        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is facing a substantial rebellion from its own Labour MPs ahead of a crucial vote on planned welfare reforms. Despite holding a large majority, the government is struggling to persuade dozens of its backbenchers to support the bill, particularly concerning changes to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip). Critics within the party are concerned that the reforms are punitive and will not achieve their stated goals, while a promised review of the changes is seen as insufficient. The scale of the internal dissent represents a significant challenge for the Prime Minister one year into the government's term.</p>

          <p>Manchester City suffered a stunning defeat in the Club World Cup, being knocked out by Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal in a dramatic last-16 match that ended 4-3 after extra time. Despite a controversial opening goal and a late equalizer from Phil Foden that marked his 100th for the club, City crumbled in the added period. The decisive goal came from Al-Hilal's Marcos Leonardo in the 112th minute, sealing a historic victory for his team. The loss eliminates City from the tournament and denies them a potential Â£9.6 million in prize money.</p>

          <p>China is preparing for a major military parade on September 3 to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, an event that is expected to carry a strong message for Taiwan. While not the official theme, the parade will showcase the People's Liberation Army's most advanced weaponry, much of which was developed with a potential Taiwan conflict in mind. Analysts expect the display to include fifth-generation fighter jets, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and new carrier-based aircraft. The event and President Xi Jinping's accompanying speech will be closely watched for signals regarding China's military posture and foreign policy intentions.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Guardian questions the scarcity of French films that address the nation's significant role in the transatlantic slave trade and its colonial past. The author notes that French audiences often learn about slavery through American films like "12 Years a Slave," while France's own cinematic landscape remains largely silent on the subject. The article highlights recent independent films like "Fanon" and "Zion" that are beginning to explore these narratives but laments their marginalization from mainstream festivals like Cannes. It suggests that while French audiences are ready to confront this history, the film industry has been slow to respond.</p>

          <p>China's yuan has appreciated to its strongest level against the US dollar since last November, with analysts forecasting the trend to continue through 2025. This strengthening is attributed to a more optimistic view of China's near-term economic growth and rising concerns about the sustainability of U.S. government debt. Investment bank Goldman Sachs projects the yuan will surpass the 7 per dollar mark within six months, citing resilient Chinese economic data and diminishing confidence in the American economy's unique strengths. The People's Bank of China has been setting progressively stronger daily reference rates for its currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Panelists at the East Tech West conference in Bangkok argued that emerging economies must develop their own "sovereign AI" to ensure strategic autonomy and cater to local languages and cultures. This involves nations controlling their own AI technologies, data, and infrastructure rather than relying on English-based models from Western companies. Experts highlighted the use of open-source AI models and democratized access to cloud computing as key strategies for achieving this goal. The digitally savvy ASEAN region is seen as particularly well-positioned to pioneer this movement, fostering local talent and creating a collective energy for innovation.</p>

          <p>A private survey revealed that China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers unexpectedly returned to growth in June, contrasting with official data that showed a contraction. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI registered 50.4, beating expectations and indicating improving market conditions for the eighth time in nine months. This divergence is partly attributed to exporters front-loading shipments to avoid potential U.S. tariffs. Despite the positive production figures, new export orders declined and employment in the sector remained weak, suggesting potential headwinds for the second half of the year.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has successfully pushed through major housing legislation that significantly reforms the state's landmark environmental law, CEQA, to speed up construction. By tying the legislation to the state budget, Newsom compelled lawmakers to pass bills that exempt most urban housing projects from lengthy environmental reviews, a move that had previously faced stiff opposition from labor unions. Experts call the reforms the most consequential in CEQA's 55-year history and expect them to immediately unblock numerous housing projects. The governor's aggressive strategy marks a pivotal moment in his effort to address California's severe housing crisis.</p>

          <p>The White House has asserted that Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney "caved" to pressure from President Trump by agreeing to rescind a planned digital services tax on large U.S. technology firms. After Trump threatened to raise tariffs and halted trade talks, Canada announced it would scrap the 3% tax, which was set to affect companies like Google and Meta. While the White House framed it as a victory for American companies, Canadian officials stated the move was part of a broader negotiation, with bilateral trade talks resuming. The dispute highlights ongoing trade tensions between the two North American allies.</p>

          <p>A top U.S. military commander has proposed reassigning some of the California National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles by the Trump administration to help with wildfire preparedness. The proposal suggests moving 200 of the roughly 4,000 Guard members from their controversial protest-related duties in L.A. to wildfire response efforts elsewhere in the state. This move comes after California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, warned that the federal deployment was illegal and could hamper the state's ability to fight an expectedly active fire season. The deployment has been a point of legal and political conflict between the state and federal government.</p>

The family relies on a state Medicaid waiver program to afford over $4,000 in monthly treatments and medications not covered by their private insurance. State officials warn that the proposed federal funding reduction, estimated at $700 billion nationally, could force North Carolina to eliminate programs like the one the family depends on.

          <p>A political analysis from the BBC suggests the internal Labour Party dispute over a new welfare bill is a significant challenge for the government, despite its large majority. The row, centered on tightening eligibility for disability benefits, reveals a fundamental split between MPs prioritizing fiscal discipline and those defending the welfare state's principles. The government's leadership argues the changes are necessary for long-term stability, but many backbenchers view them as a departure from party values. This internal persuasion effort highlights the difficult balancing act the Prime Minister faces in managing both economic credibility and the party's traditional base.</p>

          <p>The 20-year-old man who fatally shot two firefighters and injured a third in an Idaho ambush had previously aspired to join a fire department, according to authorities and family. The suspect, Wess Roley, allegedly started a wildfire to lure emergency responders to the area before opening fire on them. Police believe an interaction with the fire crew about his vehicle, which he was living in, may have preceded the attack. Roley was later found dead at the scene from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, leaving the motive for the tragic attack a subject of investigation.</p>
