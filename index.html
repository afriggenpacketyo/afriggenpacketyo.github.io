          <p>At least 14 people have died and dozens remain missing in Taiwan after Super Typhoon Ragasa caused a landslide-dammed lake to overflow in Hualien county. The resulting floodwaters inundated Guangfu township, sweeping away cars and burying homes under mud and debris. Survivors described chaotic scenes as they were forced to seek refuge on rooftops from two successive waves of flooding. As rescue operations continue, residents are expressing growing anger over what they perceive as an avoidable disaster, questioning the adequacy of official warnings and preparations for the storm's impact.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has praised U.S. President Donald Trump following a meeting at the UN, after which Trump publicly shifted his stance on the war with Russia. In a notable pivot, Trump stated that Ukraine is in a position to "fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form," a departure from his previous skepticism about Kyiv's military prospects. Zelenskyy described the change as a "big shift" and called Trump a "game changer," suggesting the U.S. president is now better informed about the battlefield situation. This development has generated cautious optimism among some Ukrainian officials, though others remain wary of Trump's unpredictability.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region traded without a clear direction after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell commented that equity prices appear to be "fairly highly valued." Powell's remarks, which also indicated uncertainty in the path for interest rate cuts, contributed to declines on Wall Street and influenced investor sentiment across Asia. While Australia's ASX 200 fell, Japan's Nikkei 225 saw gains, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose significantly, partly driven by a surge in Alibaba's shares. South Korean defense stocks also rallied in response to U.S. President Trump's supportive statements regarding Ukraine. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has issued a warning to Japan regarding a recent private visit by former Taiwanese leader Tsai Ing-wen, urging Tokyo not to provide a platform for "Taiwan independence" advocates. Tsai, who led the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, visited Japan for what her office described as a purely tourism-related trip. Despite the private nature of her visit and the absence of scheduled meetings with Japanese officials, Beijing remains highly sensitive to any international activities involving Taiwanese political figures. The trip occurred under Japan's visa-free policy for Taiwanese tourists, highlighting the delicate diplomatic balance in the region.</p>

          <p>The UK's energy regulator, Ofgem, has announced plans requiring all suppliers in England, Scotland, and Wales to offer customers a tariff with a lower standing charge by the end of January. This move addresses concerns from low-energy users who are disproportionately affected by the fixed daily fee, which covers connection and network costs. However, these new tariffs will feature higher per-unit energy prices, meaning they are unlikely to reduce overall bills for most households. While the plan provides consumers with more choice in how they pay for fixed costs, charities argue it does not solve the underlying problem of high energy prices.</p>

The AI tool, developed by the Cabinet Office, cross-references data across government departments to identify and block fraudulent activity.

Additionally, a UN official noted that the teleprompter used for Trump's speech was operated by the White House, not the UN.

The author contrasts this with the post-Watergate norm of maintaining a wall between the White House and the DOJ.

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has unveiled an ambitious plan for an $850 billion infrastructure expansion in partnership with Oracle, Nvidia, and SoftBank. The project aims to build a vast network of supercomputing data centers to meet the staggering and rapidly growing demand for AI capabilities, which Altman says is necessary to deliver the future of the technology. This massive investment, equivalent to the power consumption of over 13 million homes, has raised concerns about a potential bubble and a circular financing model among partners. However, Altman insists the buildout is a necessary response to the exponential growth in demand for AI services.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani showcased his pitching prowess in his final regular-season start, throwing six shutout innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks in a dominant performance. Despite his efforts, the Los Angeles Dodgers' bullpen once again failed to secure the win, giving up a 4-0 lead late in the game. The collapse culminated in a 5-4 walk-off loss, highlighting the team's persistent and critical issues with its relief pitchers as the postseason approaches. Ohtani's strong outing demonstrated his readiness for the playoffs, but the team's inability to close out games remains a major concern for their championship hopes.</p>

          <p>The chief executive of South Korean battery maker Aricell, Park Soon-kwan, has been sentenced to 15 years in prison following a factory fire in June 2024 that killed 23 workers. A court found that the deadly blaze was an "anticipated disaster" resulting from the company's failure to implement proper safety measures and adequately train its employees. The sentence is the longest ever imposed under the country's industrial safety law, which holds business owners accountable for fatal workplace incidents. The fire at the lithium battery plant highlighted ongoing concerns about worker safety in South Korea's advanced manufacturing sector.</p>

          <p>Prominent chemist Tiow-Gan Ong, a top researcher at Taiwan's prestigious Academia Sinica, has left the island to take a position at the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Shenzhen campus. This high-profile departure has intensified concerns within Taiwan about a growing "talent drain" to mainland China. Ong, who had previously expressed hope that talent would remain in Taiwan due to its free academic environment, is the latest in a series of scholars to be recruited by mainland institutions offering competitive resources and compensation. The trend highlights the increasing competition for top academic and scientific talent across the Taiwan Strait.</p>

          <p>The city of Datong in northern China successfully avoided disaster during heavy summer rains, a feat attributed to a major infrastructure project completed over 15 years ago. Former mayor Geng Yanbo led an initiative to widen the city's main river and reinforce its banks, a project that was criticized at the time as wasteful but has now been vindicated. The city's resilience is being cited as a prime example of the long-term benefits of proactive investment in disaster prevention. Economists suggest that such infrastructure spending can not only improve urban resilience but also serve as an effective short-term economic stimulus.</p>

          <p>Australia's national broadcaster, the ABC, has been ordered to pay A$150,000 in penalties for unlawfully dismissing presenter Antoinette Lattouf over a social media post about the war in Gaza. The Federal Court had previously found that Lattouf was fired due to her political opinions and pressure from a pro-Israel lobby group. In his ruling, the judge stated that the substantial penalty was necessary to ensure the ABC understood the unacceptability of its actions and to deter it from appeasing lobby groups at the expense of its employees' rights. The case has sparked a national conversation about journalistic independence and support for diverse staff.</p>

Petro stated that if any of the victims were Colombian citizens, a criminal process must be initiated against the U.S. officials who gave the order, including President Trump himself.</p>
