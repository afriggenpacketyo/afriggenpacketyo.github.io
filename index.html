        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boeing announced a significant reduction in its quarterly losses, with revenue rising 35% to $22.75 billion, driven by the highest number of airplane deliveries since 2018. CEO Kelly Ortberg described 2025 as a potential "turnaround year," highlighting improved production stability and a focus on safety and quality. The company is increasing its 737 Max output to the FAA's limit of 38 per month and aims to generate positive cash flow in the fourth quarter. Despite the progress, challenges remain, including delays in the certification of its Max 7 and Max 10 models.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is launching a new hospitality initiative called "Green Apron Service" as part of CEO Brian Niccol's strategy to revitalize sales by focusing on customer experience. The program involves training baristas to provide warmer, more engaging interactions to foster customer loyalty and make Starbucks visits a regular habit. This push is supported by technological upgrades, such as Smart Queue algorithms for better staffing, and operational changes to ensure faster service. The company hopes this focus on human connection will differentiate it in a competitive market and reverse a trend of declining sales.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase, already the largest credit card issuer in the United States, is reportedly in advanced negotiations to take over the Apple Card portfolio from Goldman Sachs.

The potential transfer follows reports of Goldman Sachs looking to exit its consumer-facing ventures after facing challenges and losses. Both banks and Apple have declined to comment on the developing situation, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.</p>

          <p>Spotify's stock fell over 9% after the company reported a net loss of 86 million euros for the quarter and issued a weaker-than-expected forecast for the upcoming period. Despite an 11% increase in monthly active users to 696 million, the company's revenues and earnings fell short of analyst expectations. CEO Daniel Ek expressed dissatisfaction with the performance of the advertising business, calling it an "execution challenge" but reaffirming confidence in the long-term strategy. The company cited higher personnel and marketing costs as contributing factors to the disappointing financial results.</p>

          <h2>Psychologist Identifies Common Parental Phrases That May Hinder a Child's Success</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 10:07:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist with over two decades of experience has highlighted several common but potentially harmful lies that well-meaning parents tell their children. Phrases such as "if you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything" and "big kids don't cry" can set unrealistic expectations and discourage healthy emotional expression. The article argues that such statements can lead to self-blame, an inability to ask for help, and the suppression of valid feelings. Instead, the expert advises parents to foster resilience by being realistic, validating emotions, and teaching the value of both independence and interdependence.</p>

          <p>The full-scale removal of melted fuel debris from the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant will be delayed for several more years, according to the plant's operator, TEPCO. The company now estimates that 12 to 15 years of preparation are needed before the main removal process can begin at the No. 3 reactor, pushing the start date to 2037 or later. This setback casts further doubt on the Japanese government's ambitious goal of completing the plant's decommissioning by 2051. Over 800 tons of highly radioactive melted fuel are mixed with debris inside the three damaged reactors.</p>

          <p>Xu Gao, a prominent economist at Bank of China International, has publicly contested the views of Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio regarding the debt situations in China and the United States. In a detailed article, Xu argued that Dalio's call for China to deleverage is a misjudgment of the country's economic dynamics. He asserts that China's recent liquidity issues stem from overly harsh deleveraging policies, not excessive borrowing. Xu's comments contribute to an ongoing debate among economists about whether China needs more stimulus to support its economy amid various internal and external pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A lead researcher who has studied hundreds of companies transitioning to a four-day, 32-hour workweek has identified three key strategies for success. The first involves aggressively cutting down on meetings by making them shorter, more efficient, or replacing them with written updates. The second strategy is redesigning work processes to be more efficient, such as re-engineering factory workflows or reassigning tasks based on individual strengths. Finally, successful companies eliminate low-impact work by questioning the value of long-standing tasks and projects, freeing up time to focus on what truly matters for the business.</p>

The piece posits that any deal between Trump and Maxwell would be a strategic maneuver, not a correction of a legal wrong.
