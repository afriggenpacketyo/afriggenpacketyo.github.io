          <p>The ABC network has taken 'Jimmy Kimmel Live' off the air indefinitely following comments the host made during his monologue about the recent killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Kimmel criticized what he termed the "MAGA gang" for attempting to score political points from the tragedy and mocked the president's reaction. The decision followed pressure from figures like FCC Chair Brendan Carr and a move by Nexstar Media, a major station owner, to preemptively drop the show. In his remarks, Kimmel accused supporters of trying to mischaracterize the suspect as someone other than one of their own, sparking significant controversy and leading to the program's suspension.</p>

          <p>In her upcoming book, '107 Days,' Kamala Harris reveals that her first choice for a running mate was Pete Buttigieg, but she ultimately decided against it, deeming it "too big of a risk." Harris explains that she believed asking America to accept a ticket with a Black woman and a gay man would be too challenging, despite viewing Buttigieg as an "ideal partner." The passage offers a candid look into the identity politics and strategic calculations that influence major political decisions. Instead, Harris selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a choice that followed a period where Democrats have been reassessing their focus on historic candidacies versus electability.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region traded mixed after the U.S. Federal Reserve implemented an anticipated interest rate cut, which Chairman Jerome Powell described as a "risk management" measure. While the Fed's move was expected, it created some uncertainty, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi seeing gains while Australia's ASX 200 declined. The Fed also signaled the possibility of two additional cuts by the end of the year, influencing investor sentiment across the region. Concurrently, the Bank of Japan began its policy meeting, where it is widely expected to maintain its current steady policy rates amid global economic shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

This decision comes amid heightened scrutiny of campus policing following clashes with pro-Palestinian protesters in 2024. Critics, including faculty members, raised concerns during the meeting that such equipment could be used against students and staff, potentially creating a chilling effect on free speech and campus safety.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Current forecasts predict the storm will remain over open waters, tracking north of the Caribbean and away from any immediate land threats. However, meteorologists anticipate that Gabrielle will intensify over the weekend, potentially developing into a low-grade hurricane by Sunday. While its path is projected to stay clear of the U.S. mainland, the system could approach Bermuda next week as it continues to strengthen. This storm's formation occurs just after the historical peak of the hurricane season, which has been quieter than initially predicted by NOAA.</p>

          <p>Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old charged with assassinating conservative activist Charlie Kirk, was reportedly fearful of being shot by law enforcement and agreed to a peaceful surrender with his family's help. According to the Washington County Sheriff, a retired detective with ties to Robinson's family facilitated the negotiation, convincing the suspect to turn himself in under calm conditions. Robinson's father had confronted him after recognizing him in photos released by authorities. The sheriff credited the family's trust in the retired officer for de-escalating a potentially violent situation, leading to Robinson surrendering quietly at the sheriff's office without a large-scale SWAT operation.</p>

          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume fruit with a low alcohol content, amounting to the equivalent of nearly two human cocktails per day. Scientists from UC Berkeley measured the ethanol in figs and plum-like fruits favored by the chimps, discovering an average alcohol content of about 0.3% by weight. This study provides the first direct chemical evidence supporting the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in primate fruit-eating habits. The steady, low-dose exposure does not intoxicate the animals but may act as an aperitif, encouraging higher rates of feeding.</p>

Additionally, the MPs called for new national minimum standards for Send support in schools, increased teacher training, and more investment in state specialist schools.

The rate has shown little improvement since surging after the expiration of pandemic-era aid programs, which had briefly lowered it to a historic low of 11% in 2021. The report highlights that child poverty has more than doubled since that time, with people of color and renters being disproportionately affected. The authors argue that poverty is a "policy choice" and warn that recent federal and state budget cuts to social safety net programs are likely to worsen the situation.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent 0.25% interest rate cut, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors against making major portfolio changes based solely on the central bank's actions. He argued that the move was widely expected and did not upend any major, long-term market themes, suggesting that the mixed market reaction might even present buying opportunities. Cramer stated that the Fed is in a difficult position, balancing a weakening job market with persistent inflation, much of which he attributes to tariffs. He described Fed Chair Jerome Powell's approach as prudent and steady, which he believes is precisely what the current economic situation requires. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A suspect has been arrested for allegedly making a threat of terrorism against Utah Valley University, the same campus where conservative activist Charlie Kirk was recently killed. The Summit County Sheriff's Office was alerted by the FBI to a video posted online in which 20-year-old Blake Francis Rogers allegedly made specific threats of violence against the university. According to the probable cause affidavit, Rogers admitted to making the video but claimed it was a "joke" sent to a small group of people. The arrest occurred as students returned to the campus, which has become a site of mourning following Kirk's assassination.</p>

Interim coach Tim Skipper announced the departure of Malloe, who was a highly respected and popular figure among the players. According to a source, Malloe felt a strong sense of personal responsibility for the team's defensive struggles and believed it was best for him to step away. The move leaves the Bruins to adopt a collaborative coaching approach for the defense as they attempt to reset their season.</p>

          <p>In sworn testimony before a Senate committee, former CDC Director Susan Monarez stated that she was fired by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Monarez alleged that Kennedy demanded she give "blanket approval" for all upcoming recommendations from a vaccine advisory panel without seeing the evidence, a request she refused on the grounds of scientific integrity. She also testified that Kennedy expressed disdain for CDC employees, calling them corrupt and claiming they were "killing children." Her testimony paints a picture of a federal health agency where political pressure is overriding established scientific processes.</p>

Despite initial outrage from some council members over the cost, the council voted 10-3 to increase the contract cap to nearly $5 million for the current fiscal year.

Pittman maintained his innocence in his final words, stating he was an innocent man being murdered by the state. His recent appeals, which were rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court, focused on claims of intellectual disability that his lawyers argued should have made his execution unconstitutional.</p>

Lula criticized Trump's recent imposition of 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods as "eminently political," asserting that American consumers would bear the cost. He explained that he has never spoken directly with Trump because the U.S. administration has shown no interest in dialogue. Lula contrasted this with his relationships with other world leaders, emphasizing that Trump's connection was with former president Jair Bolsonaro, not with Brazil itself.</p>

          <p>Birdie G’s, a highly praised Santa Monica restaurant known for its unique blend of Midwestern, Jewish, and Californian cuisine, will be closing its doors at the end of the year.

A significant drop in business following the nearby Palisades fire in January was described by Fox as the "nail in the coffin."

This declaration follows a recent report from an independent UN commission that reached a similar conclusion.

          <p>Amid growing political turmoil, public health experts and the American public are expressing a significant loss of confidence in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency's credibility is being questioned following the appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as HHS Secretary and the recent testimony of ousted director Susan Monarez, who alleged she was fired for upholding scientific integrity. With the CDC's guidance now viewed by many as politicized, experts are pointing Americans toward alternative sources like professional medical organizations and academic institutions for reliable health information. This fragmentation is creating a challenging landscape for physicians and could accelerate diverging health policies across states.</p>
