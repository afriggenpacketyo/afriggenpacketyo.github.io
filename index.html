          <p>Rice prices in Japan have surged, more than doubling in May and marking the largest increase in over half a century, following similar rises in previous months. This spike occurs as Japan's core inflation rate climbed to 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023, exceeding economists' expectations. The Bank of Japan held rates steady at 0.5% but indicated potential future rate hikes if underlying inflation approaches their 2% target. However, the bank also forecasts a potential slowdown in inflation due to a decelerating economy, while geopolitical tensions could impact energy prices (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with federal immigration authorities to receive transportation funding. The ruling sided with 20 states that sued, arguing the administration lacked the authority to tie transportation dollars to immigration enforcement. The judge deemed the policy arbitrary and lacking specificity, emphasizing that Congress did not authorize the Secretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on transportation funds. California's Attorney General lauded the decision, accusing President Trump of coercing states into carrying out his immigration agenda.</p>

While attacking Iran's nuclear enrichment program would cripple its nuclear weapons capability, it would not eliminate it, as Iran possesses the knowledge, experience, and resources to rebuild.

The states argued that the transportation secretary lacked the authority to impose immigration-enforcement conditions on funding appropriated by Congress. The ruling prevents the administration from coercing states into adhering to Trump's immigration agenda.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft has resigned as a government whip over planned cuts to disability benefits. Foxcroft expressed understanding for the need to address the welfare bill but opposed cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit. She stated that she had tried to fight for changes from within but was unsuccessful. The government defended the reforms as necessary to fix a broken welfare system and support those who can and want to work.</p>

          <h2>ICE Issues New Rules for Congress Members Visiting Detention Centers</h2>

          <p>ICE has issued new rules for members of Congress visiting detention centers, which experts say are illegal and obstruct congressional oversight. Lawmakers have been denied entry to detention facilities, prompting concerns about transparency and accountability. Federal statute states that funds may not be used to prevent members of Congress from entering facilities for oversight purposes, but ICE is requesting 72 hours' notice. Lawmakers are considering legal action to compel access and ensure oversight of detention facilities.</p>
