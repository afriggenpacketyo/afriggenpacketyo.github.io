        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's export growth has slowed for the second consecutive month due to the impact of U.S. tariffs imposed by President Trump. According to government data, exports to the U.S. fell for the first time since December of the previous year, with a decrease of 1.8% year-over-year. This decline is primarily attributed to a 25% levy on Japan's auto, steel, and aluminum exports to the U.S., with transport equipment exports also seeing a significant drop. Economists anticipate that net exports will continue to negatively impact Japan's GDP growth in the second quarter, potentially delaying the central bank's interest rate hike.

          <p>Philadelphia District Attorney Lawrence Krasner, backed by George Soros, successfully defended his position against a primary challenge from Judge Pat Dugan in a Democrat-heavy area. However, Dugan may still have a chance for a rematch in November if he garnered sufficient Republican write-in votes. The Republican Party strategically funded a website encouraging voters to write-in Dugan, aiming to oust Krasner due to his progressive criminal justice policies. Krasner has faced criticism for policies such as ceasing charges for marijuana possession and eliminating cash bail for some offenders, leading to Republican-led impeachment proceedings in the past.</p>

          <p>A federal judge voiced concerns that the Trump administration may be in contempt of court for deporting migrants to South Sudan, potentially violating a previous order that requires migrants be given a meaningful opportunity to challenge their deportation to third countries.

The judge, Brian Murphy, questioned a Justice Department lawyer about the flight's destination, but the lawyer stated the information was classified. Judge Murphy did not order the plane to return, but mandated that the migrants remain in government custody pending a hearing.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has initiated an investigation into former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo regarding his testimony to Congress during the COVID-19 pandemic. This investigation follows accusations that Cuomo lied to Congress during a probe into coronavirus deaths in nursing homes. Congressional Republicans had previously pressed the DOJ to investigate Cuomo, alleging he was involved in drafting and editing a 2020 state report on nursing home deaths but testified otherwise. A Cuomo spokesperson dismissed the investigation as politically motivated, likening it to election interference.</p>

O'Connor campaigned on a platform of pragmatism, promising to improve city services and rebuild the tax base, contrasting with Gainey's focus on affordable housing, which saw incremental gains amid administrative missteps.</p>

Despite President Trump expressing willingness for direct peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, Putin's diplomatic victory could undermine his broader economic goals to normalize relations with the United States. Trump emphasized that American economic rapprochement with Russia would come after peace in Ukraine, not before, potentially confining Russia to an economic purgatory. Putin's goal is to convince Mr. Trump that Russia’s vast natural resources are a sufficient prize to make up for the international acclaim that the American president would miss by failing to stop the bloodshed in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The Toba Aquarium in Japan offers a rare opportunity to see sea otters, but this opportunity is nearing its end as they house the last two sea otters in captivity in Japan. The wild sea otter population has declined due to hunting and environmental pollution. Breeding in captivity has been challenging, raising concerns about the species' future. The aquarium is making efforts to keep the two sea otters, May and Kira, healthy and has begun livestreaming their activities on YouTube. However, due to their popularity, visitors are only permitted one minute at the sea otters' enclosure.</p>

Recommendations include discouraging the laying of flowers in areas where a student has died to avoid drawing attention to the location.
