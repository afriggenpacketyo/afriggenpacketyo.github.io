          <p>Louisiana State Police have arrested Connie Weeden, the third alleged accomplice in the escape of inmates from the Orleans Parish Correctional Facility. Weeden is accused of providing financial assistance to escapee Jermaine Donald via a cell phone application, and is charged with accessory after the fact. Authorities are continuing their search for the remaining fugitives and warning that anyone aiding or concealing these individuals will face legal consequences. This arrest follows the previous accusations against Cortnie Harris and Corvanntay Baptiste for providing support to other escapees, and underscores the seriousness with which law enforcement is treating the jailbreak and the ongoing threat to public safety.</p>

President Cyril Ramaphosa had planned to address his country‚Äôs economy during his White House meeting, but Trump continued to make false claims of genocide. Despite Trump's claims, police data does not support evidence of genocide or the idea that white farmers are more likely to be targeted than any other group.</p>

This trend is partly driven by the rising number of childless couples and unmarried individuals in Japan. The amount of money going into the national treasury due to the absence of inheritors has been increasing, prompting greater awareness and planning among those without heirs.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate climbed to 3.5% in April, marking the highest level in over two years, driven by reduced government utility subsidies and surging rice prices.

Rice prices in Japan have doubled over the year, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba pledging to lower prices.
