          <p>A new company named Jams has launched a line of frozen peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, aiming to compete with the dominant Uncrustables brand. Backed by prominent athletes like Alex Morgan and C.J. Stroud, Jams differentiates itself by targeting health-conscious consumers, offering a product with no seed oils, artificial additives, or high-fructose corn syrup, and a higher protein content. Despite a higher price point, Jams is betting on the appeal to athletes and those seeking cleaner ingredients to capture a share of the billion-dollar market. The product is launching exclusively in 3,000 Walmart stores nationwide.</p>

          <p>An inmate has successfully escaped from a prison near Lyon, France, by concealing himself inside the luggage of his cellmate, who was being officially released. The 20-year-old prisoner, who was serving multiple sentences and was under investigation for organized crime, was captured by authorities on Monday. Prison officials have launched an internal investigation, describing the escape as an "extremely rare event" resulting from an "accumulation of errors" and "serious malfunctions." The incident also highlights concerns about severe overcrowding at the Lyon-Corbas prison, which holds nearly double its intended capacity.</p>

          <p>A fast-moving wildfire on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and between 50 to 80 other structures. The Dragon Bravo Fire exhibited extreme behavior, expanding to 5,000 acres and causing a chlorine gas leak from a damaged water treatment facility, which complicated firefighting efforts. All guests and employees were safely evacuated, but the loss of the iconic lodge, a central feature of the park since the 1930s, is a significant blow to Arizona's history. The incident has prompted calls for an investigation into the fire's management.</p>

It contrasts the relative acceptance in antiquity, citing examples like the Roman Emperor Hadrian and the poet Sappho, with the persecution that arose with the spread of Christianity, which used biblical stories to stigmatize such behaviors. The article also touches on the acceptance of same-sex love in other cultures, such as among Japanese samurai, and highlights historical LGBTQ+ figures who sought to live authentically.

          <p>The UK government has initiated a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, suggesting that the state-owned enterprise could be transformed into an employee-owned mutual organization. This proposal comes in the wake of the Horizon IT scandal, which saw hundreds of sub-postmasters wrongly convicted, prompting calls for a significant cultural overhaul. Proponents argue that a mutual model, where staff have a greater stake in decision-making, could prevent such scandals from recurring. The consultation will also examine the number of required branches and the range of services, particularly banking, that the Post Office should offer in the future.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has announced a hosepipe ban for 1.1 million people in parts of Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire, and Wiltshire, effective July 22. The restriction is a response to a prolonged period of dry weather and increased consumer demand, which have strained water supplies. The ban prohibits activities like watering gardens, washing cars, or filling paddling pools with a hosepipe, with potential fines of up to £1,000 for violators. This action follows similar bans by other water companies and comes as the Environment Agency declares a state of prolonged dry weather in the region.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the YIMBY ("yes in my backyard") movement, which advocates for building more housing to increase affordability, is fundamentally a progressive and populist effort, contrary to critics who label it as centrist or pro-business. The author frames the issue in antitrust terms, asserting that NIMBYism represents a form of regulatory capture by wealthy landowners who restrict housing supply to protect their property values. By fighting against exclusionary zoning and other restrictive regulations, the YIMBY movement aims to break this cartel-like hold on the housing market. This approach seeks to unrig the system, expand access, and redistribute wealth from a landowning elite to the broader population.</p>

          <p>The recent deadly flash flood in the Texas Hill Country bears a striking resemblance to a 1987 disaster in the same area, prompting questions about why more preventative measures were not in place. In 1987, a flash flood on the Guadalupe River killed 10 children from a church camp. The recent flood, which was even larger, has killed nearly 130 people. The region, known as "flash flood alley," has a long history of such events. While some nearby towns have since installed effective siren-based warning systems, Kerr County's plans for a similar system stalled, a failure that may have contributed to the scale of the current tragedy.</p>

          <p>An investigation into the teen-oriented version of Google's Gemini AI chatbot revealed significant safety vulnerabilities, allowing a user posing as a 13-year-old to easily bypass safeguards and engage in explicit conversations. By using simple prompts, the user was able to coax the AI into generating sexually explicit dialogue and role-playing disturbing scenarios, including bondage and sexual assault. The article highlights the challenges AI companies face in creating truly safe environments for young users, even with stated protections in place. Google has since implemented additional safeguards in response to the findings.</p>

          <p>An Israeli theater director and long-time pacifist describes the profound sense of isolation he experiences for opposing the war in Gaza. He feels rejected both at home, where his anti-war stance is seen as a betrayal, and abroad, where his Israeli identity leads to immediate condemnation. The article recounts personal anecdotes of being ostracized by family in Israel and shunned by colleagues in Europe, illustrating a global climate where nuance is unwelcome. The author questions where one can stand when advocating for the rights of both Israelis and Palestinians, caught between two worlds that demand absolute allegiance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the paradox of why, despite modern advancements like comfortable beds and climate control, a significant portion of the U.S. population suffers from poor sleep. While historical barriers to sleep like pests and physical danger have been largely eliminated, new challenges have emerged. Modern lifestyles, characterized by stress, anxiety, and late-night screen use, disrupt natural sleep patterns. Furthermore, systemic issues such as housing insecurity, noise pollution, and the pressures of shift work disproportionately affect sleep quality in low-income and minority communities, creating significant health disparities.</p>

          <p>China and Serbia are set to hold their first joint military training exercise this month, marking a deepening of defense cooperation between Beijing and the Balkan nation. The exercise aims to enhance the combat skills of the participating forces and strengthen military ties. Serbia, which is not a member of NATO, is one of China's closest European partners, a relationship strengthened since the 1999 NATO bombing of the former Yugoslavia. This drill represents China's first joint exercise with a European country since its counterterrorism training with Belarus last year, signaling its growing military diplomacy in the region.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's headline consumer inflation rate fell to a lower-than-expected 2.1% in June, continuing a downward trend and reaching a more than six-year low. The drop was primarily driven by a continued decline in food price growth, with food inflation turning negative. This sustained easing of inflation provides the Reserve Bank of India with more room to continue its monetary policy relaxation, potentially leading to further interest rate cuts. Strong agricultural production and favorable weather are expected to keep food prices in check, which could help boost domestic consumption and support economic growth.</p>

          <p>Global financial markets reacted with relative calm to the U.S. administration's latest threat to impose 30% tariffs on goods from the European Union and Mexico. While European markets saw modest declines, the overall response was subdued, which some analysts characterize as either resilience or complacency. Investors appear to be in a holding pattern as negotiations are ongoing, making it difficult to price in the potential impact of the tariffs, which are not set to take effect until August 1. The EU has delayed its own retaliatory measures, holding out hope for a negotiated settlement before the deadline.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that justifications for cutting essential public services for children and families, such as Medicaid and nutrition programs, under the guise of fighting "fraud and abuse" are misguided. The author, a former state legislator, contends that significant government waste is found not among poor families but in areas like healthcare vendor fraud, tax evasion by the wealthy, and corporate crime. Instead of gutting effective programs that support children, lawmakers should focus enforcement on these larger-scale issues. The piece concludes that cutting aid to children is a cruel policy that jeopardizes the nation's future.</p>

          <p>The president of the global football players' union, Fifpro, has sharply criticized FIFA's expanded Club World Cup, calling the organization's praise for the tournament "nothing more than a fiction." In a scathing statement, Fifpro accused FIFA of prioritizing revenue at the expense of player health and welfare, adding more pressure to an already congested fixture schedule. The criticism intensified after Fifpro was reportedly excluded from a key meeting on player welfare. The union has previously filed a legal complaint against FIFA, alleging that the unilateral expansion of the tournament abuses European competition law.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger's recent guilty plea in the murder of four University of Idaho students has brought a legal conclusion to the case but leaves the central question of his motive unanswered. This article explores what is known and what remains a mystery, noting that without a trial, key details may never be officially revealed. The evidence against Kohberger was overwhelming, including DNA, phone records, and an eyewitness. However, his reasons for targeting the victims, particularly his apparent fixation on one of the students, remain speculative. Upcoming documentaries and books are expected to delve deeper, but a full understanding of the crime's psychology may be lost.</p>

The 40-year-old doctor allegedly administered deadly cocktails of sedatives to the victims, aged 25 to 94, during home visits and, in some cases, set fire to their apartments to conceal his crimes. Prosecutors have accused the doctor of exploiting his patients' trust and acting as a "master of life and death," with a motive described as a "lust for murder."

          <p>The price of Bitcoin has surged to a new all-time high, breaking the $120,000 mark, driven by significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Analysts suggest that increased institutional buying is a key factor behind the cryptocurrency's recent momentum, with some predicting further appreciation in the near future.

          <p>This article explains the potential negative consequences of the U.S. administration's push for the Federal Reserve to lower its benchmark interest rate to 1%. While a low rate would reduce government borrowing costs, it is typically a crisis response to a struggling economy, not a sign of strength. In the current environment of low unemployment and moderate inflation, such a drastic rate cut could be seen as a loss of Fed independence, potentially spooking the bond market and reigniting inflation. Historically, a 1% Fed rate has coincided with periods of high unemployment and economic distress, not a robust economy.</p>

          <p>An independent investigation into the BBC show 'MasterChef' has substantiated 45 allegations against presenter Gregg Wallace. The claims, spanning a 19-year period, primarily relate to inappropriate sexual language and humor, culturally insensitive comments, and one instance of unwelcome physical contact. The inquiry was launched by the show's production company following a BBC News report on Wallace's behavior. The report notes that Wallace was recently diagnosed with autism, which may help explain some actions, but he does not wish to hide behind it.
