          <p>The Trump administration has announced a comprehensive trade deal with South Korea, establishing a 15% tariff on the country's exports to the U.S., a reduction from a previously threatened 25%. The agreement includes a commitment from South Korea to make a $350 billion investment in the United States, although the two nations have offered differing interpretations of how these funds will be managed. Additionally, the deal stipulates that South Korea will purchase $100 billion in American energy products like LNG. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics reported a second-quarter operating profit that more than halved year-over-year, falling short of market expectations. The significant drop was primarily attributed to a major slump in its memory chip business, which was impacted by U.S. export restrictions on advanced AI chips to China. In contrast, the company's mobile experience division, responsible for smartphones and tablets, saw a notable increase in both sales and profit, driven by strong demand for its Galaxy S25 and A series devices.

          <p>A BBC analysis details the effects of the Trump administration's recent tariffs, noting a surge in government revenue but also a widening trade deficit as firms stockpiled goods to avoid the taxes. While Chinese exports to the U.S. have fallen, they have increased to other regions like the EU and ASEAN nations, suggesting a significant diversion of trade flows. Economists are now observing that U.S. consumer prices are beginning to rise on certain imported goods as these tariff costs are passed on. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to keep its key interest rate unchanged, resisting pressure from President Donald Trump to implement a cut. The decision was not unanimous, with two board members dissenting in favor of a rate reduction, a rare occurrence that signals broadening support for looser policy. Policymakers cited concerns about inflation remaining above their target and the unpredictable effects of new tariffs, even as recent data showed moderate economic growth.</p>

This directionality, combined with the quake's specific characteristics, meant that areas like California and Hawaii were spared the catastrophic waves seen in past events.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company has reinstated its full-year financial outlook, now estimating a net $2 billion negative impact from tariffs after initially suspending guidance due to uncertainty. The automaker reported second-quarter revenue that beat expectations, though its net income was affected by a $570 million charge from a major vehicle recall. CEO Jim Farley stated Ford is in "constructive conversations" with the Trump administration regarding the tariffs, which affect imported parts used in its U.S. manufacturing.

VOA has been largely non-operational since March, following the appointment of a new Trump adviser who oversaw mass firings.</p>

These series use hyperrealistic techniques, such as single-take sequences and real-time narratives, to immerse viewers in high-pressure environments that mirror the stresses of modern life. Psychologists suggest this "vicarious stress" can be cathartic for audiences, who relate to the characters' struggles for excellence in chaotic workplaces.</p>

The former hostage stated that making recognition conditional on a ceasefire disincentivizes Hamas from releasing the remaining hostages, as the group would lose key leverage. Her statement, along with concerns from lawyers representing hostage families, argues that the move sends a dangerous message that violence can earn political legitimacy.</p>
