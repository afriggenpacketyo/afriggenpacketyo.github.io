          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-30 13:48:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the "7-year rule" for credit card debt, clarifying common misunderstandings about its impact. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, most negative information, such as unpaid debts and late payments, must be removed from a credit report after seven years. This rule also often aligns with state statutes of limitations, which typically prevent creditors from suing for old debt after a similar period. However, the debt itself does not disappear, and collectors may still attempt to contact the borrower for payment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda has intensified into a hurricane in the Atlantic, with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph. The storm is currently moving away from the Bahamas and the southeastern U.S. coastline, with forecasters predicting it will approach Bermuda by late Wednesday. A hurricane warning is in effect for Bermuda, while coastal North Carolina may experience isolated flash flooding. Swells from Imelda are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along much of the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>President Trump, in an address to senior military leaders, stated his intention to use American cities as "training grounds" to handle what he termed "a war from within." Alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, he outlined a cultural shift at the Pentagon, including an end to "woke" policies and the implementation of new, uniform physical fitness standards. The president criticized Democratic-led cities and reiterated his policy of using military personnel for domestic law enforcement, drawing criticism from figures like Illinois Governor JB Pritzker.</p>

          <p>Ford CEO Jim Farley predicts that the market share for electric vehicles could be cut in half, dropping from a record of around 10% to 5%, following the end of federal tax incentives. The termination of the up to $7,500 consumer credit is part of the Trump administration's new policy, which Farley believes will significantly shrink the EV market. He noted that consumers are hesitant about expensive EVs and that the industry, including Ford, will need to adapt its strategy regarding battery plants and production capacity.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the monthly cost for a $200,000 home equity loan has slightly decreased, though not substantially. A 10-year loan at current rates would cost approximately $2,463 per month, while a 15-year term would be around $1,936 per month. The article advises homeowners to carefully consider their financial stability before borrowing such a large sum, as the home serves as collateral. It suggests the loan could be advantageous for those with high equity and a solid repayment plan. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Democratic lawmakers have raised concerns that the Trump administration may be improperly seizing the tax refunds of defaulted student loan borrowers. In a letter to the Education Secretary, they argue that the department is failing to provide the required 60-day notice before initiating an offset, potentially using warnings issued years ago as justification. This action follows the resumption of garnishments after a pandemic-era pause and affects millions of borrowers at risk of default. The lawmakers state these seizures are already causing significant financial hardship for American families.</p>

The plan has faced criticism and protests from some students and community members, who argue it blemishes the symbolic importance of the Freedom Tower, a historic processing center for Cuban refugees.

The recommendation comes after Combs's lawyers requested a sentence of no more than 14 months, citing his rehabilitation while incarcerated.

The new ambition includes increasing the number of young people in higher technical courses or apprenticeships to at least 10% by 2040.

          <p>Labor unions in Greece have called for a general strike to protest a controversial government bill that could legalize a 13-hour workday. The proposed reform, championed by Labor Minister Niki Kerameos, would allow employees to voluntarily work longer hours for a single employer, building on previous measures that introduced a mandatory six-day work week in some sectors. Critics and union leaders argue that the changes will lead to worker exploitation and burnout, as employees have little bargaining power to refuse overtime. Despite having the longest working hours in the EU, Greeks face lower purchasing power, fueling widespread opposition to the bill.</p>

While mandatory spending like Social Security and Medicare would continue, services could slow down, and programs like WIC for low-income families are at risk of running out of funds.

          <p>Despite a series of Federal Reserve rate cuts, savers can still strategically use certificates of deposit (CDs) to earn significant interest. The article outlines several methods to earn approximately $1,000, such as depositing $24,000 into a one-year CD or $8,200 into a three-year CD at current rates. With further rate cuts anticipated, it emphasizes the timeliness of locking in today's relatively high rates. The piece also suggests CD laddering—opening multiple CDs with staggered maturity dates—as a way to maximize returns while maintaining flexibility in a changing interest rate environment.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are set to begin their best-of-three wild-card playoff series against the Reds in weather that is cooler than typical for this time of year. A deep marine layer is contributing to lingering cloud cover and temperatures that are 4 to 8 degrees below normal at Chavez Ravine. First pitch temperatures are forecasted to be around 67 to 71 degrees for the first two games. While conditions are expected to warm slightly for a potential third game on Thursday, the forecast indicates that temperatures will remain below average through the weekend.</p>

He defended the acquisition, highlighting Woltemade's strong start with two goals in three games and noting that the player is not weighed down by the price tag.

Musicians have become symbols of political resistance, similar to their role during the final years of the Soviet Union. The Kremlin has attempted to suppress this movement by banning songs, arresting performers, and labeling them as "foreign agents," but these actions often backfire by increasing the artists' popularity. Stars like Noize MC and Alla Pugacheva have openly condemned the war, using their platforms to challenge the regime's narrative.</p>

          <p>This article explores the practice of "self-connecting" flights, where travelers book separate tickets to create their own itinerary, often at a lower price than a single booking. While this can offer significant savings, it comes with substantial risks, as the traveler is not protected if a delay on the first leg causes them to miss their connecting flight. The piece advises that this strategy works best with only cabin baggage and a long layover. It also warns that travelers must have the proper documentation, such as a visa, for the connecting country, even if they do not plan to leave the airport.</p>

This is the second arrest in the case, following the detention of another Ukrainian suspect in Italy last month.
