          <h2>Japanese Universities Receive Defense Tech Subsidies Amid Budget Constraints</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-01 08:25:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese universities have received approximately 2.7 billion yen in defense-related technology subsidies from the Defense Ministry over nine years, starting in fiscal year 2015. This funding has become increasingly important for researchers due to declining operational subsidies to national universities and a decreasing student population. While the ministry's program aims to advance state-of-the-art projects like harmful gas absorption sheets and AI-driven cyberattack detection, some experts express concern about the potential for military applications and the Defense Ministry's influence on research directions. The subsidy budget has increased significantly since the program's inception, reflecting the growing emphasis on security-related technology research. </p>

          <p>North Korea amended its space development law in 2022, removing language that prohibited the military use of space, according to an analysis by 38 North.

This change aligns with North Korea's claim of successfully placing a reconnaissance satellite into orbit in 2023. The amended law, which increased the number of articles from 23 to 48, suggests a maturing space strategy in North Korea. </p>

          <p>Germany's national police chief, Dieter Romann, has given a positive initial assessment of the tightened border controls. He dismissed concerns about overburdened personnel, stating that the Federal Police should be able to manage with the current staff. Since September 16, 2024, Germany reintroduced temporary checks at its land borders. The personnel have been reinforced by almost 1,200 colleagues, bringing the total to 13,000 to 14,000 federal police officers deployed at the borders. </p>

          <p>The article advocates for a new social contract that lifts from the bottom of society, drawing lessons from past poor people's movements. It highlights the welfare rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s, particularly the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO), as an example of effective grassroots organizing. The NWRO, led by Black women, fought for welfare rights and created innovative "projects of survival." The article suggests that the Johnnie Tillmon model, which emphasizes uniting the poor and addressing their daily needs, is relevant today. </p>

Critics warn the curtailing or eliminating federal student loan programs could drive low-income students away from pursuing medicine as a career, make loans harder to repay, or push students into the arms of expensive private lenders.

          <p>Many top U.S. universities have been torn with strife for the last decade, but the Trump administration’s campaign to defund research, hike endowment taxes, dictate admissions and faculty appointments and otherwise forcibly reshape universities has united fractious factions. To successfully repel this onslaught, university communities will have to sustain and build upon this improbable, newfound and fragile unity. Doing so will mean accepting the idea that, to make common cause, one need not hold every cause in common. </p>

          <h2>White House Deporting Individuals to Countries of Non-Origin</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-01 06:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>The Trump administration is deporting individuals to countries they are not from, arguing that their home countries won't accept them due to criminal records. This strategy has faced legal challenges, with immigration lawyers arguing that deportees need more time to contest their removal to third countries. A federal judge ruled in their favor, requiring credible fear interviews for migrants facing deportation to countries other than their origin. This policy raises concerns about the safety and due process rights of deportees. </p>

          <p>Hurricane Helene worsened an existing housing crisis in North Carolina, damaging or destroying over 100,000 homes. Many residents, like Stuart and Jackie Pacheo, lost everything and struggle to rebuild. The storm caused extensive flooding and landslides, making evacuation difficult and dangerous. The lack of preparedness and difficulty in conveying the storm's threat contributed to the devastation. </p>
