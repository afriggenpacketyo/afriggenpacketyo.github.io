        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>There is no universal rule for how much screen time is safe for children, but a consensus among experts suggests a cautious approach based on developmental stages. For toddlers, real-world interaction is crucial for cognitive and motor skill development, with recommendations ranging from "screen-free until three" to a maximum of one hour daily for two-year-olds. As children grow, the focus shifts from time limits to content quality and supervised use, ensuring screens don't replace essential activities like imaginative play and social interaction. For adolescents, open communication is key to navigating online risks, while parents are encouraged to model healthy media habits for the entire family.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor Rebecca Patterson has raised concerns that former President Trump's efforts to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook could threaten the central bank's political independence. Drawing on economic research from other countries, Patterson warns that politicizing the Fed often leads to weaker stock markets, higher inflation, and reduced foreign investment. While markets might initially react positively to politically motivated interest rate cuts, she argues the long-term consequences for the U.S. economy could be severe, including a weaker dollar and diminished institutional integrity. The article suggests that such a move would be a significant and potentially damaging shift in U.S. economic policy. (not investment advice)</p>

His recent man-of-the-match performances, marked by multiple assists in consecutive games, have made him a central figure for his new club. Despite his excellent form, Grealish was notably left out of the latest England squad by manager Thomas Tuchel, raising questions about his chances of making the World Cup team. Everton's manager and pundits have praised his renewed energy and creativity, suggesting the consistent playing time is allowing him to showcase his talent once again.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has publicly demanded the resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., accusing him of endangering public health through his anti-vaccine stance and promotion of scientific conspiracy theories.

The senator argues that Kennedy's actions are dismantling the nation's public health infrastructure and creating a "war on science." This development highlights a growing bipartisan backlash against what critics describe as the politicization of U.S. health agencies under the current administration.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is cutting more than 500 government positions at Voice of America and its parent agency, the U.S. Agency for Global Media. The move, announced by acting CEO Kari Lake, comes despite a federal judge's recent orders intended to protect the international broadcaster's operations and leadership. Judge Royce Lamberth had blocked Lake from firing VOA's director and ordered her to provide sworn testimony about her compliance with his rulings. Critics and employee groups have called the layoffs an abhorrent attack on an agency tasked with providing objective news in countries with restricted press freedom, viewing it as an attempt to dismantle the organization.</p>

          <p>Several local councils in the UK are continuing to pursue legal action to prevent hotels from being used to house asylum seekers, despite a recent Court of Appeal ruling that overturned a temporary injunction. The ruling was seen as a setback for councils arguing that using hotels for this purpose constitutes an unauthorized change of use and creates public safety risks. However, some councils, including Epping Forest, are considering appealing to the Supreme Court. The ongoing legal battles coincide with protests and counter-demonstrations across the country, highlighting the intense community and political tensions surrounding the government's asylum accommodation policies.</p>

The ruling from U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb found the administration's policy of applying this process to migrants detained in the interior of the country to be unlawful. Previously, expedited removal was primarily used for recent arrivals near the border. The decision curtails the administration's ability to quickly deport individuals who cannot prove they have been in the U.S. for more than two years, dealing a significant blow to a key part of its immigration agenda.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has instructed all staff to return to its Atlanta offices by September 15, about five weeks after a fatal shooting occurred at the headquarters. On August 8, a gunman killed a responding police officer before taking his own life, forcing employees to barricade themselves in their offices. In an internal email, the agency's COO assured staff that their safety is the top priority and that significant progress has been made on repairs. The return-to-office mandate comes during a period of turmoil for the agency, which has also seen a recent leadership shakeup and staff cuts.</p>

          <p>The new remake of the 1984 cult classic 'The Toxic Avenger' updates the schlocky original with a higher-quality production and a cast including Peter Dinklage and Kevin Bacon. Directed by Macon Blair, the film retains the gratuitous gore and blunt parody of its Troma predecessor but anchors the story with a more sincere emotional core and a pointed environmental message. Dinklage plays a janitor who, after being thrown into toxic waste, becomes a disfigured mutant hero fighting a corrupt pharmaceutical corporation. While the film's polished look may feel disconnected from the original's low-budget charm, it delivers a diverting and gruesome homage to the anti-hero.</p>

          <p>As Labor Day approaches, American labor unions are confronting a period of significant challenge and uncertainty under the Trump administration. Organizers report a somber mood as they grapple with the impacts of increased immigration raids, proposed cuts to Medicaid, and a weakened National Labor Relations Board. Unions have been forced to divert resources to support members affected by deportations and to fight against policies aimed at reducing collective bargaining rights for federal employees. Leaders express concern that these systematic rollbacks of worker protections are creating a crisis for the labor movement and the communities they represent.</p>

          <p>Originating from the 1999 film 'The Matrix,' the term "taking the red pill" has evolved from a simple metaphor for seeing a hidden truth into a cornerstone of a global, and often toxic, online subculture. Initially adopted by misogynistic "pick-up artist" communities, it now anchors the "manosphere," a collection of online forums promoting anti-feminist and conspiratorial worldviews. This ideology has spread worldwide, adapting to various cultures and merging with extremist narratives, with its concepts seeping into mainstream political discourse. Social media algorithms that reward provocative content have amplified these messages, raising concerns about their influence on young audiences and society at large.</p>

          <p>A significant number of beaches across the United States are reporting unsafe levels of fecal contamination, leading to health advisories that discourage swimming ahead of the Labor Day weekend. A recent report from Environment America found that nearly two-thirds of beaches tested in 2024 had at least one day with potentially unsafe bacteria levels. The contamination, which can cause gastrointestinal illness and rashes, is largely attributed to outdated sewer systems and stormwater runoff that overwhelm water infrastructure. The problem is widespread, affecting beaches on the East Coast, West Coast, Gulf Coast, and the Great Lakes.</p>

          <p>The Pickett fire in Northern California has caused an estimated $65 million in agricultural losses, primarily impacting wine grape growers in Napa Valley. Wineries like Robert Craig lost their entire crop from one vineyard due to both the fire and controlled burns set by firefighters to protect nearby towns. This event compounds the financial devastation from previous wildfires in 2020 and 2018, which also destroyed crops through direct heat damage and smoke taint. While the industry has developed strategies to mitigate fire risks, the recurring threat and soaring insurance costs pose a significant challenge to the region's family-owned wineries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that former President Trump's broad "reciprocal tariffs" on nearly all trading partners were an illegal overreach of presidential authority. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which Trump used to justify the levies, does not grant the power to impose taxes or duties. The decision upholds a lower court's ruling but allows the tariffs to remain in place until mid-October to give the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court. The ruling creates significant uncertainty for global trade and could have major economic and political ramifications depending on the final outcome. (not investment advice)</p>

However, sources involved in the project report that over $400,000 remaining in the budget, partly earmarked for public awareness campaigns, has been "zeroed out" without explanation.
