          <p>An Antonov-24 passenger plane operated by Angara Airlines crashed in Russia's Amur region while flying from Blagoveshchensk to Tynda. The aircraft was carrying 43 passengers, including five children, and six crew members when it disappeared from radar. A rescue helicopter later located the plane's burning fuselage on a mountainside approximately 10 miles from its destination. Authorities reported that initial aerial observations showed no signs of survivors, and rescue teams were being dispatched to the remote crash site.</p>

          <p>The White House has refuted reports claiming President Trump was informed that his name appears in Department of Justice documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. The Wall Street Journal alleged Attorney General Pam Bondi briefed the president on this, noting that an appearance in the files does not imply wrongdoing. A White House spokesperson dismissed the story as "fake news," part of a continued effort to undermine the president. This development occurs amid pressure on the administration to release more information about Epstein and a congressional push to subpoena the relevant files.</p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled against President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship, affirming it is unconstitutional. The 2-1 decision upholds a lower court's nationwide injunction that blocks the policy, which would deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are in the country illegally or temporarily. The court majority found the case met an exception to recent Supreme Court limits on nationwide injunctions, arguing it was necessary to provide complete relief to the states that filed the lawsuit. The Trump administration is expected to continue its legal challenges.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed executive orders to establish an "American AI Action Plan," which includes measures to prevent the federal government from using what he terms "woke AI." One order directs that government-procured AI models must be neutral and not sacrifice accuracy for ideological agendas like Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). The plan also aims to spur innovation by reducing regulations and create a program to support U.S. AI technology exports. The move reflects the administration's focus on cultural issues within technology policy and aims to position the U.S. as a global AI leader.</p>

          <p>Vehicle manufacturing in the United Kingdom during the first half of the year has dropped to its lowest point since 1953, not counting the COVID-19 pandemic period. Data from the SMMT shows car output declined by 7.3%, while van production plummeted by 45%, partly due to a plant closure. Uncertainty over U.S. tariffs contributed to the slowdown, though a recent deal may restore some confidence. While production of electric vehicles saw a slight increase, the industry faces significant challenges in meeting future government production targets and expresses concern over a lack of clarity in new EV grant schemes.</p>

          <p>China is confronting an unusual oversupply problem in its waste-to-energy sector, with a surplus of incineration capacity and not enough municipal solid waste to burn. Despite a 10% increase in waste generation since 2019, the country's incineration capacity has more than doubled, leaving an estimated 40% of it idle. This situation is attributed to overly optimistic planning, a slowdown in urbanization, and weaker economic growth. Experts note that this glut of incinerators highlights a significant miscalculation in infrastructure development, creating inefficiency in a sector intended to manage waste sustainably.</p>

          <p>A lawyer for Lauren Pisciotta, a former assistant to Kanye West, has stated that his client is in hiding and fearful after filing a lawsuit containing allegations of sexual assault, stalking, and harassment against the rapper. The amended civil suit accuses West, also known as Ye, of sex trafficking and oral sexual assault. West has denied the claims, calling them "fantasy fiction." The lawsuit also alleges that Pisciotta was a victim of "swatting" and received threatening calls after first filing her case, adding a layer of fear and intimidation to the ongoing legal battle.</p>

This wave of fundraising activity, particularly in the tech and consumer sectors, suggests that companies are capitalizing on improved market sentiment to shore up liquidity and finance future growth.

          <p>A tragic accident occurred in China's Inner Mongolia region, where six university students drowned during a field trip at a copper-molybdenum mine. The students, from Northeastern University, fell into a flotation tank at the mine's processing plant after a grating panel collapsed. A teacher was also injured in the incident. Despite being pulled from the tank, the students could not be revived. The victims were reportedly third-year students majoring in mineral processing engineering, and the incident has prompted an investigation into the safety conditions at the state-owned mining facility.</p>

While the trip is not formal, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is scheduled to hold talks with Trump in Scotland.

          <p>After a decade-long legal fight, former traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo have had their convictions for rigging the Libor inter-bank interest rate overturned. The ruling raises questions about the prosecution of individuals following the 2008 financial crisis, with the men's lawyers arguing they were made scapegoats. This successful appeal is expected to lead to other convicted traders challenging their sentences and has prompted calls for a public inquiry into the scandal. The focus may shift to the role of senior bank managers and the methods used by the Serious Fraud Office during its investigation.</p>

          <p>A growing crisis in student mental health is raising questions about the role and responsibility of universities in providing support. Students report feeling let down by "one-size-fits-all" services, while institutions struggle with increasing demand and limited resources. Academics, often the first point of contact, feel untrained to handle complex mental health crises. The debate centers on whether universities should have a formal duty of care, a move opposed by some who argue they are not clinical treatment centers and that expectations are unrealistic. The situation highlights a systemic challenge at the intersection of higher education and public health services.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve, a highly unusual move that escalates his public pressure campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell. This marks the first official presidential visit to the central bank in nearly two decades, challenging the long-standing tradition of respecting its political independence. Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not cutting interest rates and has even suggested he could fire the chairman. The visit is a powerful symbolic act, bringing the president's criticism directly to the institution he has frequently targeted for its monetary policy decisions.</p>

          <p>Amid a nationwide housing affordability crisis, states like Utah are increasingly intervening to compel local municipalities to allow for more affordable and denser housing. With median home prices soaring, many residents, including middle-class families, are being priced out of their communities. Utah has strengthened laws requiring cities to adopt strategies for affordable housing, but faces significant pushback from residents and local officials concerned about overcrowding and loss of local control. This tension between state mandates and "Not In My Back Yard" (NIMBY) sentiment highlights the growing struggle to address the critical shortage of attainable housing.</p>

MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged that while the event is important for business, the league needs to rethink the format to keep it competitive and appealing to players.
