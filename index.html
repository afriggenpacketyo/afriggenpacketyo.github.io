          <p>Following a militant attack that killed 26 people, Indian authorities have detained at least 1,500 people in India-administered Kashmir and destroyed homes linked to alleged militants. India has accused Pakistan of supporting the group that claimed responsibility for the attack, escalating tensions between the two nations. While the Pakistani prime minister expressed concern over the loss of lives and denied responsibility, Kashmiri residents report that Indian officials have taken punitive measures, including demolishing homes of suspected perpetrators.</p>
