          <p>A wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, has consumed 12,000 acres and is 35% contained, prompting a state of emergency and evacuations for 5,000 residents which have since been lifted. The New Jersey Forest Fire Service is working to fully contain the blaze, which has destroyed at least one business. Dry conditions and high winds have contributed to the fire's rapid spread, with officials warning that it could become the largest wildfire in New Jersey in 20 years. Power outages affected 25,000 homes, but restoration efforts are underway. </p>
