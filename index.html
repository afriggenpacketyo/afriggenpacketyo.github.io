          <p>The UK's transport secretary has announced that the government will soon reveal plans to lower the cost of purchasing an electric car. While declining to confirm if this involves direct subsidies, she highlighted a new £88 million investment package for charging infrastructure, including solutions for homes without driveways. The move aims to address consumer hesitancy driven by high upfront costs and 'range anxiety,' as the country progresses toward its 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales.</p>

          <p>Women's basketball icon Nancy Lieberman has publicly called for WNBA players to move past any jealousy and embrace rookie sensation Caitlin Clark. Comparing Clark's impact to that of Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods, Lieberman argued that Clark is a 'cash cow' who will elevate the entire league financially. She urged players to celebrate one another's successes, including those of stars like Angel Reese, and focus on playing rather than engaging in petty rivalries.</p>

          <p>Russia's defense ministry has announced the capture of the village of Myrne in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, part of an intensified offensive that has been ongoing for over three years. The ministry claimed its forces advanced deep into Ukrainian defenses to seize the territory.

          <p>A Senate committee report reveals that the U.S. Secret Service denied or failed to fulfill at least 10 requests for additional security resources for Donald Trump's 2024 campaign prior to the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. The report highlights significant communication failures and negligence, noting requests for assets like counter-snipers and drone defense were not met. The investigation found a lack of formal processes for resource requests and disciplined six personnel, though key figures involved reportedly faced no repercussions.</p>

          <p>As IUDs have grown in popularity as a form of birth control, so have reports of the significant pain many people experience during the insertion procedure. A new report explores why women's pain has historically been minimized in this context and how the medical community is starting to change its approach. Recent recommendations from the CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now urge doctors to proactively discuss and offer more robust pain management options, such as anesthetics.</p>
