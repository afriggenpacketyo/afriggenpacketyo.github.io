          <p>Former President Donald Trump has announced a plan to impose an additional 10% tariff on any country that aligns with what he terms the "Anti-American policies of BRICS." This threat was issued via social media as the BRICS summit convened in Brazil, where leaders from the bloc criticized unilateral protectionist measures. The announcement raises questions about how such alignment would be assessed and has been met with opposition from nations like China, which advocates against using tariffs as a coercive tool. This development adds another layer of uncertainty to global trade relations as a previous tariff pause is set to expire. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid the devastation of the Texas flash floods, a US Coast Guard rescue swimmer is being hailed as a hero for his life-saving efforts. Petty Officer 3rd Class Scott Ruskan, a 26-year-old from New Jersey, is credited with rescuing nearly 200 people, including 165 victims he personally saved as the sole triage coordinator at one scene. This was reportedly the first rescue mission of his career. His actions at Camp Mystic, where he and his team evacuated approximately 200 children from a campsite, have been singled out for praise by officials for their selfless courage.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall in South Carolina early Sunday morning. While tropical storm warnings have been canceled, the system continues to pose a threat of significant rainfall and potential flash flooding as it moves northeast into North Carolina and Virginia. Forecasters anticipate 2 to 4 inches of rain, with localized amounts up to 6 inches, prompting flood watches for the region. Dangerous surf and rip currents are also expected to persist along the Atlantic coast for several days.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to change its laws to grant parents the legal right to bereavement leave if they experience a miscarriage at any point during a pregnancy. This marks a significant expansion of the current law, which only provides for leave after a loss post-24 weeks. The amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will give parents crucial time off work to grieve without having to use sick leave. This move is being praised by advocates as a major step forward in recognizing the emotional toll of pregnancy loss and ensuring legal protections for grieving families.</p>

          <p>The first session of indirect ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, held in Doha, Qatar, has concluded without any significant progress being made. According to Palestinian sources close to the negotiations, the Israeli delegation was not sufficiently authorized to finalize an agreement. The talks, which were mediated by Qatari and Egyptian officials, lasted for over three hours but failed to bridge the gap between the two sides. Negotiations were expected to resume, but this initial outcome tempers hopes for an immediate breakthrough in the long-running conflict.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The flavor of American chocolate often differs significantly from its European counterparts due to distinct production methods and ingredients. US brands frequently prioritize a long shelf life, which involves using additives like butyric acid, giving the chocolate a slightly sour note that can be unfamiliar to other palates. In contrast, European chocolate is more strictly regulated, requiring higher cocoa solid content and traditional processes like conching for a finer texture. These differences reflect varying consumer preferences and historical development, with new markets in Asia and Africa now developing their own unique chocolate tastes.</p>

          <p>A recent Gallup survey highlighted by CNN reveals a dramatic drop in national pride among Democrats in the United States. The data shows that only 36% of Democrats now report being "extremely" or "very" proud to be American, a steep decline from 80% in 2015 when Barack Obama was president. This shift is particularly pronounced among the youngest generation of voters, Gen Z. In contrast, pride among Republicans has remained consistently high, rising slightly from 90% in 2015 to 92% today, illustrating a deepening partisan divide on sentiments of national identity.</p>

The defense argued there was no clear motive and that her actions were driven by panic. Ultimately, the jury rejected her narrative, concluding that the evidence pointed toward a calculated plan to murder her relatives.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence semiconductor startup Groq has announced its first European data center, located in Helsinki, Finland, as part of its international expansion. The company, which designs specialized chips for AI inferencing, is partnering with Equinix to tap into rising demand for AI services in Europe. This move aligns with the push for "sovereign AI" in the region and takes advantage of the Nordics' access to renewable energy. Groq is one of several startups competing to provide the hardware for running AI models, a market segment distinct from the AI training chip market dominated by Nvidia.</p>

          <p>There is growing but cautious optimism for a Gaza ceasefire as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu travels to Washington for talks with President Trump. A US-sponsored proposal for a 60-day truce and hostage release deal is on the table, with indirect talks between Israel and Hamas resuming in Qatar. The proposed framework reportedly involves a phased release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of Gaza. Despite positive signals, significant obstacles remain, primarily Hamas's insistence on a permanent end to the war, a condition Israel has consistently rejected.</p>

          <p>Fertility rates across the United States and the world have fallen to their lowest recorded levels, presenting profound long-term challenges. This demographic shift is largely driven by positive factors like increased economic independence and freedom for women, leading many to delay or opt out of parenthood. However, economists and demographers are concerned about the consequences, including aging populations, shrinking workforces, and immense strain on social safety nets like Social Security. This trend is sparking a political debate over pronatalist policies aimed at encouraging higher birth rates to avoid future depopulation.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is scheduled to visit China next week, where a key topic of discussion will be the controversial ownership of the Port of Darwin. The visit is intended as a positive gesture to maintain diplomatic relations, but Albanese will also need to articulate Australia's stance on Chinese investment. The port, leased to a Chinese-owned company, has been a point of strategic concern for Australia and its allies. This high-level discussion aims to address the sensitive issue directly with President Xi Jinping as part of broader conversations on trade and bilateral ties.</p>

          <p>Across Europe, the large-scale acquisition of residential properties by institutional investors like private equity firms has become a primary driver of the housing crisis. This article argues that treating housing as a financial asset class has pushed home ownership out of reach for many, inflated rents, and exacerbated inequality. While investors profit from housing shortages, residents face precarious conditions, fueling political discontent and the rise of far-right parties. Despite this, governments have often enabled this trend by weakening tenant protections and offering incentives, creating a system that prioritizes financial returns over social need.

In Kerr County, the Guadalupe River reportedly rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes during the night while many residents were asleep. The National Weather Service did issue a flash flood warning, but local authorities indicated they had no reason to believe the event would be so catastrophic and noted the county lacks a river-based warning system.

          <p>A new gene therapy has shown remarkable success in reversing a form of congenital deafness, according to a clinical trial from Sweden's Karolinska Institutet. The therapy involves a single injection into the inner ear that delivers a healthy copy of the OTOF gene, which is crucial for transmitting sound signals to the brain. In a small trial, all 10 participants showed considerable hearing improvement, with a seven-year-old girl regaining almost all of her hearing within months. The safe and well-tolerated treatment represents a major breakthrough with potential to treat other forms of genetic deafness.</p>

This lack of clarity has created uncertainty for importers and roiled Asian stock markets.
