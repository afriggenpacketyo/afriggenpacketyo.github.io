          <p>Israel announced an expanded military operation in Gaza, aiming to seize 'large areas' and establish 'security zones'.  This follows overnight Palestinian deaths and previous evacuation orders for thousands of Gazans. The move has drawn criticism amid worsening humanitarian conditions in Gaza, with Israel maintaining a blockade on aid since March 2nd.  The conflict stems from Hamas' October 7th attack, which killed over 1,200 and led to a prolonged war.</p>
