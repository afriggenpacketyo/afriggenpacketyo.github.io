          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently sold approximately $36.4 million worth of the company's stock as part of a pre-established trading plan. This transaction comes as Huang's personal net worth has surged to $143 billion, placing him nearly on par with Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett. The sale coincides with Nvidia's own significant milestone, having recently become the first company to exceed a $4 trillion market capitalization, driven by the ongoing boom in artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes the culture war controversy surrounding the new "Superman" film, which some critics have labeled "superwoke" following the director's comments about the character being an immigrant. It argues that Superman's origin as an outsider from another planet has always been a core part of his story, representing themes of assimilation and kindness. The piece suggests the backlash is overblown and reflects current political tensions rather than the film's actual content.</p>

          <p>More than 24 hours after a large-scale ICE raid at a farm in Camarillo, California, families are desperately seeking information about the approximately 200 migrants and several protesters who were arrested. Relatives and community advocates report that those detained have effectively disappeared, with federal agencies and consulates providing no information on their locations. Local organizations and consular offices have been inundated with calls from panicked family members trying to locate their loved ones.</p>

          <p>Chelsea is set to face a powerful Paris Saint-Germain team in the Club World Cup final, a match seen as a major test for the English club's youth-driven project. Despite PSG's recent dominant performances, Chelsea's manager Enzo Maresca stated the team will not abandon its attacking, possession-based style for a defensive approach. A victory in the final would offer significant validation for Chelsea's long-term strategy and their progress under the new ownership.</p>

          <p>An eight-year legal battle is underway between the owner of a multi-million pound penthouse on Park Lane and companies controlled by the family of the late Mohamed Al Fayed. The dispute, detailed in High Court filings, originated over a lift installation and has since grown to include allegations of leaky roofs and a noisy lift being operated maliciously at night. The Fayed-controlled companies deny the allegations and are counterclaiming for hundreds of thousands of pounds in unpaid ground rent.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their seventh consecutive loss, falling 8-7 to the rival San Francisco Giants. Despite their offense finally showing signs of life and scoring six runs against ace Logan Webb, an early deficit created by a poor start from pitcher Dustin May was too large to overcome. The loss marks the team's longest losing streak since 2017 and has reduced their lead in the division to just four games as they approach the All-Star break.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: International Law Has Consistently Failed to Protect Palestinians in Gaza</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece by author Raja Shehadeh argues that Israel's declared plan to move Palestinians into a contained camp in Rafah amounts to a crime against humanity. He contends that despite global outcry, international law has repeatedly failed to protect Palestinians or hold Israel accountable for its actions since 1948. The author suggests that true hope lies not in legal institutions, but in Palestinian resilience and the eventual emergence of the truth about their suffering.</p>
