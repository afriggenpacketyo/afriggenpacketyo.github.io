          <p>Attorneys for Tyler Robinson, accused of assassinating Charlie Kirk, are requesting a Utah judge to ban courtroom cameras and allow their client to appear in civilian clothing without restraints. The defense argues that extensive media coverage, public commentary, and viral videos have created a "content tornado" that threatens Robinson's right to a fair trial by potentially biasing the jury pool. They cite a Supreme Court decision restricting restraints unless specific security justifications exist, challenging the automatic application of standard policies in high-profile cases. The legal team also opposes remote appearances, asserting Robinson's right to be physically present for his capital prosecution.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice, under the Trump administration, plans to send federal election observers to Passaic County, New Jersey, and five counties in California for upcoming off-year elections. This initiative aims to ensure transparency and compliance with federal law, following requests from state Republican parties. Democrats in both states have condemned the move as an "intimidation tactic" and "election interference," fearing it could suppress voter turnout or sow distrust in results. While election monitoring is routine, the focus on these Democratic strongholds raises concerns about partisan motives, especially given past allegations of election fraud.</p>

          <p>Amid a trade dispute where President Trump accused Canada of misrepresenting Ronald Reagan's views on tariffs, the full text of Reagan's April 25, 1987, radio address is provided for comparison. In his speech, Reagan expressed reluctance to impose tariffs, stating they "hurt every American worker and consumer" in the long run and lead to trade wars. However, he also defended his specific decision to impose duties on Japanese semiconductors due to unfair trade practices, emphasizing a commitment to both free and fair trade. This article allows readers to independently assess the context of Reagan's original remarks.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has been conducting intermittent strikes on vessels suspected of carrying drug smugglers and illegal narcotics in international waters off South American coastlines since early September. President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth assert the operations are legal and do not require congressional authorization, citing the designation of certain cartels as terrorist organizations. At least 43 individuals have been killed in 10 disclosed strikes, prompting accusations of "murder" from Colombian President Gustavo Petro and concerns from some members of Congress about legality and potential escalation. The administration is now considering land strikes, further intensifying the anti-drug campaign.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is projected to strengthen into a hurricane by Saturday and a major hurricane by Sunday, bringing severe weather to the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica. Forecasters predict days of heavy rainfall, with up to 25 inches in some areas, raising the risk of "catastrophic" flash flooding and landslides. As of Friday evening, Melissa was moving north but is expected to turn west, potentially affecting Jamaica and eastern Cuba early next week. The storm, the 13th named system of the Atlantic season, is not anticipated to have significant impacts on the mainland United States.</p>

          <p>A manhunt has been launched in the UK for Hadush Kebatu, an Ethiopian national and former asylum seeker, who was mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford after being jailed for sexual assault. Kebatu, who sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl and another woman, was meant to be transferred to an immigration detention center for deportation. Justice Secretary David Lammy expressed outrage, calling Kebatu a "dangerous individual" and ordering an immediate investigation into the error. Police confirmed Kebatu boarded a London-bound train, and authorities are working urgently to locate him, acknowledging public concern over the situation.</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino has been ordered by a federal judge in Chicago to appear in court for allegedly violating a temporary restraining order. The order limits federal agents' tactics against protests and media coverage during immigration enforcement operations in Illinois. Plaintiffs accused Bovino of throwing tear gas canisters into a crowd of protesters, a move they argue breaches the court's prohibitions on riot control weapons and crowd dispersal without immediate safety threats. Bovino, however, defended his agency's tactics, citing nearly 2,700 arrests and "exemplary" force amid "chaos in the streets."</p>

Finance chief Steven Fasching noted that price increases due to tariffs are affecting consumer discretionary spending. Despite CEO Dave Powers downplaying long-term slowdown fears, the revised outlook and a lower full-year revenue forecast reflect significant market pressure and investor unease.

          <p>The U.S. is deploying the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier, the world's largest warship, to the Caribbean, significantly escalating its military presence in a campaign targeting alleged drug traffickers. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the move, which includes other warships and F-35 aircraft, following a series of U.S. airstrikes that have killed at least 43 individuals. While the administration frames this as a war on drug trafficking, experts and members of Congress question the legality and suggest it's an intimidation campaign aimed at destabilizing Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro.

          <p>Ferrari's Charles Leclerc set the fastest time in the first practice session of the Mexico City Grand Prix, outpacing Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli by just over a tenth of a second. Nine teams utilized rookie drivers during the session, with Red Bull's junior Arvid Lindblad impressing by finishing sixth. Championship leaders Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris, along with Max Verstappen, did not participate in this session. The dusty track conditions in Mexico often make the first practice less indicative of race performance, leading teams to use it for mandatory rookie sessions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration imposed sanctions on Colombian President Gustavo Petro, his wife, son, and Interior Minister, accusing them of involvement in the global drug trade. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated Petro "has allowed drug cartels to flourish," justifying the "strong action to protect our nation." This move escalates tensions between the U.S. and Colombia's first leftist leader, following deadly American strikes on alleged drug boats and Trump's prior threats to cut aid and impose tariffs. Petro has vowed to defend himself judicially against these "calumnies," while defending his anti-drug policy focused on crop substitution and combating money laundering.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kim Kardashian revealed a brain aneurysm diagnosis, attributing it to stress, prompting doctors to clarify the connection. While stress doesn't directly cause aneurysms, it can elevate blood pressure, a factor in their formation and growth. Experts like Dr. Brian Snelling and Dr. Greg Albers emphasize genetics, high blood pressure, smoking, and age as primary culprits. Brain aneurysms, a bulge in a blood vessel, are common and often asymptomatic unless they leak or rupture, leading to life-threatening brain bleeds. Doctors advocate for blood pressure control, avoiding smoking, and screenings for at-risk individuals, hoping Kardashian's disclosure raises awareness about women's health.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether the president can deploy troops in American cities despite objections from local and state officials, a decision with significant implications for executive power. The Trump administration appealed lower court rulings that blocked National Guard deployments in Chicago and Portland, arguing judges lacked authority to question the president's assessment of threats. Democratic officials and legal experts warn that a ruling favoring the president could establish a dangerous precedent for using the military as a "personal police force." Conservatives, however, cite historical precedents of federal intervention to enforce laws and protect federal functions.</p>

          <p>Six men have been jailed for their roles in a Russian-ordered arson attack on a London warehouse providing aid to Ukraine, causing £1.3m in damage. Ringleader Dylan Earl, recruited by the Wagner Group, received a 17-year sentence for a National Security Act offense and aggravated arson. This marks the first convictions under the new act, designed to tackle hostile state threats. The Ukrainian-owned warehouse was targeted for sending Starlink terminals and other goods to Ukraine. Judge Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb described the acts as a "planned campaign of terrorism and sabotage" in the interests of the Russian state, underscoring the real threat posed by foreign state actors.</p>

          <p>The EU is debating whether to use frozen Russian assets for Ukraine's war reparations, impacting millions of private Russian investors whose non-sanctioned securities are held in European depositories. These investors face immense difficulty reclaiming their assets due to complex legal procedures and prohibitive costs, with few successful cases reported. While the total frozen assets are estimated at €210 billion, including state reserves, private individuals account for about €12 billion, with an average of €2,400 per investor. Activists are calling for simplified procedures and transparency, but most private investors without Western residence permits may have to wait until sanctions are lifted. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US-Canada trade relations have derailed after President Trump terminated negotiations, angered by an Ontario-sponsored ad quoting Ronald Reagan denouncing tariffs. Trump labeled the ad "fraudulent" and "fake," despite Ontario's defense that it used an unedited excerpt from Reagan's 1987 address. Ontario Premier Doug Ford initially planned to re-run the ad during the World Series but later announced its pause to allow talks to resume. This dispute underscores deep frustrations and a fundamental shift in U.S. trade policy, with both countries facing critical deadlines, including the review of the USMCA and constitutional challenges to Trump's tariff authority.</p>

A Court of Appeal ruling on the legal definition of "enemy" in a separate Russian interference case underscored the need for clear factual evidence, which the government could not provide for China.
