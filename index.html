          <p>At least two firefighters were killed in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, after being shot at while responding to a wildfire on Canfield Mountain. The Kootenai County Sheriff's Office reported that first responders were under active sniper fire from a suspect using high-powered rifles, and the situation remained dynamic with the shooter at large. The incident prompted a shelter-in-place order for local residents and a massive law enforcement response, including FBI support, to neutralize the threat. Idaho's governor described the event as a "heinous direct assault" on the state's firefighters.</p>

          <p>Mexico is experiencing severe weather from two separate tropical systems on its Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Tropical Depression Barry made landfall south of Tampico, bringing heavy rain and winds, though it is expected to weaken as it moves inland. Simultaneously, Tropical Storm Flossie formed off the southwestern coast near Acapulco and is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane while remaining offshore. Both storms are predicted to cause significant rainfall and potential flooding in several Mexican states over the coming days.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned digital services tax after President Trump announced he was terminating all trade discussions with the country in response to the policy. The tax, which would have applied a 3% levy on large tech companies like Google and Amazon, was a point of major contention. Canadian officials stated the withdrawal is intended to facilitate the resumption of negotiations for a new comprehensive economic and security agreement with the United States. The move represents a significant reversal from Canada's earlier stance on the issue.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Russia's passive response to the recent Israeli and U.S. attacks on its ally, Iran, demonstrates Moscow's waning power on the world stage. Despite a strategic partnership and Iran's critical support for Russia's war in Ukraine, Moscow only offered verbal condemnation and mediation efforts instead of concrete military or diplomatic aid. The author contends that the war in Ukraine has exhausted Russia's military and financial resources, severely undermining its credibility and ability to support its allies. This inaction is presented as part of a broader pattern of strategic neglect.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is debating a massive legislative package central to President Trump's second-term agenda, which includes spending increases for defense and border security offset by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. A new Congressional Budget Office analysis estimates the bill would add nearly $3.3 trillion to the national deficit over a decade. Republicans are using the budget reconciliation process to advance the bill with a simple majority, while Democrats are employing delay tactics. The legislation's fate remains uncertain as GOP leaders work to secure votes from holdouts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, an increasing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are now studying. Studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs, particularly the regenerative braking systems, are a primary cause. This system, which converts kinetic energy back into battery power, can result in low-frequency deceleration that provokes queasiness. Researchers are investigating solutions to mitigate this effect and improve passenger comfort as the automotive industry continues its rapid transition to electric power.</p>

Grossi emphasized that Iran retains the industrial and technological capacity to rebuild its program and stressed the importance of allowing IAEA inspectors to resume their work to verify the status of nuclear materials.

          <p>Pep Guardiola, the manager of Manchester City, has voiced concerns that the expanded 32-team Club World Cup could negatively impact his team's 2025-26 season due to the demanding schedule. While acknowledging the income and prestige of the tournament, he admitted he tries not to think about the potential for player exhaustion to avoid anxiety. Guardiola's comments echo similar sentiments from other top managers who have criticized the increasingly crowded football calendar. He stated his main goal for the tournament is to recover the team's form, not to dwell on the future strain.</p>

          <p>Police in Istanbul detained more than 50 people who attempted to participate in the city's annual LGBTQ+ Pride parade, which has been officially banned by authorities since 2015. The governor had prohibited the event, claiming it "undermines social peace, family structure, and moral values." Despite a heavy police presence designed to prevent large gatherings, activists clashed with officers while carrying rainbow flags. The crackdown reflects an increasingly harsh stance against the LGBTQ+ community by President Erdogan's government, which human rights groups warn is fostering a hostile and discriminatory environment.</p>

The victim, using the pseudonym Hikari, alleges she was pressured to remain silent and was later slandered by a colleague who spread false rumors about her.

This move effectively marks the end of the city's organized pro-democracy political bloc, which has been systematically dismantled since the law was enacted.

          <p>This article examines the safety record of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, an aircraft once considered among the safest but now under scrutiny following a recent fatal crash and years of whistleblower allegations. While the 787 has flown for over a decade with a strong safety record, former and current employees have raised serious concerns about production standards, alleging that pressure to speed up manufacturing led to compromised quality control. These claims include the use of substandard parts and improper assembly, which Boeing has consistently denied. The analysis weighs the plane's operational history against these persistent and damaging allegations.</p>

          <h2>Chicago Sky defeats Los Angeles Sparks on the day the Sparks retired Candace Parker's jersey</h2>

          <p>The Chicago Sky spoiled the Los Angeles Sparks' celebration of Candace Parker's jersey retirement, securing a 92-85 victory at Crypto.com Arena. Sky rookie Angel Reese delivered a dominant performance with 24 points and 16 rebounds. The game was a tribute to Parker, who led both franchises to WNBA championships, and her No. 3 jersey was raised to the rafters in a halftime ceremony. Despite a third-quarter surge, the Sparks could not contain Reese and the Sky in the final period, resulting in a disappointing loss on an otherwise historic day for the franchise.</p>

          <h2>China cracks down on female authors of gay erotic fiction, sparking debate on censorship</h2>

          <p>Chinese authorities have launched a crackdown on authors of "danmei," a popular genre of gay erotic fiction written primarily by and for young women. At least 30 writers have been arrested since February for allegedly "producing and distributing obscene material," a charge that can lead to long prison sentences. The authors had published their work on Haitang, a Taiwan-hosted platform. The arrests have ignited a rare online debate in China about the country's vague and selectively enforced pornography laws, with many arguing they are used to suppress female sexuality and LGBTQ+ expression.</p>

          <h2>Analysis reveals shifting U.S. descriptions of Iran airstrike damage, raising questions about mission's success</h2>

          <p>A week after the U.S. attacked three Iranian nuclear sites, an analysis of official statements reveals a shifting narrative about the extent of the damage and the mission's primary goals. Initial claims by President Trump and the Defense Secretary that Iran's program was "obliterated" were later contrasted by preliminary intelligence assessments suggesting a more limited setback of only a few months. As the week progressed, top officials appeared to downplay the physical destruction, instead emphasizing that the strikes successfully prompted a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. This evolution in messaging has sparked ongoing questions about the true impact of the military operation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have a chance to set a new MLB record for the most position players voted as All-Star Game starters, with eight players advancing to the final phase of voting. The final 48-hour voting window opens Monday, with finalists at every infield position and two in the outfield. Shohei Ohtani has already secured the designated hitter spot by leading all National League players in the first phase. The current record for starters from a single team is five, a mark the dominant Dodgers hope to surpass when the final results are announced this week.</p>
