          <p>Jim Cramer identifies several reasons for market optimism, including the EU's willingness to fast-track trade talks and potential momentum in US-European relations following President Trump's shift in perspective on Russia. The US House's passing of a bill facing Senate resistance and Nvidia's upcoming earnings report with lowered expectations also contribute to this positive outlook. Cramer notes the S&P Oscillator is at a low risk level, further supporting his conviction that investors should have bought more, particularly Capital One and TJX. Cramer still likes Disney and believes Home Depot makes sense, though weather-related concerns exist. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he is pardoning Scott Jenkins, a former Virginia sheriff convicted of fraud and bribery for accepting cash in exchange for making businessmen sworn law enforcement officers. Trump claims Jenkins was a victim of a weaponized Biden DOJ, alleging the judge refused to allow evidence in his defense. Jenkins was found guilty on multiple counts, including conspiracy and honest services fraud, for taking $75,000 in bribes. Jenkins, a longtime Trump supporter, is the latest ally to receive a pardon from the former president.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece discusses President Trump's demand that retailers like Walmart absorb the costs of tariffs on goods from China, Vietnam, Canada, and Mexico. The author argues that this request defies fundamental business principles, as expenses should not exceed revenue, and criticizes the administration's denial of the impact of tariffs. While some companies like Home Depot, with founders who support Trump, may try to comply, it's unlikely their earnings will remain unaffected. The article concludes that businesses are afraid to speak honestly about the tax-like nature of tariffs for fear of retribution, engaging in self-satire that will ultimately be self-defeating.</p>

          <p>The ultra-rich are increasingly storing their gold offshore, particularly in Singapore, due to growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty. A six-story facility in Singapore called "The Reserve" has seen an 88% increase in orders to store gold and silver from the start of the year to April, compared to the same period in 2024. The surge is driven by concerns over tariffs, global changes, and potential geopolitical instabilities.

          <p>Japan has lost its position as the world's top creditor for the first time in 34 years, overtaken by Germany, despite an increase in its net external assets. Japan's gross external assets rose to 533.05 trillion yen ($3.7 trillion), but remained below Germany's 569.65 trillion yen. The yen's depreciation boosted the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets, while Germany benefited from a large current account surplus. The United States, in contrast, had a net external liability, indicating its foreign debts far exceeded its overseas assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a delay in implementing 50% tariffs on goods from the European Union until July 9, citing ongoing negotiations with the bloc. The decision followed a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who expressed a desire for serious negotiations. Trump's initial threat to impose tariffs on EU goods, along with threats on Apple products, had caused a stock market downturn. Von der Leyen affirmed the EU's readiness to advance talks swiftly to reach a beneficial agreement.</p>

          <p>A manhunt is underway in northern Arkansas for Grant Hardin, a former police chief convicted of first-degree murder and sexual assault, after he escaped from a high-security prison. Hardin, considered extremely dangerous, was wearing a makeshift law enforcement uniform when he escaped. Authorities are conducting interviews, reviewing surveillance footage, and retracing steps to determine how Hardin acquired the uniform and navigated through the prison.</p>

          <h2>Multilingual Emergency Alerts Delayed by Trump Administration</h2>

          <p>California Representative Nanette Diaz BarragÃ¡n is urging the FCC to follow through on plans to modernize the federal emergency alert system and provide multilingual alerts in natural disasters. This call comes after deadly fires in Los Angeles highlighted the need for alerts in languages other than English, particularly for Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. BarragÃ¡n expressed concern that the Trump administration's delays in publishing the necessary order in the Federal Register are jeopardizing the safety of millions of Americans with limited English proficiency.</p>
