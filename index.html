          <p>Matthew Ecker has been found guilty of second-degree murder for the 2022 shooting death of 32-year-old nurse Alex Pennig in her St. Paul apartment. Ecker, a former romantic partner, initially claimed Pennig had taken her own life, but investigators grew suspicious of his inconsistent story. A key piece of evidence was a small metal part from the bathroom door lock found under Pennig's body, suggesting the door was forced open before the shot was fired. Ecker was sentenced to 30 years in prison, while his family maintains his innocence and plans to appeal.</p>

          <p>Legendary New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera sustained a significant injury during the team's Old-Timers' Day game, tearing his achilles tendon while fielding a fly ball. The 55-year-old Hall of Famer, who is baseball's all-time saves leader, will require surgery to repair the damage. This incident marks the second major injury Rivera has suffered in a non-game situation, having previously torn his ACL in 2012. The injury cast a somber mood over the event, which was the first of its kind held by the Yankees since 2019.</p>

          <p>The fashion industry is witnessing a shift away from the subtle "quiet luxury" trend towards more visible and bold "loud luxury" styles. Analysts suggest this change is driven by major brands like Gucci and Burberry attempting to inject novelty and reignite consumer desire amid a sector-wide slowdown. After a period of discrete opulence, the re-emergence of large logos and statement designs is seen as a strategy to appeal to a broader customer base. This sartorial shake-up coincides with new creative leadership at several major fashion houses and follows a period of significant price hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the wake of a deadly shooting at the CDC's Atlanta headquarters, some employees have expressed that the attack, while terrifying, was not entirely surprising given the escalating hostility towards public health workers. The gunman, who killed a police officer before being found dead, was reportedly motivated by anti-vaccine beliefs. This article highlights that some CDC staff have internally criticized Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for what they see as fanning the flames of misinformation and hatred against the agency.

This action follows previous moves by the administration to freeze federal research money over allegations that the university failed to adequately address antisemitism on campus.

          <p>Six months after the Chinese AI app DeepSeek-R1 shocked Silicon Valley with its capabilities and low development cost, its long-term impact is being assessed. The app's launch challenged the prevailing "bigger is better" mindset in AI development and briefly erased $600 billion from Nvidia's market value. While DeepSeek is no longer a headline topic and faces security scrutiny over its Chinese origins, the article notes it prompted a shift in the industry towards more efficient, smaller models. However, major US tech giants appear to have returned to a strategy of massive spending on computing power and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Authorities have reported that the gunman who attacked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters in Atlanta believed a COVID-19 vaccine had made him depressed and suicidal. The suspect, identified as 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White, killed police officer David Rose before being found dead himself. The attack has drawn sharp criticism from former CDC employees towards Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom they accuse of fueling a climate of hostility against the agency. This incident highlights a rising trend of violence against healthcare professionals.</p>

          <p>US fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued an apology following controversy over a new Adidas sandal that authorities in Oaxaca, Mexico, say appropriates a traditional Indigenous design. The Mexican government is seeking compensation from Adidas, accusing the company of cultural appropriation for its "Oaxaca Slip-On," which reinterprets the local huarache sandal. Chavarria expressed deep regret that the design was not developed in partnership with the Oaxacan community. Adidas has also acknowledged the criticism and requested a meeting with local officials to discuss repairing the damage.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock experienced its largest weekly gain in over five years, rising 13% after CEO Tim Cook's visit to the White House. The surge added over $400 billion to Apple's market capitalization. During the visit, Cook announced plans to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts, a move that pleased President Trump, who in turn suggested Apple would be exempt from future tariffs on imported chips. This development eased investor concerns about the potential negative impact of tariffs on Apple's profitability and followed a strong quarterly earnings report. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>London police arrested 365 people on Saturday during a demonstration in support of Palestine Action, a pro-Palestinian group recently banned by the government. Supporters gathered outside the Houses of Parliament, intentionally violating the new law by displaying signs and placards for the organization. The ban was enacted after activists vandalized military planes to protest UK support for Israel. Protest organizers argue the law illegally restricts free expression and aimed to overwhelm the justice system, though police stated they successfully arrested those who were openly breaking the law.</p>

The event contrasted sharply with recent town halls held by Republicans, who have faced jeering crowds.

Under the proposal, offenders with fixed-term sentences could be deported right away and barred from re-entry, with their home countries deciding if they serve any remaining prison time. The government states this measure, which would not apply to those with life sentences, aims to save taxpayer money and protect the public. Critics have raised concerns that some countries may refuse to accept the deported individuals.</p>
