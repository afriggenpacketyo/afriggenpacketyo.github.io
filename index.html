        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to a continuing decline in visitor numbers, Las Vegas tourism authorities have initiated a large-scale promotional event called "The Fabulous 5-Day Sale." The campaign features significant discounts on hotels, shows, dining, and other attractions from dozens of participating resorts and venues across the city. This effort aims to counteract a notable drop in tourism, with visitor counts in July down significantly compared to the previous year, and is part of a broader strategy to attract travelers back to the city.</p>

          <p>A federal jury has awarded more than $9 million to a man who suffered two strokes during an eight-hour American Airlines flight from Miami to Madrid in 2021. The lawsuit successfully argued that the flight crew failed to follow company protocol by not diverting the plane for immediate medical assistance after being alerted to the passenger's initial symptoms. This delay in care resulted in severe and permanent disabilities for the man, and the jury found the airline liable under the Montreal Convention, which governs international air travel.</p>

          <p>Following ABC's decision to reinstate "Jimmy Kimmel Live!", major broadcast station owners Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair have announced they will not air the show's return. Both groups cited host Jimmy Kimmel's recent controversial comments linking the alleged killer of a conservative activist to the MAGA movement as the reason for their decision. This preemption highlights growing tensions between national networks like Disney-owned ABC and their local affiliate stations, creating a significant debate over content standards and political discourse in media.</p>

          <p>The New York Giants are making a significant change at quarterback, naming rookie Jaxson Dart as the starter for their upcoming game against the Los Angeles Chargers. The decision comes after the team's 0-3 start to the season and a poor performance by veteran Russell Wilson, which led to fans chanting for the rookie. Wilson, who has thrown three touchdowns and three interceptions this season, will now serve as the backup, as the team hopes to salvage its season with a new leader under center.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has described the current economic climate as a "challenging situation," pointing to a recent increase in inflation combined with a slowdown in hiring. Speaking in Rhode Island, Powell noted that the downside risks to employment have grown, which influenced the Fed's recent decision to cut interest rates. The central bank faces a difficult balancing act, as lowering rates to stimulate hiring could exacerbate inflation, creating conditions some economists refer to as "stagflation."

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a new policy imposing a $100,000 fee on all new applications for H-1B high-skill work visas. While the stated goal is to prevent companies from using the program to replace American workers with lower-wage foreign labor, this analysis argues the policy is a flawed solution. The article suggests the exorbitant fee could severely undermine American scientific research and technological progress by making it too costly for universities, nonprofits, and smaller companies to hire essential foreign talent, ultimately harming long-term economic growth.</p>

The ruling stated the government likely violated federal law by failing to provide specific explanations for the cuts, which primarily affected medical research grants from the National Institutes of Health. The funding freeze was part of a broader administration effort to pressure elite universities over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and diversity programs.</p>

          <p>Public health experts from around the world are expressing concern that recent U.S. government announcements questioning the safety of vaccines and the painkiller Tylenol could have damaging global consequences. They warn that when the U.S. promotes scientifically unsupported health claims, it can undermine trust in established medical guidance and local health authorities in other nations. This could lead to increased vaccine hesitancy and public confusion, making it harder to manage infectious diseases and provide proper medical care internationally.</p>

          <p>Days after introducing a staggering $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas, the Trump administration has proposed further revisions to the program. The new proposal from the Department of Homeland Security would change the allocation process to give preference to employers who offer higher wages to their H-1B applicants. The administration states this move is intended to better protect American jobs and prevent wage depression from foreign labor, adding another layer of uncertainty for companies relying on skilled overseas talent.</p>

          <p>The New York Liberty have announced they will not be renewing the contract of head coach Sandy Brondello. The decision comes less than a year after Brondello led the team to its first-ever WNBA championship title.

Their candidacies highlight the deep and ongoing divisions within the state's Republican party ahead of the 2026 election.</p>
