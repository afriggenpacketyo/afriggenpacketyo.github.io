          <p>San Diego Padres star reliever Mason Miller made MLB postseason history during a crucial Game 2 victory against the Chicago Cubs, helping his team avoid elimination. Miller's ninth pitch of the night, a scorching 104.5 mph fastball, became the fastest recorded in postseason history since pitching track began in 2008, impressively striking out Cubs catcher Carson Kelly. He dominated the Cubs lineup, striking out all five batters he faced over 1.2 innings, showcasing the strength of the Padres' bullpen. This stellar performance, coupled with Manny Machado's two-run homer, secured a 3-0 win and forced a decisive Game 3 in the Wild Card series, underscoring the team's resilience and determination.</p>

          <p>China's three most economically significant cities have implemented new policies to alleviate property sector weakness, aiming to stabilize the industry and boost consumer sentiment. Analysts suggest these efforts, seen as a crucial defense for the real estate market, might lead to short-term regional rebounds but won't quickly end the broader slump. The property sector's decline significantly impacts over a dozen related industries and consumer confidence, contributing to the economy's current challenges. Despite maintaining around 5% growth, China faces persistent household deleveraging and trade tensions, making property stabilization vital for sustained economic health.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made history by becoming the first individual to achieve a net worth exceeding $500 billion, with his fortune briefly reaching $500.1 billion. This unprecedented wealth accumulation is attributed to the rising valuations of Tesla, his artificial intelligence startup xAI, and rocket company SpaceX. The milestone firmly establishes Musk as the world's richest person, significantly ahead of other tech billionaires. His wealth is closely tied to his substantial stake in Tesla, whose shares have seen a sharp increase this year as investors welcome Musk's renewed focus on his companies rather than political engagements.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced a freeze on approximately $18 billion in federal funding for two major New York City infrastructure projects, the Hudson Tunnel Project and Second Avenue Subway. This action, targeting the home state of Democratic congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, occurred on the first day of a government shutdown. The White House cited a review into potential 'unconstitutional DEI principles' as the reason for the halt, with the Department of Transportation linking the freeze to the ongoing funding lapse. Democratic leaders condemned the move as politically motivated, arguing it would harm America's competitiveness and cost thousands of jobs.</p>

          <p>An Alabama construction worker and U.S. citizen, Leo Garcia Venegas, has filed a class-action lawsuit after being detained twice by immigration agents within weeks. The lawsuit, filed with the Institute for Justice, seeks to end what it calls "unconstitutional and illegal immigration enforcement tactics" targeting industries with large immigrant workforces. Venegas, born in the U.S., alleges agents targeted Latino-looking workers without warrants or suspicion, even after he presented his Real ID driver's license. The Department of Homeland Security dismissed the suit as "race-baiting opportunism," stating enforcement targets illegal presence, not ethnicity, but did not explain Venegas's detentions.</p>

Netanyahu later apologized for the strike during a meeting with Trump, assuring no repeat attacks.

          <p>The federal government initiated a shutdown after lawmakers failed to reach an agreement on extending government funding by the midnight deadline. The impasse stems from disagreements between Republicans and Democrats, with Democrats advocating for health care tax credits to be included in a funding measure, a demand Republicans oppose. This failure led to hundreds of thousands of federal workers being furloughed without pay, while essential employees continue working. The funding dispute highlights Congress's perennial challenge in approving spending bills by the fiscal year deadline, often resorting to stopgap measures to avoid economically and politically costly shutdowns.</p>

Mayor Pat Burns, a staunch supporter of President Trump, spearheaded the initiative, arguing that illegal immigration negatively impacts the city without clear accountability. This non-sanctuary status allows local police to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts, a stance that conflicts with California's restrictions on such collaboration. Despite federal attempts to withhold grants from sanctuary jurisdictions being struck down in courts, Huntington Beach aims to make a statement and encourages other cities to adopt a similar approach.</p>

Crucially, it clarifies that basic olive oil is suitable for shallow frying, while vegetable or sunflower oil is superior for deep frying due to higher smoke points, contrary to popular belief.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has significantly increased its drone attacks on Russian oil refineries, leading to fuel shortages and rising prices in various parts of Russia, according to a BBC investigation. Analysis shows 21 of Russia's 38 large refineries have been hit this year, with successful attacks up 48% compared to the whole of 2024. These strikes, some deep inside Russia, have forced at least ten refineries to suspend operations, causing long queues at petrol stations and rationing in occupied Crimea. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky views these attacks as a key strategy to pressure Russia into negotiations and restrict its war-funding capabilities, despite official denials from the Kremlin about the severity of the situation.</p>

          <p>Many individuals who win employment tribunal awards, like Nadine Fallone who was granted nearly £65,000 for unfair treatment and dismissal, are struggling to receive their rightful payments. A BBC investigation reveals that over 5,000 out of 7,000 claimants using a government scheme designed to tackle non-payments have yet to receive their money. Nadine's former company went into administration, leaving her unable to recover her award, despite the scheme's intention to penalize non-paying companies. The data indicates a significant gap between penalties issued and actual payments received, with not a single employer named online despite thousands of requests, highlighting a "completely broken" system.</p>

The Norway midfielder's stellar performance in a 2-0 Champions League win against Olympiacos, where he contributed to both goals, underscored his crucial role for the Gunners. Despite a disrupted start to the season due to a shoulder injury, Odegaard has returned with impactful displays, including delivering a stoppage-time corner that secured a comeback win against Newcastle.

The criminals, calling themselves Radiant, had begun publishing profiles of approximately 8,000 children and contact details for parents, demanding a Bitcoin ransom from Kido Schools. Public revulsion and threatening phone calls to parents appear to have forced the hackers to backtrack, stating they were "sorry for hurting kids." While Kido did not pay the ransom, past incidents show hackers often fail to permanently delete stolen data, raising ongoing concerns about the breach's long-term impact.</p>

          <p>YouTube has settled a lawsuit with former President Donald Trump for $24.5 million, reinstating his channel after its suspension following the January 6 Capitol riot. This settlement, which directs funds to the Trust for the National Mall, marks the latest instance of major tech companies financially resolving disputes with Trump over content moderation decisions. The article suggests these settlements reflect corporate cowardice and a shift by tech giants towards a lighter touch on moderation, effectively arguing their initial suspensions were wrong. This pivot aligns with broader trends from Meta and X, signaling a move away from stringent content policing and a re-emphasis on "free expression."</p>

          <p>The White House announced that mass layoffs of US federal workers are imminent, potentially within two days, as the government shutdown continues with no resolution in sight. Vice-President JD Vance and Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt blamed Democrats for the impasse, accusing them of political games over healthcare funding. Democrats, however, assert they are trying to negotiate to protect healthcare benefits for lower-income Americans, while Republicans insist on a temporary stop-gap measure. The prolonged shutdown threatens hundreds of thousands of jobs and risks significant economic costs, with the administration also hinting at permanent layoffs if the standoff drags on.</p>

Haaland criticized the team's lack of energy and failure to maintain first-half dominance, stating, "it's not good enough." This result highlights a concerning trend for City of conceding crucial late goals, dropping points in both the Premier League and Champions League, and raising questions about their ability to secure major trophies this season.</p>
