          <h2>Music Industry Grapples with Rise of Viral AI-Generated Artists</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 05:35:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The emergence of AI-generated music acts like "The Velvet Sundown," which has amassed over a million monthly listeners on Spotify, is causing significant concern within the music industry. While AI tools have long been used in production, new platforms enable the creation of entire songs from simple prompts, leading to a surge in synthetic content. This trend raises complex questions about authorship, copyright, and the financial viability of human artists, who find it increasingly difficult to compete for attention and revenue. Major record labels are now pursuing legal action against AI music platforms for alleged mass copyright infringement, signaling a major battle for the future of music creation.</p>

          <h2>Frustration Grows Among Trump Supporters Over Unreleased Jeffrey Epstein Files</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 05:30:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Patience is wearing thin among some of Donald Trump's most loyal supporters over the administration's failure to release a rumored "client list" associated with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Despite the Justice Department stating it has found no evidence such a list exists, a faction of the MAGA movement feels betrayed by what they see as a broken promise to expose high-profile individuals. This has led to online backlash against top officials like Attorney General Pam Bondi and created a rare fissure within Trump's base. While some supporters remain confident that Trump will release the files when the time is right, others are demanding immediate accountability and justice.</p>

          <p>Belgium's renowned electronic dance music festival, Tomorrowland, is set to continue as planned despite a massive fire destroying its main stage just days before opening. The blaze occurred on Wednesday evening in the town of Boom, but fortunately resulted in no injuries. Organizers have assured the 400,000 expected attendees that the event will proceed, with contingency plans being developed in coordination with safety experts and local authorities. While the loss of the elaborate main stage is a significant blow, the festival features 14 other stages, and officials are focused on finding solutions to ensure the event can go on safely for the thousands of campers already arriving.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has set a new world record in women's football by signing 20-year-old Canadian forward Olivia Smith from Liverpool for a £1 million fee. The move, which breaks the previous record of £900,000, sees Smith sign a four-year deal with the Champions League holders. Smith, who made her international debut at 15, is considered one of the most exciting young talents in the Women's Super League, having scored seven goals in 20 games for Liverpool last season. The landmark transfer highlights Arsenal's ambition to strengthen their squad and signifies major financial growth and investment within the women's professional game.</p>

          <p>At least four people were killed and many others injured in Bangladesh during violent clashes between security forces and supporters of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The violence erupted in Gopalganj district when members of a new student-led political party attempted to hold a rally commemorating the anniversary of the uprising that removed Hasina from power. Supporters of Hasina's Awami League party reportedly attacked police and set vehicles on fire. The incident underscores the ongoing political turmoil and polarization in Bangladesh under the interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, who took power 11 months ago promising to restore stability.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is showing clear signs of weakening, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.7%, its highest level in four years. Concurrently, the number of job vacancies has been falling for three consecutive years, and the annual rate of pay growth has slowed to 5%. Analysts suggest these trends, partly attributed to a recent rise in employer national insurance contributions, are increasing the likelihood of an interest rate cut by the Bank of England next month. The government acknowledged the need for further economic improvement, while the opposition criticized the rising unemployment as a significant concern for families nationwide.

She fears that Russian financial influence has corrupted the FIE, potentially leading to scandals that could jeopardize its Olympic status, similar to what happened with the International Boxing Association.

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the increasing use of profane and vulgar language by public officials, arguing that it represents a coarsening of the country's discourse. The author notes that while such language was once strictly forbidden in broadcasting and public life, it is now becoming more common, citing California Governor Gavin Newsom's recent use of a profanity on a podcast. The piece questions the assumption that there is no political cost to this trend, suggesting that many voters in the political center are still repelled by such language. The author concludes that maintaining standards of civility is a virtue, not a weakness, in political communication.</p>

He stated that AI can help decipher the meaning of proteins, cells, and life itself, which will enable the design of new drugs to help people live longer. This focus on scientific application, he believes, will ultimately yield more profound results than AI's use in other domains.</p>

          <p>Director Ari Aster's new film, "Eddington," is a period piece set in a fictional New Mexico town during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020. The movie, described as a Western, dramatizes the cultural and political divisions of the era through a standoff between a mayor enforcing mask mandates and a sheriff who believes in personal choice. Aster, who experienced the lockdowns in New Mexico, aims to sympathetically portray the paranoia and deepening convictions that pushed people into different realities. The film explores how these societal fissures logically progress toward violence, serving as a critique of a landscape where political division has made mutual understanding seem impossible.</p>

The new Maryland law allows the state to tap into a $25 million account, funded by fees from insurers on the ACA marketplace, to provide grants to these organizations.

          <p>The Labour Party is investigating remarks made by veteran MP Diane Abbott, in which she reiterated controversial views on racism that previously led to her suspension. In a BBC interview, Abbott stood by her 2023 assertion that racism against Black people is different from prejudice experienced by Jewish people or Travellers, arguing that skin color makes it distinct. Her original comments in a letter to the Observer were condemned as antisemitic, and she was only readmitted to the party after a year-long suspension. A Labour spokesperson stated the party takes the new comments "incredibly seriously" and will assess them under its disciplinary rules.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas Sands has broken ground on a new $8 billion integrated resort in Singapore, a major expansion of its presence in Asia. The project, adjacent to the existing Marina Bay Sands, is being presented as a brand-new identity rather than an extension. The development will feature a 55-story all-suite hotel with 570 rooms, luxury retail, gaming facilities, and a 15,000-seat arena. A key highlight is the 'Skyloop' rooftop space, which will include an observation deck, restaurants, and multiple infinity pools. The massive investment aligns with Singapore's long-term strategy to boost tourism revenue by attracting high-value leisure and business travelers.</p>

          <p>After years of delays, Elon Musk's business ambitions in India are finally moving forward, with Tesla opening its first showroom in Mumbai and Starlink receiving regulatory approval for commercial services. This analysis suggests the pivot is part of a broader global diversification for Musk, offering a new growth market as his relationships in the U.S. and China become more complex. Tesla is initially targeting India's premium segment with its high-priced Model Y, while Starlink is positioned to address the underserved rural internet market. These moves signal growing confidence in India's economy, though significant challenges remain, including building out a robust EV charging infrastructure.</p>

The package targets approximately $8 billion from foreign assistance and $1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the 'Smurfette principle,' a term coined in 1991 to describe the pop culture trope of having a single female character in an otherwise all-male ensemble. The upcoming "Smurfs" animated film, starring Rihanna as the voice of Smurfette, brings this concept back into focus. The piece traces how the franchise has previously attempted to address its gender imbalance, including introducing a village of all-female Smurfs in a 2017 film, though this also drew criticism. The analysis reflects on how this 'gentler form of misogyny' persists in media and how brands attempt to navigate evolving social values, sometimes for reasons that appear more commercial than ideological.</p>

Li urged automakers to practice self-discipline in pricing and compete through innovation rather than just cost-cutting.

This development points toward a deliberate act rather than an accident, intensifying the investigation into the captain's background, including reports of mental health struggles.

The sackings were attributed not to a single vote but to a pattern of organizing against the government.

          <p>A weather system moving across the Gulf of Mexico is threatening to bring heavy rainfall and significant flooding to the northern Gulf Coast, with a high chance of developing into a tropical depression. The National Weather Service has warned that areas from southeastern Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle could see substantial downpours through the weekend. New Orleans is bracing for 3 to 5 inches of rain, with some coastal areas potentially receiving up to 10 inches. Regardless of whether the system intensifies into a named storm, officials are urging residents to be proactive, with volunteers already distributing sandbags in preparation for the potential floods.</p>
