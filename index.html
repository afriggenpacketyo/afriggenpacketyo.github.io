          <h2>UK Police Update Guidance on Releasing Suspects' Demographics</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 03:07:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New guidance from the National Police Chiefs' Council encourages UK police to disclose the ethnicity and nationality of suspects charged in high-profile and sensitive investigations. This significant policy shift aims to combat misinformation and enhance public trust, particularly after incidents like the alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old in Warwickshire, where false information contributed to public unrest. While decisions on releasing such details remain with individual forces, the guidance seeks to ensure more consistent, fair, and transparent policing in an age of rapid information spread. It also clarifies that verifying a suspect's immigration status is the Home Office's responsibility, not the police's, aiming for clearer public information policies.</p>

          <p>NPR's science correspondent Nell Greenfieldboyce explores new research into robot personalities, challenging the common programming of AI to be solely extraverted and cheerful. Researchers are experimenting with different temperaments, including more neurotic or anxious traits, similar to characters like C-3P0. This exploration aims to understand what makes robots more relatable to humans, suggesting that a broader range of emotional expressions could foster deeper connections. The article delves into the potential for more complex and nuanced human-robot interactions.</p>

          <p>Nine-time Grand Slam champion Monica Seles has revealed her diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, a neuromuscular autoimmune disease, three years ago. The 51-year-old decided to go public with her condition, which causes muscle weakness, to raise awareness ahead of the US Open. Seles first noticed symptoms, such as double vision, about five years ago and described the difficulty of absorbing and speaking openly about the long-term illness. Her decision aims to use her platform to educate others about this rare condition.</p>

          <p>Approximately 100 individuals, primarily women, organized a "not welcome" protest in Charlbury, Cotswolds, targeting US Vice-President JD Vance during his holiday. Organized by the Stop Trump Coalition, participants criticized Vance's policies and stances, including his treatment of Volodymyr Zelenskyy and environmental views. The protest highlighted local concerns about the Cotswolds becoming a retreat for the wealthy and powerful, with residents expressing strong opposition to his presence and the disruption caused by the increased security. The event underscored local sentiment against the Vice-President's political alignment.</p>

They aim to ensure no decisions are made without Ukraine's involvement, particularly regarding potential "swapping of territories" in the Donbas region, which Trump has suggested. Zelenskyy has firmly rejected any concessions, emphasizing that such a move could invite future Russian attacks.

          <h2>UK Councils Lower Swimming Pool Temperatures Due to Soaring Energy Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 02:25:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation reveals that over one in seven UK councils have reduced swimming pool temperatures since 2020, primarily due to soaring energy costs. This measure, while saving money, has raised concerns among critics, including individuals with muscular dystrophy, who find the colder water detrimental to their health and ability to swim. The Local Government Association acknowledges councils' fragile financial positions, but advocates urge for reconsideration, highlighting the importance of these facilities for public health. The article underscores the impact of economic pressures on local public services.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, which formed in the eastern Atlantic, is projected to intensify into the Atlantic's first hurricane of the season. Forecasters anticipate it could become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands later in the week, though its longer-term path remains uncertain for the US. The storm has already caused deadly flooding in Cabo Verde, resulting in at least eight fatalities and a declared state of emergency. This development signals a potentially active period as the Atlantic hurricane season enters its peak months.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity has made a surprising $34.5 billion takeover bid for Google's Chrome internet browser, citing a commitment to user safety and the open web. Perplexity stated that an independent Chrome operator would benefit the public, and proposed keeping Google as the default search engine while maintaining Chromium. However, technology industry investors view the offer as a "stunt" and significantly undervalued, questioning its seriousness and whether Chrome is even for sale. This comes as Google faces antitrust scrutiny, with a ruling potentially ordering a breakup of its search business. (not investment advice)</p>

The historic location, once Russian territory, adds symbolic weight. While Trump expressed optimism for a "constructive" meeting, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is not expected to attend in person, emphasizing that "talks about us, without us, will not work."</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore hundreds of suspended UCLA science research grants, totaling $584 million, ruling that the government's actions violated a previous injunction against grant terminations. The administration had frozen funds citing alleged discrimination and antisemitism at the university, demanding over $1 billion for restoration. This ruling is a significant win for UCLA researchers, allowing them to resume critical studies in areas like cancer and clean energy. It challenges the administration's perceived political motivations behind the cuts, providing leverage for the university in ongoing disputes.</p>

This raises concerns about the scope of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, as nearly half of all ICE detainees reportedly lack a criminal record. Despite official assertions that DACA status does not confer legal protection, immigration attorneys question the precedent and the implied threat of deportation for "dreamers."</p>
