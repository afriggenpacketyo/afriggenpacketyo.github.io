          <p>The U.S. Attorney General has directed a federal prosecutor to convene a grand jury to investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia probe. This action follows the declassification of documents and the findings of the Durham report, which criticized the FBI's initial investigation for lacking rigor. The proceedings will examine allegations that the "Russiagate" narrative was a politically motivated effort to undermine Donald Trump, potentially targeting former intelligence and law enforcement officials for indictment.</p>

          <p>According to a report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the adoption of artificial intelligence was cited as a reason for over 10,000 job cuts in the U.S. during the first seven months of 2025. The technology sector has seen the most significant layoffs, with AI reshaping the industry and reducing the availability of some entry-level corporate roles. While other factors like federal budget cuts and retail sector challenges currently have a larger impact, AI is emerging as a critical factor in workforce reductions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York City police arrested more than 40 protesters who were part of a demonstration against the war in Gaza, organized by the Jewish-American group IfNotNow. Hundreds had gathered to demand the U.S. government pressure Israel to end the conflict and allow more humanitarian aid into the territory, citing the worsening humanitarian crisis. The protest culminated in a sit-in on the street outside the Trump International hotel, leading to the arrests for blocking traffic.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court decision, U.S. border agents have reportedly been directed to cease deportations based on the Trump administration's broad asylum ban. A D.C. Circuit Court panel partially limited the ban, stating it could not be used to completely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum seekers. This ruling is a significant development in the ongoing legal battles over the administration's restrictive immigration policies at the U.S.-Mexico border, forcing officials to process migrants under existing law.</p>
