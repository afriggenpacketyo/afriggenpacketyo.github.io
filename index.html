          <p>A Russian missile and drone barrage in Kyiv killed at least 15 people, including a U.S. citizen, and wounded dozens more, marking one of the deadliest attacks on the Ukrainian capital in recent months. The attack lasted nearly nine hours, targeting residential buildings and destroying numerous apartments, with emergency workers responding to rescue people from under the rubble. The strikes occurred as world leaders convened at the Group of Seven meeting in Canada, where Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was expected to attend. Russia has escalated attacks after Ukraine's Security Service agency staged an operation targeting war planes in air bases deep inside Russian territory. The attack underscores the ongoing intensity of the conflict and its devastating impact on civilian populations. The loss of life and destruction highlight the urgent need for de-escalation and a peaceful resolution. </p>

          <p>The Leipzig Bach Festival is exploring themes of war, discrimination, and transformation through contemporary arrangements of Johann Sebastian Bach's masterpieces. The festival includes performances such as the "Queer Passion," which addresses the suffering of LGBTQ+ people, particularly in countries like Russia and the USA, and the "Arabian Passion," which promotes peace between the West and the East amidst Middle East conflicts. This year's festival motto is "transformation," reflecting changes in the economy, the digital world, and the climate, and how these themes resonate within Bach's music. The festival also celebrates the 75th anniversary of the Leipzig Bach Archive, showcasing Bach's enduring relevance in addressing contemporary issues. Bach's music is being presented in new and relevant ways, highlighting its power to address issues of oppression and conflict. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has requested funding from Congress for a "Golden Dome for America," a missile defense system inspired by Israel's Iron Dome. The system aims to protect the entire United States, but experts note that building such a system would be significantly more complex than Israel's due to the country's larger size and the types of missiles it would need to defend against. While Israel's Iron Dome intercepts many missiles, building a similar system in the U.S. presents substantial challenges. The proposal highlights ongoing debates about national security and defense strategies. </p>

          <p>Esfandyar Batmanghelidj argues that Israel's attacks have disrupted Iran's trajectory toward liberty and prosperity, which had been slowly improving due to the efforts of the Iranian people. Despite the oppressive government, Iran had been experiencing improvements in its political, economic, and social conditions. The election of President Masoud Pezeshkian aimed to repair Iran's social contract, and there had been modest progress in regaining the electorate's trust. Negotiations for a nuclear deal with the US were underway, but Israel's attacks have undermined these efforts, demonstrating a contempt for the agency and aspirations of the Iranian people. The situation has shifted control of Iran's future away from its people, leaving them uncertain about what lies ahead. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's comments on the Israel-Iran conflict have been ambiguous, ranging from support for Israel's strikes to distancing himself from them, further complicated by his early departure from the G7 summit. Trump's options include escalating the conflict under pressure from Netanyahu, maintaining the current course, or pulling back based on concerns from his supporters. Escalation could involve direct US military action, while holding the course means continuing current levels of support for Israel. Pulling back would align with his "America First" policy but could face criticism from Republicans in Congress. The situation is highly volatile, with significant risks and potential consequences for Trump's legacy. </p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to slow the pace of reducing its monthly government bond purchases beyond April next year, while maintaining its interest rate at 0.5 percent. The BOJ's move reflects a cautious approach to normalizing monetary policy amid economic uncertainties, particularly due to U.S. President Donald Trump's higher tariffs. The central bank will scale back its debt buying by 200 billion yen per quarter, down from the current 400 billion yen, aiming for a total purchase amount of about 2 trillion yen in early 2027.

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has ruled that directives from the Trump administration that led to the cancellation of several research grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) were "void" and "illegal." The judge stated that the cancellations, which affected studies involving LGBTQ+ issues, gender identity, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), violated federal law. The judge ordered the NIH to restore the terminated grants. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has stated it will explore legal options, while plaintiffs like Dr. Brittany Charlton expressed relief and hope following the ruling. </p>
