          <p>A 29-year-old man, Fernando Ramirez, has been charged with 37 counts of attempted murder after allegedly driving his car into a crowd outside a Hollywood nightclub. The incident, which occurred after the suspect was removed from the venue, resulted in numerous injuries, with eight people suffering great bodily harm. Authorities have described the act as brazen and noted the suspect has an extensive history of violence, being out on bail for a separate case at the time. A second individual who shot Ramirez during the ensuing altercation remains at large.</p>

          <p>The death of Phillip Reeder, a 53-year-old Alabama man who was kneeled on by an Irondale police officer in 2024, has been officially ruled a homicide by the county coroner. The autopsy report concluded his death was caused by restraint during an altercation combined with hypertensive heart disease and cocaine use. Reeder's family alleges he was unarmed and experiencing a mental health crisis when officers used a stun gun and excessive force. The family's attorney compared the incident to the death of George Floyd, stating an officer's knee was on Reeder's neck.</p>

          <p>The Hershey Company is implementing a low double-digit price increase across its candy portfolio, citing the unprecedented rise in global cocoa costs. The price of cocoa has soared due to poor weather conditions and crop diseases in West Africa, creating a global supply shortage. In response, Hershey plans to focus more on products that are less cocoa-intensive as part of a broader strategy to become a "snacking powerhouse." The company's share price increased following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

The recent reassignment of Vice Admiral Yvette Davids, the first female head of the Naval Academy, is cited as the latest example in a series of firings of high-ranking female officers. The author contends these actions reflect Hegseth's documented views against what he calls "social engineering" in the military.

          <p>President Trump indicated he is considering the elimination of the federal capital gains tax on home sales, a move that would significantly alter real estate taxation. Currently, sellers can exclude up to $250,000 ($500,000 for joint filers) in profit from their taxable income, a figure unchanged since 1997. Proponents, like the National Association of Realtors, argue the current tax creates a "stay-put penalty," discouraging older homeowners from selling and thus limiting housing inventory. Critics, however, suggest that eliminating the tax would primarily benefit wealthy homeowners and could further inflate home values. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Legendary cricketer Katherine Sciver-Brunt has questioned the mindset of some current England players following their one-day international series defeat to India. Sciver-Brunt, England's all-time leading wicket-taker, suggested that some players on the field appear timid or even "lazy," lacking the outward passion she was known for. She speculated that some players may be scared to fail, leading to misfields and a lack of aggressive play. In response, current captain Nat Sciver-Brunt and coach Charlotte Edwards defended the team's commitment and professionalism, stating that outward appearances don't always reflect a player's internal drive.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board has determined the probable cause of the 2023 plane crash that killed Eugene Peltola Jr., husband of former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola. The report states the small plane was overweight with moose meat and that a set of moose antlers mounted to a wing strut created significant drag. These factors, combined with turbulent conditions and downdrafts, likely resulted in the aircraft having insufficient power to avoid crashing into terrain in remote western Alaska. Peltola was the sole occupant of the plane at the time of the accident.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's recent surge of erratic posts on Truth Social as a sign of desperation amid the escalating Jeffrey Epstein scandal. The author argues that Trump's behavior, including posting extreme-sports compilations and AI-generated images of his political rivals in jail, has devolved into a form of "Executive Cope." Unable to control the narrative or silence his critics on the Epstein issue, Trump is retreating into a social media fantasy world where he is a universally beloved hero with unilateral power. This behavior suggests a president who feels powerless and is increasingly detached from reality.</p>
