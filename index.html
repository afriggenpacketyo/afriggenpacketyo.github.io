        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's foreign ministry spokesman, Guo Jiakun, issued a stern warning against external interference in the China-South Korea relationship, emphasizing its foundation in mutual interests and non-targeting of any third party. This diplomatic statement closely follows South Korean President Lee Jae-myung's recent assessment that Seoul must rebalance its ties with Beijing due to escalating US-China competition. Lee articulated that South Korea can no longer sustain its historical strategy of relying on the US for security while simultaneously cooperating economically with China, stressing that its actions cannot diverge from America's core policy stance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wuliangye Yibin, China's second-largest liquor distiller, reported its slowest earnings growth in a decade, with first-half net profit rising only 2.3 percent. This significant downturn is directly attributed to the intensified anti-corruption campaign, which has curbed ostentatious spending, alongside a broader slowdown in the Chinese economy affecting the entire baijiu industry. Major competitors like Kweichow Moutai and Jiugui Liquor also experienced their weakest growth in ten years, with Jiugui Liquor seeing a dramatic 92.6 percent plunge in net profit. The article highlights how stringent policy factors have severely reduced baijiu consumption, impacting sales of mainstream products across the sector.</p>

          <p>Argentinian authorities are intensifying their search for an 18th-century Italian portrait, believed to have been looted by a fugitive Nazi officer 80 years ago, after its unexpected reappearance in a real estate advertisement. The painting, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Vittore Ghislandi, was originally stolen from Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker and later acquired by Friedrich Kadgien, who eventually settled in Argentina after World War II. Police recently raided a seaside villa, finding German documents from the 1940s but not the artwork itself. The renewed investigation was sparked by Dutch newspaper reporters who recognized the painting in an advertisement for a home potentially owned by Kadgien's descendants, bringing hope for its recovery.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker issued a strong warning, stating the state "will not stand idly by" and "action will be met with a response" if President Donald Trump proceeds with his threat to deploy the National Guard to Chicago to combat crime. Pritzker, a Democrat, condemned Trump's proposed move as an unconstitutional power grab, an attempt to politicize military personnel, and an effort to manufacture a crisis for political gain. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson echoed these criticisms, calling the potential federal deployment uncoordinated and unsound, while citing data indicating recent declines in violent crime rates in the city. Trump, in response, took to social media to label both Pritzker and Johnson as "incompetent," urging them to seek his assistance.</p>

          <p>Former US Open champion Daniil Medvedev has been slapped with a substantial fine of nearly £31,500 ($42,500) for his unsportsmanlike conduct during an extraordinary first-round exit from the tournament. The incident that sparked his meltdown occurred during his defeat by France's Benjamin Bonzi, reportedly triggered by a photographer walking onto the court. Medvedev was specifically docked $30,000 for unsportsmanlike behavior and an additional $12,500 for obliterating his racket against a chair. This hefty penalty means the Russian player will forfeit approximately 40% of his first-round prize money, a consequence he publicly acknowledged he was prepared for.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is replacing Nin Pandit, his principal private secretary in Downing Street, marking the third change in a top aide within a mere ten months. Pandit, who previously led the No 10 policy unit during Rishi Sunak's premiership, is expected to transition into another role within the government. While No 10 contests this, the BBC understands concerns had arisen regarding her effectiveness in the pivotal role. This latest reshuffle signals potential internal instability within the government's senior ranks, especially as many anticipate a wider reshuffle of junior ministers following a series of Labour parliamentary rebellions before the summer break.</p>

          <p>Reform UK, under Nigel Farage's leadership, is increasingly seen as an existential threat to the Scottish Conservatives, consistently outpolling them ahead of the Holyrood election. The recent defection of Graham Simpson, the third MSP to abandon the Tories in four months, underscores the severe challenges facing Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay. While Findlay attempts to shift his party's stance rightward to counter this threat, such a move risks alienating the moderate centre-right voter base established under previous leadership. This internal division, with departing MSPs scattering to different parties, suggests Reform's surge is a significant UK-wide trend, capitalizing on voter discontent and potentially reshaping the Scottish political landscape.</p>

Zelensky vehemently condemned Russia's choice of "ballistics instead of the negotiating table" and reiterated his urgent calls for new, tough sanctions against Moscow.

Hank becomes unwillingly entangled with various dangerous criminal factions, from Russian thugs to Hassidic hitmen, all while being pursued by a hard-nosed NYPD detective. The article praises the film, adapted from Charlie Huston's novel, for its intimate, affectionate yet gritty portrayal of pre-millennial Alphabet City, showcasing a New York teeming with menace, humor, and a palpable sense of place.</p>

The remarkably well-preserved fossil, unearthed in the Chorrillo Formation, indicates that this apex predator likely reached about 3.5 meters (11.5 ft) in length and weighed around 250 kg (551 pounds). K. atrox possessed a wide, powerful jaw with large, shearing teeth, capable of devouring even medium-sized dinosaurs, making it the second-largest known predator from this rich fossil site. This significant discovery expands the known diversity of fossil vertebrates from the late Cretaceous period, offering new insights into the ancient Patagonian ecosystem and its formidable inhabitants.</p>

          <h2>Europe Endures Record Wildfire Season, Over One Million Hectares Scorched</h2>

          <p>Europe is currently facing its worst wildfire season on record, with over one million hectares burned across the European Union so far this year, primarily concentrated in Spain and Portugal. This devastating area is equivalent to approximately half the landmass of Wales, with Spain alone experiencing six times its average burn area for this period. Experts directly link the worsening fire conditions to climate change, which creates hotter, drier environments and significantly increases flammability. The fires also contribute to a perilous feedback loop by releasing record levels of CO2, further exacerbating global warming. Rural depopulation and abandoned agricultural land also contribute by increasing the amount of flammable vegetation.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has initiated the transfer of detainees from the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades. This action follows a federal judge's order to dismantle parts of the facility and prohibit new construction, a ruling that sided with environmental activists. DHS criticized the judicial decision from an "activist judge," stating it complies while simultaneously vowing to continue its efforts to remove immigrants. The state-run facility, part of the Trump administration's broader push to expand detention beds, faced severe allegations of inhumane conditions, including inadequate access to water and legal counsel, claims that federal and state officials have consistently denied.</p>

          <p>Cardi B's defense in a civil assault trial received a significant boost from the testimony of an obstetrician and his receptionist, who largely contradicted the plaintiff's claims. Security guard Emani Ellis alleges the rapper assaulted her in 2018, seeking $24 million in damages. Cardi B, whose real name is Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar, testified she never touched or scratched Ellis, only exchanging heated words. The receptionist stated she observed Ellis corner Cardi B and then reach for the rapper, resulting in a cut on her own forehead, which the doctor confirmed Ellis caused. This testimony provided crucial support for the rapper's case, as the defense concluded its presentation at the end of Wednesday's session.</p>

          <p>A 12-year-old nonverbal boy with autism, Bryan Vasquez, who had been missing for nearly two weeks, is tragically confirmed to have died following an alligator attack in a New Orleans canal. His body was discovered by a drone, and the Orleans Parish Coroner determined the cause of death was drowning with blunt trauma consistent with an alligator attack. Bryan was last seen escaping his home through a bedroom window. The New Orleans Police Department's delayed response to his disappearance faced public criticism, with Chief Anne Kirkpatrick acknowledging a nearly five-hour gap before an officer arrived. Authorities have since requested the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries to remove "nuisance" alligators from the area where Bryan was found.</p>

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced her departure, but Monarez's legal team asserted only the President can fire a Senate-confirmed official, creating a standoff. This situation, reportedly stemming from Monarez's refusal to support Health Secretary Robert F.

Zhou warned against stablecoins being excessively used for asset speculation, which could trigger fraud and financial instability.

          <p>The United States has advised Denmark to "calm down" after its top diplomat in Copenhagen was summoned over allegations of covert US operations aimed at influencing Greenland. Denmark's public broadcaster reported sources claiming the goal was to infiltrate society and promote Greenland's secession from Denmark to the US. While a White House official would not confirm an influence campaign, Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen called any interference in the Kingdom's internal affairs "unacceptable." The US State Department affirmed strong ties and respect for Greenland's self-determination, but the incident highlights ongoing diplomatic friction related to President Trump's persistent interest in potentially annexing Greenland.</p>

Governor Joe Lombardo initially stated no data theft, but the state's chief information officer later confirmed evidence of data exfiltration by malicious actors. The extensive outage affected numerous state agencies, including the DMV, and temporarily impacted law enforcement's access to critical records. Cybersecurity experts highlight that state and local governments are increasingly prime targets for such attacks, citing similar recent incidents in Minnesota, Georgia, and Pennsylvania.
