          <p>Democratic state legislators in Texas are planning to flee the state to deny Republicans the necessary quorum for a special legislative session. The move is a last-ditch effort to prevent the passage of a new congressional map that could significantly favor the GOP. This tactic has been used before in Texas politics, though Republicans have ultimately succeeded in passing their bills in past instances. The Democrats involved risk daily fines and potential legal action for breaking the quorum.</p>

          <p>The White House is defending President Trump's decision to fire Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer following a jobs report with downward revisions. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett pointed to these revisions as "hard evidence" justifying the move, while the president claimed the data was "rigged." The firing has drawn sharp criticism from economists and former officials, who warn it undermines the credibility of government data and sets a dangerous precedent for politicizing statistical agencies.</p>

          <p>In a recent court filing, the Trump administration has denied the existence of a daily quota for immigration arrests, contradicting earlier public statements by White House adviser Stephen Miller. Miller had previously stated a "goal" of achieving at least 3,000 arrests per day. The denial came in a lawsuit filed by immigrant advocacy groups accusing the administration of unconstitutional immigration sweeps. The discrepancy highlights a potential conflict between the administration's public rhetoric and its official legal positions on immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A small 3.0 magnitude earthquake occurred Saturday night, with its epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. The tremor was felt across the New York City area, causing brief shaking and startling residents, but no significant damage or injuries have been reported. The event follows a larger, rare 4.8 magnitude earthquake that shook the region in April 2024. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, such minor quakes are not uncommon on the East Coast and are not typically a cause for alarm.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has surprisingly surpassed California in new utility-scale solar capacity, driven primarily by major utilities like Florida Power & Light rather than rooftop installations. This growth is attributed to favorable economics, as solar becomes cheaper than natural gas, and a state rule that fast-tracks the approval process for projects under 75 megawatts. However, the future of this boom faces challenges from the rollback of federal tax credits and increasing strain on the existing power grid. The success of solar-powered communities like Babcock Ranch, which withstood Hurricane Ian, highlights the resilience of decentralized solar energy.</p>

The state-owned company Codelco stated its priority is recovering the last missing miner, as rescue teams use heavy machinery to clear blocked passageways deep below the surface.

          <p>The final Test match between England and India is set for a thrilling conclusion, with the game balanced on a knife-edge after a dramatic fourth day was cut short by rain. England needs just 35 more runs to win, but has only four wickets remaining in their pursuit of a record-breaking 374. Centuries from Harry Brook and Joe Root had put England in a commanding position before a late surge from India's bowlers dramatically shifted the momentum. The series, which England leads 2-1, will be decided on the final morning of play.</p>

          <p>A self-imposed deadline for a new US-Canada trade deal has passed without an agreement, leaving businesses in a state of uncertainty amid an ongoing tariff war. While Canada now faces a 35% U.S. tariff rate on some goods, the impact is buffered by the existing USMCA free trade agreement, which keeps nearly 90% of Canadian exports to the U.S. duty-free. Analysts suggest this gives Canada some negotiating leverage, as it can wait for American businesses and consumers to feel the pain of retaliatory tariffs, potentially increasing pressure on Washington for a resolution.</p>

They argue the consolidation would give the merged entity excessive power to raise prices and reduce service standards for shippers of everything from grain to automobiles. This opposition adds to that from major rail unions and some political leaders. (not investment advice)</p>
