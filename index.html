          <p>The Trump administration is facing legal challenges after a judge ruled it violated a court order by pausing FEMA funds. This comes amid mass layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services and the IRS, impacting thousands of employees. Adding to the turmoil, the director of the U.S. National Security Agency was also fired. These events are unfolding against the backdrop of President Trump's newly announced tariffs, which his administration has dubbed "Liberation Day," signaling a major shift in economic policy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "Make America Great Again" policies, particularly his focus on tariffs and trade restrictions, may inadvertently strengthen Asia's economic standing. These policies incentivize East Asia and Europe to forge closer ties, potentially leading to the creation of a large free-trade area under the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). This could offset the impact of US isolationism and create a more favorable environment for China to join the CPTPP, reshaping global trade dynamics.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on goods from Asia, where Nike manufactures most of its shoes, could lead to price increases for the iconic Air Jordan 1s. Nike's shares fell following the tariffs announcement, raising concerns about the impact on the company's supply chain. Analysts estimate that prices could increase by 10-15%, but Nike may also explore other options, such as downgrading the technology in the shoes or extending the design cycle, to keep retail prices low.</p>
