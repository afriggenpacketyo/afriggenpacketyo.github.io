          <p>The federal trial of Ryan Routh, accused of attempting to assassinate former President Donald Trump in September 2024, began with jury selection in Fort Pierce, Florida. Routh, who is representing himself, posed several unusual questions to potential jurors regarding their political views and hypothetical situations, which were dismissed by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon as irrelevant. He also noted that key witnesses on his list were unlikely to testify, citing one's fear of arrest and another's travel plans. Routh faces multiple federal charges, including attempted assassination, and has pleaded not guilty to all counts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage approaches a one-year low, experts suggest several strategies for homebuyers to secure even better terms. Key recommendations include improving one's credit score, as higher scores directly correlate with lower interest rates, potentially saving thousands over the loan's lifetime. Another effective method is to increase the down payment, with a 20% down payment often leading to more favorable lending terms and the avoidance of private mortgage insurance. Homebuyers are also encouraged to consider alternatives to the traditional 30-year fixed loan, such as adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which currently offer lower initial rates.

          <p>The House Oversight Committee's Democratic members have publicly released a controversial 2003 birthday note allegedly sent by Donald Trump to Jeffrey Epstein. The message, which reads "Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret," is framed by a hand-drawn sketch of a woman's torso. President Trump has vehemently denied writing the note or creating the drawing, previously calling reports about it fake and filing a defamation lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal. The White House maintains the signature is not authentic, while Democrats suggest it is part of a cover-up related to Trump's past association with the disgraced financier.</p>

This inclusion, which will be effective before trading begins on September 22, ends months of speculation and is a major milestone for the company. Inclusion in the benchmark index often acts as a catalyst for stock growth, as passive funds that track the S&P 500 are required to purchase the company's shares. Despite market volatility since its 2021 IPO, Robinhood's stock has performed strongly this year, with year-to-date gains exceeding 210%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new mural by the anonymous street artist Banksy appeared on the historic Royal Courts of Justice building in London, depicting a judge using a gavel to strike a protester. Shortly after Banksy claimed the politically charged artwork on Instagram, authorities announced its impending removal. The decision was made because the courthouse is a legally protected historic site, obligating officials to preserve its original character. Activist groups have interpreted the piece as a commentary on the U.K. government's recent ban of the protest group Palestine Action and the subsequent arrests of hundreds of demonstrators.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While Medicare Part A is typically free for eligible seniors, Part B, which covers doctor visits and preventive care, requires a monthly premium, set at $185 for 2025. Most seniors cannot completely avoid this cost, but certain circumstances allow for delayed enrollment or financial assistance. Individuals still working past age 65 with creditable employer-provided health insurance can delay Part B enrollment without penalty. For those with limited income, state-run Medicare Savings Programs or dual eligibility with Medicaid can help cover or eliminate the premium. However, forgoing Part B can restrict access to supplemental coverage like Medigap and Medicare Advantage plans.</p>

The announcement has drawn sharp criticism from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who accused the Trump administration of using fear tactics and failing to coordinate with local officials on public safety.

          <p>With interest rates remaining relatively high, savers with a significant sum like $40,000 are weighing the benefits of high-yield savings accounts versus certificates of deposit (CDs). While current rates are comparable, CDs offer a fixed rate for a set term, protecting earnings from future declines, whereas savings account rates are variable. A key consideration is liquidity; CDs penalize early withdrawals, making them suitable only for funds that can be left untouched. In contrast, high-yield savings accounts provide flexibility and easy access. Both options offer substantially better returns than traditional savings accounts, making a strategic choice between them crucial for maximizing earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prince Harry has returned to the United Kingdom for a series of engagements, beginning his visit by attending the WellChild charity awards in London. During the event, he met with children facing serious health conditions and delivered a speech praising their courage and resilience. Earlier in the day, on the third anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's death, the prince laid a wreath at her burial site in Windsor. His visit, which does not include his wife Meghan or their children, has fueled speculation about a potential meeting with his father, King Charles, whom he has not seen in person since February 2024.</p>

          <p>France is facing a new political crisis after Prime Minister François Bayrou's government was defeated in a no-confidence vote in the National Assembly. The vote, which saw left and hard-right parties unite against him, forces Bayrou to resign and compels President Emmanuel Macron to appoint a new prime minister. The crisis was triggered by Bayrou's unpopular budget proposal aimed at tackling France's massive national debt, which included freezing welfare payments and scrapping national holidays. This marks another period of instability for Macron's second term, as France is now set to have its fifth prime minister in under two years.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans has increased its settlement offer to survivors of clergy sexual assault to a minimum of $230 million in its ongoing bankruptcy case. This revised offer adds $50 million to a previous proposal that many survivors were advised to reject as inadequate. The new amount will be funded by the archdiocese, its affiliates, and smaller insurers, while survivors retain the right to seek further compensation from the archdiocese's primary insurer, Travelers. For the settlement to be approved, it must be accepted by two-thirds of the 660 voting claimants involved in the case.</p>

This trend comes after a weak August jobs report solidified expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut. In company news, Citigroup's decision to transfer $80 billion in client assets to BlackRock is estimated to add at least 25 cents to BlackRock's adjusted earnings per share once fully onboarded. Separately, a partnership between Meta Platforms and Anduril Industries was officially awarded a U.S. Army contract to develop augmented reality combat goggles, marking a potential new revenue stream for Meta's Reality Labs.

          <p>A New York Federal Reserve survey reveals that American workers' confidence in their ability to find a new job has fallen to an all-time low. The August Survey of Consumer Expectations showed that the perceived probability of securing another job after a loss dropped to 44.9%, the lowest point since the survey began in 2013. This data reflects a significant reversal from the "Great Resignation" period, as a cooling labor market with slowing hiring has led workers to stay in their current positions. The report aligns with recent BLS figures showing a dismal 22,000 new jobs created in August. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, permitting the Trump administration to resume widespread immigration enforcement stops in the Los Angeles area. The ruling freezes an order that had barred federal agents from detaining individuals based solely on factors like their apparent race, language spoken, or type of work. In a sharp dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by two other justices, argued the decision enables the government to "seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job." The administration praised the move as a win for public safety and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Nature Climate Change reveals a correlation between rising temperatures and increased consumption of products with added sugar among Americans. Using household purchase data from 2004 to 2019, researchers found that as temperatures rose, so did the consumption of sugary items, particularly sweetened beverages like soda and frozen desserts like ice cream. The trend was more pronounced among lower-income and less-educated groups. Researchers suggest this behavior is driven by a physiological and psychological desire for chilled, hydrating products in warmer weather, raising public health concerns about the risks associated with excessive sugar intake.</p>

Certified credit counselors can create comprehensive debt management plans, while debt relief experts can negotiate with creditors to potentially reduce the total amount owed.
