          <p>Mark Zuckerberg, frustrated with Meta's AI progress, is reportedly investing heavily in Scale AI and attempting to recruit its CEO, Alexandr Wang. Meta is allegedly finalizing a deal to invest $14 billion in Scale AI, potentially taking a 49% stake, with Wang possibly leading a new AI research lab at Meta. This move mirrors strategies by Google and Microsoft, who have brought in AI leaders through significant investments rather than outright acquisitions. Zuckerberg hopes Wang can improve Meta's AI execution, especially after the lukewarm reception of the Llama AI models, as Wang's expertise in AI's technical complexities and business acumen is highly valued. </p>

          <p>Following high-level trade discussions in London, representatives from the U.S. and China have announced a consensus on a framework to implement the Geneva trade agreement. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that this framework aims to resolve issues such as Chinese restrictions on rare earths exports to the U.S. Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will seek President Trump's approval, while Chinese President Xi Jinping's approval is also required for implementation. While Chinese state media initially remained silent, the agreement signals a potential de-escalation in trade tensions between the two nations. The agreement addresses concerns about reciprocal tariffs and aims to stabilize the relationship after accusations of Geneva agreement violations. </p>

          <p>Approximately 700 active-duty Marines have arrived in the Los Angeles area, joining National Guard troops amidst protests against federal immigration enforcement. California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a lawsuit seeking to block the deployment of these troops, arguing it is an illegal federalization of the National Guard. Local officials, including Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDowell, have criticized the deployment, citing concerns about logistical challenges and potential escalation, while Senator Alex Padilla called it counterproductive. The Trump administration argues the deployment is necessary to protect federal property and ICE agents from violence, while Newsom views it as a political move. </p>

          <p>Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver of New Jersey has been indicted on three counts of assaulting federal law enforcement officers during a clash outside a Newark ICE detention center last month. The charges stem from an incident on May 9, when McIver and other members of Congress visited Delaney Hall to conduct oversight, resulting in a scuffle between protesters and law enforcement. A special agent alleges McIver interfered with the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka by physically impeding officers. McIver has stated she will plead not guilty, calling the indictment a politically motivated attack. </p>

He described the protesters as "rioters bearing foreign flags with the aim of continuing a foreign invasion of our country." The protests, now in their fifth day, were sparked by Trump's immigration crackdowns, with demonstrators gathering at a building where activists were being held.

          <p>According to his lawyer, the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the man mistakenly deported to El Salvador and later returned to the U.S., represents a critical stand for constitutional protections. Chris Newman, Abrego Garcia's family's lawyer, argues that the case is about the erosion of due process rights rather than a referendum on immigration. Abrego Garcia faces charges of human smuggling, which the Trump administration has linked to MS-13 membership, allegations his family denies. Newman emphasizes the importance of Abrego Garcia having his day in court to defend himself against the charges, highlighting warnings from Salvadorians about the erosion of democratic institutions. </p>

The law aims to consider the full picture of abuse endured by survivors, not just bits and pieces, according to Republican state Rep. Stan Gunter.

          <p>Los Angeles City Council members and Police Chief Jim McDonnell engaged in a heated exchange regarding the LAPDâ€™s handling of protests against President Trumpâ€™s immigration crackdown. Council members challenged the departmentâ€™s relationship with federal agencies, with some questioning whether the LAPD would warn city officials about upcoming immigration raids. McDonnell defended the LAPD's cooperation with federal agencies on matters other than immigration, while council members criticized the use of rubber bullets during the protests. The council is also considering measures to enhance security at city facilities to prevent unlawful entry by federal entities. </p>

          <p>President Trump's administration has ordered the deployment of 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests against deportation operations. The deployment, which occurred over the objections of local officials, is the first time in decades that a president activated a stateâ€™s National Guard without a request from its governor. Governor Gavin Newsom has sued to block the use of military forces to accompany federal immigration enforcement, calling it an "illegal deployment." The role of the troops will be limited to protecting U.S. immigration officers, raising concerns about potential use of force. </p>
