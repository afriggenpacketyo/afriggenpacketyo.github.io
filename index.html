          <p>In Los Angeles, fifteen workers were successfully rescued after a tunnel they were working in collapsed. The incident occurred in a large industrial complex, with the collapse happening approximately six miles from the tunnel's sole access point. A significant emergency response involving over 100 personnel, including the LAFD's Urban Search and Rescue team, was mobilized for the confined space rescue. The workers were extracted using a crane and cage system, and thankfully, no injuries were reported among the rescued individuals.</p>

          <p>The U.S. administration has announced a new 50% tariff on all copper imports, scheduled to take effect on August 1. The decision was justified as a matter of national security, with copper being cited as a critical material for defense systems, semiconductors, and other essential technologies. This announcement caused an immediate surge in U.S. copper prices, creating a significant premium over global market rates. The policy aims to stimulate domestic copper production, though experts caution that building this capacity will take years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cierra Ortega, a contestant on "Love Island USA," has issued an apology after her sudden removal from the reality show. Her departure was prompted by the resurfacing of a 2024 social media post containing a derogatory term for Asian people. In a video message, Ortega stated she was unaware of the term's offensive nature at the time and deleted the post immediately after being educated by a follower. She also revealed that she and her family have since faced severe online harassment, including death threats.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, endured another large-scale overnight drone attack by Russian forces, resulting in at least two deaths and thirteen injuries. The city's military administration reported that falling drone wreckage struck multiple districts, causing fires in residential buildings, warehouses, and other structures. This assault follows a massive aerial attack just days prior, and air raid alerts remained active as residents were urged to stay in shelters. The Ukrainian military also warned of a potential ballistic missile threat during the ongoing attacks.</p>

          <p>In an effort to address persistent labor market challenges and sluggish economic growth, China has announced a new subsidy program. The government will provide a one-time payment of up to 1,500 yuan for each young person, aged 16 to 24, hired by companies and social organizations. This measure, effective until the end of the year, is designed to stabilize employment and boost household incomes amid fierce domestic competition. Additionally, the state is expanding its "work-for-relief" public works program to create more jobs for vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County medical examiner has determined that the death of Lucrecia Macias Barajas, a 46-year-old U.S. Army veteran, was an accident caused by the combined effects of fentanyl and methamphetamine. Her body was discovered by her daughter in May at a homeless encampment in the Westlake area, alongside another individual who died from the same cause. The case drew public attention after video showed the daughter's distress at the scene. The finding confirms initial police suspicions of a drug overdose and highlights the ongoing dangers of the opioid crisis.</p>

          <p>A proposed 50% tariff on copper imports could lead to higher prices for a wide range of consumer products, from home appliances and electronics to electric vehicles, according to economists. Copper is a critical component in electrical wiring, plumbing, and manufacturing, and the tariff is expected to be passed on to consumers. The administration argues the tariff is necessary to incentivize domestic production and protect national security. However, critics worry it will fuel inflation, raise home repair costs, and negatively impact industries reliant on the essential metal. (not investment advice)</p>

It highlights the role of companies, including American defense contractors, in providing weapons and technology used in the conflict.

The study found significant disparities, with Black and Hispanic Californians experiencing a much slower recovery than white and Asian residents.

The cuts would affect core mission areas like science and human spaceflight, depriving the agency of decades of institutional knowledge.
