          <p>The Department of Justice is suing Colorado and Denver for allegedly interfering with federal immigration enforcement through "sanctuary laws." The lawsuit claims these policies violate the Constitution by hindering ICE's ability to enforce immigration laws.

Colorado officials deny being a sanctuary state, stating they cooperate with law enforcement agencies. Republicans in Congress have pressured Democratic-led cities to cooperate with Trump's immigration policies, leading to clashes over immigration reform.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to impose a 100 percent tariff on movies produced outside the United States, citing national security concerns. He authorized the United States Trade Representative to initiate the process of taxing any and all movies coming into the country that are produced in foreign lands. The Motion Picture Association declined to comment, but the declaration has raised questions about its potential impact on Hollywood and the global film industry. The move could affect both foreign-language films and major Hollywood productions that utilize foreign locations and tax incentives.</p>

The FAA and NTSB are investigating the crash, examining factors such as the pilot's experience, weather conditions, and potential aircraft failures.</p>

          <p>A Chinese and Dutch study has found that the first roses were likely yellow, based on evolutionary genetic analysis. Roses are known for their diverse shapes, sizes, and colors, but the study indicates that their common ancestor was a yellow flower with a single row of petals. Researchers from Beijing Forestry University published their findings in Nature Plants, highlighting that roses, often seen as a symbol of love, have evolved significantly from their ancestral form.</p>

          <p>Eric Schmidt and Selina Xu argue that China is rapidly catching up to the United States in various technologies, especially in artificial intelligence. They highlight the accessibility of Chinese AI models and the global reach of Chinese apps like TikTok and Temu. The authors urge the US to openly share AI technologies, innovate faster, and accelerate the diffusion of AI throughout the economy to compete effectively. They warn that China's capacity to innovate and its focus on open-source AI models could lead to Chinese dominance in the AI revolution.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking among OECD members fell to fourth place in 2024, with Britain reclaiming third position. The United States remained the top donor, followed by Germany. Japan's decline was attributed mainly to the yen's depreciation and a contrast to sharp increases in previous years. Despite the decrease, Japan views ODA as a crucial diplomatic tool amid China's growing influence. Overall ODA by Development Assistance Committee members also fell due to reduced contributions to international organizations and aid for Ukraine.</p>
