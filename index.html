          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military launched strikes on three key Iranian nuclear facilities: Fordo, Natanz, and Esfahan, with the objective of destroying Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity and stopping the nuclear threat. The strikes involved massive precision attacks, including the use of bunker-buster bombs, and were described by Trump as a "spectacular military success." Trump warned Iran against retaliation, stating that any such action would be met with even greater force, while also urging Iran to pursue a peace deal with Israel. The U.S. alerted Israel ahead of the strikes, and Prime Minister Netanyahu praised Trump for his strength and resolve in addressing the Iranian nuclear threat, and Homeland Security officials are monitoring for potential physical and cyber reprisals from the U.S. attack. </p>

He emphasized that the attacks are outrageous and will have everlasting consequences, stressing that this dangerous and criminal behavior should alarm every UN member.

          <p>President Trump's recent strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities followed months of insisting on a deal to end Iran's nuclear weapon capabilities, creating an impression of diplomatic intent. However, sources indicate that Trump privately decided to bomb Iran's nuclear sites after a meeting with national security advisors, using the suggestion of a two-week negotiation window as a feint to keep Iran off guard. Trump declared that the strikes had "completely and totally obliterated" Iran's nuclear facilities, demanding they abandon any remaining nuclear capability, marking the culmination of a long-term effort to contain Iran's nuclear program. The administration is now bracing for potential Iranian retaliation, which could target U.S. assets in the Gulf, Iraq, or commercial shipping, potentially drawing the United States further into the conflict.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece analyzes President Trump's decision to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, questioning whether it was a strategic triumph or a potential trap. The author suggests that the administration has not provided sufficient evidence to support claims that Iran was weeks away from building a nuclear bomb, and that military strikes alone cannot erase the knowledge possessed by Iranian scientists. It also posits that Iran is likely to retaliate through regional attacks, disruption of oil routes, or asymmetric attacks abroad. The author concludes by urging vigilance, clear strategy, and diplomatic efforts to contain the situation.</p>

Some lawmakers, like Marjorie Taylor Greene, opposed the U.S. action, arguing it is not America's fight, while others, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, called the strikes unconstitutional and grounds for impeachment. The debate centers on the president's authority to engage in military action without congressional approval, highlighting the ongoing tension between the executive and legislative branches on matters of war powers.</p>

          <p>A Japanese startup, Craif Inc., has developed a urine-based cancer risk screening kit that shows promise in detecting cancer at its earliest stages through non-invasive means. The "miSignal" test kit can simultaneously assess a person's risk for up to seven types of cancer without requiring a blood test. A survey using the test kits detected changes in pre-malignant cells among residents of Hokkaido towns, leading to early detection and treatment of tumors. The kit detects microRNA, a biomarker linked to early cancer biology, in urine to screen for risks of lung, colon, and pancreas cancer, among others.</p>

Professor Li Lei's team reorganized yeast metabolism into four distinct yet interconnected phases, mirroring the concept of mutual promotion and restraint in traditional Chinese medicine. Each phase reflects a unique metabolic state, with specific molecular mechanisms triggering the next phase while suppressing others, similar to the "four symbols" theory in traditional Chinese medicine.

          <p>An analysis assesses the potential outcomes of President Trump's decision to bomb Iran, noting the contradictions in his statements and the uncertainties surrounding the situation. The most optimistic view is that it will end Iran's nuclear ambitions and lead to the fall of the mullahs, while the worst outcome involves Iran developing a bomb and retaliating against U.S. targets. The most likely outcome is a mixed scenario where Iran's program is delayed, the region becomes more unstable, and the Iranian regime survives. The author highlights the risks of misperception and accidents, particularly given the unqualified nature of Trump's national-security team.</p>

They promote positivity and random acts of kindness in Blaze's name, and hundreds of hand-painted stones with messages of tolerance, love, and peace have been left at Borrego Park in his memory. The killer, Samuel Woodward, was found guilty of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement and sentenced to life in prison without parole. The family hopes that Blaze's life and legacy will inspire people to be kinder and work on repairing the world.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that President Trump's decision to strike Iranian nuclear facilities risks escalating conflict both domestically and internationally. The author notes that Trump, who promised to be a "peacemaker", has inserted the U.S. into the conflict between Iran and Israel, warning that this could lead to a wider war. It questions whether the two-week negotiation period was a feint and highlights the potential for Iran to retaliate, leading to a continued American military engagement. The piece concludes by noting that Trump's gamble carries political risks and that the U.S. must be prepared for volatility.</p>

The strikes occurred despite Trump's previous criticism of U.S. involvement in overseas wars, marking a significant shift in his approach to Iran.</p>
