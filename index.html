          <p>Amazon is significantly expanding its same-day delivery service to include fresh groceries like meat, eggs, and produce in over 1,000 U.S. cities, with plans to reach 2,300 locations by year-end. This move intensifies competition with rivals like Instacart, Walmart, and Kroger, whose stock prices fell following the announcement. The service is free for Prime members on orders over $25 and is part of Amazon's broader strategy to integrate its grocery operations, including Whole Foods, more deeply into its ecosystem. This expansion aims to capture a larger share of the grocery market by making it more convenient for customers to bundle perishable items with other purchases.</p>

          <p>Shares of CoreWeave, a prominent renter of AI data centers, plummeted by 20% after the company reported a second-quarter adjusted loss of 27 cents per share, exceeding analyst expectations. The poor results were announced just before the expiration of its post-IPO lock-up period, raising concerns about potential stock volatility from insider sales. Despite the loss, CoreWeave's revenue more than tripled year-over-year to $1.21 billion, driven by strong AI demand from clients like Microsoft and OpenAI. The company also raised its full-year revenue guidance, but some analysts noted that light capital expenditure guidance suggested uncertainty in deployment timing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A European Commission plan to penalize Israel for its actions in Gaza, which the EU has called a violation of human rights, remains stalled due to internal disagreements among member states. The proposal, which would restrict Israeli startups from accessing EU research funds, requires backing from a qualified majority, but key countries like Germany are hesitant to approve it. This deadlock highlights the bloc's long-standing divisions on its relationship with Israel, despite growing international pressure and warnings of a famine in Gaza. While some members advocate for suspending trade agreements, the lack of consensus means the EU's response remains limited to verbal condemnation for now.</p>

          <p>In a new documentary, Sylvester Stallone reflected on his experience working with the late Hulk Hogan on the film "Rocky III," describing the wrestling icon as being in "a class of his own." Stallone praised Hogan's consistently positive and self-deprecating demeanor, noting that he possessed a natural star quality even at the beginning of his career. He also highlighted Hogan's professionalism and concern for his co-star's safety during their on-screen wrestling match, emphasizing the physical risks involved. Stallone's tribute underscores the significant impact Hogan had, not just in wrestling, but in his early foray into Hollywood.</p>

          <p>Climate scientists are organizing a formal public response to a recent Department of Energy report that questions the established consensus on the climate crisis. This effort is part of a broader pushback against the Trump administration's attempts to dismantle climate regulations, including a proposal to undo the EPA's "endangerment finding," the legal foundation for most U.S. climate rules. The National Academies of Sciences is also fast-tracking a review of greenhouse gas evidence to inform federal policymaking. These actions come as the administration is accused of deleting climate data from government websites, prompting research groups to archive and publicize the information independently.</p>

In a memo, the company acknowledged that the expanded discount was one of its most requested benefits and would help employees and their families.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can move forward with its plan to suspend or terminate billions of dollars in foreign aid that had been appropriated by Congress. The divided three-judge panel found that the grant recipients challenging the president's executive order did not meet the legal requirements for a preliminary injunction that had previously blocked the cuts. The ruling vacates a lower court's order that had forced the administration to release the funds. A dissenting judge argued the decision enables the executive branch to disobey laws for policy reasons, undermining the separation of powers.</p>

          <p>With U.S. home equity reaching a record $17.8 trillion, nearly 48 million mortgage holders now have tappable funds, averaging $213,000 per homeowner. To calculate available equity, homeowners subtract their current mortgage balance from their home's market value, though lenders typically cap borrowing at around 80% of the total equity. Homeowners can access these funds through financial products like home equity loans or HELOCs, which currently have more favorable interest rates than credit cards or personal loans. However, it's crucial to borrow responsibly, as the home serves as collateral and failure to repay could lead to foreclosure. (not investment advice)</p>

The move is framed not as a response to actual crime statistics, which are down, but as part of a broader agenda to create a personalized state where the monopoly on violence rests with the president.

          <p>Police are investigating an armed robbery of a Brinks truck in Elkins Park, a Philadelphia suburb, where two assailants stole between $700,000 and $800,000. The suspects, one armed with an AR-15-style pistol, ambushed the truck outside an H Mart before fleeing and abandoning their vehicle. This incident is the latest in a string of similar armored vehicle heists in and around Philadelphia this summer, and authorities are investigating potential connections. Federal prosecutors recently charged three individuals in connection with a separate $2 million Brinks truck robbery that occurred in June.</p>

          <p>The second-round draw for the Carabao Cup has pitted six-time winner Manchester United against League Two side Grimsby Town. For United, who are without European competition for the first time in over a decade, it is an early domestic cup test. The draw also handed a home tie to Bromley, who pulled off a first-round upset against Championship team Ipswich, and they will now host Wycombe. Other notable matchups include two all-Premier League clashes, with Bournemouth facing Brentford and Wolves taking on West Ham, while Everton will play at their new stadium against Mansfield Town.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles processed a record-breaking volume of cargo in July, handling over one million container units for the first time in its 117-year history. This surge was largely driven by shippers front-loading imports of Chinese goods to get ahead of tariff deadlines imposed by the Trump administration. While the port operated without delays, logistics experts note that this early peak season has been unusual and that the high tariff levels have prevented many companies from importing their full orders. As a result, spot freight rates have dropped significantly, indicating a potential slowdown now that the pre-tariff rush has passed. (not investment advice)</p>

According to French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump clarified that his goal is to secure a ceasefire and that any territorial decisions must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Despite these assurances, European leaders reiterated the need for Kyiv's direct involvement in any final deal, revealing underlying anxiety that Trump might concede Ukrainian land. The call was a last-ditch effort by the sidelined European allies to impress their security concerns upon Trump ahead of the meeting.</p>

          <p>Florida's Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has unanimously approved the state's first black bear hunt in ten years, drawing strong condemnation from wildlife advocacy groups. The limited hunt, scheduled for December, will permit what critics call "barbaric" methods, including bait traps, archery, and eventually, dog packs. Officials justified the decision by citing a rising bear population and increased human encounters, but opponents argue the hunt is based on flawed science and is a cruel setback for a species that was once endangered. The controversial 2015 hunt was halted early after far exceeding its quota, raising concerns that this hunt will see similar problems.</p>

Initially framed as a "listening exercise" and then a potential "land-swapping" deal, the focus has now moved toward securing an immediate ceasefire. This analysis suggests Trump's expectations are fluid, reflecting the dynamic nature of back-room negotiations ahead of the high-stakes summit. He has floated the idea of a second, trilateral meeting with President Zelenskyy, but made it conditional on the success of his initial meeting with Putin, leaving his ultimate plan and potential outcomes unclear.</p>

The annual adjustment is designed to ensure that benefits keep pace with inflation.

          <p>A new analysis of an ancient Incan khipu, a record-keeping device made of knotted cords, suggests its use may have been more widespread than previously thought. Researchers discovered that a khipu from around 1498 was made primarily of human hair, and a dietary analysis of the hair indicated its owner was likely a commoner, not a member of the ruling elite. This finding challenges the long-held assumption that khipu production was restricted to high-status individuals. The discovery could help bridge the gap between ancient Incan khipus and more modern versions made by lower-status people, rewriting our understanding of literacy in the Inca Empire.</p>
