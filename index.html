          <p>The Trump administration is defying a federal judge's order to free pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, who was arrested and designated for deportation over campus protests. The administration argues that Khalil's presence constitutes a threat to U.S. foreign policy, despite him being a legal permanent resident. A federal judge ordered Khalil's release, but the administration refused, claiming a different violation. Critics argue that the administration is punishing immigrants for expressing political opinions, violating the First Amendment.</p>

The judge found that Khalil's career and reputation were being damaged and his speech chilled, causing irreparable harm. The administration could still try to deport Khalil for other reasons, but the judge believes the current detention is due to the Rubio determination.</p>

          <p>At least 11 people have died and several others remain missing in San Antonio, Texas, after heavy rains caused widespread flooding. Emergency crews are focusing their search on Salado Creek and Leon Creek, with assistance from Texas A&M Task Force 1. The fire department responded to at least 70 water rescues, saving at least 10 people, and believes that those rescued or located were initially in their cars sitting in traffic, but ended up in trees due to the rising waters.</p>

First, is Israel's objective limited to demolishing Iran's nuclear program, or is it also a regime change operation? Second, to what extent does Iran have the capability to retaliate? Finally, how will these events affect Iran's thinking about acquiring a nuclear weapon? The answers to these questions will significantly influence the conflict's scope and potential consequences for the region and beyond.</p>
