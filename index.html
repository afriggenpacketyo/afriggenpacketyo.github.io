          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 03:38:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nintendo's revenue more than doubled in its first fiscal quarter, driven by the highly successful launch of its new Switch 2 console, which sold 5.82 million units. The company's performance significantly exceeded analyst expectations, largely due to the new console's higher price point compared to its predecessor. Despite the strong quarter, Nintendo has maintained its conservative annual forecast, citing potential impacts from U.S. tariffs, though analysts remain bullish on its long-term growth prospects.</p>

          <p>Germany has reported a significant recovery in its wolf population, particularly in the northern Atlantic region, leading officials to declare a "favorable" conservation status for the first time. This change paves the way for the government to consider allowing wolf hunting in these areas to manage the population and protect livestock. The decision has sparked debate, with farmers' associations pushing for more urgent action while conservation rules are reviewed for the rest of the country.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new policy restricting its main civil service internship program to university students from "lower socio-economic backgrounds." The initiative, driven by Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Pat McFadden, aims to increase representation from working-class families and ensure the civil service better reflects the country. Successful interns will be fast-tracked for the Fast Stream graduate program, a move criticized by some as social engineering but defended as a way to harness a broader range of talent.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formalized new, higher tariffs on nearly 70 U.S. trading partners through an executive order, with rates ranging from 10% to over 40%. The duties, which take effect in seven days, are part of a broader strategy to reduce U.S. trade deficits, with rates determined by whether the U.S. has a trade surplus or deficit with a given country. Canada faces a steep 35% tariff, while Mexico has received a 90-day extension, highlighting the administration's use of trade policy as a tool for negotiation and foreign policy leverage.

          <p>El Salvador's congress, dominated by President Nayib Bukele's Nuevas Ideas party, has approved constitutional reforms that eliminate term limits and allow for indefinite presidential reelection. The changes also extend the presidential term from five to six years and remove the need for a runoff election, consolidating Bukele's power. The move has been condemned by opposition parties and civil society organizations as a step toward authoritarianism, drawing comparisons to similar power grabs in Venezuela and Nicaragua.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming UK Supreme Court ruling could enable millions of motorists to claim compensation over mis-sold car finance deals involving hidden commissions. The court will decide on the legality of discretionary commission arrangements, where dealers were paid more for securing higher interest rates on loans, a practice banned in 2021. A decision upholding an earlier ruling against these practices could lead to billions of pounds in payouts, with major lenders already setting aside funds in anticipation of a scenario similar to the PPI scandal.

          <p>A Delta flight from Salt Lake City to Amsterdam was forced to make an emergency landing in Minneapolis after encountering severe turbulence, resulting in 25 people being hospitalized. Passengers described a terrifying experience with significant altitude drops that sent people and objects flying through the cabin. The incident is now under investigation by the FAA and NTSB, and it highlights the increasing frequency of clear-air turbulence, which some scientists link to climate change, posing a growing risk to air travel safety.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh defended the court's management of its emergency docket, which has seen an influx of appeals from the Trump administration. Speaking at a judicial conference, Kavanaugh argued that as presidents increasingly use executive orders, courts are inevitably drawn in to rule on their legality, necessitating the emergency review process. He acknowledged criticisms but stated the court has improved its processes, including holding emergency oral arguments, to ensure it reaches the right answers in these high-stakes cases.</p>

          <p>Jen Easterly, who served as the director of CISA during the Biden administration, had her appointment as a distinguished chair at West Point rescinded by the Secretary of the Army. The reversal came shortly after a pro-Trump activist highlighted the appointment on social media, accusing Easterly of undermining the current administration for her work on countering election disinformation. Easterly lamented the decision as a "casualty of casually manufactured outrage," marking another instance of a position being terminated after public pressure from political activists.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for these individuals, who faced the loss of their legal status and deportation protections. In her order, the judge stated the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing that the administration's decision was motivated by racial animus and failed to properly consider the ongoing unsafe conditions in the designated countries.</p>

          <p>This commentary argues that the United States' expensive and underperforming healthcare system is a domestic problem, not the fault of countries like Australia that have price controls on prescription drugs. The author notes that the U.S. spends nearly twice as much per person on healthcare as other wealthy nations for worse health outcomes, a gap too large to blame on "freeloading" by others. Instead of blaming allies, the article suggests the U.S. could learn from systems like Australia's Medicare to provide universal care and control costs. (not investment advice).</p>

Donilon's closed-door testimony was part of a Republican-led investigation into the former president's cognitive fitness, which Donilon defended, stating he saw a leader who was "deeply engaged and in command." The testimony provides insight into high-level compensation in presidential campaigns.</p>

          <p>In her first interview since leaving office, former Vice President Kamala Harris told Stephen Colbert that she believes the American political system is "broken." She explained her recent decision not to run for governor of California stemmed from a desire to step away from a system she feels is no longer strong enough to defend the nation's fundamental principles. Instead of seeking office, Harris said she plans to travel the country and engage with Americans outside the transactional context of a political campaign.</p>
