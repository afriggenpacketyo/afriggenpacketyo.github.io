          <h2>Wind Energy Industry Adapts to Challenges with Turbine Repowering</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 09:50:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite facing headwinds from political opposition, supply chain issues, and tariff uncertainties, the U.S. onshore wind energy sector is finding new opportunities in repowering aging infrastructure. Many of the nation's 75,600 turbines are over 20 years old and nearing the end of their operational lives, prompting operators to upgrade or replace them with more efficient models. This repowering trend is boosting market leaders like GE Vernova, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa, leading to revenue increases and stock gains. Repowering existing wind farms offers economic benefits, including avoiding property acquisition costs and potentially increasing electricity output by up to 50%.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychotherapist with experience counseling over 100 couples has identified five common habits that can erode relationships. These include expecting partners to read minds, keeping score of good deeds and missteps, engaging in passive-aggressive behavior, backseat driving their partner's life, and listening without truly understanding. The therapist emphasizes the importance of clear communication, giving without expecting returns, direct expression of dissatisfaction, supporting individual choices, and active listening to build strong, healthy relationships. Addressing these behaviors can prevent the accumulation of frustrations that ultimately lead to relationship breakdowns.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece highlights Turkey's slide toward autocracy under President Erdogan, citing constitutional changes, judicial control, and suppression of dissent. The recent detention of Istanbul's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, on dubious charges is seen as a significant escalation. The international response, including from the U.S. and European leaders, has been criticized as weak. The piece argues that democracies should do more to support the Turkish people and pressure Erdogan to reverse his autocratic course.</p>

Trump's statement, made after meeting with President Zelensky, suggested a potential shift in his approach towards Russia. The United States has been pushing Ukraine to accept a peace plan that seems in part a gift to Moscow. The proposal would force Kyiv to abandon its aspirations of joining NATO, offer Ukraine only vague security guarantees, and see the United States officially recognizing Crimea as Russian. Ukraine has rejected that deal, which the Trump administration had described as its final offer.</p>
