          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-16 02:36:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's economy grew by a slight 0.1% in August, according to the Office for National Statistics, following a revised 0.1% contraction in the previous month. This marginal expansion occurs as the government faces mounting pressure to boost the economy ahead of the upcoming Budget. Over the three months leading to August, the economy expanded by 0.3%, primarily driven by the services sector, though some consumer-facing areas showed weakness. Economists suggest that tax increases or spending cuts may be necessary for the chancellor to meet self-imposed borrowing regulations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking third-quarter profit, surging 39.1% year-over-year and significantly exceeding market expectations. This substantial growth is attributed to the sustained high demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from major clients like Nvidia and Apple. The company's revenue also rose by 30.3%, with its high-performance computing division constituting 57% of total sales. In light of these strong results, TSMC has raised its full-year revenue growth forecast for 2025 to the mid-30% range, signaling confidence in the continued AI boom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has published three witness statements from a deputy national security adviser related to the collapsed espionage case against two men accused of spying for China. The documents, drafted under both Conservative and Labour governments, describe China as conducting "large scale espionage" and posing a threat to the UK's economic and democratic security. The case was dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service, which stated it could not obtain sufficient evidence from the government officially labeling China a national security threat at the time of the alleged offenses, sparking a major political controversy. Both accused men have consistently denied all allegations.</p>

The Blue Jays' offense dominated the game, recording 18 hits, including five home runs, against Seattle's pitching. Mariners' starter George Kirby struggled, giving up eight hits and multiple key runs in the early innings. Toronto's offensive surge was a significant turnaround after being limited to just four runs in the first two games of the series, demonstrating a potent and contagious hitting performance that overwhelmed their opponents.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured him that India will cease purchasing oil from Russia, although a specific timeline for the halt was not provided. Trump described the move as a significant step in pressuring Moscow over its war in Ukraine and indicated a similar expectation for China. India's external affairs ministry responded by stating that its import decisions are guided by the need to ensure stable energy prices for its consumers. As one of the largest buyers of Russian crude, India's potential shift could have a notable impact on global energy markets and geopolitical dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's largest airlines, including Air China, have formally objected to a U.S. Department of Transportation proposal that would prohibit them from flying over Russian airspace on routes to the United States. In official filings, the carriers argued the ban would significantly inconvenience thousands of passengers, especially during the upcoming holiday season, and disrupt their operations. Air China requested a grace period of at least 60 days if the rule is implemented to allow passengers to rebook flights. This dispute adds another layer to the already heightened trade and geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing.</p>

          <p>President Trump hosted a dinner for dozens of corporate leaders from companies like Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Google to raise funds for a proposed $200 million ballroom at the White House. The administration plans to add the 90,000-square-foot ballroom to the East Wing, with the project being financed entirely by private donations rather than taxpayer money. During the event, Trump thanked attendees for their generous contributions, stating the project's cost has been fully covered. The fundraising effort has drawn criticism from some, who question the motivations behind corporate donations for such a project.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani took the unusual step of participating in on-field batting practice as he works to break out of a significant postseason slump. Since the start of the playoffs, the two-way phenom is just two-for-25 with 12 strikeouts, a performance manager Dave Roberts said is not conducive to winning a World Series. Ohtani downplayed the idea that his return to pitching this season has negatively impacted his hitting, stating he does not feel a direct physical connection between the two roles. His visible effort to recalibrate his swing signals an urgent desire to return to form for the remainder of the NLCS.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from firing federal workers during the current government shutdown. The ruling came after the administration sent termination notices to over 4,000 employees, with the White House budget director indicating that more than 10,000 jobs could be cut. The judge called the firings "unprecedented" and cited President Trump's social media posts suggesting the cuts were intended to target programs favored by Democrats. The order, which applies to employees represented by two major unions, halts the terminations pending a further hearing.</p>

          <p>A long-forgotten diary discovered in a Hong Kong apartment has revealed the firsthand account of Lam Ping-yu, a Chinese naval officer who participated in the D-Day landings. Lam was one of over 20 Chinese officers sent to train and serve with Allied forces in Europe during World War II. His detailed diary provides a unique perspective on the Normandy invasion from aboard the British battleship HMS Ramillies, including a narrow escape from torpedoes. This historical finding sheds new light on the multinational cooperation that was crucial to the Allied victory and highlights a little-known aspect of China's involvement in the European theater.</p>

Data reveals that while most counties threaten fines or other sanctions, about 21% admit to taking no action against those who skip their civic duty. This lack of enforcement contributes to a jury pool that is less representative of the population, potentially impacting the right to a fair trial.
