          <p>Authorities in San Bernardino County are questioning a mother's report that her 7-month-old son was kidnapped, citing inconsistencies in her statements. The mother, Rebecca Haro, claimed she was assaulted and the baby was taken, but later chose to stop cooperating with the investigation. The lack of evidence, suspect information, and the parents' refusal to continue interviews have led investigators to consider the possibility of foul play in the infant's disappearance. An advocacy group has also withdrawn a reward, citing concerns over the case's missing details.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economic problem of "involution," characterized by excessive internal competition yielding diminishing returns, is driven by issues on both the supply and demand sides. Local governments and enterprises are engaging in a self-defeating rat race due to a lack of better options, leading to near-zero profit margins and stifling new investment. The authorities have criticized this domestic dumping of products, directing local governments to cease offering unreasonable incentives that fuel the hyper-competitive environment. This phenomenon is symptomatic of deeper structural problems within the Chinese economy. (not investment advice)</p>

Airman First Class Jadan Orr, 20, allegedly shot and killed a 23-year-old man in a Cheyenne apartment after handling an AK-47 rifle while drinking with friends. This incident follows the August arrest of another airman from the same base for a separate fatal shooting in July. That earlier case involved a Sig Sauer M18 handgun, which has since been suspended from use by the U.S. Air Force Global Strike Command.</p>

Despite dominating the first half, Leeds struggled to score until the disputed handball decision against Everton's James Tarkowski. The win provides a crucial and optimistic start for the newly-promoted club's campaign to remain in the top flight.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers in California have initiated a legislative process to redraw the state's congressional districts for the 2026, 2028, and 2030 elections. The move is a direct response to efforts in Texas and by former President Trump to create more Republican-leaning districts. If the measure passes the legislature, it will go to California voters in a special election, temporarily suspending the state's independent redistricting commission. Republicans have condemned the plan as a partisan power grab that subverts the will of voters who established the independent commission.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has announced his intention to "lead a movement" to eliminate mail-in voting and certain voting machines, claiming he is preparing an executive order to do so before the 2026 midterm elections.

Legal experts, however, state that the president lacks the constitutional authority to regulate state-run elections, as that power resides with Congress.

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals that women are effectively trapped in Afghanistan's largest women's mental health facility due to a combination of societal restrictions and abandonment by their families. Many patients, some of whom are victims of domestic violence, are deemed ready for discharge but have nowhere to go, as Taliban regulations and patriarchal traditions prevent them from living independently. The center is overcrowded, with a long waiting list, reflecting a broader mental health crisis among Afghan women exacerbated by the crackdown on their rights.

          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic examines the escalating federal militarization of Washington, D.C., a week after former President Trump initiated a federal takeover of the city's police force. With no clearly stated objective or end date for the mission, which was ostensibly to "liberate" D.C. from crime, there are concerns the situation could continue indefinitely. The deployment of National Guard troops from other states and the positioning of federal forces in non-high-crime areas suggest the move may be more about intimidation than public safety. This action is viewed as a potential experiment for similar takeovers in other Democrat-run cities.</p>

Pundits and former players are divided, with some arguing the arm's position was natural, while others believe he leaned into the ball. The incident highlights ongoing confusion and inconsistency in how the handball law is interpreted and applied by officials, even with VAR.</p>

The author points to Trump's past meetings with North Korea's Kim Jong Un, which, while not achieving denuclearization, successfully cooled down a situation that felt close to war.

          <p>This opinion piece explores the geopolitical significance of China's plan to build a massive new embassy at the former Royal Mint site in London. The author argues that the project is more than a planning dispute; it is a powerful symbol of China's rising status and long-term diplomatic ambitions. By committing to such a large and modern facility, China is signaling London's importance as a global capital and visually representing its own emergence as a superpower. The article contrasts this with the UK's recent trend of selling off prime diplomatic properties, suggesting a difference in long-term strategic thinking.</p>

          <p>Iowa State Representative J.D. Scholten has suspended his campaign for the 2026 Democratic U.S. Senate nomination. In his withdrawal, Scholten endorsed fellow Democratic legislator Josh Turek, calling him the "best hope" to challenge incumbent Republican Senator Joni Ernst. Turek recently joined a crowded primary field aiming to unseat Ernst, who has not yet formally announced her campaign for a third term but is actively fundraising. The race is being watched as Republicans navigate challenges in other states to maintain their Senate majority.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of the 2025 season, has strengthened to a Category 4 storm and is expected to generate life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast this week. While the storm is not predicted to make landfall in the U.S., its powerful winds and large size will create dangerous ocean conditions from a distance. A storm surge watch and evacuation orders have been issued for North Carolina's Outer Banks due to the risk of coastal flooding. The storm's center is forecast to pass between Bermuda and the U.S. coast midweek.</p>

          <p>This essay from The Atlantic posits that the rapid rise of generative AI has induced a form of mass delusion, characterized by a confusing mix of hype, anxiety, and reluctant acceptance. The author argues that society is racing toward a hastily conceived future, exemplified by bizarre applications like AI-reanimated dead children and the messianic rhetoric from Silicon Valley. This has created a disorienting cultural moment where people feel unmoored, anxious about job loss, and unsure what to believe. The piece questions what happens if the technology never lives up to its grandest promises but is just "good enough" to permanently disrupt society.</p>

          <p>A new study from Bankrate reveals that despite wage growth, the average American's earnings have lagged behind the rise in the cost of living by 1.2 percentage points since the pandemic began. This gap signifies a loss of purchasing power and contributes to ongoing public dissatisfaction with the economy. The analysis found that educators have experienced the largest deficit, while workers in sectors like leisure, hospitality, and healthcare have seen wages that outpaced inflation. The findings align with polls showing that a majority of Americans feel their income is not keeping up with rising prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Florida woman who purchased a certified pre-owned Mercedes-Benz is in a legal battle with the dealership after it failed to pay a $66,000 arbitration award. An independent mechanic found the vehicle was unsafe, had a damaged suspension, and its odometer had been tampered with, showing nearly double the advertised mileage. An arbitrator ruled the dealership violated Florida's unfair trade practices act, but four months later, the dealer has not paid the damages or taken back the car. The dealership is now stalling, forcing the owner into a costly and prolonged legal fight.</p>

          <p>City officials in Anaheim, California, have issued a public warning about what they describe as the most significant federal immigration enforcement activity seen in weeks. The warning follows several weekend raids, including one at a car wash where agents detained a bystander, and another outside a Home Depot where laborers were detained. Officials condemned the actions for spreading fear and destabilizing the community, which has a large Latino and immigrant population. The city recently joined a lawsuit challenging federal enforcement tactics, citing concerns over racial profiling and the negative impact on residents.</p>

          <p>A source within Hamas has informed the BBC that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal presented by Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The deal is said to involve an initial 60-day truce during which Hamas would release about half of the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The proposal also includes negotiations for a permanent ceasefire. It remains unclear how Israel will respond, as its government previously stated it would only accept a deal that releases all hostages at once, while intense Israeli military operations continue in Gaza City.</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Polari Prize, a UK-based award for LGBTQ+ literature, have canceled this year's event following a controversy surrounding the nomination of author John Boyne. Boyne was longlisted for his novel "Earth," but his inclusion sparked backlash due to an article he wrote defending J.K. Rowling's views on trans issues. Several other nominated authors withdrew in protest, and over 800 publishing figures signed an open letter criticizing the nomination. Organizers decided to pause the prize to review their processes and increase trans representation on their judging panels.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's meeting with former President Trump and European leaders at the White House focused on ending the war in Ukraine. A key development was Trump's signaling of potential U.S. security guarantees for Kyiv, though details remain vague. Zelenskyy adopted a collegial tone, a marked change from a previous contentious visit, and emphasized his country's need for comprehensive support, including weapons and training. The possibility of a future trilateral meeting involving Trump, Zelenskyy, and Vladimir Putin was also a major topic of discussion, which Trump framed as a matter of "when, not if."</p>
