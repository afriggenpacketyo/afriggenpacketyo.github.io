          <h2>UK Campaigners Advocate for English-Language Ingredient Lists on Cosmetics to Protect Allergy Sufferers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 03:09:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Campaigners in the United Kingdom are urging for a change in cosmetic labeling regulations, advocating that ingredients be listed in English rather than the current standard of Latin or scientific names. This push is driven by concerns for individuals with severe allergies, such as nut allergies, who find it difficult to identify potential allergens from Latin terms. Supporters, including a Member of Parliament and affected families, argue that cosmetic products should adopt labeling standards similar to food packaging to prevent dangerous allergic reactions. The industry's trade association defends the Latin-based system, known as INCI, stating it provides a globally harmonized language for ingredients, but critics maintain it prioritizes industry convenience over consumer safety.</p>

          <p>The upcoming week is poised to be critical for global markets, with a focus on the second-quarter earnings reports from major U.S. banks and a G20 finance ministers' meeting in South Africa. Analysts are watching closely to see how recent trade tariffs implemented by the U.S. will impact corporate profits, with Goldman Sachs predicting a slowdown in earnings-per-share growth. Simultaneously, the G20 meeting is clouded by diplomatic tensions between the U.S. and host nation South Africa, highlighted by new tariffs and the U.S. Treasury Secretary's decision to skip the event. These developments create an uncertain economic picture for the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 2018 murder of 31-year-old Aileen Seiden in a Florida motel room has been detailed in a recent report, revealing a complex and volatile "throuple" relationship as central to the crime. Investigators connected her death to a bloody scene in Room 15 of the Sportsman's Lodge, where she had been staying with her boyfriend, Zachary Abell, and his other girlfriend, Christina Araujo. The case, which took nearly six years to go to trial, exposed a history of jealousy, alcohol-fueled violence, and abuse within the three-person relationship. Ultimately, both Abell and Araujo were convicted of second-degree murder, with testimony revealing a brutal beating that led to Seiden's death.</p>

          <p>Kindergartens across China are facing significant operational challenges due to a dramatic plunge in the number of prospective students, a direct consequence of the country's falling birth rate. One government-affiliated kindergarten in Harbin, once exclusive to officials' children, has now been forced to open enrollment to the general public to fill its classrooms. This trend is national, with over 38,000 kindergartens closing since 2020 and total enrollment dropping by more than 25% during the same period. The situation reflects the profound economic and social impact of China's demographic shift on its education sector.</p>

          <p>A neighbor's security camera played a pivotal role in the conviction of Melissa Turner for the murder of her boyfriend, Matthew Trussler, in 2019. While Turner claimed she stabbed Trussler in self-defense during a physical altercation, audio from the camera captured a woman's voice screaming phrases like "So f****** die." Furthermore, an in-home ADT camera showed Turner following an unarmed Trussler while appearing angry, contradicting her self-defense narrative. Prosecutors used this evidence to argue against her claims, leading a jury to find her guilty of second-degree murder. She was subsequently sentenced to 20.5 years in prison for the crime.</p>

This evidence includes a letter from Erik to a cousin alleging sexual abuse by their father and a separate affidavit from a former boy band member claiming he was sexually assaulted by Jose Menendez.

The opposition Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition, which includes the Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), has gained substantial electoral ground, particularly among younger Malay voters. This "green wave" reflects a push for policies aligned with a more conservative interpretation of Islam, such as stricter dress codes and the implementation of Islamic criminal law in the states they govern.

          <p>A new scientific study indicates that China's large dams on the Brahmaputra River in Tibet may not cause the droughts feared by downstream nations like India, and could in fact increase water flow during dry seasons. The research, based on data collected since 2014 from two operational dams, shows that low-flow water levels in February rose by over 50%. This suggests that the dams' water regulation mechanisms are augmenting the river's volume during traditionally dry periods.

          <p>The Trump administration is facing internal dissent and backlash from supporters over the Justice Department's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation records. Tensions flared after the DOJ announced it would not release further documents and confirmed that a rumored "client list" never existed, leading to a reported confrontation between Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino. President Trump has publicly expressed support for Bondi while urging his followers not to "waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein." The episode highlights the administration's struggle to manage the expectations and conspiracy theories it had previously fueled among its base.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to sources, Attorney General Pam Bondi has dismissed at least 20 Justice Department prosecutors and support staff who were involved in former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigations into Donald Trump. The move follows the earlier ousting of most senior prosecutors associated with the probes and has reportedly caused significant alarm among the department's career employees. The firings target a range of personnel, including some who may have only had administrative or support roles in the investigations. This action is seen as part of a broader purge of officials perceived as disloyal to the administration.</p>

          <p>Hong Wang, a celebrated Chinese mathematician and a leading contender for the prestigious Fields Medal, has become a target of online criticism from Chinese nationalists. The backlash emerged after she delivered a series of academic lectures at top universities in China, including her alma mater Peking University, in English rather than Mandarin. Despite her groundbreaking research and the packed attendance at her seminars, some netizens accused her of being unpatriotic and disconnected from her roots. Wang, who is currently an associate professor at New York University, has built an international career after completing her postgraduate studies in France and the U.S.</p>

          <p>The UK's Health Secretary, Wes Streeting, is set to meet with the British Medical Association (BMA) next week in an effort to prevent a planned five-day strike by resident doctors in England. The strike, scheduled to begin on July 25, is the latest action in an ongoing dispute over pay. The BMA is demanding a clear plan to restore pay to 2008 levels in real terms, arguing that the government's current offer of a 5.4% increase is insufficient. While the government has stated it will not increase the pay offer, the talks indicate a potential willingness to negotiate on other aspects of working conditions.</p>

          <p>China's aerospace industry is experiencing a significant surge in private investment, positioning the country as a key player in the rapidly expanding global space economy, which is projected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2035. This opinion article highlights how the space sector is no longer dominated by state-led missions, with private enterprises driving innovation in satellite launches and other technologies. Companies like i-Space and LandSpace have achieved major milestones, such as putting the first private Chinese rocket into orbit. This growth is fueled by technological advancements, lower costs, and strong state support for private commercial space ventures. (not investment advice)</p>
