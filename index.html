        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's European sales experienced a significant drop of 49% in April, attributed to reputational damage linked to Elon Musk's political activities and increased competition from both traditional automakers and Chinese electric vehicle companies. Despite overall battery electric car sales rising in Europe, Tesla's sales have declined nearly 40% over the first four months of the year. European consumers are also showing a preference for hybrid electric vehicles, a market segment Tesla does not currently serve, while investors have raised concerns about Musk's dedication to Tesla due to his involvement with government advisory roles. The company is working to address these challenges, with Musk reaffirming his commitment to leading Tesla for the next five years.</p>

          <p>Japan has approved a $6.3 billion spending package to support businesses and households affected by U.S. tariffs, joining other nations implementing aid plans. The funds will assist small and medium-sized businesses and subsidize household energy costs, as the automotive sector, a key part of the Japanese economy, faces significant impact from U.S. tariffs. The stimulus package comes as Japan grapples with growing government debt and public concerns over rising consumer prices, while trade negotiations with the U.S. continue with no immediate concessions secured. The Japanese government hopes to reach an agreement during a Japan-U.S. meeting in mid-June.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has challenged Darwinian evolution by demonstrating that rice plants can pass on acquired traits related to cold tolerance to future generations without genetic mutations. The research, published in *Cell*, supports the long-dismissed theory of Lamarckism, which posits that organisms can inherit traits acquired during their lifetime. The team found that rice varieties from northeastern China exhibited stable, non-genetic adaptations, driven by DNA methylation changes, positioning Lamarckism as a contributing factor in evolution. This discovery may require a reconciliation of epigenetics with core evolutionary principles.</p>

Lee anticipates the initiative will create job opportunities for mediators, translators, and researchers, while also drawing high-quality conferences and exhibitions to Hong Kong.

The rule change also made it easier to exploit the red-flag tire-change rule, highlighting the challenge of overtaking at Monaco.

          <p>The diamond industry is facing a number of challenges, including a potential 10% import duty to the U.S., which accounts for over half of the global demand for polished diamonds. This comes at a time when the luxury industry is already experiencing a slowdown in demand and increased competition from lab-grown diamonds (LGDs), which are chemically identical to natural diamonds but sell at a significant discount. Some analysts believe the industry is nearing a stabilization point between LGDs and mined diamonds, while major players like De Beers are doubling down on natural diamonds and closing their LGD jewelry brand Lightbox.</p>

Chinese manufacturer BYD surpassed Tesla in pure electric car registrations in Europe for the first time, with 7,231 BYD cars registered compared to Tesla's 7,165. Experts attribute Tesla's decline to the slow rollout of the latest Model Y and Elon Musk's involvement in U.S. politics, while European consumers are increasingly purchasing electric vehicles from Mercedes and Volkswagen, particularly in Germany.

          <p>A proposed regular mechanism for organ donation between Hong Kong and mainland China, under discussion since 2022, faces legal hurdles that have delayed its implementation. According to Wang Haibo, director of the China Organ Transplant Response System (COTRS), revisions to mainland laws are necessary to facilitate the cross-border mechanism. The primary legal obstacle is related to regulations preventing the spread of HIV, which currently prohibit the transfer of organs, blood, and tissue across the border.

          <p>Italian filmmaker Silvio Soldini's "The Tasters" is a fictionalized account inspired by Margot WÃ¶lk, one of Hitler's food tasters during World War II, who revealed her story late in life. The film explores the moral complexities faced by the women who were forced to taste Hitler's food, fearing it could be poisoned, and develops a secret relationship with an SS officer. While the film is based on a novel inspired by WÃ¶lk's testimony, some historians question the historical accuracy of the food tasters' existence, citing the lack of corroborating evidence. Soldini acknowledges the film's basis in fiction, emphasizing its relevance to contemporary political violence.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese automakers have declined for a second consecutive day due to concerns about a price war and increased regulatory scrutiny. BYD's shares fell significantly after announcing price cuts on several electric and plug-in hybrid models, while other automakers like Geely, Great Wall Motor Co, and Li Auto also experienced declines. China's commerce ministry is reportedly investigating the practice of marking cars as sold to meet sales targets, which are then resold on the secondhand market. Analysts expect BYD's vehicle margins to face pressure in the short term due to the price reductions, but anticipate the company will offset the impact through larger sales and lower battery costs (not investment advice).</p>
