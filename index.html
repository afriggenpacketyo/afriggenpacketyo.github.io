          <p>The White House announced that the U.S. and China reached a trade deal after negotiations in Geneva, although specific details were not immediately provided. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the talks as productive, promising a more comprehensive briefing on Monday, while U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer hailed the discussions as constructive. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng noted the agreement to establish a consultation mechanism for trade and economic issues, suggesting further details would be forthcoming. While specifics are scarce, the agreement signals a potential de-escalation in the trade war, which has negatively impacted the global economy, potentially providing relief to businesses and consumers, and the Chinese negotiator Li Chenggang said that the deal would be good news for the world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to meet with airline executives to address ongoing disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport, including technological issues and staffing shortages. Duffy warned that other U.S. airports could face similar problems during the summer travel season, citing antiquated systems as a major concern. The announcement follows a series of outages at Newark's air traffic control facility, leading to significant delays and cancellations, raising safety concerns for travelers. Duffy's proposal to improve air travel involves investments in digitizing flight data and upgrading radio systems, requiring congressional approval, although some details are unclear, and he denied that recent layoffs at the F.A.A. contributed significantly to the problems.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Zepbound More Effective Than Wegovy for Weight Loss</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 18:01:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine reveals that Eli Lilly's Zepbound led to significantly more weight loss compared to Novo Nordisk's Wegovy in a head-to-head clinical trial. Participants taking Zepbound lost nearly 50% more weight on average than those using Wegovy over 72 weeks. Zepbound targets two hormones that regulate appetite, while Wegovy targets only one, potentially explaining the difference in efficacy. Despite these findings, both drugs are considered important tools for treating obesity, with access and affordability remaining key challenges, and it's important to note that a drug may work well for one patient, but not for others.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CVS Caremark, a major pharmacy benefit manager, will exclude Zepbound from its coverage in favor of Wegovy, despite research indicating Zepbound results in greater weight loss. This decision forces many Americans to switch medications, highlighting the impact of secret deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers on patient access to treatments. Caremark claims the decision aims to lower drug prices for employers, although the move has sparked criticism from patients and doctors who prefer Zepbound due to its superior efficacy. The decision underscores the growing trend of insurance denials driven by cost considerations, limiting physicians' ability to tailor prescriptions to individual patient needs, and the article cites a patient who lost 85 pounds on Zepbound and is now being forced to switch to a less effective medication.</p>

          <p>The first group of white South Africans, granted refugee status by the U.S. due to claims of racial discrimination, departed Johannesburg for Washington, D.C. This initiative, expedited by President Trump, contrasts with the administration's restrictive refugee policies for other groups. The South African government views the resettlement as politically motivated, while the U.S. State Department maintains it is prioritizing Afrikaners facing unjust racial discrimination. The arrival of this group highlights ongoing tensions and differing perspectives on racial inequalities in South Africa.</p>

The plane will be checked for security before it can be used as Air Force One and is expected to be transferred to the future Trump presidential library before he leaves office. While Qatari officials have confirmed discussions about the possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use, they deny that the gift will be donated during Trump's upcoming trip.

          <p>President Trump urged Ukraine to accept a Russian proposal for direct talks, diverging from a European plan that insisted on a cease-fire first. European leaders had set a Monday deadline for Russia to accept a 30-day cease-fire or face additional sanctions. Ukrainian President Zelensky initially insisted on a halt in fighting but later expressed willingness to attend negotiations in Turkey. The exchanges occurred after Putin proposed direct talks without mentioning a cease-fire, and the Trump administration has aligned with Russia on a vote in the United Nations on the war and resumed broader diplomatic ties with Moscow.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced plans to overhaul the UK's immigration system by tightening English tests for visa applicants and extending the settlement period to ten years. The reforms aim to create a controlled, selective, and fair system, with exceptions for high-skilled workers in sectors like nursing and engineering. Adult dependents will also be required to demonstrate basic English skills to promote integration and prevent exploitation, though critics warn this could split families.

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced 'substantial progress' in trade talks with China, following high-level discussions in Geneva. While details remain scarce, the announcement suggests a potential de-escalation of the trade war that began after steep tariffs were levied against China in January. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng also praised the progress, noting that the meetings had been substantive, and the World Trade Organization called the talks a significant step forward. An escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing has seen the US president hit Chinese imports to the US with tariffs of 145%. China retaliated with levies of 125% on some US goods.</p>

          <p>California, despite being the fourth-largest economy globally, faces significant challenges, including potential population decline due to wildfires and immigration policies. Los Angeles grapples with a billion-dollar budget shortfall and the costs of rebuilding after the fires and preparing for the Olympics. The state's leadership is at a crossroads, with a new governor set to be elected amid political divisions and an adversarial relationship with the Trump administration. While some remain optimistic about California's resilience, others express concern over rising homelessness, struggling public schools, and the increasing cost of living.</p>

          <p>A U.S.-funded charter plane transported white South Africans, claiming discrimination, to the United States as refugees, under a Trump administration initiative. This move contrasts sharply with the administration's restrictions on refugees from other regions, raising questions about the motivations behind the policy. The South African government has criticized the initiative, viewing it as a politically motivated attempt to discredit the country. Despite the controversy, the Afrikaners, citing racial discrimination and safety concerns, are relocating to the U.S., highlighting the complex racial dynamics in post-apartheid South Africa.</p>

The Israeli prime minister's office said it had been informed by the US of Hamas' intention to release Alexander, which was expected to lead to negotiations on further hostages.

China responded with reciprocal tariffs of 125% on most American goods, effectively starting a trade war that has led to a significant reduction of goods shipped to the U.S.</p>

The Trump administration is preparing to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8, a jumbo jet from the Qatari royals that was estimated to be about $400m. The gifted plane was not conditioned on any official act and therefore was not bribery, and it will be transferred to Trump's presidential library foundation. Critics have raised concerns about foreign influence and potential ethical violations, while the president has not responded to the claims.</p>

The talks aimed to ease tensions after President Trump initiated a trade war, and the outcome has major implications for the global economy. Any indication of a trade truce between the worldâ€™s two largest economies would lift financial markets and ease concerns among companies, investors and economists that the global economy was poised for a sharp downturn.</p>

Other analysts express cautious optimism, noting the positive headlines but emphasizing the need for substantive progress, but it sounds like we are going to take a trade war with China off the table.</p>
