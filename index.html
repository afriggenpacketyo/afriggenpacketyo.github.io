            <h2>Texas GOP Bill Could Hinder Trump's AI Development Plans Amidst China Competition</h2>

            <p>A new Texas bill, Senate Bill 6, could potentially stall President Trump's AI initiative, "Stargate," which aims to build ultra-powerful data centers across the country. The legislation introduces a six-month regulatory review and imposes new fees and mandatory backup generators, which could double approval times and increase costs. Trump allies warn that this bill could jeopardize a generational opportunity, potentially pushing these billion-dollar projects out of Texas, while China is rapidly advancing in AI technology. Despite the tradeoffs, the Trump administration views Stargate as essential for 21st-century American leadership.</p>

            <p>Brown pelicans in Southern California are filling wildlife rehabilitation centers, suffering from domoic acid poisoning and malnutrition. A toxic algae bloom is believed to be the cause, poisoning adult pelicans and leaving their chicks to starve. Rescue centers are overwhelmed with young pelicans that don't know how to fish. Runoff from the Los Angeles firestorm is suspected to have exacerbated the bloom, and climate change is also a contributing factor. Rescue centers are seeking donations to support their efforts.</p>

            <p>A federal judge admonished the Department of Justice for not complying with her order to facilitate the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Judge Paula Xinis ordered expedited discovery and warned against "gamesmanship." She stated that "every day Mr. Abrego Garcia is detained in CECOT is another date of irreparable harm." The Justice Department attorney said the Trump administration would facilitate Abrego Garcia's return if he arrived at a port of entry, dodging questions about the administration's efforts to return him.</p>

            <p>Nvidia projects a $5.5 billion hit due to tightened U.S. export rules on AI chips to China amidst escalating trade tensions. The company will require licenses to export its H20 AI chip to China, a popular product. These rules address the risk of covered products being used in supercomputers in China. Chips remain a key battleground in the U.S.-China tech race, with President Trump aiming to bolster domestic chip manufacturing.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has given the Trump administration two weeks to provide evidence of efforts to return Kilmar Ábrego García, wrongly deported to El Salvador. Judge Paula Xinis accused government officials of inaction and warned against "gamesmanship." The Supreme Court has ordered the administration to "facilitate" his release. Despite this, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele stated he does not "have the power" to return him. The judge has stated she will decide if the government acted in good faith or was in contempt of court.</p>
