          <p>SpaceX successfully launched the Axiom Space Ax-4 mission, carrying a four-person crew to the International Space Station (ISS). The crew includes retired NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, who will command the mission and oversee approximately 60 experiments during their 14-day stay. Shubhanshu Shukla of India, Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski of Poland, and Tibor Kapu of Hungary are also part of the crew, marking a return to human spaceflight for their respective countries after more than 40 years. The mission faced delays due to weather and a leak on the Falcon 9 rocket, but the crew is now en route to the ISS aboard SpaceX's Dragon capsule, which will remain docked until their return. Optimism regarding the mission's success and international collaboration in space exploration is high.</p>

          <p>Tony Moon, a Korean-American man who participated in the 'rooftop Korean' movement during the 1992 Rodney King riots, asserts that recent riots in Los Angeles are manufactured for political gain and lack genuine grassroots support. Moon contrasts the organic nature of the unrest in 1992 with what he perceives as a staged continuation of BLM/Antifa activities from 2020. He advocates for peaceful protest but condemns property damage and looting, advising Angelenos to arm themselves for self-defense during social chaos. The article highlights the mayor's blaming of President Trump for the unrest, which followed ICE sweeps targeting criminal illegal immigrants, further fueling the political divide.</p>

          <p>Chinese military analysts are closely observing the recent US strikes on Iranian facilities, particularly the use of GBU-57 bunker-busting bombs. While acknowledging the success of the B-2 bomber's delivery and the bomb's performance, they also highlight its limitations against deeply buried targets like Fordow. Mainland China, known for its extensive underground bunker systems, is developing its own bunker-busting weapons, potentially targeting facilities within Taiwan's mountains. This analysis underscores China's strategic interest in counteracting advanced US military capabilities and enhancing its own defensive and offensive capabilities.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang addressed the World Economic Forum in Tianjin, urging countries to collaborate on trade and avoid turning it into a political or security issue. He emphasized that globalization is irreversible and that engaging in the international economy is a way of "reshaping the rules and order." Li's comments come amid rising tariffs and trade barriers, though he did not directly mention US trade tensions or the Israel-Iran conflict. Adam Tooze, a professor at Columbia University, interpreted Li's remarks as a call for a "pluralization" of the global order, focusing on processes rather than a single entity setting the order.</p>

Pro-Palestinian hacking groups have claimed responsibility for denial-of-service attacks and urged others to join their efforts.

          <p>Jane Qiu argues that the controversy over the origins of COVID-19 is not merely a right-wing conspiracy but a symptom of public distrust in science. She contends that framing the debate along political lines does a disservice to the public and that the issue reflects longstanding anxieties over virus research. Qiu points to a crisis of trust fueled by a lack of transparency and inclusiveness in decision-making, particularly regarding gain-of-function studies. She emphasizes the need for scientists to cultivate trust through transparency, accountability, humility, and relationship-building.</p>
