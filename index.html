          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly pushing for a military solution to free the approximately 20 remaining hostages held by Hamas, amid a growing belief that a diplomatic deal is unlikely. This approach has gained momentum as officials feel Hamas is not interested in a negotiated release. The situation unfolds as thousands of protesters in Tel Aviv demand the government end the war and bring the hostages home, and as a new video shows a captive looking painfully emaciated, intensifying concerns for their well-being.</p>

          <p>Economist Jeffrey Sachs has stated that the United States' aggressive rhetoric and trade posture toward China could become a self-fulfilling prophecy of conflict. He argues that the U.S. initiated the trade war and must show prudence, as both nations have leverage over each other and mutual gains from cooperation. Sachs also forecasts that China's future export growth will come from developing regions like Africa and Asia, not from an increasingly restrictive U.S. market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight bound for Munich experienced an engine failure shortly after departing from Washington Dulles International Airport, forcing the pilot to declare a mayday emergency. The Boeing 787, carrying 219 passengers and 11 crew members, safely returned to the airport without any reported injuries. The flight was subsequently canceled, and the airline made alternate travel arrangements for the affected customers while investigating the mechanical issue that prompted the diversion.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash plume miles into the sky. The eruption occurred just days after a powerful 8.8-magnitude earthquake shook the region, leading seismologists to believe the quake may have shaken the system and triggered the volcanic activity. While an aviation alert was issued, the sparsely populated area is not under direct threat, and officials are monitoring the situation.</p>

          <p>A pest control worker in North Yorkshire, England, discovered a massive rat measuring over 22 inches from nose to tail inside a residence. Local councilors shared a photo of the rodent, described as being "almost the size of a small cat," to draw attention to what they call a growing and serious pest problem in the area. They stated this was not an isolated incident and are calling for more effective action to be taken to address the issue of the famously good breeders.</p>

          <p>As part of the approval for the acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel, the U.S. government has secured what President Trump termed a "golden share." This agreement, negotiated by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), grants the government significant governance rights, including veto power over factory closures or salary reductions. While not a traditional equity-holding golden share, it represents an unusual level of government oversight in a private company's operations to safeguard national security interests.

          <p>A new NPR series, "Tested," examines the long and contentious history of sex testing in sports, as World Athletics institutes new genetic testing rules for female competitors. The policy has been criticized for collapsing the distinct issues of transgender athletes and cisgender women with differences in sex development (DSD). The report highlights that such testing is not new and that scientific evidence for a clear competitive advantage in DSD athletes is scarce, raising questions about fairness, inclusivity, and what sports bodies are truly trying to protect.</p>

          <p>In an effort to manage its budget, the Powys health board in Wales has instructed English hospitals to align waiting times for its referred patients with the longer waits common in Wales. This means Welsh patients needing procedures like knee and hip replacements in England will face significant delays, as the board cannot afford the cost of the faster treatment. Patients affected by the change have expressed frustration, stating they were not informed and that their quality of life is suffering as a result.</p>
