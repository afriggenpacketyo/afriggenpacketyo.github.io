          <p>The House Oversight Committee, led by Republicans, has released documents from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, including his 2003 "birthday book," which reportedly contains a letter allegedly signed by Donald Trump. This public disclosure follows House Democrats making the purported letter public, an item Trump has consistently denied writing, dismissing it as "fake" and initiating a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal for its original report. The 238-page book, compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell, lists Trump under the "Friends" category and features a crude sketch. While the White House maintains the signature is not Trump's, an attorney representing Epstein's survivors criticized Trump's "hypocrisy" for attempting to silence the story while suing journalists, suggesting the release validates earlier reports.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson stated the city received no prior notice regarding the Department of Homeland Security's "Operation Midway Blitz," a ramped-up immigration enforcement effort targeting "criminal illegal aliens." DHS justified the operation by citing Illinois' sanctuary policies and the killing of Katie Abraham, allegedly by an undocumented individual. Governor JB Pritzker and Senator Dick Durbin accused the Trump administration of politicizing immigration and failing to coordinate with local leaders, with Johnson expressing opposition to militarized enforcement due to past human rights abuses by ICE. The operation highlights growing tensions between federal and local authorities over immigration policy and public safety.</p>

          <p>Rookie quarterback JJ McCarthy, making his long-awaited NFL debut, led the Minnesota Vikings to a thrilling 27-24 comeback win against the Chicago Bears on Monday night. After struggling through the first three quarters, McCarthy orchestrated a remarkable turnaround, throwing two fourth-quarter touchdown passes and running for another score. The former Michigan star, drafted tenth overall in 2024, completed 13 of 20 passes for 143 yards, overcoming an early interception returned for a touchdown. This impressive performance, which included a 59-yard field goal from Will Reichard, delivered a crucial season-opening victory for the Vikings, highlighting McCarthy's clutch potential.</p>

          <p>Attaullah Baig, WhatsApp's former head of security, has filed a whistleblower lawsuit against Meta, alleging "systemic cybersecurity failures" within the messaging service that potentially compromise user privacy. Baig claims Meta retaliated against him after he notified leaders, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, of significant security issues, such as approximately 1,500 WhatsApp engineers having unrestricted access to user data without detection or audit trails. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, asserts these flaws violated federal securities laws and Meta's 2020 privacy settlement with the FTC. Meta disputes the allegations, stating Baig was dismissed for poor performance and is misrepresenting the company's robust security measures.</p>

          <p>Following Angela Rayner's resignation, the Labour Party has opened nominations for its deputy leadership, a position directly elected by party members. This contest coincides with a recent government reshuffle, which many perceive as a tilt to the Right, causing jitters among the party's soft and hard Left factions. Candidates need significant MP backing and support from local parties or affiliated groups, with the winner announced on October 25. The election is seen as a critical indicator of the party's future direction and an opportunity for members to express their views on the government's performance, despite calls from some for the post to be abolished to prevent infighting.</p>

          <p>Thailand's top court has ruled that former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra did not properly serve his 2023 jail term, ordering him to serve one year in prison. The court determined that his extended hospital stay did not count as a legitimate prison term, following significant public outrage and allegations of special treatment. Thaksin, who had been in exile for 15 years, had his initial eight-year sentence commuted to one year by the king and was paroled after six months, spending the majority of that time in hospital detention. This decision further complicates the political dynasty of the Shinawatra family, whose populist appeal has dominated Thai politics for two decades but has seen waning popularity recently.</p>

Badenoch cited rising UK borrowing costs and expert opinions pointing towards such a crisis, although other economists dismiss this as hyperbole.

          <p>The murder of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on the Charlotte Metro has drawn federal attention, with FBI Director Kash Patel and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy indicating the case is under federal investigation. Duffy announced a Department of Transportation probe into Charlotte's transit system for failing to ensure safety, linking it to President Trump's "zero tolerance" crime message. Trump himself viewed the crime footage, demanding accountability and suggesting federal transportation funding could be withheld from cities failing to curb public transit violence. This signals the administration's intent to use the Charlotte incident as a national test case for its broader crime-and-safety agenda in cities.</p>

Trump defended his rhetoric as "common sense" to "clean up our cities," but critics argue his focus is on Democratic-led cities rather than those with higher crime rates.

This significant trend is primarily attributed to the high cost and overwhelming demands of child care, making it financially unfeasible for many mothers to continue working. Mackenzie Bruegge, a mother of two, exemplifies this challenge, choosing to leave her medical billing job as daycare expenses would effectively cancel out her earnings. Economists highlight the critical lack of supportive policies for caregivers, forcing women to choose between their children and careers, despite many desiring to remain in the workforce.</p>

          <p>Ofsted will proceed with its new "report card" system for inspecting schools in England, despite strong criticism from a coalition of school leaders, campaigners, and former inspectors. This new system, replacing the previous one or two-word grades, will use a five-point scale across multiple areas like curriculum, achievement, and leadership, aiming to provide more detailed information to parents. Opponents, including Ruth Perry's sister, argue the changes are merely "cosmetic rebranding" and continue to pose risks to the wellbeing of teachers and leaders, citing the high-stakes, punitive nature of the system. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson maintains the system will focus on accountability and support struggling schools.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court's decision to allow federal immigration raids to resume in Los Angeles has sparked widespread anger and dread among the county's immigrant communities. Critics, including Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Gavin Newsom, denounce the ruling as "dangerous" and an "attack," fearing agents will become even more aggressive. The Department of Homeland Security declared it would "FLOOD THE ZONE" in Los Angeles, with a spokesperson stating they would continue to arrest and remove "murderers, rapists, gang members, and other criminal illegal aliens." This ruling, which overturns a temporary ban on stops based on race and language, means a full-scale resumption of fears and disruptions for many families and businesses in the region.</p>

          <p>Cannabis use among Americans aged 65 and older surged by 46% between 2021 and 2023, according to a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine. This significant increase is largely driven by seniors seeking solutions for various medicinal issues, including chronic pain, PTSD, and relaxation, with many preferring edibles over smoking. The growing legality of cannabis in 40 states for medical use and 24 for recreational use has significantly diminished its social stigma. However, some medical professionals, like UC San Francisco professor Matt Springer, warn of potential health risks, particularly to the cardiovascular system, regardless of the method of ingestion, citing recent research linking cannabis use to increased cardiovascular disease risks.</p>

Over 200 firefighters were deployed to combat the 5.3-acre fire, which was 25% contained by Monday evening. One person suffered burn injuries, and another smoke inhalation, both requiring hospitalization. Crews are working overnight to mop up hot spots and ensure safety for evacuated residents to return, as authorities continue to assess the full extent of the damage.</p>

Muncy, who was hitting .258 with 17 homers and 64 RBIs before his injury, aims to contribute by simply being himself and not overdoing it. He is the first of several key players expected to return, with left-hander Alex Vesia and utility player Tommy Edman also nearing activation, providing a much-needed cavalry for the team's playoff stretch drive.</p>

Northeast China is currently an underpenetrated market for durians compared to southern and eastern China, facing logistical challenges due to its distance from traditional entry points.

The flotilla, an international initiative including Greta Thunberg, aims to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, which has been under an Israeli naval blockade since 2007.

This bill aims to close loopholes that allowed deceptive practices, as highlighted by a Times investigation revealing how commercially bred dogs from out-of-state puppy mills were resold. The legislation, which applies to dogs, cats, and rabbits under one year old, builds on California's 2019 ban on pet store sales of commercially bred animals. Attorney General Rob Bonta supports the bill, emphasizing its importance in combating deceptive sales tactics and protecting families from the financial and emotional harm of unknowingly purchasing sick or poorly bred pets.</p>

Despite the ban, Biffa's facilities have seen a 3% rise in vapes mixed with general recycling since June, attributing this to cheap reusable models being treated as disposables and a surge in black market trade. Vapes, containing lithium batteries, pose fire hazards when crushed in lorries or recycling centers, costing the UK waste industry a billion pounds annually. The vape industry, however, claims the ban is successful, attributing issues to illegal trade.</p>
