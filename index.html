            <h2>Vitamin D May Reduce Colorectal Cancer Risk, Study Suggests</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-19 16:05:48 EDT</div>

            <p>A recent Hungarian study suggests that vitamin D may be effective in preventing and treating colorectal cancer by reducing inflammation, promoting cancer cell death, and inhibiting tumor growth. The meta-analysis of 50 previous studies indicated that cancer patients with low vitamin D levels had poorer prognoses. Researchers recommend that individuals at high risk of colorectal cancer monitor their vitamin D levels and consider supplementation, with dosages tailored to individual health conditions. The American Cancer Society notes that while some studies suggest vitamin D could lower cancer risk, large studies haven't confirmed that supplements lower the risk of colorectal polyps or cancer.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen alleges that El Salvador President Nayib Bukele staged a meeting with a wrongfully deported U.S. citizen, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to defame him. The senator claims that officials placed margarita glasses on the table during the meeting and that neither he nor Abrego Garcia touched the drinks. Van Hollen asserts the insinuations about the margarita glasses are false and that the Trump administration is attempting to divert attention from the Supreme Court's order to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. The El Salvador government has not commented on the senator's claim.</p>

            <p>Scientists have discovered ancient footprints at John Day Fossil Beds National Monument in Oregon, providing insights into the behavior of prehistoric animals dating back 50 million years. The findings include the first known fossil tracks of birds and lizards at the monument, along with evidence of a cat-like predator and an ancestor of tapirs or rhinoceroses. Researchers used 3D imaging to analyze the tracks, revealing foraging behaviors of ancient shorebirds similar to modern species. The trace fossils offer a rare window into ancient ecosystems and add behavioral context to the monument's body fossil record.</p>

            <p>Criminals dressed in fake military uniforms opened fire at a cockfight in rural Ecuador, killing 12 unarmed people and wounding several others. The attackers used automatic rifles, targeting spectators in La Valencia. Police have detained four suspects, believed to be part of the "Los R7" criminal group. Ecuador is facing increased violence due to transnational cartels using its ports for drug trafficking, with much of the world's cocaine passing through the country.</p>

            <p>A judge has ruled that a former roommate of the victims in the Idaho student killings can testify about seeing an intruder with "bushy eyebrows" around the time of the crime. The ruling came in the trial of Bryan Kohberger, who is charged with murder in the stabbing deaths of four students. The judge also ruled that Kohberger's defense team cannot use his medical diagnoses to explain his courtroom demeanor unless he takes the stand.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court issued an order forbidding the Trump administration from removing Venezuelan immigrants from the United States without due process. The ruling came in response to concerns that the government was defying a previous court order by rushing deportations. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented. The order suggests the Court may no longer tolerate procedural tactics intended to evade meaningful judicial review of immigration policies.</p>

            <p>A CNBC survey indicates that President Trump's economic approval rating has fallen to its lowest point, driven by discontent over tariffs, inflation, and government spending. Economic optimism following his reelection has waned, with more Americans believing the economy will worsen. While Trump's Republican base remains supportive, disapproval has increased among Democrats, independents, and blue-collar workers. Tariffs and inflation are key areas of concern, and more Americans believe a recession is imminent. (not investment advice)</p>
