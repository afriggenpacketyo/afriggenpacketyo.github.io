          <p>House Republicans are pushing for a vote on a tax bill containing President Trump's agenda, including tax cuts, border security, and defense spending. However, disagreements persist within the GOP over issues like the state and local tax deduction (SALT) and Medicaid work requirements, jeopardizing its passage. Speaker Mike Johnson is attempting to balance demands from conservative hardliners and moderate Republicans to reach a consensus. The bill is scheduled to go before the House Rules Committee, where further changes could be made before a full House vote, with President Trump urging Republicans to unite behind the legislation.</p>

          <p>Special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) are making a comeback, driven by figures connected to President Trump and investments in cryptocurrency and blockchain. These speculative investment vehicles allow executives to raise money on the stock market without a concrete business plan, seeking acquisitions within two years. Key executives from Trump Media & Technology Group and advisors to Saudi Arabia are involved in recent SPAC deals, with firms like Cantor Fitzgerald actively participating. The resurgence is fueled by a rising stock market, demand for crypto, and small investors seeking quick gains, though many past SPAC deals have faced regulatory scrutiny and investor losses.

          <p>The Spanish government has ordered Airbnb to remove nearly 66,000 listings that violate regulations, as part of a broader effort to address a severe housing crisis.

          <p>Homeowners with 100% home equity have attractive borrowing options like home equity loans and HELOCs, offering lower interest rates compared to personal loans and credit cards. Having 100% equity means the home is fully owned without a mortgage balance, though lenders typically allow borrowing only 80-90% of the home's value. HELOCs offer variable rates that could decrease with potential interest rate cuts, while home equity loans provide a lump sum with fixed rates.
