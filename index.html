        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following deadly anti-corruption protests that led to the ousting of her predecessor, Nepal's interim Prime Minister Sushila Karki has vowed to address the demands of young demonstrators. In her first public address, the former chief justice promised to prioritize good governance and economic equality, acknowledging her appointment was driven by street protests organized by the youth. Karki has committed to a short tenure of no more than six months, during which she will oversee the transition to a new government with elections scheduled for March 5. The recent unrest, which resulted in at least 72 deaths, was initially sparked by a social media ban but grew to encompass broader economic frustrations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, representing families of Israelis held by Hamas, has publicly identified Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the primary obstacle to securing a hostage release deal. They assert that every time negotiations approach a breakthrough, Netanyahu's actions, such as the recent strike in Qatar that killed Hamas leaders, sabotage the process. The group accuses the prime minister of using excuses to prolong the conflict and maintain his political power, which they claim has cost the lives of numerous hostages. This statement comes as U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visits Israel amid international condemnation of the strike in Doha.</p>

          <p>A central London protest organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson resulted in injuries to 26 police officers and led to 24 arrests. The 'Unite the Kingdom' rally, which drew up to 150,000 participants, saw clashes as some demonstrators threw projectiles at law enforcement attempting to keep them separated from a counter-protest. The event featured a video address from tech billionaire Elon Musk, who called for a change of government in the UK over migration policies. The Metropolitan Police described the violence as "wholly unacceptable" and deployed over 1,500 officers to manage the tense situation between the rally and the nearby anti-racism demonstration.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian military drones successfully struck the Kirishi oil refinery, one of Russia's largest, located in the northwestern Leningrad region. The attack, confirmed by Russian officials, sparked a significant fire at the facility, which is operated by Surgutneftegas and has a substantial production capacity. This strike is part of a broader Ukrainian strategy to target Russia's oil infrastructure, aiming to disrupt the fuel supply for Moscow's war efforts.

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has arrived in Israel for a two-day visit as Israeli military operations intensify in northern Gaza, resulting in further Palestinian casualties. The trip aims to address the diplomatic fallout from Israel's recent strike on Hamas leaders in Qatar, an action that angered the Trump administration and derailed ceasefire negotiations. Rubio's visit is also intended as a show of support for Israel, which faces growing international isolation and a contentious UN debate on Palestinian statehood. Meanwhile, Israeli attacks continue across Gaza, with reports of a high-rise building being destroyed and numerous deaths, including from malnutrition.</p>

          <p>This opinion article recounts the story of Kelvin, the biological father of the author's adopted children, who was deported to El Salvador immediately after being paroled from a California prison. Despite demonstrating significant rehabilitation during his incarceration for armed robbery, including earning certifications and taking parenting classes, an old deportation order was enforced by ICE. Upon arrival in El Salvador, he was imprisoned in a facility known for torture due to a gang tattoo, a fate the author argues was foreseeable and thus makes his deportation illegal under international law. The piece contends that deporting a rehabilitated individual undermines justice and humanity, wasting the state's investment in his recovery.</p>

          <p>As Israel expands its military operations in Gaza, a contentious domestic debate over mandatory military service for the Ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) community is reaching a critical point. A historical exemption for full-time religious students is now under intense scrutiny, as the strain on military reservists grows and the IDF faces a personnel shortage. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition is fragile, with Ultra-Orthodox parties threatening to withdraw if a new exemption law is not passed. Proponents of universal conscription argue it is a matter of national security and social equality, while Haredi leaders maintain that Torah study is vital for the nation's spiritual existence.</p>

The system reportedly moves beyond traditional search patterns by functioning as an intelligent commander. It integrates and analyzes real-time data from a wide array of sources, including sonar buoys, underwater sensors, radar, and oceanographic information like temperature and salinity. This allows the AI to create a comprehensive, live operational picture of the undersea environment, significantly enhancing detection and tracking capabilities against submerged threats.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by scholars warns that the Colorado River's reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, are so depleted that another dry year could trigger a severe water crisis. The researchers are calling on the Trump administration to impose immediate and significant water use cutbacks across the seven states reliant on the river, including California and Arizona. Despite some relief from a snowy winter in 2023, a subsequent dry year and long-term overuse have left the reservoirs at just around 30% capacity. The report emphasizes that without proactive reductions, the region risks facing "draconian measures" to manage the dwindling water supply.</p>

When the Sheriff's Department discovered the secret investigation, top officials, with Baca's alleged approval, orchestrated a scheme to hide an inmate informant from the FBI and intimidate agent Marx. This act of obstruction expanded the federal case, ultimately leading to the conviction of 22 department members, including Baca himself, for their roles in the conspiracy.</p>

Missouri's new plan, which is expected to be signed into law, is designed to help Republicans gain a seat currently held by a Democrat, though it faces legal challenges and accusations of diluting the votes of Black communities. This trend, also seen in Texas, is part of a national strategy to protect the Republican House majority.

          <h2>New Ladybird Species Discovered in the UK for the First Time</h2>

          <p>The Little Arboreal Ladybird, a species typically found in continental Europe, has been officially recorded in the UK for the first time, with sightings in England's New Forest. Experts believe the hot summer weather facilitated the species' journey across the English Channel, establishing a new colony. This discovery is part of a broader trend of winged insects moving north and colonizing southern England due to warming temperatures. Conservationists view this natural colonization as a positive sign of biodiversity adapting to climate change, suggesting these new arrivals will be crucial for maintaining wildlife diversity in the coming decades.</p>

          <p>Manchester City enters this weekend's derby against Manchester United in an unusually difficult position, trailing their rivals in the league table and coming off two consecutive defeats. Manager Pep Guardiola is grappling with several issues, including integrating numerous new, young players after the departure of key veterans and managing a growing injury list. The goalkeeping situation has also been a point of confusion, with the recent signing of Gianluigi Donnarumma after another keeper was declared the number one. This match is seen as a crucial test for a City side that appears defensively vulnerable and is struggling to find its rhythm this season.</p>

          <p>Residents of Henllys, a village in Cwmbran, Wales, were baffled after finding approximately 20 signs painted over with St. George's Crosses, the flag of England. The graffiti also included swastikas and anti-immigration text in a subway used by schoolchildren. In response, about 15 community members organized to clean the vandalism, an act they described as empowering against a divisive message. The incident follows a recent trend of similar symbols appearing across England, which some groups claim is patriotic, but others view as provocative and linked to far-right sentiments.</p>

          <p>A seemingly ordinary working father, Robert Andrews Jr., was exposed as the leader of a multi-million pound drug empire after police discovered incriminating WhatsApp messages on another gang leader's phone.

A covert police operation captured him conducting large-scale drug and cash exchanges in secluded woodland areas. Despite his modest lifestyle, he was funneling profits into a new luxury home and was ultimately sentenced to over 14 years in prison, dismantling a significant organized crime group.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study suggests that women trying to conceive should avoid using cannabis, as its active ingredient, THC, can negatively affect female fertility. The research, which examined both human eggs in a laboratory setting and IVF outcomes in patients, found that THC disrupts the development and genetic stability of egg cells. Patients with detectable THC in their system had a significantly lower rate of producing genetically healthy embryos, which is crucial for a successful pregnancy. The study observed that THC led to more errors in chromosome distribution and defective egg cell structures, potentially reducing the chances of implantation and increasing miscarriage risk.</p>

          <p>China has issued four travel advisories for the Philippines since April, citing an "unstable" public security situation and crimes targeting Chinese citizens. Analysts suggest these repeated warnings could negatively impact economic ties between the two nations. If heeded by Chinese citizens, the advisories may lead to a slowdown in two-way trade, investment, and enrollment in Philippine universities. While observers note that Chinese nationals engaged in legal activities rarely encounter trouble, the frequency of the warnings from Beijing points to underlying diplomatic tensions that could spill over into the economic sphere.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the end of Nazi rule, the racist ideology codified in the 1935 Nuremberg Laws continues to cast a shadow over Germany. These laws stripped Jewish citizens and other minorities of their rights, creating a distinction between state citizens and superior "Reich citizens." Historians and activists express concern that this concept is being echoed by the modern far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which distinguishes between "passport Germans" and "real Germans." This rhetoric challenges the German constitution's foundational principle of equality for all citizens, highlighting a persistent struggle with discrimination based on ancestry.</p>

          <p>A growing number of teenage boys are adopting extreme fitness and diet cycles known as "cutting and bulking" to achieve a muscular, "ripped" physique, a trend heavily promoted on social media platforms like TikTok. This method involves alternating between high-calorie diets to build mass and severe calorie restriction to reduce body fat and increase muscle definition. While some see it as a healthy and disciplined lifestyle, nutritionists and health experts warn it can be harmful for adolescents. The practice poses risks to hormone health, growth, and development, and may contribute to eating disorders like muscle dysmorphia.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Donald Trump's leadership style, which projects an image of a strongman but folds when confronted by determined adversaries, is exacerbating global conflicts. The author contends that leaders like Russia's Vladimir Putin and Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu have exploited this weakness, leading to escalations such as Russian drone incursions into Poland and the Israeli strike in Qatar that sabotaged Gaza peace talks. The article suggests that Trump's policies have undermined Western cohesion and that other democratic nations must step up to counter Russian and Israeli aggression. It concludes that waiting for U.S. leadership under Trump is futile and risks a descent into global anarchy.</p>

          <p>The upcoming state visit of U.S. President Donald Trump to the United Kingdom will feature a significant royal charm offensive, designed to flatter the president and strengthen diplomatic ties. The UK government hopes that the elaborate pageantry, including a lavish banquet and ceremonies hosted by King Charles III, will create a positive atmosphere for discussing sensitive issues like trade and the war in Ukraine. Analysts suggest Trump's known admiration for the monarchy provides the King with a unique diplomatic advantage. The carefully orchestrated visit will largely take place within the secure confines of the Windsor estate, away from potential public protests.</p>
