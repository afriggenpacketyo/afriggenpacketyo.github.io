        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada's Liberal Party, led by Mark Carney, has won the federal election, a surprising turnaround fueled by Canadian opposition to U.S. President Trump's threats to annex Canada and impose sweeping tariffs. Trump's rhetoric and policies, which undermine the Canadian economy, dominated the campaign and influenced voters' choices, leading to a surge in support for the Liberal Party. Voters considered Canada's sovereignty, tariffs, and affordability as key issues, with many expressing concern about Trump's impact on Canada and the need for broader global partnerships. Carney's victory represents a rejection of Trump's aggressive stance and a renewed commitment to Canadian independence.</p>

          <p>Tom Homan, President Trump's "border czar," asserted that Kilmar Abrego Garcia's deportation to El Salvador was justified, despite a previous withholding order protecting him from removal due to gang persecution. Homan claimed that the facts surrounding the withholding order had changed, alleging Abrego Garcia is now a terrorist and the gang he feared no longer exists. However, Abrego Garcia's attorneys deny any gang affiliation and note his lack of a criminal record. The Salvadoran president has refused to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S., leading to diplomatic tensions and legal battles, with a federal judge setting a deadline for the Trump administration to respond to inquiries about his case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration plans to announce measures to alleviate the impact of tariffs on imported cars and auto parts, providing automakers with more time to relocate production to the United States. While tariffs of 25 percent on imported vehicles and auto parts will remain, modifications will prevent "stacking" tariffs on materials like steel and aluminum. Automakers will also receive reimbursements for some tariff costs on imported components, phased out over two years. This adjustment aims to balance rewarding domestic manufacturing with providing a transition for companies investing in U.S. production.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has rejected anonymous criticism of her leadership, labeling the critics "cowards" as the party anticipates potential losses in upcoming local elections. Two anonymous Tories voiced their discontent in an article in the Critic magazine, advocating for her replacement by shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick. Badenoch dismissed the criticism, stating she is not concerned about those who are too afraid to attach their names to their opinions. She also refuted claims of a rift with Jenrick regarding a potential electoral pact with Reform UK.</p>

          <p>Walmart and other major U.S. retailers have reportedly instructed some manufacturers in China's Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to resume shipments to the United States, signaling a potential shift in trade dynamics. This decision comes after a series of tariff hikes between the U.S. and China had slowed shipments, with Walmart indicating that the costs of the new import duties will be borne by the U.S. clients. At least one exporter in Jiangsu has also been asked to prepare for a recovery in demand, suggesting that major retailers anticipate a rebound in trade activity.</p>

          <p>As part of President Donald Trump’s sweeping immigration crackdown, unaccompanied minors are now being targeted for deportation, with the Department of Homeland Security engaging in “welfare checks” on children who arrived in the US alone, usually across the US-Mexican border. These moves have sparked fears of a crackdown and prompted alarm about what one critic called “backdoor family separation”.

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated investigations into Harvard University and the Harvard Law Review following allegations that the legal journal selects articles based on authors' race rather than merit. This action coincides with ongoing disputes between the administration and Harvard over diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and concerns about antisemitism on campus, leading to a freeze on federal grants. The investigations aim to determine if the Law Review's policies and practices violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits race-based discrimination by recipients of federal funding.</p>
