          <p>Amazon's Zoox is increasing its robotaxi production at a new facility in Hayward, California, to prepare for its commercial launch in Las Vegas later this year. The facility currently produces one robotaxi per day but aims to increase this rate significantly over the next year, with a full-scale capacity of 10,000 robotaxis annually. Zoox, acquired by Amazon in 2020, is testing its robotaxis in several cities and plans to operate between 500 and 1,000 robotaxis in small- to medium-sized cities, the company said. The company's CEO, Aicha Evans, emphasized that the company is focused on deploying a ride-hailing service rather than selling the vehicles. </p>

          <p>Temperatures in the UK are expected to reach 30C, potentially leading to the first heatwave of 2025. Yellow heat-health alerts are in place for most of England, indicating a greater risk to vulnerable people, and temperatures will peak in different regions on different days. The Met Office study indicates a rising risk of exceeding 40C in the UK in the next 12 years, citing climate change as a driving factor. The rising temperatures are attributed to a developing area of high pressure drawing in hot weather from Western Europe, where temperatures could approach 40C. </p>

          <p>NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory captured an image of an intense solar flare released by the sun on Tuesday evening. The solar flare, classified as an X-class flare (the most intense type), peaked at 5:49 p.m. EDT, sending energy, light, and high-speed particles into space. Solar flares can disrupt radio communications, electric power grids, and navigation signals, and they can also pose risks to spacecraft and astronauts. The flare was also associated with a coronal mass ejection, which can cause geomagnetic storms on Earth, as seen in May and October 2024. </p>

          <p>The Social Security trust fund is now projected to be depleted by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast, according to the Social Security Board of Trustees' annual report. This means that the federal retirement program may need to cut monthly benefits by about 20%. The new projection is partly due to increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act and a surge in early benefits claims, attributed to anxieties about the program's stability. Americans are filing for Social Security benefits at a record rate this year, with claims jumping 17% through May, as the program faces financial challenges due to baby boomer retirements and an aging population.

After returning to the UK, she was diagnosed at Barnsley Hospital and died on June 11, after developing symptoms such as headaches and loss of motor functions. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) stated that there is no risk to the wider public, but close contacts and health workers are being assessed and offered vaccinations as a precaution. Rabies is a virus that causes an infection of the brain and nervous system, and it is nearly always fatal once symptoms appear, though post-exposure treatment is very effective if given promptly. </p>

Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson has also criticized Republican "warmongers," leading to a rebuke from Trump, while Steve Bannon warns against allowing the "deep state" to drive the US into a war with Iran.

The court argued that the law responds to ongoing debate among medical experts regarding the risks and benefits of such treatments. The dissenting justices argued that the ban leads to medical discrimination on the basis of sex, abandoning transgender children and their families to political whims. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Striking Iran's nuclear sites is a difficult feat due to the hardened nature of facilities like the Fordo plant, which is built inside a mountain and reinforced with concrete. The U.S. is the only country with the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) "bunker buster" bomb and the B2 Spirit stealth bomber capable of deploying it. However, even a strike with these weapons may not guarantee complete destruction, requiring multiple bombing rounds and potentially ground personnel. A U.S. strike could also trigger Iranian retaliation against U.S. assets in the region, potentially escalating the conflict. </p>

          <p>Senate Democrats largely boycotted a Republican-led hearing focused on Joe Biden's mental decline, with only one Democrat attending. The hearing, titled “Unfit to Serve: How the Biden Cover-Up Endangered America and Undermined the Constitution,” saw Democratic ranking member Dick Durbin launching a counterattack on Donald Trump's statements before leaving. Republicans framed the panel as addressing a "constitutional crisis," citing reports that Biden's team concealed his declining capabilities. The lone Democrat, Peter Welch, argued that the constitutional crisis stemmed from Congress's abdication of its legislative responsibilities. </p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to extend the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok's U.S. business or face a nationwide ban for the third time. The extension, lasting 90 days, aims to allow the administration to ensure a deal is closed so that Americans can continue using TikTok securely. This decision marks another pause in the enforcement of a bipartisan law requiring ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. operations. Previous delays occurred due to potential deals being curtailed by Trump's imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods. </p>

          <p>Israel has been targeting Iran's nuclear facilities in an effort to destroy Tehran's nuclear program, with sites in Natanz, Isfahan, and now Fordow in the crosshairs. The Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, located south of Tehran, is a key enrichment facility situated deep underground. While the IAEA theoretically conducts inspections, Iran has increasingly limited access for international inspectors. The Institute for Science and International Security warned that Iran's Fordow stockpile could allow the production of enough weapons-grade uranium to build several nuclear warheads in just three weeks. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court rejected a challenge brought by Texas and landowners against the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval of a plan to store nuclear waste in the state. The court determined that neither Texas nor the land developer were parties to the commission's licensing proceeding, thus they cannot obtain judicial review. The ruling reverses a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. The court did not address the broader issue of whether the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has the authority to license private companies to store nuclear waste offsite. </p>

          <p>Purchasing a $500,000 annuity at age 65 can provide a reliable retirement income, but the exact monthly payout depends on factors like gender, annuity type, and interest rates. For a 65-year-old male, a $500,000 immediate fixed annuity could yield around $3,269 per month for life, while a female of the same age might receive around $3,151 per month. Joint life annuities, covering two people, typically offer lower monthly payments. Interest rates, the type of annuity, and payout features also influence the monthly income, with higher rates and deferred annuities generally providing more generous payouts.

          <p>Global food production is at an all-time high, but that harvest is concentrated in a few breadbaskets and faces significant challenges from climate change. A new study in Nature found that key staple crops will see an 11.2 percent decline by the end of the century compared to a world without warming. The largest drops aren’t occurring in poorer farmlands, but in major food-producing regions like the US Midwest. Rising average temperatures and changing rainfall patterns are poised to diminish yields, while extreme weather events could wipe out harvests more often. </p>

They sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins with detailed questions about the effort. The lawmakers cited privacy risks and the potential for damaging SNAP's reputation. The USDA is seeking to collect names, birth dates, Social Security numbers, and addresses of SNAP recipients and applicants from the past five years. </p>
