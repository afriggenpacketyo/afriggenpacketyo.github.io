          <p>The Department of Justice has charged a father-son duo and other Sinaloa cartel leaders with trafficking fentanyl, cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin into the United States. Pedro Inzunza Noriega and his son, Pedro Inzunza Coronel, allegedly ran one of the largest fentanyl production networks. The pair trafficked tens of thousands of kilograms of fentanyl into the U.S., with over 1.65 tons seized from their holdings. Attorney General Pam Bondi emphasized the government's commitment to seeking life imprisonment for these terrorists, highlighting President Trump's designation of Latin American drug trafficking organizations as terrorist organizations.</p>
