          <p>Elon Musk announced at the Qatar Economic Forum that he plans to significantly decrease his political spending in the future, a notable shift after donating over $250 million to help Donald Trump win a second term. Musk stated he feels he has "done enough" but may reconsider if he sees a future reason for political spending. This decision could impact Republicans running for reelection, as Musk's super political action committee was a major spender in recent elections. Public opinion of Musk and his companies has declined, coinciding with a drop in Tesla's market value, though shares have recently rebounded. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's efforts to persuade House Republicans from blue states to support a major tax bill have failed, as the 'SALT Caucus' remains opposed due to insufficient increases in state and local tax deductions. The opposition threatens to derail the legislation, which Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson hoped to pass before Memorial Day weekend. The current bill proposes raising the SALT deduction to $30,000, but some GOP lawmakers from high-tax states are pushing for a higher cap. Trump urged the caucus to 'let it go,' but five members remain 'no' votes.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to announce plans for a massive missile shield system, dubbed the 'Golden Dome,' to protect the U.S. from missile threats, potentially costing tens to hundreds of billions of dollars. The project, led by Gen. Michael Guetlein, echoes President Ronald Reagan's 'Star Wars' program. Trump's push for the shield, inspired by Israel's Iron Dome, was met with cheers at rallies, leading to its inclusion in the Republican party platform. Questions remain about the system's scope and potential impact on other vital programs, such as the Air Force's intercontinental ballistic missile replacement.</p>

          <p>A maintenance worker, Sterling Williams, has been arrested and charged with aiding 10 inmates in their escape from a New Orleans jail. Williams allegedly shut off the water supply, allowing the inmates to remove a toilet and sink fixture from a cell wall, creating an escape route. He claimed an inmate threatened him to comply. The inmates then cut steel bars and exited through a loading dock, scaling a wall to escape. A civilian employee monitoring security systems was absent from his post at the time of the escape, prompting investigations into procedural failures and intentional wrongdoings.</p>

          <p>Nearly 2 million federal student loan borrowers are caught in an Education Department backlog, awaiting approval or denial for affordable repayment plans. This complication arises as the Trump administration restarts collection activity, potentially leaving many borrowers at risk of default. The backlog stems from the administration's need to ensure repayment plans complied with a court order blocking the Biden administration's SAVE plan. Without access to affordable repayment plans, borrowers face suspension of loan forgiveness timelines and increased risk of falling behind on payments.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the complexities of prostate cancer screening, highlighting that even diligent testing may not detect aggressive forms of the disease. Guidelines advise against screening after age 70, as many men have slow-growing cancers that pose no threat. The article references the recent diagnosis of former President Joe Biden, noting that fast-growing cancers can emerge between screenings or remain undetected by PSA tests. Experts emphasize the importance of discussing the risks and benefits of screening with doctors, as treatments can have devastating side effects, particularly in older men.</p>

          <p>Britain has recently struck trade deals with the European Union and the United States, showcasing its ability to engage with both major trade partners. However, these deals required concessions, highlighting Britain's diminished position post-Brexit. The agreement with the EU involves allowing European trawlers to fish in British waters, while the deal with the US grants greater access to American agricultural products. Experts suggest that Britain faces constraints as a midsize economy operating among larger trading blocs.</p>

          <p>Member states of the World Health Organization have overwhelmingly voted to adopt the first ever pandemic agreement aimed at preventing, preparing for, and responding to future pandemics. The 30-page treaty lays out a framework for boosting surveillance of animals to lower the risk of viruses spilling over to humans and for responding more effectively once pandemics do come. However, the agreement's ultimate impact remains unclear due to a lack of enforcement mechanisms and robust funding, and the absence of the U.S. The agreement's success depends on countries ratifying the agreement internally.</p>

His message targeted a group of Republicans seeking cuts to the Medicaid health-care coverage program and the addition of work requirements. Critics argue that work requirements would create bureaucratic challenges. Medicaid, jointly financed by the federal government and states, covers nearly 80 million Americans.</p>

Another study revealed that losing Medicaid coverage leads to reduced prescription drug access and increased mortality rates.
