        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration escalated its conflict with Harvard University by barring the institution from enrolling international students, citing non-compliance with information requests and concerns over anti-Americanism and antisemitism. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused Harvard of fostering an unsafe environment hostile to Jewish students and promoting pro-Hamas sentiments. Harvard responded by stating the action was unlawful and threatened serious harm to the university's community and academic mission, vowing to maintain its ability to host international students. The administration views enrolling foreign students as a privilege, not a right, and insists on enforcing laws against anti-Americanism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has agreed to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, a decision driven by legal challenges and fears of Chinese influence. The primary concern revolves around the joint UK-US military base on Diego Garcia, with ministers arguing that continued UK sovereignty would render the base legally and practically inoperable. Defence Secretary John Healey cited potential legal rulings from UN bodies and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea that could interfere with the base's operations. The deal also aims to prevent China from establishing a military presence on the islands, offering Mauritius a financial incentive to maintain cooperation with the UK.</p>

          <p>Ezra Klein interviews Jake Tapper, co-author of "Original Sin," about the perceived cover-up surrounding Joe Biden's cognitive decline leading up to the 2024 election. Tapper recounts special prosecutor Robert Hur's flabbergasted reaction to Biden's forgetfulness during interviews, suggesting a stark contrast between public perception and private reality. The article explores the White House's alleged efforts to downplay concerns about Biden's age and memory, even to the point of attacking their own Attorney General. Tapper argues that the Democratic Party's gaslighting of the public regarding Biden's abilities ultimately contributed to their electoral defeat, as voters recognized the disconnect between the official narrative and the President's actual performance.</p>

          <p>Robert F Kennedy Jr.'s 'MAHA' commission report, focused on chronic disease among children, has been released, highlighting ultra-processed foods, environmental chemical exposure, lack of physical activity, and 'overmedicalization'. The report, however, omits common causes of chronic disease, insinuates harms where evidence is lacking, and avoids discussing how Republican policies have impacted the health system. The report is seen as a mix of interesting ideas and fringe theories, drawing criticism from experts.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the importance of defending academic freedom, even when the ideas in question are controversial or harmful. Drawing parallels between the McCarthy era and current challenges, the piece emphasizes the need for unrestricted freedom of thought and due process. Referencing Joseph Alsop's 1953 letter, it argues that universities must uphold the freedom to think "bad thoughts as well as good." The article also notes the increase in professors being fired for their beliefs in recent years.</p>

          <p>A federal judge issued a nationwide injunction blocking the Trump administration from terminating the legal status of thousands of international students. Judge Jeffrey White found that the administration's actions violated due process rights and caused significant hardship to the students. The ruling prevents immigration authorities from arresting or jailing the plaintiffs and bars the administration from reversing the reinstatement of certain students' legal status. The case arose after the administration terminated SEVIS records for students under the "Student Criminal Alien Initiative."</p>

          <p>The Senate voted to block California's plan to phase out new gasoline-powered vehicles, a move that challenges the state's authority to set stricter environmental rules. The vote, supported by Republicans, was made possible by an unusual legislative tactic that Democrats denounced.

The repeal could also impact other states that intended to follow California's plan.</p>
