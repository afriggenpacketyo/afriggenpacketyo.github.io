          <p>This New York Times article analyzes the Trump administration's increasingly relaxed approach to ethical norms and legal guardrails, highlighting concerns about potential corruption and conflicts of interest. The article details instances such as the acceptance of a luxury jet from Qatar, the promotion of a meme cryptocurrency benefiting the Trump family, and the rollback of law enforcement efforts targeting cryptocurrency crimes and foreign bribery. The article also touches upon pressure on law firms to provide free legal services and settlements from media companies, suggesting a pattern of leveraging presidential power for personal gain. The article concludes by emphasizing the openness with which the administration is leveraging its position for personal benefits, marking a notable shift in Washington's ethical landscape.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has endorsed Jack Ciattarelli, a former critic, for New Jersey governor, calling him a "terrific America First Candidate." Ciattarelli, who previously criticized Trump, now aligns with his agenda, promising to grow the economy, cut taxes, secure the border, and protect veterans. The endorsement has sparked mixed reactions, with Ciattarelli expressing honor and resolve to unite the party and make New Jersey affordable and safe again. The New Jersey Democratic Governors Association criticized the endorsement, stating that Ciattarelli would put Trump before New Jersey, while Bill Spadea, another Republican candidate, accused Ciattarelli of lying about his record.</p>

          <p>This BBC article reports on Donald Trump's offer to mediate between India and Pakistan regarding the Kashmir dispute, a move that has put India in a tight spot. For decades, India has opposed third-party mediation, especially in the Kashmir conflict, treating the region as an integral part of its territory. Trump's offer follows recent clashes between the two nations, but India views it as an attempt to internationalize the issue, particularly after revoking Kashmir's special status in 2019. The article highlights the historical context of the dispute and India's firm stance against terrorism as a reason for not engaging in direct bilateral talks with Pakistan.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reports on the anticlimactic auction of the Riggio family's art collection, indicating potential weakness in the art market. The sale, seen as a bellwether for the auction season, fell short of expectations, with many objects presold and little enthusiastic bidding. Experts attributed the subdued atmosphere to economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs. While some artworks sold above their estimates, a major Warhol painting was withdrawn, and a painting by Lucio Fontana sold for significantly less than it had in 2017, suggesting a cooling market for certain artworks.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have proposed sharp restrictions on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), seeking to limit funding and benefits as part of a package to advance President Trump's tax cuts. The proposal would require states to contribute funding and impose stricter work requirements, potentially causing millions of low-income families to lose access to aid. Republicans argue the changes will improve the program while defraying the cost of tax cuts. Democrats and anti-poverty groups are likely to oppose the measures, warning they would deepen hunger and poverty.</p>

          <p>A shortage of air traffic controllers at the Philadelphia facility managing Newark Liberty International Airport's air traffic caused significant flight delays, with some flights delayed by up to seven hours. The FAA said that at least three controllers were scheduled for each hour, but sources claimed the number of fully certified controllers was at times one or two, while the target is fourteen. The delays follow previous radar outages and equipment failures, contributing to ongoing issues at Newark. The FAA is working to address staffing and technology issues, but solutions may take time.</p>

The resolution, prompted by a challenge from Kalyn Free, alleges that the DNC improperly combined two questions and tallied votes together, giving male candidates an advantage. The move follows controversy surrounding Hogg's efforts to mount primary challenges against Democrats, leading to concerns about neutrality in primary elections.

          <p>A scientist warns that proposed funding cuts by the Trump administration could eliminate NOAA's global CO2 program, ending decades of unbroken data collection. The program monitors CO2 levels, a key indicator of climate change, and the cuts would degrade the nation's ability to project future climate impacts. The program's data is used to create the Keeling Curve, a simple graph plotting the unchecked rise of carbon dioxide. Ralph Keeling, whose father started the program, said turning off a program like this would be like turning off the headlights on a dark street at night.</p>
