The call was reportedly initiated by Trump. The conversation comes after accusations from both sides regarding violations of a previous agreement to ease tariff escalations. U.S. officials claimed China was withholding critical minerals, while China criticized the U.S. for introducing discriminatory measures, including restrictions on AI chips and student visas.

          <p>A survey from Capgemini indicates that 81% of "next generation millionaires" plan to replace their parents' wealth management firms, citing poor digital offerings or a lack of services and products. Cerulli Associates estimates that over $100 trillion is expected to flow from baby boomers and older generations to heirs and spouses. Younger investors are more interested in crypto, private equity, and overseas investments. Wealth managers are challenged to build relationships with the next generation, who are more global and have different priorities.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his supporters are on a mission to overhaul school lunch. The Trump administration’s Make America Healthy Again Commission released a report on children’s health that pointed to school meals as one venue where ultra-processed foods are offered to kids unabated, contributing to obesity and other kinds of chronic disease. The report suggests ridding school lunch of ultra-processed foods means the end of pizza day as we know it. There is concern that when school meals are too healthy, a sizable portion of kids simply get off the lunch line.</p>

The U.S. lowered its rate to 30% on Chinese goods, and China cut its tariffs to 10%. (not investment advice)</p>
