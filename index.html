        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Skomer Island, off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has recorded a record high of 43,626 puffins, a stark contrast to the rapid decline in global puffin populations. The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales attributes this success to the island's isolation, which protects the birds from predators like rats, cats, and foxes, as well as human impact. Skomer also hosts 350,000 breeding pairs of manx shearwaters and thousands of guillemots and razorbills, monitored annually by the WTSWW. Globally, puffins are listed as vulnerable to extinction due to pollution, food shortages, and climate change, highlighting the importance of Skomer's conservation success.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has determined that Elon Musk's role leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is 'continuing and permanent,' despite the White House's attempts to characterize it as temporary. A lawsuit filed by 14 states alleges that Musk's sweeping changes to the federal government, including eliminating offices and cutting the workforce, are unconstitutional because he was not confirmed by the Senate. Judge Tanya Chutkan found that the states made a credible argument that Musk occupies a continuing position and exercises significant authority without proper appointment by Congress. The case can move forward, though President Trump was dismissed as a defendant.</p>

          <p>Police Scotland's national child abuse investigation unit is using a 'soft' approach when arresting suspected paedophiles, prioritizing minimizing disruption to families and neighborhoods. This tactic involves plainclothes detectives executing search warrants with a gentle knock rather than a forceful entry. The unit has seen a 30% increase in child sexual abuse investigations since 2015, with offenders increasingly making direct contact with children online, often within 30 seconds of trying, according to Det Ch Insp Mike Smith. The unit conducts 700 child sexual abuse investigations a year, safeguarding between 600 and 800 children in Scotland, and the offenders come from various backgrounds, including teachers, lawyers, and police officers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's bond market is raising concerns about potential capital flight from the U.S. as long-dated yields hover near record highs, sparking fears of a carry trade unwind and broader market turmoil. Rising Japanese government bond yields could incentivize Japanese investors to repatriate funds from the U.S., potentially triggering a global financial market downturn. Analysts warn that a strengthening yen, driven by higher yields, could negatively impact U.S. tech stocks and increase global borrowing costs, with Japan's significant net external assets amplifying the risk. The Bank of Japan scaling back bond purchases and Japanese life insurance companies meeting their buying requirements are contributing to the yield curve steepening. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump claimed that Canada is 'considering' an offer to become the 51st U.S. state in exchange for free protection under the 'Golden Dome' missile defense system. Trump stated that remaining a separate nation would cost Canada $61 billion, while becoming a state would cost nothing. However, Canadian officials, including Prime Minister Mark Carney, have repeatedly asserted that Canada is not for sale, and King Charles III has seemingly rejected the idea of purchasing the country. Discussions between the U.S. and Canada regarding security programs, including the 'Golden Dome,' are ongoing.</p>

The revised law targets companies producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually across various industries, accounting for nearly 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Under the system, companies will receive maximum emission allowances and must purchase carbon credits for emissions exceeding that threshold, incentivizing emissions reduction. While intended to lower emissions, the costs of decarbonization efforts may be passed on to consumers through price increases.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration pursues a nuclear deal with Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly threatening to strike Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities, creating tension between the two leaders. Netanyahu believes Iran's current vulnerability presents an opportune time for military action, while Trump prefers negotiating an end to Iran's enrichment program, backed by the threat of military intervention if talks fail. Israeli officials fear that Trump is eager for a deal that allows Iran to maintain its uranium enrichment facilities, leading Israel to prepare for a potential strike without U.S. assistance. These tensions are based on differing views of how best to exploit Iran's weakness.</p>

          <p>A British think tank, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), warns that a Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army (PLA) attack on Taiwan is 'unlikely in the near future' but 'not impossible,' particularly given the risk of misperception and miscommunication with the U.S. under President Donald Trump. The report highlights strained U.S.-China relations, characterized by 'deep mutual distrust and a lack of dialogue mechanisms.' While tactical improvements occurred during the Biden administration, the IISS cautions that these are unlikely to significantly alter the strategic direction of the two powers during Trump's second term.</p>

Orban, seen as Russia's closest ally in the EU, has been critical of Ukraine's EU membership and has maintained trade relations with Russia despite international sanctions. Critics view Orban's actions as an attempt to undermine the Tisza Party and reward Russian aggression, while the government's narrative is seen as weak and politically motivated.</p>

County sheriffâ€™s deputy Trevor Kirk, convicted of felony excessive force, to a misdemeanor, though he could still face prison time. The decision comes after controversy surrounding the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney's attempt to offer Kirk a misdemeanor plea deal, which led to resignations within the U.S. attorney's office. Kirk was convicted of using excessive force against an unarmed woman in 2023, and the judge's ruling has sparked criticism from the victim's attorney.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Claim 'Cure' for 'Extremely Unpleasant' Hyperloop Ride</h2>

          <p>Chinese scientists claim to have solved a critical flaw in hyperloop technology, addressing issues of turbulence and vibration at high speeds. Researchers found that track irregularities and electromagnetic resonance could cause violent low-frequency vibrations in maglev cars traveling at 1,000km/h, making the ride 'extremely unpleasant.' However, they developed a method to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, improving ride comfort. The study, based on supercomputer simulations and prototype tests, could potentially salvage vacuum-tube maglev technology and address challenges faced by Elon Muskâ€™s Hyperloop concept.</p>
