            <p>Millions of Beijing residents were urged to stay indoors as the city experienced its strongest winds in decades, caused by a cold vortex from Mongolia.

Nationalization is seen as a way to preserve jobs and maintain the UK's steel-making capacity, but it would require significant investment from taxpayers. (not investment advice)</p>
