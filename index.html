          <p>Concerns about softening consumer travel demand, fueled by looming tariffs and decreased consumer confidence, caused airline stocks to decline. Delta Air Lines, the most profitable U.S. carrier, saw its shares fall over 2% after a downgrade from Jefferies.  The bank cited potential reductions in Delta's 2025 forecasts, although Delta executives highlight growth in higher-end cabins and credit card partnerships. Delta's upcoming earnings report will be closely watched.</p>

Countries importing Venezuelan oil will face a 25% tariff on all U.S. trade.  This primarily affects China, India, and Spain, potentially disrupting oil supplies and prompting retaliatory measures.

          <p>President Trump's planned tariffs are increasing economic uncertainty, impacting consumer and investor sentiment.  Consumers fear higher inflation, while investors worry about lower profits and a struggling stock market.  The lack of detailed information about the tariff implementation plan is contributing to market volatility.  The overall impact on the U.S. economy remains uncertain, with potential for both short-term challenges and long-term restructuring.</p>

          <p>Senator Cory Booker delivered a lengthy speech on the Senate floor as a form of political protest against the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.  The speech, exceeding 18 hours, isn't a formal filibuster but a demonstration of resistance.  It reflects a broader sentiment within the Democratic Party base calling for stronger opposition to Trump's agenda.  The long-term impact of this political theater remains to be seen.</p>

          <p>Cybersecurity stocks have outperformed broader software stocks in 2025, due to the essential nature of their services in an increasingly threat-filled digital landscape.  While the broader software sector has struggled, cybersecurity ETFs have shown relative resilience.  Analysts attribute this to the "mission criticality" of cybersecurity spending for businesses, making it less susceptible to economic downturns.  However, macroeconomic factors and potential federal spending cuts remain considerations. <br><i>(not investment advice)</i></p>
