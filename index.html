          <p>Protests erupted in downtown Los Angeles over federal immigration enforcement operations, leading to clashes between demonstrators and authorities. The LAPD chief described the protests as increasingly violent, with demonstrators halting traffic on the 101 Freeway. President Trump deployed the California National Guard in response, citing "lawlessness," while Governor Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory and requested the deployment be rescinded. The situation escalated as authorities deemed the gathering an unlawful assembly, highlighting the deep divisions over immigration policy. Optimism is low given the civil unrest.</p>

The ban also imposes heightened travel restrictions on citizens of Venezuela. Critics argue the ban disproportionately affects non-white countries and is rooted in "bigotry."</p>

          <p>President Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom are in disagreement over the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles amid ongoing riots. The dispute centers on interpretations of the Posse Comitatus Act, which governs the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. Trump deployed the National Guard after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were reportedly attacked. Newsom has requested the troops be returned to his command, citing a breach of state sovereignty. The disagreement highlights the political tensions surrounding immigration and law enforcement. The events themselves are low optimism.</p>
