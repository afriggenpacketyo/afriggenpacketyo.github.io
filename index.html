          <p>President Trump declared his intention to restore Columbus Day, criticizing Democrats for allegedly attempting to diminish Christopher Columbus's legacy. He stated he would reinstate the holiday under the same rules as before, opposing the recognition of Indigenous Peoples' Day alongside Columbus Day, a practice initiated by his predecessor. Trump has long objected to reframing American history through a lens of diversity and oppression. The holiday was initially established to honor Italian immigrants and was designated a national holiday by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1934.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has been accused of removing a two-year-old U.S. citizen to Honduras with her deported mother, prompting a federal judge to express concerns about the lack of due process. In a separate case, a Cuban-born woman, mother to a one-year-old with seizures and wife to a U.S. citizen, was deported to Cuba, separating her from her family. Critics argue that these actions violate ICE's own directives regarding the care of minor children during deportations. The administration's aggressive crackdown on immigration has led to court battles and raised concerns about due process and constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, believes the US-China trade war is far from over. He argues that the Trump administration views the international trading system as unfair to the US, leading to the implementation of tariffs as leverage for change. The administration aims to negotiate reciprocal tariffs with individual countries, potentially leading to lower tariffs in the future. Kennedy emphasizes that the current situation is not necessarily the desired end state but a starting point for negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) reported that federal agents raided an underground nightclub in Colorado, detaining over 100 individuals identified as undocumented immigrants. The raid, which took place early Sunday morning in Colorado Springs, involved more than 200 people, including over a dozen active-duty members of the U.S. military. Agents found weapons and illicit drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, inside the nightclub, which had been under surveillance for months due to suspected drug trafficking, prostitution, and violent crimes.</p>

          <p>Israel launched an airstrike on Beirut's southern suburbs, targeting what it claimed was a Hezbollah store of "precision-guided missiles." The attack occurred despite a ceasefire that came into force five months ago, putting further pressure on the agreement. The Lebanese presidency condemned the strike and called on the US and France to press Israel to cease its attacks. UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon urged all sides to halt actions that could undermine the cessation of hostilities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's approval ratings are falling as he approaches 100 days in office, with a majority of Americans disapproving of his handling of the presidency. Polls show his approval rating is the lowest for any newly elected president at the 100-day mark in more than seven decades. The latest approval ratings represent a change from when Trump returned to the White House in January, during which he saw an uptick in his favorability ratings.</p>

          <h2>Danish Slave Ships Wreckage Found Off Coast of Costa Rica</h2>

          <p>Two 18th-century shipwrecks off the coast of Costa Rica, previously thought to be pirate ships, have been confirmed to be Danish slave ships. Marine archaeologists identified the ships as Fridericus Quartus and Christianus Quintus, which were wrecked in 1710. The ships were part of Denmark's transatlantic slave trade, which the country banned in 1792, although slavery was not fully abolished until 1847. Underwater excavations and analyses of ship timbers and cargo confirmed the ships' identities.</p>
