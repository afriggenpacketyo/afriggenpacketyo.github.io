          <p>A 31-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder following a stabbing incident at a business in Bermondsey, London. The attack resulted in the deaths of a 58-year-old man and a 27-year-old man, with a third man in his 30s left in critical condition. Police believe the victims were known to each other, and a local Member of Parliament described it as a targeted, isolated incident. The event has left the local community feeling terrified and uneasy.</p>

          <p>Jordan is requesting aircraft and logistical support from the United States for a three-week humanitarian airdrop operation into Gaza, but the Trump administration currently has no plans to assist. While European allies have pledged support, the State Department communication notes concerns about the inefficiency of airdrops and the risks involved. The administration is instead promoting its own aid mechanism, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), despite criticism from NGOs and a group of Democratic senators. Jordanian officials also reported significant delays by Israel in allowing aid trucks to enter Gaza by land.</p>

          <p>A Portland man, identified by his father as a "lifelong Quaker... deeply committed to pacifism," is facing federal charges for allegedly assaulting an officer during an anti-ICE protest. The suspect, Robert Jacob Hoopes, is accused of throwing a large rock that caused a significant laceration over an officer's eye. He and others also allegedly used a stop sign as a battering ram, causing major damage to the ICE facility. Despite prosecutors' requests, a judge granted Hoopes pretrial release.</p>

          <p>Christopher Kennedy, a 74-year-old dog trainer, was unexpectedly diagnosed with terminal idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis after a routine scan. With his lung function rapidly declining and medications proving ineffective, doctors gave him less than a year to live. Despite initial hesitation, he was approved for and successfully underwent a double-lung transplant, a procedure his own brother had not survived. Now recovering with 98% lung capacity, Kennedy is back to training therapy dogs and plans to get a new puppy named "Encore" to celebrate his second chance at life.</p>

          <p>Despite widespread concerns, significant price hikes from President Trump's tariffs have not yet materialized for American consumers due to several key factors. Companies anticipated the tariffs and stockpiled goods, while importers have delayed shipments amid uncertainty over the final tariff rates. Many businesses, including major automakers, are currently absorbing the increased costs as a hit to their profits rather than passing them on to shoppers. However, experts warn that these are temporary buffers, and price increases are still expected as stockpiles dwindle and storage costs rise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Danish pharmaceutical firm Novo Nordisk plummeted by as much as 26% after the company significantly cut its full-year sales and profit forecasts.

The company cited persistent competition from compounded versions of the drugs and a slower market expansion as primary reasons for the downgrade.

          <h2>Fragile Ceasefire Between Thailand and Cambodia Takes Hold After Deadly Border Clashes</h2>

          <p>A ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia appears to be largely holding after five days of border fighting that killed at least 35 people and displaced around 200,000. The truce was mediated by Malaysia, the current chair of ASEAN, with analysts suggesting that US President Donald Trump's threat to delay trade talks and impose tariffs also pressured both nations to de-escalate. Analysts note the conflict served political purposes for both countries' leaderships, potentially weakening the Thaksin dynasty in Thailand while strengthening the Hun family's rule in Cambodia. The lack of a third-party monitoring mechanism, however, raises concerns about the ceasefire's long-term durability.</p>

          <p>Mobile network operator EE is set to launch new SIM-only phone plans in the UK specifically designed for teenagers, featuring tiered levels of internet content filtering. The plans will offer different restrictions based on the user's age and include protections against scam calls. However, a significant limitation is that these filters only apply when using the mobile data network, not when connected to a Wi-Fi network. Despite this, EE, which is also offering in-store safety guidance for families, believes the plans are a positive step toward protecting young smartphone users from harmful content.</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group issued a 2025 earnings outlook that disappointed Wall Street, signaling that the health insurance industry continues to struggle with elevated medical costs. The company projected adjusted earnings significantly below analyst expectations, causing its stock to fall. The insurer's medical care ratio, which measures expenses relative to premiums, increased to 89.4%, driven by more seniors undergoing procedures they had delayed during the pandemic. This report from the nation's largest insurer suggests that financial pressures on the Medicare Advantage market may persist for the broader industry. (not investment advice)</p>

This has allegedly resulted in lost production, mandatory overtime, and safety concerns as fewer workers are forced to cover more tasks.

          <p>A former FBI assistant special agent in charge, Michael Feinberg, claims he was forced to resign due to his friendship with Peter Strzok, a former agent critical of President Trump. In an essay and interview, Feinberg, a self-described conservative, argues that the FBI is being transformed from an institution based on expertise into one that prizes political loyalty above all. He warns that the bureau's new leadership is pushing out experienced, apolitical agents and re-directing resources from complex counterintelligence to minor immigration offenses. This politicization, he contends, accustoms new agents to a corrupted culture and ultimately makes the country less safe.</p>

          <p>An analysis contends that the Trump administration has effectively defunded the police for higher education by laying off over 80% of the Department of Education's fraud-prevention and quality-assurance team. This unit was responsible for investigating and sanctioning predatory colleges that steal taxpayer money through federal student aid programs. The author argues that these cuts, made in the name of reducing bureaucracy, will have the opposite effect, leaving the $1.7 trillion federal student loan system vulnerable to widespread abuse. The move is described as part of a chaotic approach to governance that prioritizes political goals over protecting students and taxpayers.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's dependence on his far-right coalition partners has corrupted his decision-making and led directly to Gaza's humanitarian catastrophe. The author posits that to maintain power, Netanyahu has had to appease extremists like Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, who advocate for ending aid and displacing Palestinians. This political necessity resulted in a contradictory and failed aid strategy, oscillating between blockades and flawed new delivery systems, ultimately precipitating the current hunger crisis. The piece concludes that Netanyahu's choices have undermined Israel's war effort and its international standing.</p>

          <p>In an unusual move, Republicans are planning to redraw congressional maps in states they control, like Texas, well before the typical post-census cycle.

In response, Democrats like California Governor Gavin Newsom have threatened to retaliate with their own gerrymandering, raising concerns about a new norm of politically motivated, mid-decade redistricting.
