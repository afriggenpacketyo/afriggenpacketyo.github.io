          <p>The article analyzes winning acts from the Eurovision Song Contest since 2000 to determine the formula for success, highlighting that the best way to win Eurovision is to be spectacular, inspiring, and just weird enough. Key elements include singing about personal liberation, preferably in English, and incorporating folk music elements without fully committing to the genre. The article also suggests that dramatic key changes are now passé and that elaborate staging and pyrotechnics are beneficial, but novelty acts often struggle, and the article warns against burning a piano.

          <p>The UK economy experienced stronger-than-anticipated growth of 0.7% in the first three months of the year, driven primarily by the services sector, according to official figures. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed the figures as evidence of the UK's economic strength, analysts caution that this rate of growth is unlikely to persist due to upcoming US tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. Despite positive signs in business investment, skepticism remains regarding the sustainability of this growth, with some economists suggesting that this may be the peak for the year.

          <p>The article discusses the ethical implications of President Trump accepting a $400 million jet from the Qatari royal family, questioning whether this act helps Americans understand the extent to which he is leveraging the presidency for personal enrichment. Critics, including Republicans, have voiced concerns, highlighting the hypocrisy of a president who recently suggested Americans sacrifice for his tariffs. The article suggests this scandal could focus attention on how Trump is exploiting his position for self-gain, particularly through foreign investments and cryptocurrency ventures.

          <p>Three Māori MPs in New Zealand are facing suspension from parliament for performing a protest haka during a parliamentary session last year. The parliamentary committee ruled that the haka could have "intimidated" other lawmakers, recommending suspensions for the MPs. The Māori Party criticized the recommendations, viewing them as a warning against resistance to colonial powers. Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters condemned the trio's actions, and their proposed suspensions will be put to a vote. Optimism score is 50.</p>
