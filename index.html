            <p>China's Commerce Ministry is calling on the U.S. to completely abolish reciprocal tariffs, describing recent U.S. tariff exemptions as a "small step." The ministry urged the Trump administration to heed international and domestic voices advocating for dialogue and mutual respect in resolving trade differences. Chinese state media portrays the U.S. tariff exemptions as a sign of retreat by the Trump administration, underscoring the challenges faced by U.S. companies in replacing Chinese supply chains. Despite these exemptions, a 20% tariff on all Chinese products remains in effect. </p>

            <p>President Trump's tariff policies are causing significant disruptions to global supply chains, as companies scramble to adjust to higher costs and uncertainties. The decision to pause additional tariffs for most countries except China for 90 days has done little to calm the turmoil. Companies are considering rerouting products and seeking alternative sources, leading to increased shipping costs and potential port congestion. The long-term effects of the trade war are a major concern, with analysts predicting a slump in demand between the U.S. and China. </p>

            <p>Devastating attacks on camps hosting hundreds of thousands of displaced people in Sudan's Darfur region have continued for a third day, leaving dozens dead and conditions dire. The attacks, blamed on the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), have targeted the Zamzam and Abu Shouk camps, where many residents face famine-like conditions. The UN and US have condemned the attacks, and aid organizations report the deaths of humanitarian workers. The violence comes on the eve of the second anniversary of the civil war between the RSF and the army. </p>

            <p>The Federal Trade Commission's antitrust case against Meta has begun, examining whether the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp violated competition laws. The FTC argues that Meta used a "buy or bury" strategy to eliminate competition and maintain its monopoly power. The FTC seeks to force Meta to unwind its purchase of both apps. Meta counters that it is being punished for being an innovative company and that the acquisitions were approved by regulators years ago. </p>

            <p>The scandal surrounding Ireland's mother-and-baby homes, where thousands of unmarried women and their children were abused, continues as religious organizations refuse to contribute to a redress scheme. Only two of the eight religious orders linked to the homes have offered to contribute, highlighting a lack of remorse and accountability. The treatment of children born out of wedlock is a stain on the church's history, and campaigners are calling for church assets to be seized unless the institution contributes to the scheme. The scandal has prompted cultural and artistic responses aimed at remembering the victims. </p>
