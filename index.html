          <p>A U.S. Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet rolled off the deck of the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier and sank into the Red Sea. The incident occurred while the jet was being towed in the hangar bay, and the crew lost control of the aircraft and tow tractor. Both personnel involved were able to evacuate, with one sustaining a minor injury. The USS Harry S. Truman has been operating in the Red Sea since last September, supporting efforts to protect commercial ships from Houthi rebel attacks. An investigation is underway to determine the cause of the mishap, and initial reports suggest the carrier's movement due to Houthi fire might have been a factor.</p>

          <p>Detroit Opera is staging a production of “The Central Park Five,” an opera about the Black and Latino boys wrongly convicted of sexually assaulting a Central Park jogger.

          <p>The head of Israel’s domestic intelligence service, Shin Bet, announced his resignation, seemingly ending a public and bitter clash with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The clash began when Netanyahu fired Ronen Bar, the head of Shin Bet, in mid-March as Shin Bet investigators were scrutinizing Netanyahu’s aides for potential impropriety in their dealings with the Gulf state of Qatar. Critics of Netanyahu saw Bar’s firing as an attempt to consolidate control over the agency or even muzzle the investigation into his advisers.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second presidency has brought rapid and significant changes to the U.S., dividing the country and raising concerns about stability. Trump has acted on promises to end the war in Ukraine and reform immigration policy, but has faced criticism for his approach to international relations and trade. His administration has introduced and then withdrawn policies, leading to uncertainty and instability in government. Some experts suggest the administration's actions have undermined the separation of powers and restricted freedom of the press.</p>
