          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972 but failing to reach Venus due to a rocket malfunction, made an uncontrolled reentry to Earth on Saturday after 53 years in orbit. Experts had predicted that parts of the half-ton spacecraft, built to withstand Venus's harsh conditions, might survive reentry. While the exact location of impact and the extent of debris survival remain unknown, scientists stated that the chances of anyone being hit by debris were exceedingly low. The U.S. Space Command is analyzing data to confirm the spacecraft's demise, as Kosmos 482 garnered attention due to its potential to survive reentry.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's sweeping government overhaul, siding with unions and non-profits who argued that Congress did not authorize large-scale staffing cuts. Judge Susan Illston issued a 14-day restraining order against the mass layoffs, known as ‚Äúreductions in force,‚Äù asserting that the president requires congressional approval for broad agency restructuring. The ruling follows dozens of lawsuits challenging the administration's ‚Äúdepartment of government efficiency‚Äù (Doge), with plaintiffs presenting evidence of widespread terminations disrupting critical services across various agencies. A hearing is scheduled for May 22 to consider a longer-lasting preliminary injunction.</p>

          <p>The sisters of Michael Barnard, who died from carbon monoxide poisoning in his car due to a leaking exhaust, are campaigning to make carbon monoxide detectors a legal requirement in UK vehicles. Lucy and Rebecca Barnard are raising awareness of the "silent killer," which claims about 60 lives annually in the UK. They have started a petition, gathering over 500 signatures, to alert people to the dangers of the odorless and colorless gas. Currently, UK cars are not legally required to have carbon monoxide detectors, and the sisters hope to change this to prevent future tragedies.</p>

Tensions had risen after an attack on Hindu tourists in Kashmir, leading to cross-border fire and strikes, but both countries have now committed to de-escalation.</p>

However, economists caution that waiting for labor market confirmation could mean acting too late, as tariffs and other factors create uncertainty.

          <p>A Chicago homeowner, Marco Velazquez, discovered squatters living in his property and, instead of leaving, decided to stay overnight with friends and his wife. The squatters, Shermaine Powell-Gillard and her boyfriend, claimed they had purchased the property, but no mortgage was on record. After police said they couldn‚Äôt intervene without a court order, Velazquez negotiated a cash-for-keys deal, paying the couple $4,300 to leave, fearing a prolonged legal battle. Powell-Gillard has been accused of similar actions in other properties, raising questions about squatter's rights and law enforcement's ability to act in such situations.</p>

          <p>The article details how recent efforts to control silicosis, a deadly lung disease caused by inhaling silica dust, have been undermined by the Trump administration. Elon Musk's DOGE fired the team in charge of medical testing and counseling to miners with the disease, and the White House is scrapping NIOSH's functions. Additionally, the Department of Labor has paused enforcement of a strengthened silica standard, citing a lack of staff to certify necessary equipment. These actions threaten to reverse progress in preventing silicosis, particularly in mining and artificial-stone countertop industries.</p>

          <p>Researchers have found an 80,000-year-old spear tip carved from bone in Russia, indicating it was made by Neanderthals, not modern humans. The discovery suggests that Neanderthals developed advanced bone-working techniques independently of Homo sapiens. The spear tip, found in Mezmaiskaya Cave, joins other recent finds demonstrating Neanderthals' ability to craft sophisticated tools. Analysis of the spear tip revealed cracks suggesting it was used successfully, marking a significant advancement in understanding Neanderthal technology.</p>

          <p>The article argues that the rise of part-time work has created a new form of exploitation for low-wage American workers, as employers circumvent labor laws by offering too few hours rather than too many. The shift to part-time labor allows companies to avoid paying benefits and utilize just-in-time scheduling, leaving workers with unstable incomes and difficulty accessing social safety nets. It proposes potential solutions such as requiring employers to set schedules in advance and allowing workers to choose between part-time and full-time employment, but emphasizes the need for political action to address the issue.</p>
