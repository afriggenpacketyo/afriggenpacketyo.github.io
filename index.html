          <p>A study published in Nature Communications has found that multinational enterprises were responsible for 25% of all corporate carbon emissions in China over a 20-year period. The research indicates that while China's eastern coastal regions gained significant economic benefits from foreign investment, the central and western inland areas disproportionately bore the environmental pressures. The findings raise new questions about assessing carbon emission responsibilities for foreign-owned firms operating globally.</p>

          <p>Switzerland is facing a severe economic and psychological shock after the Trump administration announced unexpected 39% tariffs on Swiss exports. The U.S. is Switzerland's most important export market, and industry groups warn the tariffs could effectively annihilate sales. This aggressive trade move has shattered the country's long-held sense of being in "splendid isolation" from global political turmoil, provoking a national identity crisis and leaving its government scrambling for a response.</p>

The meeting was announced after a deadline set by Trump for Russia to agree to a ceasefire passed without a resolution.

          <p>Following an order from President Donald Trump, National Guard troops have been deployed on the streets of Washington D.C., with the administration citing the need to combat violent crime. The deployment involves 800 troops and 500 federal agents, and comes after Trump took temporary control of the city's police force. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has strongly criticized the move, labeling it an "authoritarian push" and denying that crime in the city is out of control.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has formally acknowledged his country's use of "repressive violence" in Cameroon during its struggle for independence in the 1950s. In a letter to his Cameroonian counterpart, Macron accepted France's role and responsibility in events that led to tens of thousands of deaths. This admission is part of a broader push by Macron for France to confront its colonial history, even as its legacy in Africa faces growing scrutiny.</p>

          <h2>Health Officials Warn of Rising 'Flesh-Eating' Bacteria Risk as Oceans Warm</h2>

          <p>The risk of infection from Vibrio vulnificus, a so-called "flesh-eating" bacteria, is increasing as ocean temperatures rise due to climate change. The bacteria thrives in warm coastal waters and can be fatal, with one in five infected people dying. Health officials are now seeing cases appear further north than previously common, in states like Connecticut and New York, and warn that the danger is particularly acute during hurricane season due to potential exposure through floodwaters.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market surged, with major indexes approaching record highs, after new data showed that inflation was slightly better than economists had anticipated. The report indicated that consumer prices in July rose 2.7% from the previous year, reinforcing hopes that the Federal Reserve will have the leeway to cut interest rates at its next meeting. As a result, traders on Wall Street significantly increased their bets on a September rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Warmer Winters Lead to Significant Decline in California Peach Harvests</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Peach farmers in California's Central Valley are facing a difficult season, with harvests down by as much as 30% for some growers. The decline is being attributed to warmer-than-usual winter weather, which disrupted the essential cold-weather "sleep" cycle that peach trees require to produce a full crop. This climate change-driven phenomenon is not only threatening farmers' livelihoods but is also leading to higher prices for consumers across the country.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has threatened to take immediate legal action against Apple, accusing the company of antitrust violations related to its App Store rankings. Musk alleges that Apple is unfairly favoring OpenAI's ChatGPT, making it impossible for other AI companies, such as his own xAI with its Grok app, to achieve top rankings. This threat escalates the intense competition and legal maneuvering among tech giants in the rapidly growing artificial intelligence sector.</p>
