          <p>As Canada heads to the polls on April 28th, the political landscape is shaped by key figures from various parties. Liberal leader Mark Carney, recently appointed after Justin Trudeau's resignation, brings financial expertise to the forefront, while Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre champions a low-tax, small government approach. Yves-François Blanchet leads the Bloc Québécois, advocating for Quebec's interests, and Jagmeet Singh heads the New Democratic Party. The election is anticipated to be closely contested, with the economy and Canada-US relations playing significant roles in voter decisions.</p>

          <p>Despite a ceasefire agreement following a devastating earthquake in Myanmar, the ruling junta has repeatedly violated the truce, according to a BBC report from rebel-held territory. The report details daily attacks by the junta, resulting in civilian casualties and displacement, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian crisis caused by the earthquake and ongoing civil war. The UN has called for an end to the military operations, but the junta has not commented on the alleged violations.

          <p>Tyler Glasnow, a pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers, exited Sunday's game against the Pittsburgh Pirates in the second inning due to discomfort in his right shoulder. This injury comes after Glasnow missed the end of the previous season with an elbow sprain and recently experienced leg cramps during a start against the Texas Rangers. The severity of this new injury is currently unknown, but it is concerning given Glasnow's history of Tommy John surgery and the fact that fellow pitcher Blake Snell is already on the injured list with shoulder inflammation.</p>

The Chargers' general manager, Joe Hortiz, expressed confidence in the existing roster and the competition for positions, but left the door open for further offseason transactions. The team aims to build on their Wild Card finish from last season under coach Jim Harbaugh.</p>
