          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 11:00:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iran's semi-official Fars news agency has reported that President Masoud Pezeshkian sustained a minor leg injury during an Israeli airstrike last month. The alleged attack on June 16 targeted a secure government facility in Western Tehran, where the president was meeting with senior officials. Reports indicate six bombs or missiles hit entry and exit points, disrupting air flow and power, forcing officials to escape through an emergency hatch. This incident, which Iran likens to an Israeli plan that led to a Hezbollah leader's assassination, took place during the recent 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran, which concluded with a U.S.-brokered cease-fire.</p>

          <p>This article highlights 16 abandoned locations worldwide that have been repurposed into popular tourist attractions, offering a unique glimpse into the past. Examples include England's Maunsell Sea Forts, Australia's SS Ayrfield Shipwreck with mangroves growing through it, and Italy's Poveglia island, known for its history as a quarantine station and mental hospital. Other notable sites feature Denmark's relocated Rubjerg Knude Lighthouse, China's 'Paris of the East' replica city Tianducheng, and Namibia's diamond-mining ghost town Kolmanskop. These diverse locations demonstrate how historical neglect can evolve into fascinating cultural and natural experiences for visitors.</p>

          <h2>Genetic Genealogy Revolutionizes Cold Case Investigations, Unmasking Serial Criminals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 10:45:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Barbara Rae-Venter, a retired patent attorney with a biology Ph.D., has pioneered investigative genetic genealogy, a technique that leverages public DNA databases to construct family trees and identify elusive criminals. Her groundbreaking work famously led to the capture of the Golden State Killer, Joseph James DeAngelo, after more than three decades. Rae-Venter's Firebird Forensics group has since assisted law enforcement nationwide in solving approximately 60 cold cases, including the identification of a sexual assault perpetrator from 1997. While proving invaluable for justice, this powerful forensic tool also sparks ongoing debates and concerns regarding individual privacy and the extensive use of genetic data by authorities.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service has significantly bolstered its security protocols and technology. The agency has deployed a new fleet of military-grade drones for aerial reconnaissance, aiming to detect and mitigate unauthorized unmanned aircraft systems, a critical failure point in the Butler incident. Additionally, mobile command posts, costing up to $1.5 million each, have been established to facilitate direct radio communication between Secret Service agents and local law enforcement, addressing a key communication breakdown identified in the prior event. These reforms aim to prevent a recurrence of the July 13, 2024, tragedy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Senate report has revealed that the U.S. Secret Service denied or left unfulfilled at least ten requests for additional security resources for President Trump's 2024 campaign, prior to the July 13, 2024, assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. These critical requests included enhanced counter-drone systems, counter-assault team personnel, and counter-snipers, according to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. The report criticizes former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle for allegedly false testimony and highlights a "disturbing pattern of communication failures and negligence," including the absence of a formal process for resource requests. While six personnel have been suspended following an internal investigation, the report points out that some key individuals responsible for communication breakdowns were not among those disciplined.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has called for the European Union to "defend European interests resolutely" in response to Donald Trump's threat of imposing 30% tariffs on nearly all EU imports. While the EU has paused retaliatory tariffs to de-escalate tensions and seeks a pragmatic solution, Macron insists on preparing credible countermeasures, including anti-coercion instruments, should no agreement be reached by August 1. This comes as the EU strengthens trade ties with other partners like Indonesia and faces internal divisions on how to respond to the potential transatlantic trade conflict, which many view as a dangerous game amid global instability.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old inmate successfully escaped from Lyon-Corbas prison in southeast France by concealing himself in his cellmate's laundry bag during the latter's release. The French prison service has initiated an internal investigation into this highly unusual incident, which its director described as an "accumulation of errors" and "a series of serious malfunctions." The escaped prisoner was serving multiple sentences and faced additional investigation in a case linked to organized crime. This security breach underscores broader concerns about overcrowding at the Lyon-Corbas prison, which reportedly housed approximately 1,200 inmates against a capacity of 678 at the time of the escape.</p>

          <p>The UK government, through Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander, has pledged to make electric vehicles (EVs) more affordable for consumers, with announcements expected soon. While Alexander did not confirm specific taxpayer-funded grants, she pointed to existing investments, including a £25 million package for "cross-pavement gullies" to aid charging for homes without driveways, and £63 million for broader charging infrastructure. The initiative aims to boost EV sales, which currently lag behind mandated targets, by addressing the high upfront cost and "range anxiety" that deter many potential buyers. This move is critical as the UK approaches its 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales.</p>

          <p>Congressman Don Bacon, a moderate Republican from Nebraska, has announced his decision not to seek re-election in 2026, citing exhaustion from the increasingly polarized political climate and threats.

His departure underscores a broader trend of traditional Reagan conservatives opting out of Congress due to the Republican party's current direction. Bacon expressed a desire to "fight for the soul of the party" from outside electoral politics, hoping for a return to greater normalcy in American political discourse.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has dropped charges against Michael Kirk Moore, a Utah doctor accused of destroying over $28,000 worth of government-provided Covid-19 vaccines and administering saline shots to children instead of the actual vaccine. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the dismissal, asserting that Moore "gave his patients a choice when the federal government refused to do so" and did not deserve the potential prison sentence. Moore had allegedly distributed nearly 2,000 fraudulent vaccination record cards in exchange for payment or required donations to a specific charity. This decision reflects the new administration's more skeptical stance on Covid-19 measures and vaccine safety, following similar actions like the cancellation of a bird flu vaccine award.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies five small, intentional daily habits that significantly contribute to stronger, happier relationships, particularly amidst demanding weekdays. These practices include establishing a "mini morning routine" for shared connection, sending thoughtful check-ins during the day to remind partners they are top of mind, and taking individual time to de-stress and recharge after the workday. Crucially, the happiest couples intentionally carve out a dedicated "us time" each evening, free from distractions and multitasking, and conclude the day with a quiet check-in to ensure emotional alignment and prevent minor issues from escalating. These consistent, small efforts foster deeper intimacy and connection without demanding extensive time commitments.</p>

          <p>This article explores Pamela Anderson's enduring cultural relevance and resilience, highlighting her journey from a Playboy model and "Baywatch" star to a respected actress and activist. It delves into her experience as a victim of a leaked intimate video in the 1990s, a violation that pre-dated widespread internet shaming and profoundly impacted her. The article emphasizes Anderson's strength, vulnerability, and her continued ability to command attention, as seen in her recent Golden Globe nomination for "The Last Showgirl" and her decision to embrace a makeup-free look. Her activism, particularly against the Canadian seal hunt, and her unique interactions with global figures like Vladimir Putin, further illustrate her multifaceted persona.</p>

          <p>A funeral was held in the Israel-occupied West Bank for Saifullah Kamel Musallet, a 20-year-old Palestinian-American, and his friend Mohammed al-Shalabi, both killed in a confrontation with Israeli settlers. Musallet's family, from Tampa, Florida, states he was protecting family land when killed and demands a U.S. investigation into the incident, which Israel's military says involved Palestinians hurling rocks. This tragedy underscores rising violence in the West Bank and settler efforts to occupy land. Meanwhile, indirect talks for a 60-day Gaza ceasefire remain stalled, with Israel and Hamas at an impasse over troop deployment and conditions for ending the 21-month war.</p>

          <p>A high-resolution sonar survey of Wisconsin's Fox River unexpectedly led to the accidental discovery of an 1880 shipwreck, believed to be the wooden paddle wheel steamer L.W. Crane. Researchers from the Wisconsin Historical Society's Maritime Preservation Program and the Wisconsin Underwater Archaeology Association were initially mapping known cultural sites when they found the partially buried 90-foot hull. The L.W. Crane, built in 1865 for passenger and freight transport, caught fire and sank in Oshkosh in 1880, directly across from where its remains were found. This exciting discovery adds to the significant amount of debris, including large trees and bridge remnants, found in the surveyed river stretch, with further investigations into other wrecks ongoing.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a groundbreaking biotransformation system capable of converting the alcohol methanol into white sugar, offering a novel approach to addressing global environmental and population challenges. This innovative method, detailed in the peer-reviewed journal Science Bulletin, demonstrates how captured carbon dioxide can be transformed into food and chemicals, significantly contributing to carbon neutrality. The team successfully adapted their enzyme-based process to produce sucrose and other complex carbohydrates, including fructose and starch, without the need for resource-intensive crops like sugar cane or sugar beets. This represents a significant scientific advancement in generating long-chain carbohydrates directly from low-carbon molecules.</p>

          <p>The medical community is increasingly acknowledging and actively addressing the significant pain many patients experience during IUD insertions, a long-standing issue often minimized in women's healthcare. While IUDs offer highly effective and convenient long-term birth control, patient accounts of severe discomfort during placement have gained widespread prominence, particularly through social media. In response, both the CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have recently issued recommendations urging doctors to proactively discuss comprehensive pain management options with patients beforehand. These options include topical creams, anesthetic shots, and pre-appointment medications, signaling a crucial shift towards more patient-centered care and improved procedural comfort for this popular contraceptive method.</p>
