          <p>Cartier owner Richemont reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter sales, driven by strong performance in its Jewellery Maisons division. The company's revenues increased by 7% year-on-year, surpassing analyst forecasts, although sales in the specialist watchmakers segment declined due to weakness in the Asia-Pacific region. Richemont's chairman acknowledged ongoing global uncertainties but highlighted the company's agility and discipline in navigating the challenges. BofA Global Research noted that Richemont faces headwinds from gold prices, U.S. tariffs, and foreign exchange fluctuations, but the company's pricing power could help offset these challenges. </p>

          <p>TikTok is launching in-app guided meditation exercises and well-being features aimed at young users, in response to lawsuits and criticism regarding the app's impact on mental health. The meditation feature, designed to improve sleep quality, will be triggered during "sleep hours" and enabled by default for users under 18, with reminders appearing after 10 p.m. This initiative comes amid increasing public pressure and lawsuits alleging that TikTok is intentionally addictive and psychologically damaging to children, leading to issues such as depression and anxiety.

          <p>Poland's coalition government, led by Donald Tusk, is facing challenges as the presidential election approaches, with approval ratings declining due to President Andrzej Duda's obstruction of reform plans. The election outcome will determine whether Tusk's pro-European government can advance its agenda, which includes restoring the rule of law and liberalizing abortion legislation. Tusk is backing Rafal Trzaskowski, the mayor of Warsaw, while the opposition supports Karol Nawrocki. The election's result will significantly impact the government's ability to fulfill its promises and address discontent across the country.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy experienced a 0.7 percent annualized contraction in the January-March period, marking the first decline in a year due to sluggish domestic demand and increased import costs. Weak consumer spending, driven by inflation outpacing wage hikes, contributed to the downturn, while exports also fell for the first time in four quarters. Economists anticipate further slowing in the coming months, contingent on negotiations with the United States to mitigate the impact of tariffs.

          <p>MPs in England and Wales are debating an assisted dying bill, which has undergone major changes since its initial passage. The bill, which would allow terminally ill adults to choose to end their lives, has been subject to intense scrutiny and amendments, including removing the need for a High Court judge's approval. Instead, a panel of experts would oversee the process. The government has also quietly corrected its impact assessment on assisted dying, reducing its upper estimate for the number of assisted deaths in the first year. The debate is contentious, with strong opinions on both sides of the issue.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) nations are urgently seeking discussions with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to address concerns over U.S. tariffs.

Many countries, including South Korea and Japan, sent ministers to push for meetings with Greer.

          <p>Beijing is intensifying efforts to create a stronger domestic market to reduce vulnerability to external tariff shocks, even with a tentative ceasefire in the trade war with the United States. Premier Li Qiang stated that China would continue to anchor its development strategy in bolstering "domestic circulation." The confrontation with Washington has added urgency to boosting domestic demand and reducing reliance on overseas trade. One analyst noted that the government has realized China can no longer rely on exports as the dominant growth driver.</p>

          <p>An international team's genetic analysis has traced the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas, shedding light on the early genetic landscape of the Western Hemisphere. The study found that Native Americans are descendants of Asian populations, particularly from the West Beringian region. Early migrants to South America formed distinct groups that remained isolated due to environmental conditions. The findings could reveal new insights about disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations.</p>
