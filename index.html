          <p>A gunman attacked a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, during a Sunday service, killing at least one person and wounding nine others. The suspect, a 40-year-old male, drove a vehicle into the church, opened fire on the congregation, and set a fire before being shot and killed by police. The FBI has deployed agents to assist local authorities in investigating the motive for the attack, which President Trump described as targeted against Christians.</p>

          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, has urged the Labour party to engage in an honest debate about its strategy for competing with Reform UK, warning against underestimating the "peril" the party faces. Speaking at the Labour conference, Burnham criticized what he described as a "climate of fear" within the party and called for a stronger narrative to connect with voters. His comments come as Labour trails Reform in opinion polls and have been interpreted by some as a challenge to Sir Keir Starmer's leadership.</p>

          <p>Moldova held a high-stakes parliamentary election, with citizens choosing between a future oriented towards the European Union or closer ties with Russia. The vote is seen as critical for the nation's geopolitical direction, especially given its location between Ukraine and Romania. Pro-EU President Maia Sandu accused Russia of "massive interference" in the election, while her pro-Russian rival Igor Dodon claimed interference came from the West. The outcome is uncertain, with polls suggesting Sandu's ruling party could lose its majority.</p>

          <p>A former FBI agent has revealed how serial killer Scott Kimball operated as a confidential informant for years while simultaneously committing multiple murders. Kimball, sentenced to 70 years in prison, manipulated agents by providing "breadcrumbs" of information about his crimes, which he framed as a game to outsmart the bureau. He pleaded guilty to killing four people between 2003 and 2004 but later claimed responsibility for dozens more, calling himself "The Opportunity Killer" because he killed whenever he had the chance.</p>

          <p>Amir Amiri, an American citizen detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nine months, has been released and is returning to the United States. His release was facilitated by Qatari diplomats working with the U.S. Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs. Qatar, which represents U.S. interests in Afghanistan since the Taliban's 2021 takeover, began negotiating for Amiri's release in March. This marks another successful hostage negotiation, following the release of four other Americans from the country earlier this year.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated he is confident that a new deal approved by President Trump successfully separates TikTok's U.S. operations from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The agreement establishes a new joint-venture company, with ByteDance holding less than a 20% stake, to address national security concerns over data privacy and potential propaganda. Under the new structure, American investors like Oracle and Silver Lake will own over 80% of the entity, ensuring U.S. control over data security and the platform's algorithm.

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has publicly stated he is open to another summit with President Donald Trump, citing a positive personal bond from their previous meetings. However, Kim reiterated that North Korea's nuclear program is non-negotiable and that any talks are contingent on Washington abandoning its "obsession with denuclearization." The U.S. State Department has maintained its commitment to complete denuclearization, indicating that a significant gap remains between the two sides despite the rhetorical overtures.</p>

          <p>A recent wave of youth-led protests in Nepal, sparked by anger over corruption and inequality, has led to significant political upheaval, including the resignation of the prime minister. The demonstrations, fueled by social media, turned violent after the government shut down platforms, resulting in dozens of deaths. Now, young activists, part of Nepal's "Gen Z," are organizing to form a new political party ahead of the 2026 elections, aiming to replace the established political order with new leadership and a democratic overhaul.</p>

          <p>The UK government is guaranteeing a £1.5 billion loan for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to help the automaker and its supply chain manage the fallout from a major cyberattack. Production at JLR's UK plants has been halted for nearly a month, raising concerns about the viability of its suppliers. A local MP suggested that further government assistance might be necessary to protect the thousands of jobs at risk. The incident has also been described as a "wake-up call" for UK businesses to improve their cybersecurity defenses.</p>

          <p>The European Union's steel industry is facing increased uncertainty as the United States considers expanding its 50% tariffs to a growing list of "derivative" products containing steel. This ad hoc process could subject goods like windows, doors, and furniture to the punitive tariffs originally aimed at Chinese imports. Business leaders and politicians are concerned that this unpredictable expansion creates a turbulent trade environment, harming European manufacturers and undermining the stability of the EU-US trade relationship.

          <p>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has condemned Reform UK's proposal to scrap indefinite leave to remain for migrants as both "racist" and "immoral." Speaking at the Labour conference, Starmer argued that the policy would involve removing people who are lawfully living and working in the UK, which he said would "rip this country apart." He clarified that while he believes the policy is racist, he does not think Reform supporters are, suggesting they are instead frustrated with years of Conservative government failure.</p>

          <p>Amid skepticism about official government statistics, alternative data sources are providing a more complex view of inflation in the U.S. While the official Consumer Price Index (CPI) shows annualized inflation at 2.9%, indexes from sources like Truflation and Zillow suggest lower current rates. However, leading indicators from the Institute for Supply Management and the National Federation of Independent Businesses point to rising price pressures, suggesting that inflation could increase in the coming months, offering a different perspective from federal reports.
