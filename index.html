          <p>Following the fatal shooting of two Israeli Embassy staffers outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., concerns are mounting about the adequacy of security measures at the event. The article highlights the lack of on or off-duty MPD officers present, despite the presence of private security. Former Homeland Security official John Cohen emphasized the heightened threat level facing the Jewish community and faith-based institutions, urging enhanced security protocols. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended law enforcement's response while acknowledging the tragedy, and investigations are underway into online writings attributed to the suspect, who yelled, "Free, free Palestine," during his arrest. The article underscores the need for better intelligence and awareness of potential threats to prevent future violence. </p>

          <p>House Oversight Chairman James Comer is seeking interviews with former President Biden's White House physician and aides as part of an investigation into Biden's mental fitness and use of an autopen. Comer cites concerns about the accuracy and transparency of Biden's medical assessments, particularly in light of his recent cancer diagnosis and allegations of mental impairments detailed in a new book. The committee aims to assess whether administration officials were performing presidential duties for Biden and explore potential legislation regarding presidential fitness under the Twenty-Fifth Amendment. Comer warns of decisive action if obstruction continues, referencing Biden's previous rejection of similar requests. </p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from firing half of the Department of Education's workforce and transferring federal student loans to the Small Business Administration. Judge Myong Joun, a Biden appointee, deemed the administration's actions unlawful, stating they would effectively prevent the department from fulfilling its mandated functions. The judge refuted the administration's claim that the changes were merely a reorganization, citing evidence to the contrary. The ruling halts the administration's efforts to implement President Trump's executive order aimed at closing the Department of Education, a move celebrated by teachers' unions and advocacy groups. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has suggested that Federal Reserve board members have special protection against presidential firings, while allowing President Trump to remove two members of other federal agencies' boards. The ruling stated that the President may remove executive officers who exercise power on his behalf, but the decision also strongly implied that efforts to fire Federal Reserve board members would face resistance. Justice Kagan dissented, noting the ruling's exemption for the Federal Reserve and emphasizing the importance of independence for bipartisan administrative federal bodies. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell previously stated that the president does not have the power to fire him. </p>

          <p>Despite initial interest, President Trump's proposed 'gold card' visa, offering permanent residency to wealthy individuals investing at least $5 million in the U.S., has failed to lure wealthy Chinese investors. Candice Meng, a real estate developer, cited concerns about the U.S.-China trade war and high urban crime levels as reasons for her decision to forgo applying. This trend reflects a broader reluctance among China's wealthy, who were expected to be a primary source of demand, due to economic slowdown and safety concerns in the U.S. Wealthy Chinese investors make up roughly 70 percent of applicants for the existing EB-5 visa. </p>

          <p>President Trump's recent tour to the Middle East, including stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, has resulted in significant policy announcements that could reshape regional geopolitics. Trump stated he would lift sanctions on Syria and claimed the US was close to securing a deal with Iran over its nuclear weapons program. These announcements have surprised many, considering Trump's previous withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018. The article suggests these moves indicate a renewed focus on US power in the Middle East, with implications for major powers like China. </p>

Justices Sotomayor, Kagan and Jackson dissented from the court's decision.

The legislation, if signed into law, would increase contribution limits for individuals and families, offering a financial tool for healthcare costs. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced an investigation into the admissions system at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Fairfax County, Virginia, alleging discrimination against Asian American students. The investigation is based on Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prevents discrimination based on race, color, or national origin. The school's admissions process was overhauled in 2020 to diversify the student body, leading to a decrease in the percentage of Asian students. The administration argues that students should be evaluated on merit, not race, while critics claim the investigation is an overreach. </p>
