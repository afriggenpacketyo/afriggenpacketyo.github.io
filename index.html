          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration from deploying any National Guard units to Portland, Oregon. The ruling came after California Governor Gavin Newsom sued the president over the plan to send his state's troops, arguing the move was an authoritarian attack on the rule of law. The judge found no evidence that recent protests, which have been described as "sedate," necessitated a military presence. This decision temporarily halts the administration's controversial use of federal forces in cities experiencing protests.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla is intensifying in the Pacific Ocean off the southwestern coast of Mexico, with forecasters expecting it to reach Category 2 strength. The National Hurricane Center has issued a tropical storm watch for a portion of the coastline, warning of heavy rains and gusty winds. While the storm's center is predicted to move parallel to the coast without making direct landfall, its outer bands are still expected to bring up to six inches of rain in some areas. This poses a significant risk of flash flooding, particularly in higher terrain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has unveiled a plan to reform the home-buying system in England and Wales, aiming to reduce costs, delays, and failed sales. The proposals would legally require sellers to provide key property information upfront and introduce the option of binding contracts to prevent last-minute withdrawals. While the government estimates this could save first-time buyers hundreds of pounds and shorten transaction times, critics worry it could create initial delays for sellers. The plan draws inspiration from the Scottish system, which already features more upfront transparency and earlier binding agreements.</p>

          <p>An in-depth analysis examines the growing influence of commentator Bari Weiss, whose anti-"woke" publication, The Free Press, is reportedly being acquired by Paramount for $150 million. As part of the deal, Weiss is slated for a high-level editorial role at CBS News, signaling a potential seismic shift in mainstream media. The article explores the core tenets of her publication's worldview, which include opposition to progressive orthodoxy, skepticism of "experts," and strong support for Israel. This move is seen as a major victory for the center-right faction she has cultivated, potentially reshaping a legacy news network.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to Shimon Sakaguchi, Mary Brunkow, and Fred Ramsdell for their foundational discoveries about the immune system. Their research identified regulatory T-cells, which act as "security guards" that prevent the immune system from attacking the body's own tissues. This breakthrough explains how the body maintains tolerance and avoids autoimmune diseases, where this process fails. Their work has opened new avenues for developing treatments for conditions like cancer, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis, and could improve organ transplant success.</p>

          <p>Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman, a Democrat and vocal supporter of Israel, has publicly called on pro-Palestinian protestors to shift their focus toward pressuring Hamas to accept a ceasefire deal. Fetterman has been using social media to highlight what he sees as a lack of activist pressure on Hamas to agree to the terms proposed by the Trump administration. He argues that the war in Gaza must end for the security of both Israelis and Palestinians and has criticized elements within his own party for what he terms an "escalating betrayal of Israel."</p>

          <p>The South African populist group "Operation Dudula" is escalating its anti-immigration activities, recently calling for migrant children to be excluded from public schools. Founded as a vigilante movement, the group blames foreigners for crime, unemployment, and strained public services, despite data suggesting otherwise. Critics and researchers argue that the group's narrative is a dangerous distraction from government failures and rooted in xenophobia leftover from the Apartheid era. The group's aggressive tactics, including blocking hospital access and conducting ID checks, have drawn condemnation, particularly after a sick child died following being denied healthcare access.</p>

The first group of five men sent to Eswatini were reportedly held in a maximum-security prison.

          <p>French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu has resigned after less than a month in office, plunging the country into a severe political crisis. His resignation, accepted by President Emmanuel Macron, occurred less than 24 hours after he named his new government. The cabinet appointments drew immediate and widespread criticism from across the political spectrum, with opponents arguing the lineup failed to represent a break from the past. The move has prompted calls from both the far-right and far-left for Macron to call snap elections or resign himself, highlighting the profound instability in French politics.</p>

          <p>Indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas are set to begin in Egypt, fueling cautious optimism for an end to the war in Gaza and the release of remaining hostages. The talks will focus on a 20-point plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, which Hamas has partially agreed to. The proposal includes the release of all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and transferring control of Gaza to an international body. While the start of talks is a positive sign, experts remain cautious, with one former ambassador giving the broader plan only a 10% chance of full implementation.</p>

Lecornu failed to unite a divided parliament to address France's significant debt and budget deficit, which far exceed EU rules.

          <p>A contributor argues that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency is recklessly lowering its hiring standards in a rush to expand its workforce. The agency now allows recruits as young as 18, has shortened training time, and does not require a high school diploma or law enforcement experience. The author expresses alarm that inexperienced agents, attracted by controversial and nationalistic recruitment slogans, will be making life-altering decisions without adequate judgment or training. The article draws parallels to a similar rapid expansion of the Border Patrol between 2006 and 2009, which led to increased corruption and misconduct.</p>

Church, who previously won damages after her phone was hacked by the News Of The World, stated there was "all sorts of dark stuff going on."

          <p>An opinion piece expresses dismay over the U.S. Supreme Court's conservative supermajority repeatedly ruling in favor of the Trump administration, drawing parallels to courts in authoritarian states like Hungary and Turkey. The author argues the justices have failed to act as a check on a president with authoritarian tendencies, ceding huge power to the executive branch. The article explores potential reasons for the court's actions, including ideological agreement, fear of a direct confrontation with the president, and a miscalculation about the strength of U.S. democratic institutions. This pattern of "appeasement," the author warns, is dangerous when dealing with an authoritarian executive.</p>

          <p>A discussion with Stanford psychology professor Jamil Zaki explores the dual nature of empathy, acknowledging that while it is fundamental to human connection, it can also be overwhelming and lead to burnout. Zaki breaks empathy into three components: emotional, cognitive, and compassionate concern. He argues that empathy is not a fixed trait but a skill that can be developed like a muscle through conscious practice, such as developing humility and shifting conversations from scoring points to learning. The key to avoiding the negative aspects of empathy, he suggests, is to turn feelings of connection into positive action, which benefits both the giver and receiver.</p>

The review praises the novel as a smart and entertaining ride that explores the wealthy's obsession with using technology to achieve longevity, even at a great moral cost.

The company is calling on the UK government to provide more proactive support to protect the interests of small-volume manufacturers from the impact of international trade disputes.</p>

          <p>Australian prosecutors are appealing the sentence of Erin Patterson, who was convicted of murdering three relatives and attempting to murder a fourth by serving them poisonous death cap mushrooms. Patterson received a life sentence but will be eligible for parole after 33 years. The Office of Public Prosecutions argues this sentence is "manifestly inadequate" and is seeking a longer non-parole period, having originally argued she should never be released. The case, in which Patterson served her estranged husband's family members a laced beef Wellington dish, has captivated the public, though her motive remains unclear.</p>

          <p>At their party conference, the UK's Conservative party has proposed a "first-job bonus" for young people, offering a £5,000 tax rebate toward their first home. The plan would work by diverting an individual's National Insurance payments into a long-term savings account upon them starting their first full-time job. Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride stated the policy would be funded by £47 billion in public spending cuts over five years. These proposed cuts would target areas such as the welfare bill, the civil service workforce, and the foreign aid budget, signaling the party's focus on fiscal restraint.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government shutdown continues for a sixth day, with the Senate scheduled to vote on competing measures to reopen it.

If that fails, the Senate is expected to vote on a Republican-supported 7-week stopgap funding bill that has already passed the House. Both parties continue to blame each other for the impasse, with leaders trading accusations over who is responsible for the disruption of government services and the failure to reach a compromise.</p>

          <p>Nearly 30 million Apple and Samsung smartphone owners in the UK could be eligible for a payout of around £17 each if a lawsuit against chipmaker Qualcomm is successful. The consumer group Which? has taken Qualcomm to the Competition Appeal Tribunal, accusing the tech giant of anti-competitive practices. The lawsuit alleges that Qualcomm abused its market dominance to inflate prices for essential components, which in turn increased the cost of smartphones for consumers. Qualcomm has denied the claims, stating the case has "no basis," but faces a five-week trial to determine the outcome.</p>

          <p>The National Institutes of Health has awarded millions in grants for autism research, including $5.1 million to Cornell University, as part of a new $50 million initiative. This funding comes as the Trump administration has shown a controversial interest in the disorder, with officials promoting debunked theories about its causes and proposing a national database of individuals with autism. While some experts are wary of the administration's influence, they are also relieved that the newly funded projects are taking a sophisticated, scientific approach. The research aims to better understand treatment outcomes and replicate previous scientific findings about the complex condition.</p>

This follows a period where the court's 6-3 conservative majority has granted an unprecedented number of the administration's requests on its "emergency docket," blocking lower court rulings.

          <p>A new study reinforces that females tend to outlive males across numerous mammal species, including humans, where the gap is nearly six years in the U.S. Researchers point to a combination of factors, including genetics, where females' two X chromosomes may offer a protective backup against harmful mutations. Behavior also plays a key role, as males across species often engage in riskier habits related to mating and competition. In humans, men have historically been more likely to smoke and drink, and are less likely to seek preventive medical care or use sunscreen, contributing to higher mortality rates from preventable diseases.</p>

          <p>Former employees from civil rights oversight offices at the Department of Homeland Security are warning that recent staff cuts will lead to increased violations in ICE detention centers. The Trump administration eliminated hundreds of positions in these congressionally mandated offices, which were tasked with investigating complaints and ensuring compliance with civil rights laws. With these internal watchdogs gone, former staff and immigration advocates worry there is no one to address issues like medical neglect or abuse, especially as ICE's detention capacity is rapidly expanding. The laid-off employees are now part of a lawsuit challenging their terminations.</p>
