          <p>The U.S. military conducted its seventh strike since last month on a vessel suspected of drug trafficking, killing three people. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the strike targeted a boat linked to the Colombian guerrilla group ELN in international waters. The Trump administration has framed these actions as part of a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels, treating them as terrorist organizations. However, the strikes have drawn criticism from some lawmakers who question the legal justification and lack of evidence presented by the administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced an end to U.S. aid and subsidies to Colombia, labeling the country's president, Gustavo Petro, an "illegal drug leader." The decision follows Petro's criticism of U.S. military strikes on alleged drug boats, one of which he claimed was a fishing vessel, resulting in a fisherman's death. This move marks a significant escalation in diplomatic tensions between the two traditional allies. Trump warned that if Colombia does not shut down its "killing fields," the United States will do so for them.</p>

          <p>Following a lawsuit by the American Federation of Teachers, the Trump administration has agreed to resume processing student loan forgiveness for borrowers in two income-driven repayment plans, Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) and Pay as You Earn (PAYE). The administration had previously paused cancellations under these plans, affecting over 2.5 million borrowers. This agreement reopens a path to debt relief for public service workers and others enrolled in the programs. The deal also clarifies that loan forgiveness granted in 2025 will not be subject to federal taxes.</p>

          <p>Bolivians are voting in a presidential run-off election that marks the end of two decades of rule by the leftist Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party. The choice is between two conservative capitalists, Jorge Quiroga and Rodrigo Paz, who both promise to pivot the country away from populist economic policies. The election takes place during Bolivia's worst economic crisis in decades, characterized by a U.S. dollar shortage and soaring inflation. The winner will face the immense challenge of stabilizing the economy while navigating potential social unrest.</p>

          <p>Four years after the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan effectively banned women's sports, a newly formed national women's refugee football team is set to compete in a FIFA-sanctioned tournament. The squad is composed of players who fled the country and are now based in Australia, the United Kingdom, Portugal, and Italy. For the players, this return to the pitch is not just about football; it represents a significant step toward official recognition and an opportunity to be a voice for the silenced women and girls still in Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>The streets of Madrid were filled with the sounds of bleating and bells as thousands of sheep and goats paraded through the city for the annual Transhumance Festival. This event celebrates the ancient pastoral tradition of moving livestock between seasonal grazing grounds and highlights its modern environmental benefits, such as clearing flammable undergrowth to prevent wildfires. Shepherds paid a symbolic fee of medieval coins to city officials, honoring a 1418 agreement and recreating a historical spectacle for thousands of onlookers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following more than a week of deadly fighting along their shared border, Pakistan and the Taliban government in Afghanistan have agreed to an "immediate ceasefire." The agreement was mediated by Qatar and Turkey and aims to establish mechanisms for lasting peace. The clashes were the most severe since the Taliban returned to power in 2021, sparked by Pakistan's accusations that the Taliban harbors militant groups that launch attacks on its soil. Both sides have agreed to end hostile actions and will hold further talks in Istanbul.</p>

          <p>Jared Kushner, a key negotiator of the recent Israel-Hamas peace agreement, said in a "60 Minutes" interview that the deal's ultimate success hinges on establishing a "viable alternative" to govern Gaza. He anticipates that Hamas will use violence to try and reassert its control over the territory. Kushner argued that if the international community and qualified Palestinians can create a successful interim governing body, Hamas will fail, and Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel's security in the future.</p>

          <p>An American woman who moved from Texas to Spain ten years ago shares seven things she doesn't miss about life in the United States. Her list includes the limited paid vacation time, dependency on cars for transportation, the stressful and expensive healthcare system, and a constant low-level sense of danger in public spaces. She contrasts these with her experience in Spain, where she has found a better work-life balance, greater walkability in cities, and a stronger sense of community and personal safety.</p>

A Marine veteran himself, Vance used his speech to criticize the ongoing government shutdown, placing blame on Democrats. He also attacked what he described as "woke" diversity and inclusion initiatives within the military, aligning with the Trump administration's policy of eliminating such programs at the Pentagon.</p>

As part of the strategy, the government will establish five "technical excellence colleges" and launch programs to match veterans and others with careers in the growing sector. The plan is intended to bolster the economy, create well-paid jobs, and help lower long-term energy bills.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The federal indictment of former National Security Adviser John Bolton on charges of mishandling classified information stands apart from cases against other Trump administration critics, according to legal experts. While the timing has raised questions about political motivations, former prosecutors suggest the evidence against Bolton may indicate a stronger, more straightforward case. The charges allege serious misconduct over a prolonged period, and prosecuting such a high-ranking official for these types of violations, while rare, is not without precedent.</p>
