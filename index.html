          <p>The UK government announced a major overhaul of its welfare system, aiming to save Â£5bn annually and encourage work.

          <p>College basketball star Cooper Flagg, projected as a top NBA draft pick, is considering staying in college due to the NCAA's new NIL rules, allowing athletes to profit from endorsements.  His high NIL valuation and the possibility of being drafted by a weak NBA team make staying in college a viable option.
