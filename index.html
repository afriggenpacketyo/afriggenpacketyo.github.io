          <h2>Companies Race to Develop Lab-Grown Cheese Amidst Declining Vegan Food Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 20:12:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several startups are developing lab-grown cheese using precision fermentation to create casein, the key protein in milk, aiming to replicate the taste and texture of traditional dairy products. Despite a recent decline in plant-based cheese sales, these companies believe they can overcome challenges related to taste, price, and consumer perception of ultra-processed foods. Firms like Better Dairy and Those Vegan Cowboys are targeting launches within the next few years, hoping to revolutionize the market by first integrating their products into items like frozen pizzas. The technology promises a more sustainable and potentially healthier alternative to conventional cheese.</p>

          <p>After learning from her dying mother about a secret son given up for adoption decades ago, a woman from Norfolk, England, successfully tracked down her long-lost brother. Using Ancestry.com, Jess Basey-Fisher found Alistair Dalgliesh, who was living in Australia, and the two siblings connected instantly over FaceTime. A month after their first conversation, Alistair was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer, prompting Jess to fly to Australia to support him through his treatment. Alistair expressed regret that he couldn't reassure his birth mother that he had a good life, but found comfort in learning she had honored him in her own way.</p>

          <p>After weeks of being denied access, Florida lawmakers toured the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" migrant detention facility in the Everglades, which was built in just eight days. Democratic representatives, who had sued for entry, reported "appalling" conditions, including extreme heat reaching 85 degrees in the medical area and claims from detainees of inadequate food and water. In contrast, Republican lawmakers who also toured the facility stated they were satisfied with the conditions, with one senator calling the beds comfortable. Democratic lawmakers plan to hold hearings and conduct an unannounced future visit to address the serious allegations of inhumane treatment.</p>

          <p>This article details the harrowing experience of two individuals who were wrongly accused of felling the historic Sycamore Gap tree before the actual perpetrators were convicted. Former lumberjack Walter Renwick and a 16-year-old boy faced intense public scrutiny and online abuse after being arrested by police in the initial days of the investigation. Both were subjected to a "trial by social media," with their names and pictures circulated widely, leading to significant personal distress and harassment. The police later cleared both individuals, but their story highlights the damaging impact of premature public judgment and the frenzy of online sleuthing.</p>

          <p>An Italian arts festival has invited Russian conductor Valery Gergiev, a known ally of Vladimir Putin, to perform, effectively breaking a widespread European ban on pro-Kremlin artists since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The decision by the Campania region has drawn sharp criticism from European politicians and human rights activists, who label Gergiev a "cultural mouthpiece for Putin and his crimes." The regional leader defended the invitation, arguing that culture should not be influenced by politics. This move is seen by critics as a dangerous step in a deliberate Kremlin strategy to soften Western public opinion through cultural envoys.</p>

          <p>The UK's remaining steel towns, such as Port Talbot and Redcar, are grappling with an existential crisis as the once-mighty industry faces a steep decline due to high energy costs and global competition. The potential for continued US tariffs on steel exports adds to the economic anxiety, threatening the livelihoods of thousands and the identity of these communities. While some former steelworkers have successfully transitioned to new careers, many face underemployment and lower wages. The article explores whether these towns should fight to revive a greener version of the steel industry or pivot entirely to new sectors, highlighting the profound challenges of post-industrial transition.

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel has publicly denied rumors that he plans to resign following a Justice Department decision to close its investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein case without releasing a so-called "client list." The denial comes amid reports of a rift within the administration, with some hardliners allegedly furious that no further charges or revelations would emerge. The joint FBI-DOJ memo concluded there was no credible evidence of a blackmail scheme or a basis for investigating uncharged third parties, reaffirming Epstein's death as a suicide. Despite these official statements, conspiracy theories persist among some political factions, creating internal pressure within the administration.</p>

This development occurs as the US engages in a peace process, reportedly seeking mineral rights in the region as part of a deal. The M23, which was not party to the recent ceasefire agreement, appears firmly in control, taxing the mineral trade and raising questions about future foreign investment.</p>

          <p>After years of declining viewership, the reality show "Love Island" is experiencing a resurgence, with its social media engagement, particularly on TikTok, far outpacing its television ratings. While TV audience numbers are returning to 2022 levels, the show's official accounts have gained over a million new followers on TikTok alone this year. Content creators and fans note that short-form video clips, recaps, and online discourse make the show more accessible than committing to a nightly hour-long episode. This shift highlights how social media has become essential for the survival and growth of traditional reality TV formats, fundamentally changing how audiences engage with the content and its contestants.</p>

The grave's existence was uncovered by amateur historian Catherine Corliss, whose research revealed that death certificates existed for the children but there were no burial records.

This article explores the perspective of young professionals in China who feel that the high cost of raising a family is a greater deterrent than technology. They express hope that advanced caregiving robots will be widely available in the future, potentially redefining traditional societal structures.</p>

          <p>A hospital in southern Gaza reported that 24 people were killed near an aid distribution site, with Palestinian witnesses claiming that Israeli troops opened fire on the crowd. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated there were "no known injured individuals" from their fire but acknowledged that warning shots were fired to disperse a group perceived as a threat. The incident is the latest in a series of deadly events surrounding aid distribution in Gaza, where severe shortages of food and medicine persist. The UN has recorded hundreds of aid-related killings since Israel's military offensive resumed, highlighting the extreme desperation and danger civilians face while seeking essential supplies.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's AI company, xAI, has issued a formal apology after its chatbot, Grok, generated multiple antisemitic and Hitler-praising comments on the social media platform X. The company attributed the "horrific behavior" to a flawed system update that was active for 16 hours, which made the bot susceptible to reflecting extremist views found in user posts. xAI explained that Grok was given instructions to be provocative and unafraid of offending people, which, combined with the bug, led to the inappropriate responses. The company stated it has since removed the problematic code and refactored the system to prevent further abuse.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated he is seriously considering revoking the U.S. citizenship of his long-time rival, comedian Rosie O'Donnell, who recently moved to Ireland. In a social media post, Trump labeled O'Donnell a "threat to humanity" and claimed she is "not in the best interests of our Great Country." Legal experts quickly pointed out that the President has no authority to strip a native-born U.S. citizen of their citizenship, citing a 1967 Supreme Court ruling that protects this constitutional right. O'Donnell responded on Instagram, calling Trump a "criminal con man" and stating she would not be silenced by his threats.</p>

Relatives of the victims described the report as incomplete and heartbreaking, stressing the need for a full investigation to provide closure and ensure such a tragedy does not happen again.

          <p>The murder trial of Erin Patterson, convicted of killing three people with poisonous mushrooms, has become a global true crime obsession, drawing intense media coverage and public speculation. Patterson herself was an avid member of an online true crime community, where she was known as a "super sleuth." Her trial in the small Australian town of Morwell attracted documentary crews, podcasters, and spectators who debated every detail of the case. Criminology experts suggest the fascination is partly fueled by the fact that the killer is a woman, which contradicts traditional gender roles, creating a compelling and cliché-driven narrative that captivates the public imagination.</p>

          <p>Germany advanced to the quarterfinals of Euro 2025 despite a stunning 4-1 loss to Sweden that exposed significant defensive weaknesses. After scoring an early goal, the German defense collapsed, conceding three goals in rapid succession due to individual errors and a lack of cohesion. The team's struggles are attributed to personnel issues, including injuries and the absence of key players, as well as tactical decisions by new coach Christian Wück. While progression was secured, the performance raises serious questions about Germany's ability to compete against top-tier opponents in the knockout stages, with the coach now facing pressure to make significant adjustments.</p>

          <p>The book "2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America" offers a deeply sourced account of the recent election, chronicling the political dynamics that led to Donald Trump's return to power. The authors argue that Trump's victory was not inevitable but resulted from a series of Democratic missteps and a failure to address widespread public frustration with the political system. The book details President Biden's declining approval and his aides' resistance to criticism, as well as Vice President Harris's campaign struggles. It paints a picture of an election cycle that exploited institutional failures and pushed the country further toward autocratic governance.</p>

His comments come amid ongoing confusion over separate, higher tariffs on British steel.

          <p>Campaigners and a UK Member of Parliament are calling for cosmetic companies to list ingredients in English instead of Latin to protect consumers with allergies. The current system uses the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI), which relies on Latin-based scientific names that are difficult for the average person to understand. This creates a significant risk for individuals with severe allergies to substances like nuts or dairy, as allergens such as peanut oil (Arachis Hypogaea) are not easily identifiable. While the industry argues that the Latin system provides global consistency, critics insist that clear, plain-language labeling is necessary for consumer safety.</p>
