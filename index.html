        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose a 35% tariff on all Canadian imports effective August 1, escalating the ongoing trade dispute between the two nations. In a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, President Trump linked the new levies to Canada's alleged failure to curb the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. and existing trade imbalances. The letter warns that these tariffs, which are separate from existing sectoral duties on steel and autos, could be increased if Canada chooses to retaliate. This move creates further economic uncertainty as the two countries approach a July 21 deadline to finalize a new trade agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House is standing by its assessment that the 'Operation Midnight Hammer' airstrikes completely destroyed Iran's nuclear facilities, despite a New York Times report suggesting some enriched uranium may have survived. According to the report, Israeli officials believe a portion of the underground uranium stockpile remains accessible. A White House spokesperson reiterated President Trump's statement that the mission was a total success, ensuring global safety. The operation involved a long-range, complex mission by B-2 stealth bombers that flew from Missouri to strike key Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan with powerful bunker-busting bombs.</p>

          <p>Tensions flared in Ventura County, California, as U.S. Border Patrol agents clashed with protesters during a raid on what the Department of Homeland Security identified as a marijuana facility. Federal agents, who were serving a warrant, deployed tear gas and less-than-lethal rounds after a standoff with a crowd attempting to block their access. Four individuals were hospitalized as a result of the confrontation. Governor Gavin Newsom's office condemned the operation, stating such tactics instill fear and chaos in hardworking communities, highlighting the contentious nature of the administration's intensified immigration enforcement actions in the state.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Natural Resources has announced the discovery of 38 new mineral reserve sites in the first half of the year, a 31% increase from the previous year. These discoveries, which include significant deposits of rubidium and gold, are part of a national strategy to enhance resource security amid a global race for critical materials. Investment in mineral exploration saw a substantial year-on-year increase, focusing on elements like tin, copper, and tungsten, which are vital for high-tech industries such as aerospace and semiconductors. This initiative underscores China's commitment to strengthening its domestic supply chains for strategic resources.</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates a significant decline in interest among Southeast Asian travelers for visiting the United States, with concerns about potential discrimination and gun violence outweighing cost factors. According to a CNBC Travel survey of 6,000 individuals, nearly 80% find the U.S. less appealing, with one in four stating their interest has dropped in the last six months. While the Trump administration's policies and tariff talks have had a negative impact, travelers from Vietnam and the Philippines showed increased interest, potentially due to large diaspora communities. Conversely, a majority of Singaporeans expressed diminished interest in U.S. travel.</p>

In a recent interview, Welsh expressed concern that society is becoming a "post-culture society" where artificial intelligence thinks for people, leading to atrophied brains and a population of "dumbed down machines." He attributes some of this cultural shift to the internet and social media, which he sees as a controlling force. The new novel revisits the themes of love and relationships against the backdrop of a world he feels is now full of hate.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a key student negotiator during the pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, has filed a $20 million claim against the U.S. government. The claim alleges false imprisonment and malicious prosecution after he was detained by immigration authorities for over 100 days. The government sought to deport the permanent U.S. resident, arguing his activism was detrimental to foreign policy interests, but a federal judge ordered his release in June. Khalil's lawyers state he would accept an official apology in lieu of the monetary damages, seeking accountability for what he calls a chilling effect on free speech and protest.</p>

          <p>On the 30th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide, an opinion piece reflects on the international community's repeated declarations of "never again" in the face of mass atrocities. The author, Ed Husic, shares the story of a Bosnian survivor and questions how much longer it will take for the world to apply the same principle to the ongoing suffering in Gaza. The article highlights the cycle of witnessing unimaginable suffering, followed by belated international action and legal recognition of genocide, as seen with the Holocaust, Rwanda, and Srebrenica. It serves as a powerful call to break this pattern and act decisively to protect innocent lives.</p>

The company has applied with the Arizona Department of Transportation for approval to conduct testing and operations, both with and without human safety drivers. This move comes after Tesla launched a pilot program for its remotely supervised Robotaxis in Austin, Texas. While Tesla aims to catch up in the autonomous vehicle space, its initial efforts have faced some issues, including a minor accident and traffic violations that have drawn regulatory scrutiny.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing an unusually hot 2025, with the warmest spring on record and the warmest June ever recorded in England. The country is already in its third heatwave of the year, a clear sign of the increasing frequency of extreme weather events driven by climate change. Scientists warn that while global temperatures have risen by over 1.3°C, this translates to heatwaves in the UK being 3-4°C warmer than they would have been historically. This trend, occurring during a neutral El Niño-La Niña phase, underscores that human-induced global warming is the dominant factor driving these extreme temperatures.</p>

          <p>Despite having the world's lowest birth rate, South Korea is experiencing a boom in its fertility clinic industry. The number of fertility treatments in the country has risen by nearly 50% in recent years, with one in six babies in Seoul now born with medical assistance. This trend is attributed to a generational shift where more people, particularly women, are choosing to delay having children due to social and financial pressures, such as high education costs and long work hours. Consequently, by the time many are ready to start families, they turn to treatments like IVF, signaling a strong underlying desire for children that is being met with medical solutions.</p>

A Secret Service official acknowledged the failure and stated the agency is focused on implementing improvements, including better technology and clearer accountability.

          <p>A new study from UCLA researchers reveals that the duration of heat waves is increasing at a faster rate than the overall pace of global warming. The findings, published in Nature Geoscience, indicate that the longest and rarest heat waves are showing the greatest increases in frequency, meaning each fraction of a degree of warming has a compounding impact. This acceleration poses significant risks to public health, agriculture, and infrastructure, and underscores the urgent need for faster adaptation strategies. The study warns that tropical regions near the equator will experience the most dramatic changes in heat wave length and frequency.</p>

          <p>The United Nations Aids Agency (UNAIDS) has issued a stark warning that recent U.S. funding cuts are threatening to reverse decades of progress in the global fight against HIV/AIDS. The Trump administration's decision to halt most funding for PEPFAR, the largest single contributor to the HIV response, could lead to an estimated six million new infections and four million additional deaths in the next four years. The sudden withdrawal of support is already being felt in countries like South Africa, which has the world's largest HIV-positive population and where many research trials are now being suspended due to a lack of funds.</p>

Erratic weather patterns, including long heat waves and unpredictable rain, are damaging tea plants and drastically reducing harvest yields, in some cases by up to 70%. The rising temperatures are also affecting the delicate ecosystems required for certain specialty teas, such as Taiwan's famous dongfang meiren, which relies on bites from a specific insect that is becoming less common. Farmers are attempting to adapt by using organic methods and planting at higher altitudes, but the future of their traditional businesses remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed a long-standing federal policy by excluding undocumented children from the Head Start preschool program. This change is part of a broader strategy to make life more difficult for immigrants and encourage self-deportation. The Department of Health and Human Services reclassified Head Start and at least 12 other programs as "federal public benefits," thereby restricting access for non-citizens. The National Head Start Association warned that the move will create fear and confusion among all families, not just those directly affected, and will deny a vulnerable group of children access to crucial early education and nutrition services.</p>

The company beat Wall Street expectations for its second quarter, with sales rising 6% and direct-to-consumer revenue growing 11%. Levi's finance chief stated the company is absorbing some of the initial tariff costs, which are currently expected to have a minimal impact on earnings. The strong performance is also attributed to growth in its women's apparel and tops categories, as well as a strategy of reducing promotions to encourage full-price sales. (not investment advice)</p>
