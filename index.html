          <p>The UK economy showed no growth in July, following a 0.4% expansion in June, with manufacturing output seeing its largest contraction in a year according to the Office for National Statistics. The ONS will now focus on growth over a rolling three-month period, where the economy expanded by 0.2% in the three months leading up to July. Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces increasing pressure to boost economic growth before the Budget on November 26, where tax and spending plans will be outlined, with speculation of tax increases to meet fiscal rules. The service sector saw a 0.4% growth, but manufacturing declined by 1.3%, leading economists to anticipate a slowdown in the latter half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SK Hynix, a South Korean memory chipmaker, has announced its readiness for mass production of next-generation high-bandwidth memory (HBM4) chips, positioning itself ahead of competitors like Samsung and Micron. These HBM chips are essential for AI computing, especially in Nvidia's chipsets, with SK Hynix being a major supplier to Nvidia. The HBM4 chips boast doubled bandwidth and a 40% increase in power efficiency compared to the previous generation, making them suitable for Nvidia's upcoming Rubin architecture. This development has led to a surge in SK Hynix's stock, reflecting investor confidence in the company's continued dominance in the HBM market, which is expected to account for a significant portion of its revenue.

          <p>The UK economy experienced stagnant growth in July, aligning with economists' expectations and adding pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of the Autumn Budget. Production output declined by 0.9%, while services and construction showed slight increases, according to the Office for National Statistics. Economists anticipate an economic slowdown in the latter half of 2025, potentially influencing the Bank of England's monetary policy decisions amid concerns about inflation and fiscal uncertainty. The stagnation raises concerns about potential tax increases in the upcoming budget, as the government aims to balance spending with tax receipts and reduce debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Over 300 South Korean workers, detained in an immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia, have returned to South Korea, causing diplomatic tensions between the two countries. The return was delayed due to a White House instruction, with President Trump pausing the departure to assess the workers' willingness to stay and train Americans. South Korea's president expressed concern that the raid would deter future investments in the US, highlighting the importance of Korean firms in setting up overseas factories. The incident has raised concerns about visa options for Korean workers and potential delays in the factory's opening, impacting US-South Korea relations.</p>

          <p>The House of Lords is set to debate a bill legalizing assisted dying in England and Wales, with opponents raising concerns about its potential implications. The bill, already backed by MPs, proposes allowing terminally ill adults with less than six months to live to apply for an assisted death, subject to approval from multiple doctors and a panel. Opponents argue the bill is flawed and requires significant changes, while supporters urge peers to respect the decision made by the Commons. The debate is expected to cover issues such as coercion, safeguards, and mental capacity, with the outcome uncertain due to the influence of cross-bench peers.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the challenges and contradictions of the US attempt to contain China and reindustrialize, highlighting the impact of anti-immigrant policies on industrial efforts. The raid on a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia, where hundreds of South Korean technicians were detained for visa issues, exemplifies the conflict between anti-immigrant crackdowns and the need for skilled labor. The author argues that efforts to reshore American manufacturing and isolate China may ultimately hurt the US and its allies, while disrupting globalization and world trade. The current crackdown on undocumented migrants and illegal workers, both skilled and unskilled, appeals to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” base and is believed to be good for votes.</p>
