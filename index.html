          <p>A 1,000-pound American bomb from WWII was discovered at a construction site in Hong Kong's Quarry Bay district, leading to the evacuation of approximately 6,000 residents from 1,900 households. Police described the disposal operation as exceptionally high-risk due to the bomb's size and condition. The device was successfully defused after an operation lasting from Friday night until Saturday morning, with no injuries reported. Such discoveries are not uncommon in the city, which was a target of Allied air raids against Japanese forces during the war.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order mandating a new $100,000 annual fee for companies applying for H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers, set to take effect on September 21. The administration cites "abuse" of the program as the reason for the drastic fee increase, which will apply to new requests for six years. Critics, including immigration lawyers and business groups, warn the policy will devastate small businesses and startups, potentially driving tech operations out of the U.S. Major tech companies like Amazon, a top beneficiary of the program, have advised employees abroad to return before the deadline.

          <p>A cyberattack targeting software from Collins Aerospace has caused significant disruptions at major European airports, including London Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The attack affected the 'Muse' system, used by multiple airlines for electronic check-in and baggage drops, forcing staff to resort to manual processing. This led to long queues, hundreds of flight delays, and potential cancellations, with passengers reporting hours-long waits and missed connections. While the company is working to resolve the issue, the incident highlights the vulnerability of interconnected digital systems in the global aviation industry.</p>

          <p>Ed Langevin, a retired grandfather, experienced severe heartburn, nausea, and significant weight loss, which doctors eventually diagnosed as chronic mesenteric ischemia, a rare condition caused by blocked arteries restricting blood flow to the small intestine. His condition was described as extreme, causing a severe physical and psychological toll due to the pain and fear associated with eating. Dr. Gabriel Wallace at Northwestern Medicine successfully treated him with a minimally invasive stent procedure, allowing him to return to a normal life. Langevin's story highlights the importance of patient self-advocacy in achieving a correct diagnosis and treatment.</p>

          <p>Erik Siebert, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, has resigned following pressure from the Trump administration to bring criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. The resignation comes after a months-long mortgage fraud investigation into James, a political adversary of President Trump, has not yet resulted in an indictment. The move has intensified concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department and the use of prosecutorial power for political retribution. Trump publicly stated he wanted Siebert "out," further eroding norms meant to insulate federal law enforcement from White House influence.</p>

          <p>According to the 2024 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), the average reading and math scores for 12th graders in the U.S. have fallen to their lowest levels in decades. The report found that 45% of seniors scored below the "basic" level in math, and 32% were below basic in reading, continuing a downward trend that began before the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts point to multiple contributing factors, including chronic absenteeism, increased screen time, and declining student engagement. The sobering results have reignited debate over federal versus state control of education and the urgent need for effective solutions.</p>

The massive availability of private funding reduces the incentive for these companies to go public, allowing them to remain private longer. While OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman has acknowledged being in a "bubble," he also expressed a deep belief in the technology. (not investment advice)</p>

The influx of visitors raises concerns about its impact on the island's strained resources, rising housing costs, and gentrification, issues Bad Bunny himself has addressed in his music.

The piece emphasizes that his most lasting impact may be the Sundance Institute and Film Festival, which he founded to support independent and risk-taking filmmakers. Through Sundance, he helped launch the careers of numerous acclaimed directors, including the Coen Brothers, Quentin Tarantino, and Ava DuVernay. The article concludes that Redford effectively recycled his own success into opportunities for others.</p>

The new legislation also formally allows the creation of "memorial diamonds" from cremated ashes.

          <p>Reports that the Trump administration has paused $400 million in weapons aid to Taiwan have raised concerns that the island's security is being used as a bargaining chip in trade talks with China. The alleged hold on munitions and drones came just before President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping held a "productive" phone call, after which Taiwan was notably absent from official readouts. While the U.S. has previously been a major arms supplier to Taiwan, President Trump has questioned the value of this support in his second term.

          <p>To help car shoppers avoid overspending, financial planners suggest using the "20-4-10" rule as a guideline for affordability. This framework recommends making a down payment of at least 20% of the vehicle's price, financing the car for no more than four years (48 months), and ensuring that total monthly vehicle expenses do not exceed 10% of your monthly income. Adhering to these principles can help buyers avoid becoming "underwater" on their loan, where they owe more than the car is worth.

Wang argues that while China's leadership, dominated by engineers, has achieved remarkable successes in infrastructure and manufacturing, it often prioritizes national power over individual happiness. Conversely, he suggests the U.S. has become physically stagnant and could learn from China's dynamism, even as President Trump adopts some of China's worst authoritarian tendencies. The book challenges readers to consider whether the two restless, imperfect superpowers can learn from each other's strengths.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a massive overnight attack on Ukraine, targeting nine regions with over 600 missiles and drones, killing at least three people and injuring more than 30. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated the attacks deliberately targeted infrastructure, residential areas, and civilian enterprises, including an apartment building in Dnipro hit by a missile with cluster munitions. Ukraine's Air Force reported that its defenses, including F-16 fighters, successfully neutralized the vast majority of the incoming projectiles. Zelenskyy condemned the strikes as a strategy of terror and called for a strong international response.</p>

          <p>Clayton Kershaw, widely considered the greatest pitcher of his generation, announced his retirement after an 18-year career spent entirely with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Kershaw was the franchise's guiding light, leading the team through a period of bankruptcy and instability to an era of perennial success, including 13 consecutive postseason berths. His career, marked by three Cy Young Awards and a historically low ERA, bridged the gap between the team's difficult years and its current powerhouse status. On the night after his announcement, the Dodgers clinched another postseason spot, underscoring the culture of winning he helped build.</p>

          <p>For over a decade, Robert Fortunato's remodeled "Green Idea House" in Hermosa Beach, California, has produced more energy than it consumes, demonstrating a model for sustainable living. The project involved replacing all gas appliances with electric ones, powered by 26 rooftop solar panels that also charge two electric cars, eliminating utility bills. Key design features, such as calculated roof overhangs for seasonal shading and an open stairway acting as a "thermal chimney" for cooling, significantly reduce energy needs. Fortunato emphasizes that the remodel used standard materials and off-the-shelf technologies, proving that net-zero energy can be accomplished for less than the cost of traditional construction.</p>

          <p>Following the killing of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk, immigrant advocacy organizations are preparing for a potential crackdown from the Trump administration. Top officials, including Stephen Miller and JD Vance, have vowed to hold non-profits "criminally liable" for what they baselessly describe as coordinated attacks and have labeled civil rights groups a "domestic terror movement." In response, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has issued warnings against assaulting its officers and expanded its definition of "threats" to include filming its operations. Activists state they will continue their work within legal boundaries but are practicing increased caution.</p>

          <p>Critics warn that the Trump administration is using the fatal shooting of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk as a pretext to crack down on political dissent, echoing authoritarian tactics. In the days since the killing, President Trump and his allies have escalated threats against the "radical left," considering designating some groups as domestic terrorists despite no evidence linking them to the crime. The administration's rhetoric aims to delegitimize the Democratic party and civil society organizations by association. This response is seen by some political scientists as a classic authoritarian move: using political violence to justify suppressing opposition and eroding civil liberties.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel has faced a difficult week, drawing criticism from both Democrats and some conservatives for his management of the investigation into Charlie Kirk's assassination. Patel's early missteps, including a premature announcement of a suspect in custody, and his performative social media presence have been questioned. Despite this, he appears to retain the support of President Trump, who values Patel's aggressive, counter-punching style against political opponents. The situation highlights the ongoing tension between traditional FBI conduct and the political demands of the Trump administration, as well as the internal MAGA debate over whether Patel is sufficiently dismantling the so-called "deep state."</p>

The Port argues the project is necessary to accommodate larger, next-generation cargo ships, thereby securing jobs and maintaining competitiveness, proposing to add $1.5 billion to an existing renovation project. However, this would extend the bridge's closure from 16 to 28 months, causing significant disruption for commuters and businesses in San Pedro and Long Beach by rerouting traffic.
