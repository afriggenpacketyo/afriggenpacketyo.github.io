          <p>President Trump has agreed to a face-to-face interview with The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg, despite years of criticizing Goldberg's reporting as biased and fictional. Trump claims the interview is out of curiosity and to test The Atlantic's ability to be truthful, particularly regarding coverage of him. Goldberg and The Atlantic have not commented on the alleged meeting. Trump has frequently attacked Goldberg's work, including a 2020 article detailing Trump's alleged disparaging remarks about fallen soldiers, and a recent incident where Goldberg was inadvertently included in a Signal chat about a planned military operation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has replaced the federal lawyers defending it in a lawsuit over New York City’s congestion pricing program, accusing them of undermining the department’s bid to end the toll.

The memo, dated April 11, revealed that the assistant U.S. attorneys believed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy's rationale for ending the tolling plan was weak and likely to fail.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from withholding funds from "sanctuary cities." The lawsuit was filed by San Francisco and other local governments across the U.S. arguing that the executive orders threatened budgetary certainty and undermined trust between cities and their communities. The judge stated the threat to withhold funding causes irreparable injury. This ruling echoes a similar victory San Francisco had against the first Trump administration in 2018 regarding sanctuary policies.</p>

The company cited potential project delays due to tariffs as the reason for the adjustment. Dover's CEO Richard Tobin described the trim as "purely a top-down mechanical adjustment" based on sentiment, and the company still has $2.8 billion in dry powder for acquisitions or share repurchases.

          <p>Warnings of retail shortages have emerged as CEOs of major retail stores told President Trump that a prolonged trade war could lead to empty shelves. Apparel and footwear are key product areas to watch, as imports from China account for a significant portion of U.S. supplies. High tariff rates may act as an import ban, leading to product shortages as orders are canceled or goods are held in warehouses. Supply chain experts predict that lower-end stores with lean inventories will be hit hardest, with toys, games, budget home goods, and apparel disappearing first.</p>

          <p>The small government agency responsible for overseeing programs like Meals on Wheels is being dismantled as part of the Trump administration’s overhaul of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Roughly half its staff has been let go in recent layoffs, and all of its 10 regional offices are closed. The cuts are linked to President Trump's focus on ending what he calls "illegal and immoral discrimination programs," which includes disability services.</p>

          <p>A study has revealed how female bonobos maintain their matriarchal societies by forming coalitions against males. Researchers tracked six bonobo communities in the Democratic Republic of Congo for nearly 30 years. They found that when a male bonobo misbehaves, females band together to attack or intimidate him, leading to a loss of social rank for the male and improved access to resources for the females.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China are in disagreement about whether trade talks are actively taking place, with President Trump claiming discussions are ongoing while Chinese officials deny it. Trump stated that tariffs on China would "come down substantially," but the White House later clarified there would be "no unilateral reduction" in tariffs. China has responded with tariffs on U.S. goods and export restrictions on rare earth elements. Experts suggest that the Trump administration may be growing nervous about the economic fallout of the trade war.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire federal judge has restricted the Trump administration's ability to cut federal funding from public schools participating in some diversity and equity initiatives. The judge stated that actions by the Trump administration to withhold funds would "cripple the operations of many educational institutions" and violate executive branch power. The ruling is limited to public schools working with the plaintiffs in the case. The Trump administration has asserted that U.S. public schools have embraced "pervasive and repugnant race-based preferences."</p>

They contend that the nonprofit board would be breaching its duties if it proceeded with the sale.

          <p>India has threatened to suspend its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan, which could severely impact Pakistan's agriculture and economy. The threat comes after a militant attack in Kashmir, with India alleging "cross-border linkages" to the attackers. Blocking the flow of water would restrict the water supply used for most of Pakistan’s crop irrigation and human consumption, threatening their economy.</p>

          <p>Gustavo Dudamel concluded his 16th and penultimate winter season with the Los Angeles Philharmonic with a premiere of Carlos Simon's "Good News Mass" and performances at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The L.A. Phil's appearance at Coachella, where the orchestra became an equal partner with pop artists, was particularly historic.
