          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. Vice President JD Vance met in New Delhi, where they discussed the significant progress in trade negotiations between the two countries. Both leaders expressed optimism about reaching a mutually beneficial India-U.S. Bilateral Trade Agreement and reviewed advancements in energy, defense, and strategic technologies. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer noted the lack of reciprocity in the trade relationship but welcomed India's constructive engagement, highlighting ongoing efforts to create new opportunities for workers, farmers, and entrepreneurs. The leaders previously agreed to double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar's recent decline is creating both opportunities and challenges for central banks worldwide. While a weaker dollar can ease the debt burden for emerging markets and lower inflation by making imports cheaper, it also complicates export competitiveness. Central banks are treading carefully to avoid capital flight and potential retaliation from the U.S. administration, with some considering currency devaluation as an option. The European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank have already taken steps to address the situation, but the preferred approach remains avoiding a currency war that could destabilize the global economy.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks and the dollar experienced a downturn after President Donald Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates preemptively. Trump's remarks exacerbated market uncertainty already fueled by his tariff plans, raising concerns about a potential economic recession. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq all fell, while the dollar index reached its lowest level since 2022. Gold prices, viewed as a safe-haven asset, reached a new record high as investors sought stability amid the market turmoil.</p>

          <p>China witnessed a significant increase in newly established private companies during the first quarter, with nearly 1.98 million firms registered, marking a 7.1% growth compared to the previous year. This growth, exceeding the average of the past three years, reflects the resilience of China's private economy despite the challenges posed by the U.S.-China trade war. Private businesses, contributing to over half of the country's exports, are expected to bear the brunt of U.S. tariffs, prompting calls for increased support from the government. These firms accounted for 56.8% of China's total trade value in the period.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has proposed a budget that would eliminate a nearly $1 billion financial gap by cutting over 2,700 city positions, with approximately 1,650 layoffs. The proposed budget includes funding for new hires at the Fire Department, but many other agencies face significant spending reductions, including the Los Angeles Police Department, which could see over 400 civilian workers laid off. Union leaders have vowed to fight the layoffs, while Bass is lobbying for state financial assistance to avoid the job cuts.

          <p>An experiment has launched into orbit to assess the feasibility of growing lab-grown food in space, potentially providing astronauts with steak, mashed potatoes, and desserts made from individual cells. The European Space Agency (ESA) is funding the research to reduce the high cost of feeding astronauts, which can reach £20,000 per day. If successful, the project could lead to a pilot food production plant on the International Space Station within two years. Researchers aim to create factories in orbit and on the Moon, using bioreactors to produce proteins, fats, and carbohydrates that can be combined into various dishes, even 3D-printed steaks.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a sharp decline on Monday following President Trump's renewed criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all fell, driven by investor concerns over tariff uncertainty and potential impacts on economic activity. The dollar index also slid to its lowest level since 2022, while gold reached a record high, signaling investor apprehension about the safety of U.S. assets. Analysts suggest that weakening confidence among global investors, coupled with concerns about the Fed's independence, contributed to the market downturn.</p>

The whale had high levels of domoic acid in its urine, consistent with other marine mammals affected by the bloom, which has impacted hundreds of sea lions and dolphins. Experts attribute the bloom to an upswell of nutrients, climate change, and runoff from recent fires. Domoic acid is a neurotoxin that accumulates in fish and is then ingested by marine mammals, causing seizures and other neurological issues.</p>
