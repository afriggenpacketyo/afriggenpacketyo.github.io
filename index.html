          <p>A fundraising campaign for the funeral of a four-year-old boy, Zaahir Jan, has surpassed £5,500 just a day after its launch. Zaahir was fatally struck by a bus outside a hospital in Margate, Kent, where he had been visiting his grandmother. His father, Navid Feizi, described his son as the "cutest, smartest, charmed boy" and expressed profound grief over the tragic accident. The GoFundMe page, started by his mother Azaria, aims to provide him with the "best and most comfortable burial" and has received widespread community support.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly stated that ceding any territory to Russia is not an option for achieving peace. His declaration comes as a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin is scheduled to take place in Alaska. Zelenskyy warned that any peace agreement negotiated without Ukraine's direct involvement would be a "dead solution" and fundamentally "against peace." He emphasized that Ukraine's territorial integrity is non-negotiable and enshrined in its constitution, pushing back against suggestions that a land swap could end the conflict.</p>

          <p>A BBC report explores the negative psychological impacts of hook-up apps like Grindr, featuring personal accounts from users who describe feeling objectified and experiencing damaged self-esteem. One user, Lewis, explains how the app fostered an addictive cycle of seeking validation that ultimately led to anxiety and depression, comparing the experience to being an object "like picking clothes on Asos." The article also highlights singer Jacob Alon, whose music addresses the emptiness and degradation felt after casual encounters arranged on the apps, describing the culture as potentially "toxic."</p>

          <p>European destinations are witnessing a significant increase in tourism from China, with a reported 13 percent year-on-year rise in the first half of 2025. According to the European Travel Commission (ETC), this trend is expected to continue, as a recent survey found 72 percent of Chinese tourists are willing to travel long-haul to the continent. This figure is substantially higher than the global average and surpasses interest from traditionally strong markets like the US and Japan. The influx of visitors is a welcome boost for Europe's tourism sector as it navigates a changing global economic landscape.</p>

          <p>The term "grifter" has become a prevalent insult in modern political discourse, used to accuse opponents of profiting from their views through dishonest means. The article notes a significant increase in the word's usage, pointing to examples from various political figures and commentators across the spectrum. This trend is linked to a broader societal paranoia fueled by the rise of online influencer culture, numerous high-profile scam stories, and a general decline in trust in public figures. The piece suggests we are living in an "Age of Grift," where suspicion about others' motivations is the default posture.</p>

The reported directive follows an executive order designating several Mexican cartels as terrorist organizations.

He was also a member of the Apollo 8 crew, making him the first person to journey to the Moon twice, though he never landed on its surface. NASA and his family remembered him for his "unshakeable optimism" and his pivotal role in turning a potential space tragedy into one of NASA's most triumphant successes.</p>
