          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris admits in her upcoming book, "107 Days," that her silence on Joe Biden's 2024 re-election bid was reckless, suggesting she should have advised him to consider not running. Harris acknowledges she was often scapegoated by the Biden administration and felt pressured to prove her loyalty due to her past criticism of Biden. She rationalized her silence by believing Biden could defeat Donald Trump again, emphasizing her loyalty to the country above personal ambition. Harris describes how her success as vice president was vital to reassure the country given concerns about Biden's age, but her team didn't grasp this concept. </p>

This statement follows a bilateral meeting between Trump and Polish President Karol Nawrocki at the White House, where Trump promised to support Poland's protection.

          <p>Beijing is evaluating the potential risks stemming from social unrest in Nepal, a strategic partner, which was initially sparked by a social media ban and evolved into an anti-corruption movement. Observers suggest Beijing should prepare for further instability due to weak governance and possible external influences during political transitions. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman expressed hope for a swift resolution to restore social order and national stability in Nepal. The situation is attracting attention from China, particularly given the close relations between Nepali leaders and China. </p>

          <h2>German Schools Enforce Smartphone Bans to Improve Student Focus</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 10:44:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several German schools are implementing smartphone bans to combat excessive phone use among students, with Dalton High School being one example where students must keep phones in their bags throughout the school day. The initiative, called "Smart ohne Phone," has led to improved social behavior and focus, particularly among younger students, who are now engaging in activities like sports and board games. While teachers and parents largely support the ban, older students are more skeptical, and the initiative is part of a broader debate in Germany about how to handle student smartphone use. A similar project in Solingen involves fifth-grade classes taking a complete break from social media, supported by trained 'media scouts'. </p>

The largest downward revisions occurred in the leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, and retail trade sectors. The Guardian is seeking insights from current job seekers in the US about their experiences and from employees who considered new opportunities but decided to stay put due to concerns about the labor market. </p>

          <p>California is considering a bill to allow healthcare providers to anonymously mail abortion drugs, aiming to protect access to medication abortion. The measure would allow doctors, pharmacists, and others authorized to prescribe abortion drugs to omit their names from the prescription label. Abortion rights advocates say this adds to existing protections under the state's shield law, safeguarding doctors who mail abortion pills out of state from legal actions. Opponents argue that shield laws turn states into safe havens for criminal activity, while advocates assert that protecting doctors ensures patient access to abortions. </p>

          <p>Experts are offering insights on whether homeowners should use home equity to pay off student loans, with the potential benefits being simplified repayment and possibly lower interest rates. However, they also caution about the risks, including the possibility of losing the home if payments are not made and the loss of valuable student loan benefits like Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Financial advisors emphasize the importance of understanding the terms and risks before proceeding, as well as considering the fees and closing costs associated with home equity loans and HELOCs. The decision should be made carefully, weighing the potential benefits against the risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The producer price index (PPI) posted an unexpected 0.1% decline in August, fueling market expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut, prompting President Trump to criticize Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Despite the tame inflation data, market reaction was muted, with traders awaiting the consumer price index (CPI) print. The PPI report showed positive news on inflation fundamentals, with the service sector experiencing deflation and goods prices rising only slightly. The CPI reading will receive more attention as it is the final data point before the Fed's rate decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 2025 leaf peeping season is underway, with some parts of the U.S. already experiencing fall foliage, and travel brand SmokyMountains.com predicting when trees will reach peak color across the country. Peak colors are expected to occur earliest in the north, gradually sweeping south, with the Mid-Atlantic, Great Lakes regions, and much of the West reaching peak color by mid-October. Warmer but drier conditions may lead to delayed and more subdued foliage in the Southeast and Deep South, with peak color potentially occurring from late October through mid-November. The fall season is experiencing a warming trend across the U.S., with temperatures forecast to be above average. </p>

          <p>New official guidelines advise both NHS and private fertility clinics to stop offering unproven treatments that do not help people have children, as these add-ons can give false hope and put people through unnecessary procedures. The draft guidance specifically advises against several popular fertility "add-ons", including so-called endometrial scratches. The guidance says patients must be given all the information necessary about treatments, including how likely they are to be successful and the risks and benefits involved. The updated draft suggests fertility preservation services should also be offered people with medical conditions or undergoing treatment that can impair their fertility. </p>

          <p>North Korea is employing propaganda techniques to maintain loyalty amid rising casualties among its troops fighting for Russia in Ukraine. State media broadcasts a documentary highlighting soldiers' "heroic sacrifices," including suicides to avoid capture, reinforcing the regime's narrative of ultimate loyalty. Leader Kim Jong Un is depicted mourning the fallen soldiers and consoling their families to demonstrate his anguish. The propaganda also aims to assure Moscow of Pyongyang's unwavering support, reframing the war as a defense against the United States, Japan, and South Korea. The state's control over information ensures these images carry a message of heroism rather than loss. </p>
