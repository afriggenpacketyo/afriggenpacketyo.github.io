        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains methane's significant role as a potent greenhouse gas, trapping 84 times more heat than CO2 over two decades, despite its shorter atmospheric lifespan. Human activities, particularly agriculture, waste, and the energy sector, contribute 60% of emissions. Simple solutions like fixing leaks in oil and gas infrastructure could drastically cut emissions by 75%, as highlighted by the International Energy Agency. New EU regulations and a UN satellite system are increasing transparency and accountability, but more action is crucial to meet global reduction targets by 2030.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two NHS trusts, Shropshire and Leeds, have been removed from a national review into maternity failings across England, sparking concern among affected families. The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust (SaTH) was excluded due to an ongoing police investigation, while Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (LTH) is subject to a separate inquiry by the Health Secretary. Critics, including MP Helen Morgan and impacted parents, fear this decision will prevent crucial lessons from being learned from some of the most extensive investigations into decades of failures in maternity care.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned gambling advertisements featuring Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton and the Chelsea football club logo. Investigations found that ads by Kwiff and Betway were likely to appeal strongly to individuals under 18, violating advertising regulations. The ASA cited Hamilton's significant youth following on social media and appearances in age-rated video games and children's programs as evidence of his appeal, prompting warnings to betting companies against using personalities with strong youth appeal.</p>

          <p>Golf icon Jack Nicklaus has won a $50 million defamation verdict against his former business partners, Nicklaus Companies, its owner Howard Milstein, and executive Andrew O'Brien. A Palm Beach County jury found that the company damaged Nicklaus's reputation by spreading false stories, including claims he considered joining the LIV Golf League and suffered from dementia. Nicklaus's attorney emphasized his client's lifetime dedication to integrity. The verdict allows Nicklaus to continue designing golf courses under his own name, while the company retains rights to his branded merchandise.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking study has for the first time ranked the physical side effects of different antidepressants, revealing significant variations that could impact patient health and adherence. Researchers analyzed 30 common drugs, finding differences in weight gain (up to 2kg), heart rate (21 beats per minute), and blood pressure within the first eight weeks of treatment. This article emphasizes that while no one should stop medication, the findings from King's College London and Oxford University highlight the need for personalized antidepressant prescriptions, especially given that millions take these drugs.</p>

          <p>The cyber attack on Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is estimated to cost £1.9 billion, making it the most economically damaging cyber event in UK history, according to the Cyber Monitoring Centre (CMC). The September 1 hack halted JLR's production for five weeks and caused widespread delays across its supply chain, affecting 5,000 businesses. The CMC predicts a full recovery won't be achieved until January 2026, with JLR bearing over half the cost. The exact nature of the attack remains unconfirmed, but its scale underscores the vulnerability of major industries.</p>

          <p>Keegan Bradley, captain of the US Ryder Cup team, fears he will 'never get over' their defeat by Europe, describing the aftermath as 'one of the toughest times' of his life. The 39-year-old acknowledged making wrong calls after Europe secured a 15-13 victory at Bethpage. Despite a dramatic final-day comeback attempt, the US team faced too large a deficit after the first two days. Bradley, who has now lost three Ryder Cups as player and captain, will continue to make himself available for future editions, despite the profound impact of the loss.</p>

          <p>India is reportedly considering a reduction in its Russian oil purchases as it nears a trade deal with the United States, which could see Washington substantially slash tariffs on Indian exports. Indian media suggests tariffs could drop from 50% to 15-16%. US President Donald Trump claimed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured him of scaled-back Russian oil imports, though India's foreign ministry had previously denied knowledge of such a call. India, the world's second-largest buyer of Russian crude, prioritizes safeguarding consumer interests in a volatile energy market. (not investment advice)</p>
