          <p>Chinese scientists have found that transplanting cells into the spleen could offer a new approach to treating diabetes. Research indicates that "shielding" islet cells improves their survival after transplantation into the spleen, potentially turning the organ into a hub for diabetes treatment. The spleen is considered a more promising long-term survival site for these cells than the liver, and could be engineered using nanoparticles to enhance transplant outcomes. These findings may lead to systematic clinical studies to fully demonstrate the spleen's safety and effectiveness for islet transplantation, offering hope for millions affected by diabetes.</p>
