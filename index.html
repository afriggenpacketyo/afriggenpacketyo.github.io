        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taylor Swift's new album, "The Life of a Showgirl," demonstrates her exceptional business savvy, which analysts attribute to her deep focus on fan engagement. By creating multiple album variants, limited edition merchandise, and strategically announcing the album on her fiancé Travis Kelce's podcast, she has maximized both fan value and revenue. While streaming generates some income, her primary profits come from physical sales and merchandise, a strategy that has proven highly effective. This approach has once again solidified her status as a dominant force in the music industry, turning her lyrical talent into a formidable business empire.</p>

          <p>WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert has publicly denied allegations that she claimed rookie star Caitlin Clark should be "grateful" to the league for her off-court financial success. The comments were brought to light by player Napheesa Collier, who also alleged Engelbert said players should thank her for the media rights deal. While Engelbert explicitly refuted the Clark-related statement, she responded more vaguely to the second allegation, citing "inaccuracies" in reporting. Amid ongoing negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement, Engelbert acknowledged the need to improve player appreciation within the league.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for over 300,000 Venezuelan migrants. This decision freezes a lower court's ruling that had found the termination illegal, allowing the administration to move forward with removing legal protections that shield these individuals from deportation. The Department of Homeland Security praised the order, stating that TPS was never intended to be a permanent program. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson criticized the court's use of its emergency docket to disrupt hundreds of thousands of lives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of electric vehicles in the United Kingdom surged to a record high in September, with battery electric vehicle registrations growing by nearly a third. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, electrified vehicles, including hybrids, accounted for over half of all new car sales last month. This growth is attributed to manufacturer discounts, a wider variety of available models, and a government grant scheme offering up to £3,750 for eligible vehicles. While businesses and fleets still represent the majority of EV buyers, the number of private consumers is also on the rise.</p>

          <p>Newly released court documents show that a white sheriff's deputy in Kansas, now charged with murder, knelt on the back of a handcuffed Black man, Charles Adair, for one minute and 26 seconds. The incident occurred in a Wyandotte County jail cell as Adair, who was suffering from a severe leg infection, was being returned from the infirmary. An autopsy determined the cause of death to be complications from "mechanical asphyxia" and ruled it a homicide.

          <p>Following a court order for PPE Medpro to repay £122 million for substandard medical gowns, a spokesperson for the company stated that most of the funds were passed to other firms in a consortium. The spokesperson argued that the administrator should pursue these partners, including Loudwater Trade and Finance and Eric Beare Associates, for the money. The firm, which gained preferential access to government contracts through Conservative peer Baroness Mone, is now entering administration with minimal assets. This development adds another layer to the ongoing scandal surrounding government PPE procurement during the pandemic.</p>

          <p>According to a Department of Health and Human Services memo, the Trump administration plans to offer unaccompanied immigrant children aged 14 and older a $2,500 stipend to voluntarily depart the United States. This new policy, which excludes minors from Mexico, represents a significant shift from established protocols that typically require judicial approval and legal consultation for such decisions. Immigration advocates have expressed alarm, warning that the incentive could exploit vulnerable children and pressure them into waiving their legal rights and returning to dangerous situations. The move is seen as part of a broader administration effort to expedite the removal of immigrant children.</p>

In response, President Trump urged Israel to immediately halt its bombing of Gaza to facilitate the safe release of hostages, stating he believes Hamas is "ready for a lasting PEACE."

This apprehension is shared across partisan lines, though older Americans are particularly strong in their condemnation of such acts. The survey also highlights a disconnect in public life, with fewer than half of respondents feeling comfortable expressing their political views publicly. This pessimism contrasts with a general belief that people can get along personally but are driven apart by politics, reflecting a deep concern about the nation's civic health.</p>

          <p>Actor and singer Tyrese Gibson has turned himself in to authorities in Fulton County, Georgia, on an animal cruelty warrant and was released on a $20,000 bond. The charge stems from a September incident where his four Cane Corso dogs allegedly escaped his property and killed a neighbor's smaller dog. Authorities had issued the warrant after Gibson reportedly failed to cooperate in surrendering the dogs. While Gibson has expressed condolences to the family who lost their pet, county officials state he is still not cooperating and that the dogs must be turned over to be deemed dangerous.</p>

          <p>Ghanaian winger Antoine Semenyo has been instrumental in Bournemouth's surprising rise to second place in the Premier League. In a recent match against Fulham, he scored two goals and provided an assist, bringing his season total to six league goals and making him one of the most in-form players in the league. Semenyo's success is a major achievement for the club, which lost several key players over the summer but managed to retain him with a new five-year contract. His manager and teammates have praised his "world class" talent, which has been crucial to the team's unexpected success.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court in Boston has ruled that the Trump administration cannot end birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to parents who are in the country illegally or on a temporary basis. The court upheld a lower court's injunction, stating that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their claim that such children are entitled to citizenship under the 14th Amendment. This ruling is one of several recent legal setbacks for the president's executive order on the issue. The administration has stated it will appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, setting the stage for a major constitutional showdown.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is set to continue into a second week after the Senate failed for a fourth time to pass spending proposals from either party. Both Republican and Democratic bills failed to achieve the necessary 60-vote threshold, with lawmakers remaining deadlocked over healthcare funding. The White House has warned of potential mass layoffs of federal workers if the impasse continues, describing the measure as "fiscal sanity." Meanwhile, the administration has already suspended billions in federal infrastructure funding for several Democratic-run states and cities as the political blame game intensifies.</p>

          <p>An Arkansas man from India is fighting to restore his visa status after he was arrested and detained by ICE for a month because police mistook his bottle of "Opium"-scented perfume for illegal narcotics. Although lab tests confirmed the substance was perfume and criminal charges were dropped, the arrest triggered an immigration hold due to an administrative error with his visa paperwork. The man, Kapil Raghu, is now unable to work, placing a severe financial burden on his American wife and family. He is now petitioning immigration authorities to resolve his status, which was jeopardized by the erroneous arrest.</p>

The company did not provide a specific reason for the withdrawal but stated it does not intend to proceed with the offering "at this time." A spokesperson indicated the original prospectus from last year was outdated given the rapid developments in the AI industry and that the company still hopes to go public in the future.</p>

          <p>Police have revealed that Jihad Al-Shamie, the man who killed two people in a knife and car attack at a Manchester synagogue, was on bail following a sexual assault arrest at the time of the incident. The two victims, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, are being hailed as heroes who died protecting others during the attack on Yom Kippur. Investigators believe Al-Shamie may have been influenced by extremist ideology and have arrested three more individuals on terrorism-related suspicions. An independent investigation will also examine the police response, as one of the victims was accidentally killed by police gunfire aimed at the attacker.</p>

          <p>Joshua Aaron, the creator of the ICEBlock app, has formally requested that Apple reverse its decision to remove the application from its App Store. He argues that the removal was a result of political pressure from the Trump administration and represents an infringement on constitutional rights. Aaron compared his app, which crowdsources sightings of law enforcement, to features in popular navigation apps like Waze that alert drivers to police speed traps. The controversy follows criticism from administration officials who claimed the app endangered federal agents, a charge Aaron has dismissed as a fearmongering tactic.</p>
