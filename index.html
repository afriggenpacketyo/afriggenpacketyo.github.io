            <h2>Fed Governor Waller Suggests Tariff Inflation Could Be Transitory</h2>

            <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller stated that the inflationary effects of President Trump's tariffs are likely to be temporary, drawing a parallel to the 'tush push' football play. He outlined two potential scenarios: larger, longer-lasting tariffs leading to a significant inflation spike followed by slower growth and increased unemployment, and smaller tariffs resulting in a milder inflation increase. Waller emphasized that regardless of the scenario, the Fed would likely cut interest rates, with the timing dependent on the magnitude of the tariffs. He stressed the need for flexibility in policymaking given the uncertainty introduced by the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

CEO Mark Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg are expected to testify, and a win for the FTC could force Meta to break up the company. </p>
