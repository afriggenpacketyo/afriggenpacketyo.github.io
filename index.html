        <p>The UK's National Health Service (NHS) will provide a take-home tablet medication, cladribine, to thousands of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients in England. This will reduce the need for hospital visits for injections or infusions.  NICE (the drug advisory body) approved the expansion of access, making the NHS the first in Europe to offer this at-home treatment.  The treatment involves two courses of about 20 tablets, 12 months apart. While the cost per tablet is high, the NHS negotiates discounts.  Rollout is expected to begin in April in England, with Wales and Northern Ireland likely to follow.</p>

        <p>Hundreds protested in Lower Manhattan against the arrest and detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestinian activist and legal US resident, who was arrested and transferred to Louisiana.  The White House defended the arrest, citing the government's authority to revoke his green card due to alleged disruptive protests, harassment of Jewish students, and distribution of pro-Hamas materials. Khalil was a leader of student protests at Columbia University, and the White House criticized the university for a lack of cooperation.</p>

        <h2>Wildfire Prevention Efforts Insufficient, Says Scientist</h2>
        <div class="timestamp">2025-03-11 21:12:29 EDT</div>
      </div>
      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>A fire scientist at the Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory argues that current wildfire prevention methods are inadequate.  He believes that more prescribed burns and allowing some smaller fires to burn are necessary to reduce fuel buildup and prevent larger, more destructive fires. He criticizes the tendency to aggressively fight all fires, arguing that this approach exacerbates the problem in the long run.  The scientist uses the recent devastating wildfires in Los Angeles as an example of the consequences of insufficient prevention.</p>

        <p>The captain of the cargo ship Solong was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter following a collision with the U.S.-flagged tanker Stena Immaculate in the North Sea.  The collision resulted in a fire, and one sailor is presumed dead. The investigation is underway to determine the cause of the collision, which caused a significant fuel spill and raised environmental concerns. The Solong was reportedly on a course from Scotland to the Netherlands, and the Stena was carrying jet fuel for the U.S. military.</p>

        <p>California Senate Majority Leader Lena Gonzalez is urging the Los Angeles Dodgers to end their sponsorship deals with oil and gas companies, citing the negative impact of fossil fuel pollution on air quality and the climate crisis.  She highlights the Dodgers' history of social responsibility and contrasts it with their continued partnerships with companies like Phillips 66.  A petition with nearly 23,000 signatures supports this call for the Dodgers to drop fossil fuel sponsors.</p>
