          <p>A significant tax bill backed by President Trump is set to extend many 2017 tax cuts and introduce new benefits primarily for wealthy individuals and investors. According to the Tax Policy Center, those earning over $1 million could see an average after-tax income increase of about $75,000. Key changes include raising the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000 for certain incomes and expanding benefits for Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) investments. The bill also makes the higher estate tax exemption permanent and adjusts rules for itemized deductions, which could impact charitable giving for top earners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries delivered a marathon speech on the House floor, speaking for over seven hours to vehemently oppose a major Republican tax and spending bill. Jeffries criticized the legislation as an "immoral document," arguing it launches an assault on the healthcare and nutritional support for everyday Americans, children, and seniors. He shared personal stories of individuals who would be harmed by the bill's deep cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP. Citing a Congressional Budget Office report, he warned that millions could lose their health insurance and that the cuts would have deadly consequences.</p>

          <p>A recent halt in U.S. Patriot missile and ammunition shipments to Ukraine is reportedly part of a broader strategic review influenced by Pentagon policy chief Elbridge Colby. Colby has long advocated for conserving U.S. military resources for a potential conflict in the Indo-Pacific, particularly concerning Taiwan. While the Pentagon initially cited concerns over U.S. stockpiles, officials later confirmed the pause aligns with a strategic realignment to prioritize the threat from China. The move has sparked criticism from some lawmakers who fear it could encourage Russian aggression, while others defend it as a necessary 'America First' policy.</p>

          <p>The island nation of Cape Verde is celebrating 50 years of independence, marking five decades of significant progress in development, education, and healthcare. Since 1975, the country has drastically reduced illiteracy from 65% to about 3% and boasts one of the highest life expectancies in Africa at nearly 75 years. Despite these successes, challenges such as youth unemployment and poverty persist, prompting the government to implement targeted social policies funded by a tourism tax. While many young, educated citizens migrate for better opportunities, their remittances remain a vital part of the nation's economy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar has significantly weakened in 2025, falling about 13% against the euro, a trend accelerated by President Trump's aggressive tariff policies. This currency shift, combined with a 10% baseline tariff on EU goods, is creating a difficult environment for European manufacturers, making their products more expensive in the U.S. market. Economists warn that sectors like pharmaceuticals and automobiles will be particularly affected if a new trade deal isn't reached by the July 9 deadline.

While the Trump administration has announced deals with nations like China and the U.K., the status of negotiations with many others, including the European Union, remains unclear. Experts believe some extensions are likely, but the prolonged uncertainty is already hindering investment and economic planning for many U.S. businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

The author argues that the committee chair, Sen. Charles Grassley, improperly shielded Bove from questioning about his controversial past by invoking privileges. The presence of Attorney General Pam Bondi and her deputy was seen as an intimidating tactic to ensure Republican support. The article details Bove's checkered history, including accusations of abusive tactics as a prosecutor and his alleged role in politically motivated actions at the Department of Justice.</p>

Luttig, once a potential Supreme Court nominee himself, argued that Roberts has a profound obligation to defend federal judges from political threats and has failed to do so directly. He contends that Roberts' broad, non-specific statements about judicial independence are insufficient and offensive, especially given the escalating threats of violence against judges.

While this is considered better than the worst-case scenario, executives remain concerned that the new rate, double the current 10% duty, will still negatively impact businesses and consumers. Over the last decade, many top retailers moved manufacturing from China to Vietnam to avoid high tariffs, making the country a critical part of the apparel and footwear supply chain. Price increases for consumers are now expected. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lord David Lipsey, a prominent Labour peer and former journalist, has died at the age of 77 after a swimming accident in the River Wye in Powys, Wales.

          <p>Retailers in Germany are facing record losses from shoplifting, with an estimated €4.95 billion worth of goods stolen in 2024, a 3% increase from the previous year. A study by Germany's Retail Institute (EHI) indicates that a significant portion of this theft is from organized groups, which now account for one-third of the losses. Criminologists suggest that many of these incidents are "poverty crimes," committed by people with no money, though others argue opportunistic theft is also a major factor. Retailers are reportedly passing the costs of theft and increased security on to consumers through higher prices.</p>

However, the Trump administration has ordered a review of this regulation, and gun rights advocates are pursuing further legal challenges.

The healthcare and social assistance sector also saw significant growth, adding over 58,000 jobs. In contrast, the federal government workforce shrank by 7,000 positions, reflecting ongoing job-cutting initiatives. While this government-led growth helped the overall numbers exceed expectations, analysts caution that such strong public-sector hiring may not be sustainable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American televangelist Jimmy Swaggart, whose fiery preaching style built a global ministry that reportedly earned $150 million annually, has died at 90. His career spectacularly imploded after two sex scandals in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the first of which prompted a tearful on-air confession. A Biblical literalist from rural Louisiana, Swaggart's ministry began on street corners and grew to include a 7,000-seat church, a TV studio broadcasting to 140 countries, and a massive mail-order business. Despite his fall from grace, he continued preaching as an independent minister, with his son eventually taking over the ministry.</p>

The job growth, which surpassed economists' predictions, was largely driven by hiring in the government and healthcare sectors. These strong figures indicate a resilient economy, even amidst uncertainty from trade policy and potential tariffs. The robust report likely gives the Federal Reserve justification to maintain its current interest rate policy, holding off on cuts despite pressure from the White House.

While high-yield savings accounts currently offer slightly higher variable rates, calculations show they would earn only marginally more than fixed-rate CDs over terms of 18 months to three years. Given the high probability of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut later this year, locking in a competitive CD rate now could prove to be the more lucrative long-term strategy, as savings account rates are expected to fall.

          <p>Ukraine has reportedly killed Major General Mikhail Gudkov, the deputy commander of Russia's navy, in a missile strike on the Russian city of Kursk. This significant military success comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visits Denmark to discuss defense cooperation and EU relations. The visit is overshadowed by the Trump administration's recent pause on some U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine, a move that has caused alarm in Kyiv. Meanwhile, President Trump announced he would be speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin by phone, adding another layer of complexity to the geopolitical situation.</p>

          <h2>Sean 'Diddy' Combs Awaits Sentencing After Conviction on Prostitution-Related Charges</h2>

          <p>Music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs is awaiting sentencing after a federal jury found him guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. While he was acquitted of more serious charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering, he was denied bail and remains in detention ahead of his sentencing, which is proposed for October 2025. Each count carries a maximum of 10 years in prison, though legal experts believe his final sentence will likely be much lower. Prosecutors are expected to argue for a sentence of over five years, while the defense has suggested a range closer to two years.</p>

          <p>Four people have been remanded in custody after being charged in connection with a break-in at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, where two military Voyager aircraft were damaged. The suspects, aged 22 to 35, face charges of conspiracy to commit criminal damage and entering a prohibited place. The pro-Palestinian group Palestine Action claimed responsibility for the incident, which involved spraying the planes with red paint and causing an estimated £7 million in damage. The case is being treated as having a "terrorist connection," and a security review has been launched across all UK military bases.</p>
