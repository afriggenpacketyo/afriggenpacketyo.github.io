          <p>Grace Chambers, a 97-year-old from Belfast, has become Europe's oldest person to complete 250 Parkruns, achieving the milestone at a 5k event in Ormeau Park. This accomplishment is particularly notable as it comes just four weeks after she had a heart stent fitted. Having only begun running at age 88 after it was suggested during a rehabilitation program, Chambers has become a beloved local figure. Her dedication, which saw her continue running solo during the COVID-19 pandemic, exemplifies her remarkable resilience and passion for the community event.</p>

The MPs are collaborating with Doctors without Borders to facilitate the process, urging that evacuations be based solely on clinical need.

          <p>A meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, has ended without a formal agreement to end the war in Ukraine. Despite Trump describing the talks as having made "great progress," he conceded that they "didn't get there" on a final deal. Putin reiterated his position that the "root causes of the conflict" must be addressed, implying demands for Ukraine to cede territory and abandon its NATO aspirations. The summit, which lasted less than three hours, concluded without the leaders taking questions or attending a planned working lunch, indicating significant unresolved issues remain.</p>

The announcement came after what Zelenskyy described as a "long, substantive conversation" with Trump, which also included European leaders. This upcoming meeting aims to discuss the details of ending the war with Russia, signaling a direct diplomatic follow-up to the talks between Trump and Putin. Trump also posted on social media that the consensus was to pursue a direct peace agreement rather than a temporary ceasefire.</p>

          <p>The press office of California Governor Gavin Newsom has been mocking President Donald Trump on social media by mimicking his distinct, all-caps writing style. Following the Alaska summit, Newsom's team posted messages calling Trump "TOTAL LOW ENERGY" and accusing him of fleeing the press conference with Vladimir Putin. The posts also sarcastically referenced Newsom's own political maneuvers regarding redistricting maps, framing them as a move that has terrified Trump. This trolling tactic represents an unconventional and direct form of political sparring between the prominent Democratic governor and the Republican president.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's imposition of steep 50% tariffs on Brazil is causing concern among New York coffee shop owners, who anticipate significant price increases for consumers. As Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer, the tariffs are expected to inflate the cost of beans, squeezing the already slim profit margins of small businesses. Some cafes have already raised prices and fear for their long-term viability if the tariffs persist. The policy also affects other coffee-producing nations and imported goods, contributing to rising costs that force consumers to reconsider their daily purchases.</p>

          <p>Across the United States, the cost of electricity has surged more than twice as fast as general inflation over the past year, placing a significant financial burden on households, particularly during the summer. Factors driving the price hikes include increased demand from power-intensive AI data centers and the rising cost of natural gas, a primary fuel for power generation. With one in six households already struggling to pay their energy bills, consumer advocates worry about the impact on low-income families. The situation highlights the growing tension between grid modernization needs and affordability for everyday Americans.</p>

For three consecutive months, China has been trimming its holdings of U.S. Treasuries, which are now at their lowest level since 2009.

For Ukrainians, the outcome is seen as a major disappointment, as the lack of a deal means the conflict will continue unabated.

Third, Putin reiterated maximalist demands as preconditions for peace, while Trump avoided mentioning Ukraine or a ceasefire in his own remarks.
