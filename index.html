This year's installation, "In Search of Us," includes 11 projects addressing humanity's impacts, from AI to climate change and war. "Fragile Home" uses mixed reality to recreate a bombarded Ukrainian home, while "Scent" is a cinematic game where the player is a dog guiding souls. "AI & Me: The Confessional and AI Ego" analyzes participants using AI, offering a snarky assessment of their personality and goals, while "Uncharted" combines dance, spoken word, and visualizations of symbols to celebrate pan-African language and storytelling. The exhibits run through June 29.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has named eight new advisors to the CDC's vaccine recommendations committee, replacing the previous 17 members. Kennedy's picks circumvented the usual CDC vetting process and include individuals who have criticized vaccine recommendations and questioned their safety. Among the appointees are Dr. Robert Malone, who has spread misinformation about mRNA vaccines, and Dr. Martin Kulldorff, who co-authored the Great Barrington Declaration criticizing COVID-19 restrictions. The panel's recommendations are influential as they directly impact federal policies and insurance coverage for vaccines.</p>

          <p>Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky has stated that the White House rescinded his family's invitation to the congressional picnic due to his opposition to President Trump's budget bill. Paul believes he is the only senator to be uninvited, viewing the action as "incredibly petty" and immature. He had planned to bring his wife, son, daughter-in-law, and grandson to the event, but was informed they were no longer welcome when he tried to claim their tickets. Paul has criticized the budget bill for raising the debt ceiling and accused the White House of running a "paid influencer campaign" against him.</p>

Trump's initial comments suggested a harsh response to any protesters, but Leavitt emphasized that security measures were proactive and aimed at protecting parade participants and spectators.

PepsiCo Foods U.S., the parent company, confirmed the closure and stated it is offering pay and benefits to affected employees. The closure is part of a broader pattern of PepsiCo facility shutdowns amid declining snack sales, as the company focuses on "right-sizing the cost" of its snacks division, while warehouse, distribution, fleet, and transportation services will continue at the location.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has stated that he regrets some of his social media posts about President Donald Trump, admitting that "they went too far." This follows Trump's indication of openness to reconciliation in a recent interview, despite their previous public fallout after Musk stepped back from a White House role and criticized Trump's tax bill. Musk had previously claimed, without evidence, that Trump was linked to Jeffrey Epstein in unreleased government files, leading to a heated exchange where Trump threatened to cancel Musk's government contracts. Musk appears to have deleted many of his posts over the weekend.</p>

Khalil, who has not been charged with a crime, had been deemed a threat to US foreign policy by secretary of state, Marco Rubio, prompting federal authorities to detain him in March. Despite his latest order, Farbiarz did note that Khalil can still remain in custody on the basis of federal officialsâ€™ claims that Khalil inaccurately filled out his green card application.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is preparing for the arrival of Marines as California sues to halt military involvement in response to immigration enforcement protests. Downtown Los Angeles experienced its first overnight curfew since the protests began, following incidents of looting and vandalism. The role of the military, including 4,000 federalized National Guard troops and 700 Marines, remains unclear, with legal experts questioning their authority to act as police. The Marines are reportedly undergoing civil disturbance training, and California has asked a federal court to block the government from using troops outside of federal property.</p>

          <p>Crude oil futures increased by over 4% due to escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran, fueled by President Trump's skepticism about reaching a nuclear deal. The U.S. is preparing to evacuate non-essential personnel from its embassy in Baghdad, and the UK Maritime Trade Operations warned of potential military escalation in the region. Iran's defense minister stated that U.S. bases in the region are within reach of the Islamic Republic's military. Trump expressed diminished confidence in securing a nuclear agreement with Iran, although he asserted that Iran will not acquire nuclear weapons.</p>

The resolution aims to quash the countryâ€™s most aggressive attempt to phase out gas-powered cars, along with policies curbing tailpipe emissions and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks. This action is the latest in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and California over various issues, including environmental regulations. California officials plan to sue, contending that the federal government's actions are illegal, but the move is applauded by the trucking and gas station industries.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's clash with President Trump over immigration enforcement efforts presents both opportunities and risks for the governor. Newsom accused Trump of a "brazen abuse of power" in a televised address, positioning himself as a defender of California against federal overreach. Trump has criticized Newsom's leadership and threatened to cut off federal aid to California. While the confrontation offers Newsom a chance to elevate his national profile, it also requires him to effectively defend his state, and his political ambitions are on the line.</p>

Newsom's clear message and unexpected delivery have garnered significant attention, potentially positioning him as a leader against authoritarianism. By calling out the danger of violent protests while advocating for peaceful resistance, Newsom has placed Trump in a challenging position. The success of this strategy depends on whether the military or protesters are perceived as the aggressors in Los Angeles, which could influence public support.</p>

          <p>Egg prices for consumers have fallen to a five-month low in May, dropping 11% from April to $4.55 per dozen, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The price decrease is attributed to the receding effects of a years-long avian flu outbreak and a seasonal softening in demand as people shift to consuming more meat and grilling outdoors. While egg prices have declined for two consecutive months, they remain elevated compared to the previous year. Experts caution that the bird flu outbreak is not yet entirely contained and continues to impact the industry, but consumer relief is likely to continue in the short term.</p>
