          <p>Organizers of the Tomorrowland electronic dance music festival in Belgium have confirmed the event will go ahead, despite a major fire destroying its main stage. The blaze occurred just days before the festival was scheduled to begin, with 400,000 attendees expected over two weekends. While no one was injured, the incident has cast a subdued mood over the event, but organizers are working on contingency plans to ensure the festival continues with its 14 other stages.</p>

          <p>Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland, a major producer of high-fructose corn syrup, fell after former President Donald Trump announced that Coca-Cola had agreed to switch to real cane sugar for its U.S. products. While Coca-Cola's response was noncommittal, the announcement caused a significant premarket drop in ADM's stock. The Corn Refiners Association warned the move could cost American jobs and increase reliance on foreign sugar, highlighting the economic ripple effects of such corporate policy shifts.

          <p>Morgan Geyser, one of two girls involved in the 2014 "Slender Man" stabbing, has been granted conditional release from a Wisconsin psychiatric hospital. Geyser, now 22, was committed after she and a friend stabbed a classmate 19 times to appease the fictional internet character. The judge's decision comes after expert testimony that Geyser, diagnosed with early-onset schizophrenia, has made significant progress and does not present a future risk. The case originally drew widespread attention for its bizarre motive and the young age of those involved.</p>

          <p>A new book by New York Times correspondent Michael Grynbaum, titled "Empire of the Elite," examines the fall of the influential publishing company Condé Nast. The book explores how the media dynasty, which once dictated American taste through magazines like Vogue and The New Yorker, struggled to adapt to the digital age and the rise of social media influencers. It details the company's lavish spending, razor-thin profit margins, and its eventual decline from a cultural gatekeeper to a fraction of its former self.</p>

          <p>British Member of Parliament Diane Abbott has been suspended from the Labour Party following controversial comments she made regarding racism. The suspension, which means she will now sit as an independent MP, is pending an investigation into her remarks. The controversy stems from an interview where she reiterated views from a 2023 letter suggesting that prejudice against Jewish, Irish, and Traveller people is not the same as racism based on skin color. Abbott had previously been suspended for the original letter but was readmitted to the party shortly before the last election.</p>

          <p>An Idaho judge has lifted the restrictive gag order in the case of Bryan Kohberger, who recently pleaded guilty to the murders of four University of Idaho students. The decision follows a request from a coalition of news organizations, arguing that the order was no longer necessary to ensure a fair trial since Kohberger avoided trial with his plea. While the judge agreed to lift the order on public discussion, he denied a motion to unseal case documents until after sentencing, citing the need to protect the integrity of the final legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>A national debate is escalating over whether federal immigration agents should be permitted to wear masks during enforcement operations. The Department of Homeland Security reports an 830% surge in attacks on ICE agents since January, linking it to doxxing incidents where agents' personal information is posted online. While Democrats in several states and Congress are pushing legislation to ban masks for identification purposes, the DHS is calling for federal prosecution of doxxing.

While acknowledging that some fossil fuel subsidies remain, the article points out they are vastly smaller than those for green energy.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has officially terminated $4 billion in federal funds allocated for California's high-speed rail project. In a letter, the Federal Railroad Administration stated the California High-Speed Rail Authority had breached its agreements and demonstrated an "inability to complete" its goals. The project, which has faced years of delays and cost overruns, was originally intended to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco. California Governor Gavin Newsom has called the move an "illegal action" and stated the state will explore all options to fight the decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A study by the motoring group RAC has revealed that over half of the UK's busiest airports have increased their "kiss-and-fly" fees for drivers dropping off passengers. Eleven out of 20 major airports raised their prices, with hubs like Gatwick and Stansted now charging £7 for a brief stop. The RAC contrasts this with major European airports, where such fees are rare. Airports defend the charges as necessary for managing congestion and funding sustainable transport initiatives, while all offer free alternatives further from the terminals.</p>
