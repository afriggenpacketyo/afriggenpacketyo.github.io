          <h2>Trump Authorizes National Guard Deployment to Chicago Amid Protests</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has authorized the deployment of 300 National Guard troops to Chicago, citing a need to protect federal officers and assets. This move follows weeks of threats as part of his crackdown on immigration, drawing criticism for its authoritarian tactics. The decision comes after a federal judge temporarily blocked a similar deployment in Portland, Oregon. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, condemned the deployment as "outrageous and un-American," disputing Trump's claims of rampant crime.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking President Trump's plan to deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland for at least 14 days. Judge Karin Immergut ruled that Trump's justification for federalizing the Guard did not meet the high legal bar required without the governor's approval, stating that protests were not "significantly violent or disruptive" enough. The decision covers 200 soldiers and is expected to be appealed by the Trump administration. Oregon officials, including Governor Tina Kotek and Attorney General Dan Rayfield, celebrated the ruling as a victory for state sovereignty and constitutional law.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury is considering minting a new one-dollar coin for the nation's 250th anniversary, potentially featuring President Donald Trump. A draft design shows Trump's face on one side and him pumping his fist after a 2024 near-assassination attempt on the reverse, with the words "Fight, Fight, Fight." The Circulating Collectible Coin Redesign Act of 2020 allows for such commemorative coins, but legal provisions typically prohibit living persons, especially sitting presidents, from appearing on U.S. currency. Congress could, however, provide an exception as it has in the past for similar historical anniversaries.</p>

However, an increasing number of market participants are warning of potential bubbles, particularly in credit markets, citing a Bank of America survey showing high investor overweighting and recent corporate bankruptcies due to large debt. Saxo Bank advises investors to diversify against instability. Meanwhile, the economic impact of pop star Taylor Swift, dubbed "Swiftonomics," continues to defy market anxieties with her latest album release. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from transferring underage migrants to adult detention centers upon turning 18. Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that this new policy violates a prior 2021 order preventing such transfers. Migrant minors are typically housed by the Department of Health and Human Services, not ICE detention facilities. The administration is also reportedly offering a $2,500 stipend for voluntary departure, a move critics argue coerces vulnerable youth into abandoning asylum claims.</p>

          <p>Fiji is experiencing one of the world's fastest-growing HIV epidemics, with cases soaring elevenfold in the past five years, prompting the health minister to declare an outbreak. The surge is primarily attributed to intravenous drug use, unsafe sex, needle sharing, and a practice called "bluetoothing," where blood is shared among users for a cheaper high. Experts also cite a drastic shortage of needle-syringe programs and a lack of education as contributing factors. The crisis highlights significant challenges for the small Pacific nation's healthcare resources and public health efforts.</p>

Scientists confirm this rapid loss is not natural and is directly attributable to human-caused global warming.

Immunologists explain that packed environments, shared living spaces, and late-night socializing contribute to rapid spread. Compounding this, students' immune systems are often compromised by stress, lack of sleep, poor diet, and alcohol consumption. While typically not serious, the body's initial exposure to many new viruses, coupled with a rundown state, makes students particularly susceptible to prolonged or sequential illnesses.</p>

          <p>Thousands gathered in Tel Aviv's Hostage Square to celebrate the potential ceasefire deal with Hamas, though many expressed a mix of hope and skepticism. Protesters, some wearing Trump masks to thank the U.S. President for brokering the deal, demanded the return of all hostages and an end to the conflict. They voiced frustration with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, whom they accuse of prolonging the war. Despite Netanyahu's claims of an impending "great achievement," many feared he might still sabotage the agreement, underscoring deep public desire for peace and hostage repatriation.</p>

          <p>A recent explosion and fire at Chevron’s El Segundo refinery, which injured at least one worker and caused widespread concern, has brought its history of safety and environmental violations into focus. Environmental advocates lament that the federal government shutdown has furloughed key regulatory agencies like OSHA and the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Mitigation Board, potentially hindering a thorough investigation into the incident. This lack of federal oversight, coupled with proposed budget cuts, raises fears that the true cause may never be known, endangering workers and surrounding communities.</p>

          <p>An FBI agent has reportedly been suspended for insubordination after refusing to participate in a "perp walk" for former FBI Director James Comey, deeming the plan inappropriate. Comey was indicted on federal charges days after President Trump publicly called for investigations into political adversaries. FBI leadership allegedly discussed using "large, beefy" agents in Kevlar vests for Comey's public escort to his arraignment, a practice common in high-profile cases. Comey denies the charges of lying to Congress and obstructing proceedings, expressing confidence in the judicial system.</p>

          <p>U.S. National Parks are grappling with limited operations and potential damage as the federal government shutdown continues into its fourth day. Many parks are either closed, operating with reduced staff, or relying on state funds and donations to maintain basic services. The lack of robust staffing has raised concerns about safety, vandalism, and sanitation, with past shutdowns leading to significant ecological harm, such as in Joshua Tree National Park. Advocacy groups are calling for complete closures of understaffed parks to prevent further irreparable damage to these natural treasures.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of additional police officers have been deployed to Manchester streets to reassure communities following Thursday's deadly synagogue attack. Assistant Chief Constable Chris Sykes confirmed officers are working extended shifts, with support from other forces, also factoring in the upcoming Conservative Party Conference. The deployment follows an incident where Jihad Al-Shamie killed two Jewish men and injured three others outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue. Police also questioned the appropriateness of a pro-Palestine march taking place in the city center during this sensitive time.</p>

          <p>Two Jewish men, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, were killed, and three others seriously injured, in a car ramming and stabbing attack outside a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur. The attacker, 35-year-old British citizen Jihad Al-Shamie, was shot dead by armed police, with one victim tragically hit by police gunfire. Al-Shamie, who had a non-counter-terror criminal history including a recent arrest for sexual assault, is believed to have been influenced by extreme Islamist ideology. Worshippers and security staff bravely prevented the attacker from entering the synagogue, with the incident declared a terror attack.</p>

Despite this, the show featured performances from the British Royal Air Force, Canadian Armed Forces, and historical American aircraft. The event maintained a strong patriotic spirit on the ground, but the missing U.S. military presence underscored the tangible impacts of the congressional budget deadlock.</p>

          <p>Liverpool, the reigning Premier League champions, suffered a 2-1 defeat to Chelsea, marking their third consecutive loss and causing them to fall from the top of the table. This latest defeat, sealed by Estevao Willian's 95th-minute strike, highlights a problematic trend of conceding late goals, reversing their earlier season reliance on dramatic last-minute wins. Manager Arne Slot noted the "fine margins" not being in their favor, while pundits like Wayne Rooney observed a lack of "bite and determination." The team, despite significant new signings, appears unbalanced and is struggling to regain its championship form.</p>
