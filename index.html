          <p>Japan's long-standing ruling coalition has dissolved after the junior partner, Komeito, withdrew its support for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). This move significantly undermines LDP leader Sanae Takaichi's path to becoming the country's first female prime minister, as her parliamentary majority has now vanished. Komeito cited the LDP's failure to adequately address a persistent political slush-fund scandal as the primary reason for its departure from the alliance. The collapse introduces major uncertainty into Japanese politics just as a leadership transition was expected to be a mere formality, leaving the nation's immediate political future in question.</p>

          <p>Rhun ap Iorwerth, the leader of Plaid Cymru, is set to declare his party's readiness to supplant Welsh Labour as the governing party in the next Senedd election. In his annual conference speech, he will position Plaid Cymru as a government-in-waiting, promising "new energy and new ideas" for Wales. For the first time in a century, Labour's dominance in Welsh politics appears vulnerable, with recent polls showing Plaid Cymru and Reform UK as significant challengers. Ap Iorwerth aims to frame the election as a choice between his party and Reform UK, urging voters to back Plaid Cymru to prevent a Farage-led victory.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has reportedly reduced the list of potential candidates for the next Federal Reserve chair from eleven to five following a series of in-depth interviews. The remaining contenders include current Fed officials Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, as well as Kevin Hassett, Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock's Rick Rieder. Bessent is said to be seeking a candidate open to new ideas on monetary policy and who is willing to review the Fed's structure and mission. The final decision will be made by President Trump, who may nominate the chosen individual as a Fed governor first before elevating them to chair. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following recent anti-government protests in Tbilisi, Georgia's Interior Ministry has arrested 13 individuals, adding to the five rally organizers already detained on charges of attempting a government overthrow. The ruling Georgian Dream party has labeled the unrest a coup attempt, with the Prime Minister warning of prosecutions and accusing the EU of interference. Civil society groups express growing concern that the government is using the events, including a call by some protesters to storm the presidential palace, as a pretext for broader repression of dissent. The political opposition is described as being in a state of disarray, potentially clearing the way for the government to ban opposing parties.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Singapore have launched an investigation into Megaspeed, an AI computing firm and a customer of Nvidia, over allegations it helped Chinese companies bypass U.S. restrictions on advanced chip exports. The probe runs parallel to a similar investigation by the U.S. Commerce Department, raising concerns about the effectiveness of American export controls and Nvidia's ability to monitor its supply chain. Nvidia stated it has engaged with the U.S. government and its own inquiry found no evidence of product diversion. The case highlights the ongoing challenge of preventing high-tech components from reaching China, where a black market for smuggled chips has reportedly emerged.</p>

          <p>A significant change to 401(k) plans, enacted by the Secure 2.0 Act, will soon alter how high-income workers make catch-up contributions. Starting in 2026, individuals earning more than $145,000 from their employer in the prior year must make their catch-up contributions to an after-tax Roth account, eliminating the option for a traditional pretax deduction. This shift means higher earners will lose the upfront tax break on these extra savings, though withdrawals in retirement will be tax-free. Financial experts advise that affected workers should consult with advisors now to plan their contribution strategy for the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have advanced to the National League Championship Series after defeating the Philadelphia Phillies, achieving the win without what players and management consider to be their best performance. Despite a dominant 20-6 record over the last five weeks, key players like Shohei Ohtani struggled offensively in the division series, and the team's batting average was a modest .199. Catcher Will Smith noted that the team has "another gear," expecting stars like Ohtani to rebound strongly in the next round. The victory, largely attributed to strong pitching, suggests the team has significant untapped potential heading into the final four.</p>

          <p>The European Commission is formally requesting information from four major U.S. tech platforms—Apple, Google, Snapchat, and YouTube—regarding their measures to protect children online. The EU executive branch suspects that current practices are insufficient to meet the high standards of privacy, security, and safety required by its Digital Services Act (DSA). Concerns include easily circumvented age restrictions on YouTube, potential access to gambling apps on app stores, and the sale of drugs on Snapchat. If the platforms are found to be in breach of EU rules, they could face substantial fines of up to 6% of their global turnover.</p>

          <p>The appointment of Bari Weiss, founder of The Free Press, as editor in chief of CBS News has sparked widespread debate and analysis across the media landscape. Weiss, who famously resigned from The New York Times citing an "illiberal environment," will now report directly to Paramount chairman David Ellison. This article explores competing theories about the move: one suggests it's a strategic alignment with the Trump administration, while another posits it's a "Reconciliation Gambit" to bring ideological balance back to a legacy media outlet. The author frames her hiring as a significant experiment to see if a prominent heterodox voice can successfully reshape and perhaps save a traditional news organization.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Genevieve Shore, the executive chair of Premiership Women's Rugby (PWR), has characterized the proposed R360 breakaway series as a short-term "showpiece" rather than a legitimate league. She argues that its four-team format, offering only a limited number of games, would not adequately prepare players for the demands of international rugby. This criticism comes after eight major rugby nations announced that players signing with R360 would be barred from their national teams. While acknowledging the financial appeal for players, Shore contrasts R360's profit-driven model with the PWR's investment in grassroots development and player pathways throughout the sport.</p>

          <p>Actress Alex Kingston, known for her roles in 'ER' and 'Doctor Who', has revealed that she was diagnosed with womb cancer in 2024. The 62-year-old star, currently a contestant on 'Strictly Come Dancing', underwent a hysterectomy and radiation therapy, which concluded late last year. Kingston stated she had initially dismissed symptoms like bloating and aches as signs of aging before seeking medical help after finding blood in her urine. She said the experience motivated her to join the dance competition, embracing the philosophy that "life is too short," and is now urging other women not to ignore potential health warning signs.</p>

          <p>Investigators in Germany have searched the homes and offices of 17 Frankfurt police officers who are accused of assault, obstruction of justice, and wrongful prosecution. The probe centers on allegations that six men were physically harmed during or after their arrests between February and April, with officers potentially filing false charges to conceal their actions. Approximately 150 state police officers participated in the raids, seizing electronic devices for analysis. Prosecutors have emphasized that, at present, there are no indications of any extremist motives behind the alleged misconduct as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>The recent bankruptcy of First Brands, a major manufacturer of auto parts, has caused significant anxiety on Wall Street over the stability of the private debt market. The company, which filed for bankruptcy with liabilities between $10 billion and $50 billion, reportedly used opaque, off-balance-sheet financing to borrow against its invoices. This collapse has spooked investors, who fear it may signal broader, hidden risks within the lightly regulated "shadow banking" sector. The concern is that other companies may be using similar complex financial arrangements, potentially leading to a contagion effect that could impact the wider financial system.

          <p>A federal appeals court is hearing arguments regarding President Trump's authority to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland. The case follows a lower court's ruling that temporarily blocked the deployment, which the president described as necessary to quell protests that he has characterized as violent. The state of Oregon argues the president's depiction of the situation is "untethered from reality," while administration lawyers maintain the troops are needed to protect federal property. The outcome of this legal challenge could set a significant precedent for presidential power over state National Guard units for domestic law enforcement purposes.</p>

After inheriting it, she used the marble tablet as a garden decoration and forgot it when she moved. The new homeowners, an anthropologist and her husband, recognized its significance, leading to its identification as a missing headstone from a museum in Civitavecchia, Italy, and initiating its repatriation.</p>

The piece calls for a candidate who can communicate bold ideas, focus on substantive issues like housing and healthcare, and engage voters directly through modern platforms.

          <p>The recent ceasefire agreement in Gaza, while a moment of relief, presents substantial political risks for both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas. For Netanyahu, the deal falls short of his promise to completely vanquish Hamas and forces him to accept terms that contradict his long-standing political positions, potentially fracturing his ruling coalition. For Hamas, the group faces an enraged Gazan populace devastated by a war many view as a reckless gamble, making its future role in governance uncertain. While both sides claim victory in the hostage and prisoner exchange, the long-term political fallout could threaten the survival of their respective leaderships.</p>

Her suburb has become a focal point due to protests outside an ICE facility, but she describes the community as calm.
