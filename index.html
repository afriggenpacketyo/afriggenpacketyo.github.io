          <p>U.S. startup airline Breeze Airways, founded by JetBlue's David Neeleman, is set to launch its first international flights in early 2025. The new seasonal routes will connect several U.S. cities, including Norfolk and Charleston, with popular vacation destinations like Cancun, Montego Bay, and Punta Cana. This expansion marks a significant milestone for the carrier, which began operations during the pandemic in May 2021 and recently received FAA certification for international travel. Breeze aims to continue its strategy of serving routes with limited competition, offering introductory fares as low as $99 one way.</p>

          <p>Indian authorities have imposed a curfew and banned large gatherings in the Ladakh region following violent clashes that resulted in the deaths of four protesters. The demonstrations were part of a growing movement demanding greater autonomy and constitutional protections for the Himalayan territory, which is governed directly by New Delhi. Protesters clashed with police, allegedly setting fire to a government vehicle and a political party office, leading to a police response that included tear gas and live fire. The unrest highlights escalating tensions since Ladakh was separated from Indian-controlled Kashmir in 2019.</p>

          <p>First-time claims for unemployment benefits in the U.S. dropped to 218,000 for the week ending September 20, significantly below economists' expectations of 235,000. This data suggests that despite a recent slowdown in hiring, companies are still hesitant to lay off workers, providing a sign of underlying strength in the labor market. The report comes after the Federal Reserve cited rising employment risks as a reason for its recent interest rate cut. Other positive economic indicators were also released, including an upward revision of second-quarter GDP growth to 3.8% and a surprise increase in durable goods orders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has developed a new rechargeable hydride ion battery that they claim has up to six times the specific capacity of some conventional lithium-ion batteries. The breakthrough, published in the journal Nature, utilizes a rare earth-based electrolyte that harnesses negatively charged hydrogen ions (hydride ions) to store and release energy. This fundamentally different electrochemical process could offer new opportunities for clean energy storage and conversion. To demonstrate its practical application, the team constructed a multilayered battery that successfully powered an LED light, signaling its potential for use in electronic devices.</p>

          <p>Student loan borrowers are encountering significant difficulties with the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, one of the few remaining paths to loan forgiveness. The Department of Education has paused debt discharges under IBR, citing the need for system adjustments following court rulings that blocked the Biden-era SAVE plan, with a fix not expected until winter 2025. Furthermore, advocates report that applications for IBR are being wrongfully denied based on an outdated "partial financial hardship" requirement that was eliminated by recent legislation. These issues are creating widespread frustration and eroding trust in the student loan system.</p>

Investigators also dismantled 162 social media groups involved in the resale schemes and prevented hundreds of individuals from entering Anfield with suspicious tickets.

In a letter to CEO Bob Iger, the investors allege that the decision to suspend "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" was a response to political threats from federal regulators and broadcast affiliates, rather than a sound business decision in the interest of shareholders. They argue that the board may have breached its fiduciary duties by prioritizing political considerations, pointing to the significant drop in Disney's stock price following the suspension.</p>

Senior Labour figures like Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Housing Secretary Steve Reed downplayed the leadership talk, emphasizing their focus on governing. Burnham, a former cabinet minister who has unsuccessfully run for leader twice before, has recently outlined his policy vision, which he describes as "aspirational socialism."</p>

The attack, which occurred at the end of August, shut down JLR's IT networks and has suspended operations at its three UK factories until at least October. There are growing fears that smaller suppliers who rely heavily on JLR's business could face bankruptcy without assistance. Among the ideas being considered are government-backed loans or a scheme where the government would purchase component parts to maintain cash flow for the affected firms.</p>

          <p>The Kansas City Chiefs' offense has become methodical and less explosive, transforming star quarterback Patrick Mahomes from an irrepressible, creative force into a player who must grind for every yard. After starting the season 1-2, the team's struggles are attributed to a diminished roster, including a lack of a strong running game and injuries to key wide receivers. As defenses have adapted to limit deep passes, the Chiefs have adopted a more conservative, short-pass style that looks like hard work. This article suggests that while Mahomes is still capable of greatness, the team's current joyless and inefficient approach has made watching him play a duller experience.</p>

          <p>The thoroughbred racehorse market is experiencing a surge, with the Keeneland September Yearling Sale grossing a record $531.7 million, a significant increase from the previous year. Breeders and investors attribute the boom to tax breaks renewed in President Trump's recent "big beautiful bill," particularly the "bonus depreciation" rule. This tax incentive allows businesses to write off 100% of a racehorse's purchase price in the first year, making the highly speculative investment more attractive. The strong sales reflect increased confidence in the market, drawing in more buyers and driving record prices for top yearlings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of 46 House Democrats, led by Representative Ro Khanna, is sending a letter to the Trump administration urging the United States to formally recognize a Palestinian state. The letter argues that acknowledging Palestinian rights is essential for protecting their lives and aligns with recent calls from key U.S. allies like France, the UK, and Canada. The lawmakers advocate for a framework that also guarantees Israel's security, including the disarmament of Hamas. This move highlights a growing sentiment within the Democratic party that contrasts sharply with the Trump administration's position, which has called recognition a "reward for terrorism."</p>

          <p>Ayman Soliman, an Egyptian imam and hospital chaplain from Cincinnati, has been released after being detained by ICE for 72 days at the Butler County jail in Ohio. Soliman, who fled Egypt in 2014, was detained during a routine check-in over alleged terror-related charges from Egypt, which he denies, and faced the threat of deportation. He described his detention, which included five days in isolation, as traumatizing and dehumanizing. His release is seen by advocates as a significant victory against the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, highlighting the plight of many others still detained under similar circumstances.</p>

          <p>A Paris court has sentenced former French President Nicolas Sarkozy to five years in jail after finding him guilty of criminal conspiracy related to illicit campaign funding from the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. Prosecutors alleged that Sarkozy's 2007 presidential campaign accepted millions in illegal funds in exchange for political favors, though the court acquitted him of directly benefiting from the financing. The 70-year-old, who has consistently maintained his innocence and claims the case is politically motivated, said the verdict was a grave blow to the rule of law and has vowed to appeal. The sentence is a landmark ruling for a former French head of state.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly close to finalizing a deal that would transfer control of TikTok's U.S. operations to a consortium of American investors, avoiding a full ban of the popular app. The proposed agreement would see companies like Oracle and Fox Corporation take control, with TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, leasing the app's algorithm to the new U.S. entity. This development follows a reversal by President Trump, who previously sought to ban the app but has since delayed the action after his campaign saw success on the platform. The deal structure aims to satisfy national security concerns outlined in a 2024 law.</p>

          <p>A cultural commentator argues that the most significant religious revolution today is occurring online, as faith is increasingly mediated through digital platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Twitch. This shift, creating a "Cyber Ummah" for Muslims and similar digital congregations for other faiths, is decentralizing religious authority away from traditional institutions and clerics. While critics fear this leads to fragmentation and extremism, the article suggests it is a form of renewal, empowering individual believers to reinterpret and engage with their faith in a global, real-time conversation. This democratization of religion is presented not as a decline, but as the latest chapter in the historical evolution of faith traditions.</p>

The move comes days after two Israeli military personnel were killed by a Jordanian gunman near the crossing and follows international recognition of Palestinian statehood by several countries.

The article praises Kimmel for his refusal to back down upon his return, contrasting his stance with the "chickenshit" behavior of corporate leaders, media owners, and politicians who have abandoned principles of free speech to avoid discomfort. It suggests these individual acts of surrender collectively embolden authoritarianism by creating a false sense of invincibility.
