        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's consumer prices have fallen for the fourth consecutive month in May, signaling persistent deflationary pressures due to weak domestic demand and price wars in the automotive sector. The consumer price index (CPI) decreased by 0.1% year-on-year, slightly better than analysts' expectations, while factory-gate prices also saw a significant decline. Despite some stimulus measures, domestic consumption remains insufficient to boost prices, and falling property prices are adding to the downward pressure. Policymakers are being urged to implement more forceful and targeted stimulus measures to stimulate consumption as the country faces a challenging economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's export growth slowed in May, increasing by 4.8% year-on-year to $316.1 billion, which is below the expected 6.28% increase. Imports also fell by 3.4% year-on-year, contrasting with the predicted 0.7% rise. These figures indicate ongoing strains in China's manufacturing and trade sectors amid uncertainty over US tariffs. Despite the slowdown, China's trade surplus rose to $103.2 billion, up from $96.18 billion in April, suggesting that while trade faces challenges, the nation continues to maintain a significant trade balance.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing widespread protests following large-scale immigration enforcement operations, leading President Trump to deploy National Guard troops. Demonstrators clashed with law enforcement, resulting in injuries and arrests, while some protesters vandalized and set fire to Waymo vehicles. Governor Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory, and local officials urged peaceful demonstrations. The unrest stems from ICE operations that resulted in numerous arrests, sparking community fear and accusations of excessive force, as tensions rise between federal authorities and local communities.</p>

The proposal would increase the protected area from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 and is subject to a 12-week industry consultation. This move follows warnings from environmental advocates about the destructive impact of bottom trawling on the seabed. Pressure is also mounting for more countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty at the Ocean Conference in Nice, aiming to protect 30% of the ocean.</p>

          <h2>Rare Earth Minerals Key to US-China Trade Talks, Cramer Argues</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jim Cramer argues that the US lacks leverage in trade talks with China due to its reliance on China for rare earth minerals. He questions why the US did not secure its rare earth supply chain before engaging in a trade war. China controls most of the global rare earth production and refining capacity. Cramer suggests that the US needs a rare earth Manhattan Project to reduce its dependence and that the US may have to trade access to Nvidia's AI chips for access to rare earth minerals.

          <p>Energy firms in Britain are being paid substantial amounts to not provide power due to grid overload issues. Wind farms like Moray East and West are often compensated for turning down output because the grid lacks sufficient capacity to distribute the electricity. This system has cost the country over £500 million this year and could reach £8 billion annually by 2030. The government is considering regional pricing to improve efficiency, but the proposals have sparked debate and opposition within the energy industry.</p>

Daniel Clarke may have targeted "well over 81" vulnerable young people over a decade, according to detectives overseeing a major West Midlands Police investigation. The 29-year-old was jailed last month for offences against six children, but officers believe he could be one of the most prolific sex offenders of recent times.
