          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that President Trump's first 100 days have been marked by significant changes and strong support from his base, but also widespread concerns about his focus on tariffs and their impact on prices.

Most Americans believe Trump is making major changes, with Republicans viewing them positively and Democrats negatively.
