          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to the bone, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis followed an examination for urinary symptoms, revealing a high-grade cancer characterized by a Gleason score of 9. Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options, with his office noting the cancer appears hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management. Support has poured in from both sides of the aisle, including well wishes from former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as former President Barack Obama.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% in April, falling short of expectations and signaling ongoing concerns about consumption in the world's second-largest economy. Despite industrial output exceeding forecasts with a 6.1% increase, the National Bureau of Statistics acknowledged persistent external uncertainties and the need to bolster economic recovery. The urban unemployment rate eased slightly to 5.1%, even as trade tensions with the U.S. continue to evolve. Real estate investment saw a significant drag, falling 10.3% year-to-date, indicating continued challenges in the property sector.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by Moody's, coupled with worries about mounting government debt, is unsettling financial markets. The downgrade reflects concerns over fiscal deficits, growing debt costs, and a bill in Congress that would make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, potentially adding trillions to the federal debt. The move by Moody's means all three major rating agencies no longer consider the U.S. qualified for their top credit ratings, leading to declines in stock futures and weakening of the U.S. dollar. Analysts fear the downgrade could shake the safe-haven status of Treasury bonds, prompting investors to demand higher premiums for U.S. debt.</p>

          <p>An unfolding corruption investigation involving staff at the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) is raising concerns about oversight in the defense sector. Detentions have been made in Belgium and the Netherlands regarding "possible irregularities" in ammunition and drone contracts, with allegations of information passed to defense contractors and money laundering through consultancy companies. The investigation, initiated by NATO itself, extends to Italy, Spain, and the U.S. This probe serves as a reminder of the importance of transparency and oversight as NATO countries increase defense spending amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>

The global market for these drugs is expected to expand in Asia, particularly in China and Japan, where penetration is low.

After negotiations, four conservative holdouts voted "present," allowing the bill to advance in the Budget Committee.

The bill now moves to the Rules Committee, but faces opposition from both conservatives seeking deeper cuts and moderates concerned about the impact on their districts.</p>

The imagery shows new tents, warehouses for military vehicles, renovated fighter jet shelters, and construction activity at a helicopter base. While Russia's troop presence remains limited due to its involvement in Ukraine, the expansion reflects Moscow's perception of a threat from NATO expansion, as Finland's 830-mile border now represents the alliance's longest contact line with Russia. Military analysts predict this area could become a hot spot, especially in the Arctic Circle.</p>

          <p>The ongoing Russian occupation of eastern regions in Ukraine mirrors the Soviet Union's past actions in Eastern Europe, marked by forced citizenship, property confiscation, and attacks on national identity. This pattern, reminiscent of Soviet-era oppression in countries like Poland and Lithuania, includes the use of filtration techniques, imprisonment, and severe torture. The author argues that Western Europe must recognize and address these historical parallels to understand the concerns of Russia's neighbors and ensure European security, emphasizing the need for a unified historical narrative that acknowledges the cruelty and consequences of Soviet occupation.</p>

          <p>Japan plans to implement pre-arrival screening for visa-free travelers by fiscal year 2028 to enhance efficiency and further boost inbound tourism. The system, modeled after the U.S. ESTA, will require travelers from visa-exempt countries to provide personal and travel information before arrival. This will allow the Immigration Services Agency to examine traveler data in advance and deny boarding to those with criminal records or histories of illegal stays. The goal is to streamline immigration processes while maintaining security as Japan aims to attract 60 million foreign visitors by 2030.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, the liberal, pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, won the Romanian presidency after defeating right-wing nationalist George Simion. Simion's first-round victory earlier this month, fueled by anger over a previously annulled election, was ultimately overcome by Dan, who secured 54% of the vote. Dan campaigned on fighting corruption and supporting Ukraine, while Simion attacked the EU and called for cutting aid to Kyiv. The election reflects ongoing political turbulence in Romania, with voters broadly unhappy with mainstream parties.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones.

Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options, and supportive statements have been issued by President Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

          <p>Joe Biden's recent cancer diagnosis underscores concerns about his age and health, which were significant during his presidency. The diagnosis comes shortly after he left office and amid scrutiny over his mental and physical decline. This news may temper criticism of revelations about efforts to accommodate his declining health during his time in the White House. Despite the challenge, Biden's illness presents an opportunity to defend and burnish his presidential legacy, given his history of overcoming tragedy and adversity.</p>

          <p>Experts indicate that former President Joseph R. Biden’s prostate cancer diagnosis is serious, but recent advancements in diagnosing and treating the disease have improved survival rates. While the cancer has spread to his bones and is considered Stage 4, specialists emphasize that life expectancy is now measured in years, not months. The first line of treatment involves cutting off testosterone, and there have also been improvements in diagnosis with the use of more precise scans. Federal research funding, including Mr. Biden’s cancer moonshot effort, has largely contributed to this progress.</p>
