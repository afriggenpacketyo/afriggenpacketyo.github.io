          <p>Erik Menendez, one of two brothers convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, was denied parole in his first-ever hearing. The parole board cited multiple factors for their decision, including his behavior in prison such as possessing illegal cellphones, rather than the severity of the original crime. Despite support from some family members, the board determined he still poses an unreasonable risk to public safety and can be eligible for parole again in three years. His brother, Lyle Menendez, is scheduled for his own parole hearing.</p>

          <p>Meta has shut down a large Italian Facebook group named "Mia Moglie" (My Wife) where thousands of members shared intimate and non-consensual photos of women. The discovery of the group, which had approximately 32,000 members, has sparked widespread outrage and concern over online sexual exploitation and toxic masculinity. The incident has drawn comparisons to France's Pelicot case and has led to calls for stronger action against such online platforms, with Italian media reporting that over a thousand people have reported the group to cyber crime police.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded mixed as investors awaited Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's key speech for insights into the future of U.S. interest rates.

The cautious sentiment was influenced by a five-day slide in the U.S. S&P 500 and ongoing economic data releases, such as Japan's latest inflation figures, which showed prices remained above the central bank's target.

          <p>The online message board 4chan has stated it will not pay fines proposed by the UK's media regulator, Ofcom, for failing to comply with the Online Safety Act. A lawyer for the U.S.-based company argued that Ofcom's notices create no legal obligations in the United States and that American businesses do not surrender their First Amendment rights to foreign regulators. The case highlights the growing international conflict over internet regulation, with U.S. officials pushing back against what they see as extraterritorial overreach. Ofcom may resort to ordering ISPs to block UK access to the site.</p>

          <p>The UK government has issued new guidance for baby food manufacturers, urging them to reduce sugar and salt levels and to stop promoting snack products for infants under one year old. The guidelines also aim to restrict marketing claims that imply health benefits without scientific backing, following investigations that found some products were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients. Companies have been given 18 months to comply with the voluntary guidelines, with the government warning that "alternative measures" may be considered if they fail to make their products healthier.</p>

          <p>President Trump visited a U.S. Park Police facility in Washington D.C. to praise his administration's crackdown on crime in the city. During the event, he declared his takeover of the local police department a success and made unusual remarks about re-grassing the city's parks to resemble his golf courses. The initiative has involved deploying National Guard troops and federal agents across the city, which the administration claims has reduced crime, though local officials dispute the necessity and effectiveness of the federal surge. The visit was part of a broader effort to highlight the administration's focus on law and order.</p>

          <p>Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart U.S., said he was perplexed by the company's stock drop following what he described as an exceptionally strong quarterly report. Despite Walmart raising its full-year sales and earnings forecast, its shares fell, making it the biggest loser on the Dow for the day. Simon highlighted the retailer's ability to grow its top line, expand margins, and effectively manage the impact of tariffs as reasons for optimism. He suggested investors may have overreacted to a one-time earnings miss caused by non-systemic issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The global race to develop hypersonic missiles, which travel at over five times the speed of sound and are highly maneuverable, is accelerating, with China and Russia currently leading the field. These weapons pose a significant strategic challenge because their speed and unpredictable flight paths make them extremely difficult to detect and intercept with current defense systems. While the U.S. and UK are now investing heavily to catch up, they are considered behind after years of focusing on counter-terrorism. The proliferation of this technology is altering the dynamics of modern warfare.</p>

          <p>An active shooter alert that caused panic and a massive law enforcement response at Villanova University's law school was determined to be a hoax. The university's president condemned the incident, which occurred during a welcome mass for new students, as a "cruel hoax" that shook the community. No shooter, firearms, or injuries were found on campus after police conducted a thorough sweep of the area. The FBI and local authorities are now investigating the source of the false report, a practice known as "swatting."</p>

          <p>President Trump has voiced strong support for the Resolution Copper mine project, which would be built on a sacred Apache site in Arizona known as Oak Flat. His endorsement came after a federal appeals court issued a temporary stay, halting the transfer of the federal land to the multinational mining companies Rio Tinto and BHP. Trump met with mining executives and criticized the court's decision, emphasizing the project's economic benefits. The San Carlos Apache Tribe, which is fighting the project on religious freedom and environmental grounds, hailed the court's decision as a temporary victory.</p>
