          <h2>Target CEO Warns of Tariff Risks and Potential Price Increases</h2>

          <p>Target's CEO, Brian Cornell, has cautioned about the 'massive potential costs' stemming from tariffs, stating that the company would only consider raising prices as a 'very last resort' to protect American families' budgets. This warning follows similar concerns voiced by Walmart and Best Buy, indicating a widespread apprehension among major retailers regarding the impact of tariffs on consumer spending. Target reported a 2.8% drop in sales for the recent quarter, attributing it to consumer anxiety over tariffs and a boycott related to the company's DEI policy rollback. Cornell expressed concerns about declining consumer confidence and the potential impact of tariffs, even after a recent U.S.-China trade agreement reduced some levies, with the company forecasting continued sales pressures in the near term.</p>

          <p>The Chinese Foreign Ministry has accused President Donald Trump of undermining global stability by proceeding with the 'Golden Dome' missile defense shield program, urging the U.S. to abandon the project. According to Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the shield will be capable of intercepting missiles from any location, including space, and is estimated to cost $175 billion. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, stated that the shield will heighten the risk of space weaponization, sparking an arms race, and violating the Outer Space Treaty, which promotes the peaceful use of outer space. Mao emphasized that the project reflects an 'America First' approach that jeopardizes global security.</p>

          <p>Target has lowered its full-year sales outlook, citing weaker discretionary spending, consumer uncertainty regarding tariffs, and negative reactions to the company's rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. First-quarter sales fell nearly 3% compared to the previous year, missing Wall Street's expectations, with transactions and average customer spending also declining. CEO Brian Cornell attributed many of the retailer's challenges to the economy, while acknowledging the need for improvement in market share across merchandise categories. The company now anticipates a low-single-digit sales decline for the fiscal year, with adjusted earnings per share expected to be between $7 and $9, along with announcing leadership shakeups and the creation of an Enterprise Acceleration Office to simplify operations and accelerate growth.</p>

Casandra Ventura, known as Cassie, testified that Combs threatened to have Mescudi's car blown up after discovering their relationship in 2011. The government has accused Combs of running a criminal enterprise that helped him commit a series of crimes dating back to 2004, as part of the racketeering conspiracy charge against him. Combs has pleaded not guilty to all charges, with his lawyers acknowledging physical abuse of Ventura but denying any sexual assault or criminal conspiracy.</p>

          <p>Israel has declared an expansion of its ground offensive in Gaza, aiming to seize larger areas to force Hamas's surrender after over 19 months of war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israeli troops could potentially take control of all of Gaza, with the offensive possibly occurring gradually. This announcement coincides with ongoing cease-fire negotiations and pressure from the Trump administration for a truce. Britain, France, and Canada issued a rare public reprimand of Israel, demanding an end to the widening military offensive, highlighting growing rifts between Israel and its Western allies. The past few days have been particularly deadly for Palestinians, with the enclave facing devastation and a blockade on aid, leading to widespread hunger.</p>

          <p>The pregnancy of a brain-dead woman in Georgia has raised questions about the state's abortion law, which bans most abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected. Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old nurse, was declared brain dead while pregnant, and doctors are maintaining her organs until the fetus can be delivered, citing the LIFE Act. This situation has sparked legal and ethical debates, with some arguing that the law is being misinterpreted to require the artificial maintenance of a brain-dead woman's body. The case has also highlighted Georgia's maternal mortality crisis and the debate over fetal personhood.</p>

          <p>Proposed tax cuts by President Trump are amplifying debt and deficit concerns among bond investors, influencing interest rates and potentially impacting American households and businesses. The recent attempt to push through sweeping tax cuts without significantly reducing spending has triggered turmoil in the bond market, with the 10-year Treasury yield rising above 4.5 percent. This increase reflects concerns that the administration's tax bill will add to the federal deficit, leading to more borrowing and potentially higher interest rates. The situation is further complicated by Moody's recent downgrade of the United States' top-tier credit rating.</p>

          <p>Volatile lumber prices are once again impacting the U.S. housing market, putting pressure on builders and potentially worsening the existing affordability crisis. Softwood lumber prices have increased significantly, and futures have risen due to fears of increased U.S. duties and sawmill closures. Though lumber was not included in the latest tariff round, the Trump administration has expressed interest in tightening trade restrictions.
