          <p>A note found on the suspect in the Midtown Manhattan mass shooting claimed he suffered from CTE and mentioned the NFL. The 27-year-old shooter, who killed four people before taking his own life, had a documented history of mental health issues in Nevada. Authorities believe he intended to go to the NFL headquarters, located in the same building, but took the wrong elevator. The only way to confirm a CTE diagnosis is through a post-mortem brain analysis, which examines specific protein changes linked to repeated head trauma.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spotify's stock fell over 7% after the company reported second-quarter revenue that missed Wall Street expectations and provided a weak forecast for the upcoming quarter. The music streaming service posted a net loss of 86 million euros, a significant downturn from the net income reported in the same period last year, attributing it to higher operational costs. While monthly active users and premium subscribers saw year-over-year growth, the company's revenue guidance for the third quarter fell short of analyst predictions. The news comes despite efforts to innovate with features like an AI DJ. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite warnings that new U.S. tariffs would cause consumer prices to rise, the full impact has been delayed due to several factors. This article explains that major tariff hikes have been repeatedly postponed, giving businesses time to adjust. Companies also stockpiled goods in advance to avoid the new import taxes, creating a buffer that has so far shielded shoppers from significant price increases. Furthermore, many importers are absorbing the current, lower tariff rates as a hit to their profits rather than passing the full cost on to consumers, hoping the steeper tariffs will not materialize.

          <p>This article profiles Bill Pulte, the 37-year-old director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), characterizing him as an aggressive political operative for the Trump administration. Pulte has reportedly used his position to pressure Fed Chair Jerome Powell and has referred prominent Democrats like Senator Adam Schiff and NY Attorney General Letitia James for prosecution. The grandson of a major home-builder, Pulte gained fame through "Twitter Philanthropy" and involvement in the meme stock craze before his appointment. His actions are seen as an unusual and highly political use of the FHFA, an agency typically focused on overseeing mortgage markets.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has called for an apology from Technology Secretary Peter Kyle after the minister suggested Farage was on the side of sex offenders like Jimmy Savile. The comment was made in response to Reform UK's pledge to scrap the new Online Safety Act, which the party argues suppresses free speech. Kyle stated that if Savile were alive today, "he would be perpetrating his crimes online - and Nigel Farage is on their side." Farage condemned the remarks as "absolutely disgusting," escalating the political feud over the new internet regulations.</p>

          <p>A line of destructive thunderstorms with winds over 90 mph is moving across the Midwest, causing power outages for over 170,000 customers and damaging property. The severe weather is being fueled by a frontal boundary interacting with a strong heat dome centered over the South. This same heat dome has placed more than 165 million Americans under heat advisories, with feels-like temperatures expected to exceed 110 degrees in some areas. The combination of extreme heat, severe storms, and degraded air quality is creating dangerous conditions across a large portion of the country.</p>

          <p>The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a leading international authority, issued a stark alert stating that the "worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip." While not a formal famine declaration, the monitor warned of "widespread death" without immediate, large-scale humanitarian intervention. The report cites mounting evidence of widespread starvation and malnutrition, noting that famine thresholds for food consumption have been reached in most of the territory. The alert follows nearly 22 months of war and increasingly stringent blockades, with aid organizations saying current relief efforts are insufficient.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia has taken effect after five days of deadly border clashes, though its stability remains uncertain. The truce was mediated by Malaysia, the current chair of ASEAN, but was reportedly violated by small-arms fire just hours after it began. Analysts suggest the ceasefire may largely hold, as both nations' leaders have achieved certain domestic political objectives through the conflict. The article also notes that threats of U.S. trade tariffs from President Trump may have provided a key incentive for both countries to agree to halt the fighting, which had killed at least 35 people.</p>

          <p>UK mobile network EE is introducing new Sim-only phone plans designed for teenagers that include age-based internet content filtering. The plans, launching in August, will have three tiers of protection that restrict access to adult content and can reduce internet speeds to limit streaming for younger users. However, these safety features will only apply when the device is using EE's mobile data network, not when connected to a separate Wi-Fi network. The initiative is part of a broader effort by tech companies to make it more difficult for children to access inappropriate online content.</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group issued a 2025 earnings outlook that fell short of Wall Street expectations, causing its stock to fall. The company, which owns the nation's largest insurer, cited persistently high medical costs, particularly in its Medicare Advantage plans, as the primary reason for the lowered forecast. This marks another setback for the industry bellwether, which has been grappling with seniors undergoing procedures delayed during the pandemic. The company's medical care ratio, which measures expenses relative to premiums, increased, signaling that profitability challenges for the health insurance sector may continue.

          <p>Workers and union leaders in Michigan and Kentucky report that Donald Trump's immigration crackdown is causing significant labor shortages and straining factory operations. At a GE Appliances plant, over a hundred workers were forced out this spring, leading to production shortfalls and chaos on the assembly line. Similarly, a Kraft-Heinz plant is reportedly mandating overtime as veteran immigrant workers lose their work authorization. The article connects these on-the-ground experiences to economic analyses warning that mass deportations could lead to millions of job losses and a significant decrease in U.S. economic output.</p>

          <p>Following an increase in violent threats and the recent assassination of a Minnesota state representative, U.S. lawmakers are re-evaluating how to balance personal security with public accessibility. The article highlights the case of Rep. Eric Swalwell, who has spent nearly $1 million on security after receiving repeated death threats. In response to the escalating danger, federal and state bodies are increasing security funding and considering new laws to protect officials, such as restricting public access to their home addresses. This creates a conflict for politicians who must connect with constituents but face a growing threat of violence.</p>

          <p>The Republican party is pursuing a strategy of mid-decade redistricting in states like Texas, Ohio, and Missouri to create more favorable maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The plan in Texas alone could yield up to five more likely Republican seats, potentially securing the party's narrow House majority. In response, Democrats like California Governor Gavin Newsom are threatening to retaliate with their own gerrymandering efforts. This raises concerns among some Democrats about hypocrisy and the long-term erosion of trust in the political system, turning redistricting into a tool for partisan power grabs.</p>
