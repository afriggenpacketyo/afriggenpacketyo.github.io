            <p>Prosecutors and defense attorneys presented closing arguments in the bribery trial of Nadine Menendez, wife of former Senator Bob Menendez. The prosecution argued that Nadine acted as a 'partner in crime' with her husband, brokering deals to sell his influence for personal gain, including cash, gold bars, and a luxury car. The defense countered that the government's definitions of 'official acts' and 'quid pro quo' were overly broad and that the alleged misconduct was routine political behavior.
