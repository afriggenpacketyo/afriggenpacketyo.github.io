          <p>Tulsi Gabbard now asserts that Iran could produce nuclear weapons within weeks, a shift from her previous testimony before Congress months earlier. Gabbard's updated assessment aligns with President Trump's view that Iran possesses substantial nuclear materials and could develop a weapon within months. This change in position follows criticism from Trump, who dismissed Gabbard's earlier statements. Iran maintains that its nuclear program is peaceful and denies seeking nuclear weapons, though international concerns persist regarding its enriched uranium stockpile.</p>

          <p>Albania's Prime Minister Edi Rama is facing criticism for alleged corruption and autocratic tendencies, leading some to label him the "Ramaduro" of Europe. Despite Europe's claims of championing democracy, Rama, a former disciple of George Soros, has secured a fourth term through elections deemed flawed by critics. Rama's political survival depends on aligning with the anti-Trump order, even as his domestic leadership veers toward authoritarianism.

While the governor's office defended his actions, environmentalists expressed concern about potential retribution and the need for strong policies to address the global plastic crisis.

          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen is urging the House of Lords not to block the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which would give terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death. The bill has been passed by the House of Commons, but faces opposition in the Lords, with concerns raised about potential coercion of vulnerable individuals. Supporters argue the bill includes rigorous safeguards, while critics fear these safeguards could be eroded, potentially impacting disabled and older people who may feel like a burden.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he would make a decision within two weeks regarding U.S. involvement in the conflict between Israel and Iran. This statement comes as European leaders met with Iranian diplomats in Geneva to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. While European officials reported no major breakthroughs, they expressed openness to future talks. The article notes Macron's warning about the risk of Iran obtaining nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>The People's Liberation Army's (PLA) maneuvers around Taiwan have become increasingly routine, with a rise in tempo and intensity in recent years. These operations fall into three main categories: near-daily aerial patrols, combat-readiness patrols, and large-scale joint forces exercises. Each category varies in scale, intensity, and purpose, serving not only for combat training but also for strategic signaling, demonstrating China's continued military focus on the region.</p>

          <p>China's real estate sector is facing a deepening downturn, exacerbated by a shrinking population. Goldman Sachs estimates that demand for new homes in Chinese urban cities will remain suppressed in the coming years.

          <p>Japan has been quietly preparing for supply chain disruptions, particularly in rare earth minerals. Following China's export ban on rare earths in 2010, Japan invested heavily in non-China rare-earth projects and reduced its dependence on Chinese rare earths to below 60%. This proactive approach positions Japan as better prepared than most for China's recent export ban on several rare earth elements, though challenges remain in cutting dependency in certain key areas, highlighting the ongoing need for alternative sources.</p>

          <p>The article critiques the current trend of "feminist critique" of celebrities, arguing that it has devolved into snide remarks and paternalistic tellings-off. It highlights instances where female celebrities like Sabrina Carpenter, Sydney Sweeney, and Addison Rae have faced intense backlash for expressing their sexuality or embracing certain images. The author argues that these critiques often lack historical context and economic awareness, and risk policing women's sexuality under the guise of concern for their safety, ultimately restricting women's self-expression.</p>
