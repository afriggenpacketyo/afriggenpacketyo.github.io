          <p>A shooting at a Brooklyn nightclub that left three dead and nine injured has intensified the debate on gun violence among New York City's mayoral candidates. Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani called for increased investment in community safety programs, reprising his previous calls to defund the police which have become a focal point of the campaign. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and competitors Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa criticized Mamdani's stance, arguing for a stronger police presence to combat rising crime and remove illegal firearms from the streets.</p>

          <p>A Texas judge has issued an expanded restraining order preventing Beto O'Rourke's organization, Powered by People, from sending funds to Democratic lawmakers who left the state to block a Republican-led redistricting session. The judge ruled that the group's fundraising constituted deceptive trade practices, freezing its assets within Texas financial institutions like ActBlue. This legal action, initiated by Attorney General Ken Paxton, comes as the Democratic lawmakers begin returning to Texas, potentially allowing the controversial redistricting measure to pass.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's 1-0 opening day loss to Arsenal was decided by an error from goalkeeper Altay Bayindir, reigniting debate over the team's goalkeeping situation. Manager Ruben Amorim defended his choice to start Bayindir over the recently fit Andre Onana, but pundits criticized the mistake that led to the only goal. The club's £200m summer spending focused on improving its attack, leaving the crucial goalkeeper position a point of contention and scrutiny as the new season begins.</p>

The initial phase involves collecting surface remains and evidence, with a full exhumation pending international support due to site hazards like unexploded ordnance. Authorities will build a DNA database from samples collected from families of the missing, many of whom are believed to be Iraqi security personnel and members of the Yazidi community.</p>

          <p>Intense and sudden downpours known as cloudbursts are causing fatal flash floods and landslides in parts of India and Pakistan, with one event killing as many as 300 people in a Pakistani district. These extreme weather events, where over 100 millimeters of rain can fall in an hour over a small area, are difficult to predict and are becoming more frequent due to climate change. A warming atmosphere allows air to hold more moisture, which, combined with the mountainous terrain of the Himalayas, creates ideal conditions for these devastating deluges.</p>

The dental remains exhibit a "mosaic" of features, combining archaic traits found in Homo erectus with more modern traits seen in Homo sapiens. This unique combination suggests that different evolutionary traits developed at varying speeds and that interbreeding between different hominin groups in Asia was occurring much earlier than previously understood.

          <h2>Following Putin Summit, U.S. President Shifts Stance from Demanding Ceasefire to Pursuing Direct Peace Deal</h2>

          <p>After meeting with the Russian president in Alaska, the U.S. president has altered his public stance on ending the war in Ukraine, now prioritizing a comprehensive peace agreement over an immediate ceasefire. This shift aligns with Russia's position, which seeks to negotiate a final settlement addressing the "root causes" of the conflict, but is at odds with Ukraine's desire for an immediate halt to hostilities. The change in approach sets the stage for a critical meeting in Washington, where the Ukrainian president and European leaders will discuss the path forward.</p>

          <h2>Draft of New 'Make America Healthy Again' Report Avoids Strict Recommendations on Pesticides</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 12:07:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A draft of the Trump administration's upcoming "Make America Healthy Again" report does not recommend significant restrictions on pesticides or ultra-processed foods, a move seen as a victory for the agriculture industry. The document, obtained by ABC News, calls for more targeted pesticide application rather than elimination and suggests developing a government definition for "ultra-processed food." This language appears to be a setback for HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has been a vocal critic of chemical additives in the nation's food supply.</p>

          <p>CRISPR Therapeutics, a mid-cap biotech firm, could offer significant long-term returns for investors despite its recent underperformance in the market. The company's first approved therapy, Casgevy, serves as a crucial proof of concept for its gene-editing technology, demonstrating its potential viability and helping to navigate the complex commercialization process. Future growth and stock performance will heavily depend on the company's ability to achieve further clinical and regulatory successes with its pipeline candidates, such as its in vivo treatment for high cholesterol.

          <p>President Trump expressed frustration on social media regarding the media's portrayal of his recent summit in Alaska with the Russian president, calling the coverage dishonest and distorted. He asserted that the meeting was great and that news outlets would report negatively on him regardless of the outcome, even if he secured major concessions. The posts came ahead of his scheduled meeting with the Ukrainian president and European leaders to discuss the war, and as he continues to feel pressure over the lack of a concrete deal from the high-stakes meeting.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old Gazan woman, who was severely emaciated, has died in a hospital in Pisa, Italy, less than 48 hours after being medically evacuated. She was brought to Italy under a government program for patients with serious conditions, but suffered a cardiac arrest due to what the hospital called a "very complex clinical picture" and severe weight loss. Her death highlights the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where the UN has warned of widespread malnutrition and experts say famine is actively occurring.</p>
