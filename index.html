        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israel has launched a significant military operation in Gaza, dubbed "Operation Gideon Chariots," aimed at pressuring Hamas to release the remaining hostages. Defense Minister Israel Katz stated the operation is being conducted with considerable force, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed negotiators to remain in Qatar for indirect talks with Hamas. The operation occurs amidst a dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, with severe shortages of food, fuel, and medicine, leading to warnings of famine from humanitarian organizations. Despite ongoing negotiations and international calls for a ceasefire, the conflict continues to escalate, resulting in numerous casualties on both sides. The UN estimates that 14,000 children in Gaza are malnourished due to the blockade.</p>

          <p>A deadly explosion near a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, is under investigation by the FBI as an intentional act of terrorism. The blast, which killed one person and injured at least four others, caused significant damage to nearby buildings, shattering windows and scattering debris across several blocks. According to the FBI, the explosion occurred in or near a vehicle parked outside the clinic, and a person of interest has been identified, though authorities are not actively searching for a suspect. The American Reproductive Centers clinic reported that its staff and reproductive materials were unharmed, and it expects to resume normal operations soon. In vitro fertilization has become increasingly politicized in the debate over reproductive rights, while dividing social conservatives.</p>

          <p>Two prominent figures from the far-right are reportedly attempting to infiltrate and influence the Reform UK party, led by Nigel Farage, to promote extremist views. David Clews, a conspiracy theorist, and Mark Collett, a Nazi sympathizer, have encouraged their supporters to join Reform UK and push a "pro-white" and anti-immigration agenda. Clews claimed that sympathizers are already active within Reform, holding positions such as branch chairs and candidate list members. Reform UK has stated that far-right views are not welcome and that a stringent vetting process is in place to prevent such influence.</p>

          <p>A cat named George made a daring escape from an animal hospital in Lakeland, Florida, after being neutered, traveling three miles back to his home. George broke out of his crate and scaled a fence, evading hospital staff who attempted to catch him. His owner, Bob Beasock, expressed relief and humor, noting the cat's determination to return home, navigating through subdivisions and around lakes. Animal behaviorists suggest cats possess a combination of scent, visual markers, and geomagnetism to find their way back home, highlighting their attachment to their owners.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has publicly criticized Walmart for attributing price increases to tariffs on imported goods, urging the company to absorb the costs instead of passing them on to consumers. Trump stated that Walmart, having made substantial profits, should "eat the tariffs" to maintain affordability for its customers. Walmart responded that it remains committed to keeping prices as low as possible despite the challenges posed by tariffs. This dispute reflects the broader tension between the Trump administration's trade policies and American companies grappling with the economic impact of tariffs.</p>

This stance aligns with SNP leader John Swinney, who has called for "demonstrable support" for independence, similar to the 1997 referendum for a Scottish parliament.

Experts attributed the storm to unusually dry conditions and strong winds, noting that such events are more common in the desert Southwest and southern Great Plains.

Pakistan retaliated with its own attacks, leading to a series of drone strikes and shelling across the Line of Control.

A youth mobility scheme is also under consideration, but migration concerns complicate negotiations. The summit is expected to yield agreements on principle rather than final deals.</p>
