          <p>Peter Sullivan, who served 38 years in prison for the 1986 murder of Diane Sindall, has had his conviction overturned due to new DNA evidence.

Sullivan, now 68, expressed that he holds no anger or bitterness, emphasizing that the wrongful conviction does not diminish the terrible loss of life. The Crown Prosecution Service agreed that the new DNA evidence undermined Sullivan's conviction, preventing a retrial.</p>

          <p>Economists and policymakers are preparing for a potential resurgence of inflation as companies adapt to President Trump's trade war. While the U.S. inflation rate cooled slightly in April to 2.3%, experts predict prices will accelerate in the coming months due to import taxes. Despite a temporary reduction in tariffs with China, an effective tariff rate of around 15% remains, and the full impact of these levies is expected to materialize later in the year. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the situation, concerned about a potential shift in long-term inflation expectations.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are advancing key components of their bill to fund President Trump's agenda, including taxes and Medicaid cuts, despite internal disagreements. The legislation proposes slashing Medicaid spending by imposing work requirements, increasing eligibility checks, and penalizing states that offer Medicaid to illegal immigrants. The bill also includes a permanent extension of Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act, along with provisions like no tax on tips and overtime. The plan faces resistance from both moderate and hardline Republicans, as well as opposition in the Senate.</p>

          <p>Consumer prices rose 2.3% in April compared to a year ago, cooling slightly and defying initial fears of an inflation surge following President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs. Egg prices fell, while gasoline prices dropped significantly over the past year. While analysts anticipate a possible rekindling of inflation as retailers replenish inventory with goods imported after the tariffs, a rollback of some levies may soften the impact. The Federal Reserve remains cautious, awaiting the full economic impact of Trump's trade policies.</p>

          <p>The pace of inflation slowed in April, coinciding with the announcement of President Trump's tariffs. The annual inflation rate was 2.3%, down from 2.4% in March, though businesses are still assessing the tariffs' impact. Despite the slowdown, consumer sentiment has dropped, and inflation expectations have risen. Economists anticipate price increases later in the year as companies sell goods imported before the tariffs' implementation, while the Federal Reserve expects tariffs to impact prices, potentially delaying the achievement of its 2% inflation target.</p>

          <p>President Trump has rolled back tariffs on China, lowering them from 145 percent to 30 percent, in exchange for China lowering its retaliatory levies from 125 percent to 10 percent. This action suggests that America needs other countries' trade as much as they need ours, diminishing Trump's negotiating position. Despite Trump's initial claims, China made no concessions, and tariffs remain higher than before his second term, potentially leading to price increases for consumers. The move comes after retailers warned of price hikes and empty shelves, weakening Trump's negotiating position.</p>
