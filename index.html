          <h2>White House Considers Firing Fed Chair, Citing Renovation Project as Potential Cause</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring the possibility of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, according to National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett. White House officials have intensified their criticism, focusing on a $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed's headquarters, which they allege is mismanaged and over budget. This scrutiny is viewed by some as an attempt to establish "cause" for Powell's removal, a move President Trump has previously expressed interest in. The Federal Reserve, which is self-funded, has quietly rebutted some of the administration's claims about the project.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic fire at the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, has resulted in the deaths of nine residents. Firefighters arrived to find heavy flames and rescued numerous individuals from windows, but dozens, including five firefighters, were transported to hospitals with injuries. Fall River's Fire Chief described the event as an "unfathomable tragedy," highlighting the heroic efforts of first responders who saved multiple lives. An investigation is now underway to determine the cause of the blaze, which caused extensive smoke damage throughout the building.</p>

          <h2>BBC Review Finds Gaza Documentary Breached Accuracy Guidelines</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An internal BBC review has concluded that a documentary, "Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone," violated editorial guidelines on accuracy. The breach occurred because the program failed to disclose that its child narrator was the son of a Hamas official. While the review found no evidence that this connection influenced the content, it criticized both the independent production company and the BBC for a lack of oversight. The BBC has since apologized, stated the program should not have been broadcast, and is implementing new procedures to prevent similar failures.</p>

          <p>A shooting at the Richmond Road Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky, has left two women, aged 72 and 32, dead. The incident began after the suspect shot and wounded a state trooper during a traffic stop, then carjacked a vehicle and fled to the church. The gunman, who may have had a connection to the church victims, was subsequently shot and killed by Lexington police. Two other men were also wounded during the violent spree, and the state trooper is reported to be in stable condition.</p>

U.S. lawmakers are currently deliberating a series of bills, dubbed 'Crypto Week,' aimed at establishing a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets. This potential for increased regulatory clarity has bolstered investor confidence and is supported by the pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has stated its intention to carefully manage its "moderately loose" monetary policy to support the nation's goal of achieving around 5% GDP growth this year. A deputy governor of the bank noted that the full effects of previous stimulus measures have yet to materialize and that future actions will depend on economic conditions. This approach is designed to stimulate domestic demand, stabilize public expectations, and ensure the country meets its annual economic and social development targets amid ongoing trade negotiations with the United States.

          <p>An Air China flight traveling from Shanghai to Milan was involved in a near-miss incident with another aircraft over Siberia. The Airbus A350 made an unexplained climb of nearly 2,000 feet, bringing it within 300-400 feet of the other plane, far closer than the 1,000-foot minimum safety standard. The maneuver was not requested by air traffic control, and an investigation is underway to determine the cause. One possible explanation is that the Air China pilot may have misunderstood an instruction that was intended for the other aircraft in the vicinity.</p>

          <p>Renowned boxing trainer Dave Coldwell has voiced his disapproval of Manny Pacquiao's upcoming comeback fight against Mario Barrios for a WBC world title. Coldwell argues that the 46-year-old legend, who has not had a professional win in six years, is being granted the opportunity based on nostalgia rather than merit. He believes this sets a poor precedent and is unfair to other fighters who have worked their way up the ranks. Citing Pacquiao's faded skills in a recent exhibition bout, the trainer expressed concern for the boxer's health and safety.</p>

The legal claim, valued at over £1 million, relates to an unspecified injury during a period starting in July 2022.

The experienced guide emphasized that this was a unique situation with a habituated bear and strongly cautioned that people should never approach bears in the wild.</p>

This transaction highlights the Chinese government's strategy of using state-owned enterprises to stimulate demand and accelerate the development of its domestic robotics industry.

          <p>Indian drugmaker Sun Pharma has launched its severe alopecia areata drug, Leqselvi, in the United States. The launch follows the successful settlement of a patent infringement dispute with Incyte Corp, which had previously caused delays. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease that results in significant, patchy hair loss. Analysts view the launch as a positive development that broadens Sun Pharma's dermatology portfolio and could generate substantial sales, potentially boosting the company's growth in the competitive U.S. market. The drug is now available as an 8 mg tablet for patients.</p>
