          <p>Former President Barack Obama advised Democratic donors to "toughen up" and support candidates with a genuine chance of winning, rather than seeking a "messiah." Speaking at a fundraiser, he emphasized the need for pragmatism and courage, urging the party to back common-sense policies and electable figures in upcoming races. Obama stressed that ideological purity is less important than delivering tangible results for constituents, such as addressing housing shortages by reforming restrictive zoning laws. He called for a more aggressive and unified approach to regain political momentum following recent electoral setbacks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The future of FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is uncertain after he reportedly considered resigning following a heated dispute with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the Jeffrey Epstein case. The controversy, which threatens to divide the MAGA movement, stems from the failure to produce a rumored high-profile client list, which both Bongino and Bondi had previously promoted. Critics have long argued that Bongino, a former right-wing media personality, was unqualified for the senior FBI role. The internal fallout highlights significant tensions within the Trump administration over the handling and public messaging of the politically sensitive Epstein investigation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department successfully recovered an assault rifle and five fully loaded magazines that were misplaced after likely falling from a patrol car. The department issued a public appeal for help, detailing the route the deputies had taken. A resident in the Lennox area found the hard-shelled gun case, initially mistaking it for a musical instrument, and promptly turned it in to the local sheriff's station. Officials expressed deep gratitude for the community member's honesty and responsible actions, which prevented the high-powered weapon from remaining on the streets.</p>

          <p>The official X account for the Sesame Street character Elmo was compromised by an unknown hacker who posted racist and antisemitic messages. The posts, which have since been deleted, called for violence and referenced conspiracy theories related to Jeffrey Epstein, shocking the account's over 650,000 followers. Sesame Workshop, the organization behind the character, condemned the "disgusting" content and has since secured the account. The incident has drawn criticism from the Anti-Defamation League, which highlighted the growing threat of hate speech and antisemitism on the social media platform under its current ownership.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Dalian University of Technology in China have developed a new manufacturing technique that could resolve long-standing issues in the country's aircraft engine production. The method involves rapidly cooling forged superalloy turbine discs, a critical component that must withstand extreme heat and pressure. Improving the quality and durability of these discs is essential for enhancing engine power, efficiency, and lifespan. This technological advancement is particularly crucial as China works to develop advanced engines for its next-generation fighter jets, an area where it has historically lagged behind Western nations.</p>

Maxwell's legal team argues that a 2007 non-prosecution agreement with Jeffrey Epstein should have protected her from prosecution nationwide. However, the DOJ contends the agreement was limited to the Southern District of Florida and that Maxwell was, at most, an incidental beneficiary not explicitly covered by the deal. An attorney for Epstein's victims stated Maxwell should remain imprisoned for her "horrific crimes," reinforcing the legal consensus from lower courts.</p>

          <p>Paraguayan President Santiago Peña has forcefully affirmed his country's commitment to its 68-year diplomatic relationship with Taiwan, describing it as a strategic and values-based alliance. Speaking at a business forum, Peña stated that Paraguay will defend its ties with the self-ruled island "with all its strength." This declaration follows a recent incident where a Beijing-based envoy was declared persona non grata for privately urging Paraguayan lawmakers to switch diplomatic recognition to Beijing. Peña emphasized that the partnership reflects Paraguay's sovereign foreign policy and its dedication to democratic principles over purely economic interests.</p>

          <p>A Photo Booth Museum has opened in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, offering a nostalgic experience for fans of analog photography. Created by the San Francisco-based company Photomatica, the venue features four restored vintage analog photo booths from as early as the 1950s, alongside one digital machine. While retrofitted to accept modern payments, the old machines use original chemical processing, producing unique black-and-white photo strips after a brief wait. The museum aims to capture the "analog magic" that has become popular with a younger, digital-native audience seeking tangible and unique visual experiences.</p>

While some funds have been released as Lockheed makes progress, a majority of the payments will remain withheld into next year.

Critics on social media quickly mocked the advice as tone-deaf and simplistic, particularly as millions are at risk of losing their health coverage.

          <p>President Trump's recent shift to a tougher policy on Russia, including new weapons for Ukraine and tariff threats, is reportedly driven by personal frustration rather than a strategic change. According to White House sources, Trump feels humiliated by Vladimir Putin's refusal to heed his calls for a ceasefire, making him appear weak. After months of believing he could broker a peace deal, Trump has grown angry as Putin escalated attacks, ignoring his pleas. This perceived defiance has pushed Trump to take a harder line, not from a newfound support for Ukraine, but from a desire to reassert his own strength.</p>
