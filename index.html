          <p>Chevron CEO Mike Wirth stated that the company sees no signs of an impending U.S. recession, despite concerns about the impact of President Trump's tariffs on oil demand. While acknowledging potential slowing growth, Wirth said Chevron is not altering its capital spending plans in response to recent price drops. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its U.S. growth outlook for the year, but Chevron anticipates that energy will largely be exempt from tariffs, minimizing direct impacts on its business. The company is monitoring macroeconomic effects on global trade and growth.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts slower U.S. economic growth in 2025, citing an escalating trade war and policy uncertainty. The IMF projects a 1.8% growth rate for the U.S. this year, a decrease from previous estimates. The organization also noted an increased probability of a U.S. recession. The IMF expects global economic growth to decrease as well, attributing the slowdown to trade tensions and uncertainty.

          <p>Major U.S. ports, particularly Los Angeles and Long Beach, are experiencing a sharp decline in container vessel traffic from China, reflecting the impact of President Trump's tariffs and recession fears. The number of freight vessels leaving China for Southern California ports has decreased significantly, with a substantial year-over-year drop in scheduled arrivals. This slowdown is also impacting ground transport, with a notable decrease in available truck loads nationally. The data indicates a weakening trade relationship between the U.S. and China, affecting various sectors of the transportation industry.</p>

          <p>Beijing conveyed its condolences following the death of Pope Francis, reaffirming its commitment to improving relations with the Vatican. Despite unresolved issues, including formal recognition of Beijing over Taiwan, China emphasized the "constructive" momentum in ties with the Vatican. The Chinese foreign ministry expressed willingness to collaborate with the Vatican to enhance their relationship. The future of the landmark agreement on appointing bishops remains uncertain and dependent on the next pope.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Al Gore compared the Trump administration's attempts to manipulate reality to those of Nazi Germany during a speech about the climate crisis. Gore quoted Theodore Adorno on the Nazis' conversion of truth into power and their attack on the distinction between true and false. He criticized the Trump administration for spreading misinformation about energy and climate change, reversing environmental initiatives, and dismissing climate regulations as a "scam." Gore described Trump as a "threat" to the planet's future.</p>

          <p>A new ceasefire plan has been proposed by Qatari and Egyptian mediators to end the conflict in Gaza, according to a Hamas source. The plan envisions a five-to-seven-year truce, the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, an end to the war, and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Hamas has signaled its willingness to hand over governance of Gaza to a mutually agreed-upon Palestinian entity. Despite ongoing Israeli strikes and rejection of previous proposals, this mediation effort is described as serious, with Hamas showing "unprecedented flexibility."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's spokesman has clarified that Starmer does not believe transgender women are women, aligning with a recent Supreme Court ruling that defines "woman" by biological sex under equalities law. This marks a shift from Starmer's previous stance. The ruling clarifies that individuals born male but identifying as women do not have the right to access spaces or services designated for women only, even with a gender recognition certificate, if deemed disproportionate. Despite the clarification, Starmer maintains that transgender women should be treated with dignity and respect.</p>

          <p>The top federal prosecutor in Manhattan has stepped aside, paving the way for President Trump to appoint Jay Clayton as interim U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. This marks another shake-up for the office, following the resignation of Danielle Sassoon in protest of the Justice Department's decision to drop corruption charges. Clayton, former SEC chairman, will serve in an interim capacity until confirmed by the Senate or appointed by federal judges. The move allows Trump to install his nominee without a confirmation process.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced a comprehensive reorganization of the US State Department, aiming to reform it amidst criticism over its diplomatic execution. The reorganization will involve closing overseas missions, reducing staff, and minimizing offices promoting liberal values, integrating them into regional bureaus. Rubio stated the goal is to prioritize core national interests over radical political ideology. The changes aim to empower the Department from the ground up, consolidating functions, removing redundant offices, and eliminating programs misaligned with America's core national interests.</p>
