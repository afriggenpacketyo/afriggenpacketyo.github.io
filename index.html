Key tips include understanding that nervousness is universal, making it easier to initiate friendships, and not overhyping the importance of the traditional "freshers' week." Students also emphasize the value of joining societies to find like-minded people, especially for those who miss initial events or commute. They also highlight practical wisdom, such as maintaining cleanliness in shared living spaces and seeking academic or pastoral help without hesitation, to ensure a balanced and successful university experience.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old suspect, Tyler Robinson, has been taken into custody for the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The attack, described by officials as a "targeted political assassination," occurred during an outdoor debate event. The investigation, which involved a massive manhunt and over 11,000 leads, led to the recovery of a high-powered rifle and bullet casings with inscribed messages. Robinson was reportedly identified by his father, who then helped facilitate his surrender to authorities, according to law enforcement sources.</p>

          <p>Two separate boat accidents in the Democratic Republic of Congo have resulted in the deaths of at least 193 people, with many more still missing. One incident involved a vessel with nearly 500 passengers that caught fire and capsized on the Congo River, leaving 146 people unaccounted for. A second accident on the Nsolo and Great Maringa rivers killed at least 86 individuals, most of whom were students. Authorities attribute the tragedies to common issues in the region, such as improper loading, night navigation, and the use of old, poorly maintained vessels for essential transport.</p>

          <p>The aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination has highlighted the dysfunctional nature of online discourse, where speculation and rage-bait filled the information vacuum before facts emerged. This article analyzes how the algorithmic internet immediately worked to fit the tragedy into pre-existing narratives, with various factions attempting to label or disavow the shooter. The shooter's own hyper-online references inscribed on bullet casings suggest a motive rooted more in nihilistic trolling than coherent political ideology. This reflects a disturbing trend of violence performed for an online audience, further poisoning a political environment already rife with polarization and anger.</p>

          <p>The suspect arrested for the assassination of Charlie Kirk has been identified as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, a resident of a deeply pro-Trump region of Utah. This development complicates initial narratives that blamed the killing on "radical left" political violence. Utah Governor Spencer Cox emphasized that one individual is responsible, urging a de-escalation of rhetoric. Details suggest Robinson had become more political recently and had expressed dislike for Kirk's views, while inscriptions on recovered bullet casings referenced online gaming and troll culture, pointing to a complex and not easily categorized motive.</p>

However, environmental experts and former EPA officials warn that ending the program will blind the public to crucial data about climate pollution from major polluters.

          <p>Paramount has issued a strong statement denouncing a proposed boycott of Israeli film institutions, a campaign supported by numerous Hollywood figures including Joaquin Phoenix and Emma Stone. The group, Film Workers for Palestine, has pledged to withhold support from Israeli film festivals and production companies over the conflict in Gaza. In its response, Paramount stated its opposition to silencing creative artists based on nationality, emphasizing the need for more engagement and communication, not less. The studio is the first to take a public stance on the divisive issue.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Examining the Rush to Label Charlie Kirk a Christian Martyr</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 18:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article explores the immediate labeling of Charlie Kirk as a Christian martyr by many on the right following his assassination. The author contrasts the traditional evangelical emphasis on empathy and service with Kirk's public rhetoric, which often belittled marginalized groups and dismissed empathy as a "made-up new-age term." The piece argues that Kirk's supporters see him as a martyr for a specific vision of America where right-wing politics and religion dominate. It questions whether Kirk's legacy aligns with broader Christian values, especially when compared to other victims of gun violence.</p>

          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has confirmed that players Raheem Sterling and Axel Disasi will continue to train separately from the first-team squad indefinitely. The duo, who were unable to secure transfers away from the club during the recent window, are part of a group referred to as the "bomb squad." Maresca stated he has not seen either player since the season began, as they are using different facilities, including a separate pitch and dressing room. This decision solidifies their exclusion from the main squad's activities for the foreseeable future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New documents reviewed by Reuters show that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook declared her Atlanta property as a "vacation home" on a loan estimate form. This evidence appears to counter accusations from the Trump administration that she committed mortgage fraud by claiming both her Atlanta and Michigan homes as primary residences. The controversy led to a federal investigation and a dismissal order from the President, which Cook is resisting in court. Real estate experts suggest this document weakens the case against her, indicating she was transparent with her lender about the property's intended use. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's lawyer has refuted claims that the pop star agreed to be deposed in the ongoing legal dispute between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni. Baldoni's legal team had stated they reached an agreement for Swift to provide testimony in late October, but her attorney asserts she has "no material role" in the case and did not consent to a deposition, though she would comply if forced by the court. Lively's attorney accused Baldoni's team of trying to involve Swift to create a "media spectacle." The conflict stems from dueling lawsuits between the "It Ends With Us" co-stars.</p>

          <p>A major cyberattack has forced Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to halt production worldwide for nearly two weeks, creating a severe crisis for its vast network of suppliers. With JLR's UK factories idle, the financial strain is reportedly pushing many small and medium-sized supply chain businesses toward bankruptcy. Experts warn that up to a quarter of a million jobs could be at risk, and there are growing calls for the government to introduce a furlough scheme to prevent widespread layoffs. The disruption has already cost JLR an estimated £50 million, but the knock-on effects on its suppliers are considered far more damaging.</p>

However, he also took another opportunity to criticize Palantir's pricing, calling it "the most expensive enterprise software I've ever seen" and joking that maybe Salesforce isn't charging enough. Despite Palantir's rapid growth and popularity with retail investors, Salesforce remains a much larger company by revenue. The comments highlight the competitive tension between the two firms, which sometimes vie for the same government contracts. (not investment advice)</p>

Investigators tracked the suspect's movements on campus via surveillance video and reviewed Discord messages that mentioned the rifle used in the attack.

          <p>Stellantis's Ram brand has officially canceled its plans to develop a fully electric Ram 1500 pickup truck, citing a slowdown in demand for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in North America. The project had already faced multiple delays from its original 2024 launch target. Instead of a full BEV, Ram will focus on launching an extended-range electric truck next year, which will be equipped with both an electric generator and a traditional gas engine. This strategic shift is part of a broader reassessment under new Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, aimed at re-establishing profitable growth for the brand.</p>

As a result, migrants are now being held in a different facility that previously housed suspected terrorists. This infrastructure problem raises further questions about the base's capacity to handle the large numbers of migrants the Trump administration intends to send there, with critics highlighting the high costs and logistical challenges.</p>

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, leading Democratic figures from across the party's ideological spectrum have been united and unequivocal in their condemnation of the attack and political violence. This article contrasts the unified Democratic response with a narrative pushed by some on the right suggesting the left was celebrating the murder. While isolated offensive posts from private citizens were found online, there was no evidence of support from prominent liberals. The author argues this highlights a structural difference between the parties and critiques President Trump's rhetoric, which has sought to define political violence as an exclusively left-wing problem.</p>
