          <p>Heavy monsoon rains in Nepal have triggered devastating landslides and flash floods, leading to the deaths of at least 22 people, with 12 others reported missing. The eastern Ilam district was hit particularly hard, where multiple villages were swept away and 18 fatalities occurred, including six members of a single family. The severe weather has disrupted domestic flights and blocked major highways connecting the capital, Kathmandu, hampering ongoing rescue and relief efforts.</p>

          <p>Russia conducted extensive overnight missile and drone strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure, resulting in at least five deaths. The attacks targeted multiple regions, including the western city of Lviv, which experienced power outages. In response to the proximity of the assault, neighboring NATO member Poland scrambled its fighter jets to secure its airspace. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reported that Russia fired over 50 missiles and approximately 500 drones, reiterating his call for enhanced air defense systems.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to give police forces broader powers to impose conditions on recurring protests. Senior officers will be able to consider the "cumulative impact" of demonstrations, potentially redirecting them if a location has been used repeatedly. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood clarified the move is about restrictions, not an outright ban, and comes amid concerns for community safety, particularly within the Jewish community following a recent synagogue attack. The government will also review existing protest legislation.</p>

          <p>Syria is holding its first parliamentary elections since the ousting of former leader Bashar Assad, though the process is not a popular vote. Instead, two-thirds of the 210-seat People's Assembly will be chosen by district-based electoral colleges, with the remaining third appointed by the interim president. The interim authorities cited the difficulty of creating an accurate voter registry due to widespread displacement as the reason for this system. The results are being watched as an indicator of the new government's commitment to inclusivity for women and minorities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite recent sales growth, the United States remains a laggard in the adoption of electric vehicles compared to China and Europe. Analysts attribute this to weaker government support, higher average costs for EVs, and the recent expiration of a significant $7,500 tax credit, which is expected to cause a drop in demand. The policy landscape under President Donald Trump, who has been critical of EV mandates, contrasts with more aggressive pro-EV policies in other major markets. The article suggests that without subsidies, the US EV industry faces significant headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>
