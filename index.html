            <p>Democratic senators Adam Schiff and Ruben Gallego are calling for an investigation into potential insider trading related to President Trump's tariff rollbacks and social media posts. The senators sent a letter to Trump's chief of staff and Trade Representative, expressing concerns that Trump's actions may have been part of insider trading among White House allies. Hours before Trump announced tariff rollbacks, which boosted the stock market, he posted on Truth Social encouraging people to buy, raising suspicions about potential conflicts of interest. The senators are requesting the Office of Government Ethics to probe whether officials had advance knowledge and made financial transactions based on nonpublic information.</p>

            <p>Former Attorney General William Barr has cautioned Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill against supporting lawsuits targeting oil companies, arguing they could harm the energy industry and undermine President Trump's energy dominance agenda. Barr's letter referenced Republican Gov. Jeff Landry’s support for lawsuits seeking billions in culpability tied to land loss. Barr argues that the lawsuits, particularly one against Chevron, subject energy producers to excessive fines and raise constitutional issues of retroactivity. He suggests Louisiana should consider federal responsibility for land loss instead, and warns the suits could impact LNG plants and new energy investments. </p>

            <p>President Trump's trade war has injected uncertainty into the oil market, causing price volatility and undermining investor confidence, potentially jeopardizing U.S. oil production. The rapid pullback in crude prices threatens the president's "drill, baby, drill" agenda as companies will struggle to boost output at profit. Trump's on-again, off-again approach to tariffs is causing real damage, leading to reduced capital expenditures by oil companies. Weaker confidence and lower prices may lead to decreased drilling activity and flatlining U.S. onshore oil growth. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby" marks its 100th anniversary, having evolved from an initial sales disappointment to a revered piece of American literature. The novel, set in the Jazz Age, explores themes of the American dream, class consciousness, and disillusionment through the eyes of Nick Carraway and the enigmatic Jay Gatsby. Despite mixed reviews initially, the book's reputation soared after Fitzgerald's death, becoming a staple in high school curricula and inspiring numerous adaptations. Centennial events are planned in New York and Fitzgerald's hometown of St. Paul, Minnesota, to celebrate the novel's enduring legacy.</p>

            <p>Cabot Creamery has issued a recall for its Extra Creamy Premium Sea Salted Butter in seven US states after it was found to be contaminated with elevated levels of coliform bacteria. The recall affects over 1,700lbs of butter with a best-by date of September 9, 2025, sold in New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Maine, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Arkansas. While the FDA classifies the recall as low-risk, consumers are advised to return or discard the affected product.

This comes after Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 125%, while pausing planned tariffs on other trade partners. Beijing responded by increasing tariffs on all U.S. goods to 84%, vowing to safeguard its economy and uphold international interests. Meanwhile, the EU has paused retaliatory measures following Trump's decision to temporarily halt tariffs for most trade partners, signaling a cautious response to the evolving trade landscape.</p>

He said more price-performant chips, along with improvements in "model distillation, prompt catching, computing infrastructure, and model architectures" will over time reduce the "cost per unit in AI," which will "unleash AI being used as expansively as customers desire." Amazon has allocated up to $100 billion this year for capital expenditures, primarily focused on AI-related projects, and is investing heavily in data centers and hardware to meet the growing demand for generative AI. Jassy emphasizes Amazon's commitment to operating like a startup and eliminating bureaucracy to drive innovation and customer value.</p>

            <p>U.S. Treasury yields cooled significantly on Thursday, recovering from a sell-off which bucked the conventional trend for bonds to gain ground as investors move out of equities in search of safer assets. The U.K., plagued by investor concerns over its fiscal outlook, was particularly swept up in the turmoil this week. The yield on U.K. 30-year bonds, which on Wednesday spiked as much as 30 basis points and ended around 25 basis points higher to hit its highest closing level since 1998, tumbled 17 basis points. Markets are rightly assuming that there is a high bar for them to be reinstated at their initial levels. If anything, there's a sense of relief that trade deals with the U.S. are firmly on the table."</p>

Many of them are made in China, which now faces a 125% tariff on its goods imported to the US, under President Donald Trump's controversial trade policy. The effect this may have on the iPhone and its maker Apple is under the spotlight - with some analysts saying if costs are passed onto consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise by hundreds of dollars. Apple have not revealed yet whether they plan to pass on the costs of the tariffs onto consumers in the US and increase prices. Some analysts believe Apple is in a more fortunate position than others, having reaped more money from its products than it has spent on making them.</p>

            <p>The co-executive director of Greenpeace UK, Will McCallum, was arrested along with five other activists after a protest at the US embassy in London. The activists dyed the water outside the embassy red to highlight the "death and devastation" caused by US arms sales to Israel. Greenpeace UK condemned the arrests, calling them proof that the right to protest is under attack in the UK. A spokesperson for the embassy said the stunt "damaged a 1.5 million gallon water supply on the property, wasting a local environmental resource".</p>

            <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in March rose 2.4% on an annual basis, showing progress in the Federal Reserve's battle to bring down inflation to a 2% rate. The CPI was forecast to rise 2.6% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. On a monthly basis, prices actually fell 0.1% in March, the first monthly drop in nearly five years. Easing inflation combined with President Trump's announcement yesterday of a 90-day pause in his reciprocal tariffs should help alleviate some concerns for the Federal Reserve when it meets on May 7 to make its next interest rate decision, said Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank.</p>

            <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson announced Thursday morning that they now "believe they have the votes" to adopt a budget blueprint for President Trump's agenda after failing to muster a majority Wednesday night. He plans to move forward later in the morning with a vote in the lower chamber. The speaker and Senate Majority Leader John Thune assured fiscal hawks that they're aiming for $1.5 trillion in savings, at a minimum. Approving the budget plan in both chambers is the first step in the reconciliation process, which allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate and pass Mr. Trump's agenda with a simple majority.</p>

            <p>President Trump was aware that his broad and steep plan for levies unveiled last week could tip the economy into a recession, but he didn't want a depression, according to a Wednesday night report from paper, citing people familiar with the conversations. Trump also told advisors that he was willing to accept "pain" over the policy, a person who spoke with him on Monday told The Journal. Bond yields soared while equities cratered in the days before Trump said he would rollback some of his retaliatory tariffs on Wednesday. The 10-year Treasury yield overnight Tuesday into Wednesday spiked above 4.5% on speculation a big foreign holder like Japan or China was dumping bonds.</p>

Whitmer, initially intending to discuss the impact of tariffs on Michigan, was praised by Trump during the televised event. The governor's attempt to find common ground with Trump on trade policies has drawn criticism from fellow Democrats, casting doubts on her potential presidential bid in 2028. While her office insists her presence wasn't an endorsement, the event is seen as a misstep that undermines her political momentum.</p>

            <p>OpenAI has filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk, alleging he has engaged in an "unlawful campaign of harassment" against the company. The lawsuit claims Musk has used various means, including press attacks and legal claims, to harm OpenAI after he abandoned the project. OpenAI is seeking punitive damages and an injunction to prevent further interference. Musk's attorney has dismissed the claims, stating that OpenAI is trying to avoid paying fair market value for its assets.

            <p>Major League Baseball owners are considering implementing a salary cap, a move that could lead to a lockout in 2026. The MLBPA has long opposed a salary cap, arguing it restricts player earnings. While the commissioner's office, owners and executives legally can't discuss the upcoming CBA publicly, talk in private of changing the rules has started to heat up. The potential change aims to address spending disparities between teams and promote competitive balance. However, the union remains committed to a free market system for players.</p>
