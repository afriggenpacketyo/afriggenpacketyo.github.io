        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks' social media account posted a critical message aimed at Indiana Fever player Sophie Cunningham following their recent game, sparking online debate. This action stemmed from Cunningham's earlier remarks questioning the fan excitement for WNBA expansion into cities like Detroit and Cleveland, despite her later clarification that she was referring to off-court lifestyle attractions. She defended her comments by emphasizing her roots in a blue-collar background and expressing gratitude for the WNBA's history in these cities, stating her words were misread. The incident highlights ongoing public discourse and differing perspectives within the league regarding its growth, market viability, and the scrutiny faced by players' public statements.</p>

          <p>Three individuals were killed and ten others wounded in an early morning shooting in a South Philadelphia residential neighborhood, prompting a swift police response. Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel reported that the deceased were adults, while two of the injured were juveniles, with numerous rounds fired on the block. One person with a weapon has been taken into custody, though the motive remains unknown, with Bethel labeling the act as "coward, want-to-be-thugs stuff." This incident occurred shortly after police had responded to the same block for a separate event, leading to some arrests, raising concerns about ongoing violence and public safety in the Grays Ferry area.</p>

          <p>Independent analyses, including from Yale and Wharton, indicate President Trump's budget plan will add trillions to the U.S. deficit over the next decade, currently exceeding 6% of GDP without a clear crisis driver. CNBC's "America's Deficit Reckoning" explores potential fallout in markets, the economy, and international relations, with experts like Ray Dalio warning of a 50% chance of trauma. Persistent deficits risk inflation, higher interest rates, and reduced government capacity for emergencies, with future generations bearing the brunt. The article suggests the U.S. has less than 20 years to address its fiscal trajectory before aggressive measures may prove insufficient. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article criticizes the White House's "One Big Beautiful Bill" for its Medicaid work requirement, which is projected to cut $1 trillion in financing and eliminate coverage for 10 million people, despite official denials. Critics argue the requirement will not strengthen the program or boost employment, as most Medicaid recipients already work or have legitimate reasons for not working, such as health issues or caretaking responsibilities. Instead, it will impose billions in bureaucratic costs and cause millions to lose essential health coverage due to burdensome reporting requirements and system failures, potentially leading to fatalities. This policy is framed as an administrative burden designed to push people off benefits rather than genuinely improve their circumstances.</p>

          <p>Recent ARD Deutschlandtrend polls indicate a continued decline in support for Germany's center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), which now polls at 13%, its worst since 1887, following a disappointing federal election. Chancellor Friedrich Merz's CDU/CSU has risen slightly to 30%, while the far-right AfD holds 23% of the vote. Key issues for Germans remain immigration, the economy, and social injustice, with only 11% trusting the SPD most on peace. A majority of respondents also support reintroducing compulsory military service for both men and women, reflecting a national shift towards defense readiness.</p>

While Trump's aggression is a remarkable departure from historical norms, economists argue the Fed's independent structure limits presidential influence, at least in the short term. The Fed chair is one of 12 members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which collectively sets interest rates, and Trump's ability to appoint new members during his term is limited. Experts suggest that despite Trump's desire to replace Powell, the Supreme Court has signaled the president cannot constitutionally fire him, providing some stability to financial markets amidst the political pressure.

Despite nearly 40% of adults not getting enough rest, and the MAHA Commission's report mentioning sleep over 20 times, Kennedy has not outlined a plan for addressing this issue as Health Secretary. The article suggests that sleep is a difficult problem to legislate due to its multifaceted causes—ranging from environmental factors to work schedules—unlike dietary changes which can be influenced by government policy.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new push to strip naturalized U.S. citizens of their citizenship through denaturalization proceedings, prioritizing those deemed national security risks, violent criminals, or those with felony non-disclosures. This move, which has seen potential targets like Elon Musk and Zohran Mamdani, seeks to expand an authority previously limited by the Supreme Court's 1967 Afroyim v. Rusk decision. Critics, including legal scholars, argue this is a "repressive tool" aimed at targeting political speech and chilling all naturalized citizens, echoing McCarthy-era tactics. The use of civil rather than criminal court proceedings also raises significant due process concerns, as individuals are not entitled to an attorney.</p>

          <p>The East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) project in Uganda, led by French energy giant Total and Chinese partners, is displacing approximately 100,000 people, causing profound social and spiritual costs beyond economic benefits. Families are being torn apart by physical barriers and disputes over compensation money, leading to abandonment and destitution for some, like Jacklin, a mother of nine. Environmental and health impacts, such as contaminated water sources from road construction, are also reported, with grievances often unaddressed. Affected residents describe feeling powerless during compensation processes, which they argue undervalue their land and long-term income, reflecting a global pattern in extractive industries where communities bear unseen burdens.</p>

          <p>Tropical Depression Chantal, downgraded after making landfall in South Carolina, brought significant flash flooding to North Carolina, leading to dozens of water rescues. The system, with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph, is now moving northeast, forecast to produce 2 to 4 inches of rain, with localized amounts up to 6 inches, across Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Flood watches are in effect for these areas, and officials in Chapel Hill, N.C., reported over 50 water rescues, with some roads collapsing. While conditions are gradually improving in some affected North Carolina counties, dangerous surf and rip currents are expected along the mid-Atlantic coast for the next few days, underscoring the continued threat.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are set to meet, celebrating their recent joint strikes on Iran, but the primary focus will shift to the challenging goal of ending the Gaza war. Despite appearing united after their shared success, achieving a ceasefire in Gaza remains a complex hurdle, with Hamas demanding a full Israeli withdrawal, which Netanyahu opposes for military defeat. Trump, openly coveting a Nobel Peace Prize, has pressured both sides to conclude the conflict, which has caused immense suffering and deepened Israel's international isolation. The meeting may give new urgency to a U.S. ceasefire proposal, but the outcome hinges on balancing internal political pressures and broader regional visions for Middle East peace.</p>

          <p>Parents experiencing a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy will soon be legally entitled to bereavement leave, a significant change to the Employment Rights Bill. Currently, leave is only available for losses after 24 weeks or the death of a child under 18. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated this amendment aims to give "people time away from work to grieve" without feeling pressured to return before ready. While the exact length and eligibility details are still under consultation, this move is hailed as a crucial step towards recognizing early pregnancy loss as a profound bereavement, addressing a long-standing taboo, and validating the emotional impact on families, as highlighted by campaigners like Myleene Klass.</p>

          <p>Twelve Turkish soldiers have died from methane gas poisoning while searching a cave in northern Iraq for a comrade killed by Kurdish fighters three years prior. The Defense Ministry initially reported eight deaths, later raising the toll, after 19 personnel were exposed to the substance. The incident occurred in the "Claw-Lock Operation region," an area targeted against the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), where the cave had previously served as a field hospital. Methane, a colorless, odorless, and flammable gas, can cause asphyxiation. Other soldiers exposed to the gas were hospitalized, underscoring the hazardous conditions faced by recovery teams in the long-running conflict between Turkey and the PKK.</p>

          <p>The White House suggests some countries negotiating trade deals in good faith might see their tariff deadlines extended beyond President Trump’s impending cutoff, which could otherwise lead to higher tariffs by August 1. Stephen Miran, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, indicated that while higher tariffs are expected for non-compliant nations, those making concessions could receive a "roll" on the date. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, however, sharply criticized Trump's "one big beautiful bill," warning of higher inflation, reduced American competitiveness, and minimal revenue gains compared to its substantial costs. He called the bill a "shameful act" that poses a huge risk to the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite policymakers acknowledging cutthroat competition as a concern, attempts to revive inflation by trimming supply and reducing overcapacity have shown limited results.

Chávez, son of the legendary Julio César Chávez Sr., was recently arrested in California by ICE agents citing cartel affiliations, multiple criminal convictions, and an active Mexican arrest warrant for weapons trafficking and organized crime. The indictment claims Chávez Jr. would beat captured rivals, tied and hanged, as if they were punchbags, based on intercepted phone calls. His arrest and these disturbing allegations highlight the deep ties between organized crime and high-profile figures in Mexico, further complicated by his expired U.S. visa.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar has seen its worst decline since 1973, falling over 10% this year, leading some investors to question America's long-term financial might. This slump, despite a strong U.S. economy, is attributed by some to chaotic Trump administration policies like tariffs and attacks on the Federal Reserve, along with ballooning national debt. While critics like Kenneth Rogoff see it as an "accelerant" to a broader shift away from dollar dominance towards a "tri-polar system" with the euro and yuan, proponents argue it's a natural re-adjustment with benefits for U.S. exporters and domestic tourism.
