          <p>Xi Jinping has strategically positioned China to dominate global supply chains, aiming to counter foreign pressure and assert economic power. By increasing exports and state-backed lending, China has become the world's leading manufacturing base, using export controls and antimonopoly laws as economic weapons. This approach challenges U.S. supremacy and forces countries to choose sides, though it comes at a cost to China's own economy and international relations.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's representatives have responded to a US court summons, stating she is being brought into a legal dispute between Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively for "tabloid clickbait." The summons alleges Swift encouraged Baldoni to accept script re-writes by Lively for the film 'It Ends With Us,' which is at the center of a sexual harassment case.
