          <p>A magnitude 3.0 earthquake occurred Saturday night, with its epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. The minor tremor caused brief shaking across parts of the New York City area, startling residents but resulting in no reported injuries or significant structural damage. While this event was relatively small, it follows a much larger and rare 4.8 magnitude earthquake that shook the region in April 2024. U.S. Geological Survey analysts reassured the public that such events, while infrequent on the East Coast, are not unexpected and this quake posed little cause for alarm.</p>

          <p>French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prévot secured a historic victory in the Tour de France Femmes, finishing over three minutes ahead of her closest competitor. The 33-year-old's win marks the first time a Frenchwoman has won the prestigious race since its modern reestablishment four years ago, fulfilling a childhood dream. After focusing on cross-country cycling for several years, Ferrand-Prévot shifted back to road racing this season specifically to compete in the Tour. Her victory is a culmination of a season that also saw her win the Paris-Roubaix race in April.</p>

          <p>Over 3,200 unionized workers at Boeing's St. Louis defense facilities are set to strike after rejecting the company's latest contract offer. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union stated the proposal was insufficient and did not adequately reflect the members' skill and dedication. These employees are responsible for assembling critical military aircraft, including fighter jets and the MQ-25 aerial refueling drone for the U.S. Navy. This action marks the first strike at Boeing's St. Louis defense hub in nearly three decades, impacting a key part of the nation's defense manufacturing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has surpassed California in new utility-scale solar energy capacity, a significant shift driven primarily by large utility companies rather than rooftop installations. Favorable state regulations that fast-track projects under 75 megawatts have spurred this growth, making solar an increasingly cheaper option than natural gas for industrial power. Despite the state government removing climate change from official policy, the economic benefits are fueling the boom. However, the industry faces future headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits and growing grid capacity challenges that require significant infrastructure investment.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced plans to impose prison sentences of up to five years on people smugglers who use social media to advertise illegal immigration services. This move aims to combat the criminal gangs that promote dangerous crossings of the English Channel online, a method used by a large majority of the record 25,000 people who have made the journey this year. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper condemned the "immoral" practice of selling false promises for profit. The new policy is part of the Labour government's broader strategy to address the "small boats" crisis.</p>

Despite playing in a hitter-friendly ballpark, the team struggled to score for much of the weekend series. Key moments in Sunday's win included an aggressive send from the third base coach, a swinging-bunt single by Shohei Ohtani, and a crucial double-steal.

Responding to the administration's plans, she argued that the $50 billion rural hospital fund is a drop in the bucket compared to the nearly $900 billion being cut from Medicaid, which she called "catastrophic." With two in five New Mexicans on Medicaid, the governor expressed deep concern that the changes will lead to hospital closures and a collapse in healthcare access.</p>

          <p>A 20-foot Minke whale has died in New Jersey's Barnegat Bay after being struck by a boat on Saturday afternoon. The collision nearly capsized the vessel and threw a passenger overboard, though the person was reportedly unharmed. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center confirmed the whale's death after it came to rest on a shallow sandbar. Due to tidal conditions, the carcass will be moved on Monday to a nearby state park, where a necropsy will be performed to determine the full extent of its injuries and cause of death.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The trade relationship between the U.S. and Canada is under strain after a self-imposed deadline for a new deal passed and the Trump administration imposed a 35% tariff rate on certain Canadian goods. While nearly 90% of Canadian exports can enter the U.S. duty-free under the existing CUSMA/USMCA agreement, key sectors like steel and aluminum are being hurt. Canadian officials have expressed disappointment but remain committed to negotiations, hoping to leverage the integrated nature of the two economies. The Trump administration has justified the tariffs by citing other issues, including security and fentanyl flows. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major restaurant chains are increasingly introducing spicy menu items in an effort to attract Gen Z and Gen Alpha customers, who show a strong preference for bold flavors. Brands like Chipotle, Cava, and Wendy's are launching spicy sauces, sides, and main dishes as a low-cost, high-return way to generate buzz and drive sales amid slower consumer spending. This trend is heavily fueled by social media platforms like TikTok, where spicy food challenges and taste tests can quickly go viral.

          <p>The Swiss government is considering revising its trade offer to the United States after President Trump imposed a surprisingly high 39% tariff on the country's goods. Swiss Business Minister Guy Parmelin stated the cabinet will hold a special meeting to understand the decision and formulate a response before the tariffs take effect on August 7. Experts warn the duties could push Switzerland's export-oriented economy into a recession. Options being considered include increasing purchases of U.S. liquefied natural gas and encouraging more investment by Swiss companies in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A coalition of seven U.S. railroad customer associations is urging regulators to block the proposed $85 billion merger between Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern. The groups have expressed significant concerns that the deal, which would create the first coast-to-coast freight rail operator, would concentrate too much market power. They argue the merged entity could unilaterally raise prices and reduce service standards for shippers of everything from grain to automobiles. This opposition adds to that from major rail unions and some political leaders, who fear the consequences of further consolidation. (not investment advice)</p>

McEntarfer was fired after the agency released a July jobs report with low growth and significant downward revisions, which the president claimed were "faked" for political reasons. Her dismissal was criticized by her predecessor, who called it a "dangerous precedent" that undermines the agency's mission.</p>
