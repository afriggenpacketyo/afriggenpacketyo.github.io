          <p>A study reveals that nearly half of Japanese workers in their 20s are "quiet quitting," prioritizing personal time and work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay, a stark contrast to previous generations. Many young Japanese workers have witnessed their parents sacrifice their lives for their companies, working excessive overtime and neglecting their personal lives, which has motivated them to seek a different path. This shift is also influenced by the pandemic, which prompted some to re-evaluate their priorities and question the concept of lifetime commitment to a single company. Experts view this change positively, suggesting it could lead to a healthier economy and address the country's shrinking population.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers persevered against the New York Mets in a 13-inning marathon, winning 7-5, but the game highlighted ongoing concerns about the team's pitching depth. A rain delay shortened Clayton Kershaw's start, and the bullpen was stretched thin, with nearly every reliever used. Despite holding a lead, closer Tanner Scott blew a save in the ninth, forcing extra innings. Teoscar Hernández's RBI double in the 13th ultimately secured the win for the Dodgers, but the team faces potential consequences from overusing its pitching staff during a demanding stretch of the season.</p>

          <p>A former people smuggler detailed to the BBC how he used yachts to transport Vietnamese migrants into private marinas across southeast England, highlighting security vulnerabilities. He described private marinas as having minimal security, making them easy targets for smuggling operations. The smuggler also explained how he smuggled Albanian people in cars onto ferries, where they would then jump into lorries mid-journey in the English Channel. He claims that the smuggling routes were "easy" and "low risk," and is speaking out now because he is angry that he was jailed for a crime that is still very possible to commit.</p>

          <p>South Africa has downgraded Taiwan's representative office, relocating it from Pretoria to Johannesburg, as it strengthens its relationship with Beijing. This move underscores a deepening alignment between African nations and China, driven by strong economic ties. Taiwan's Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung disputes the relocation. Meanwhile, Somalia has banned Taiwanese passport holders, seen as retaliation for Taiwan's growing ties with Somaliland, Somalia's breakaway region. Taiwan's presence in Africa is diminishing, with eSwatini being its only official diplomatic ally on the continent.</p>

          <p>Germany's commitment to confronting its Nazi past is often selective, embracing it when it enhances the country's self-image but ignoring it when it threatens personal gain or strategic interests. Despite widespread condemnation of the far-right AfD, Germany continues to award the Herbert Quandt Media Prize, named after an early SS supporter who profited from Nazi war crimes. This highlights a broader reluctance to confront the depths of societal entanglement with state violence and genocide. While Germany emphasizes historical responsibility to avoid challenging Israel's actions in Gaza, it often overlooks its own historical complicity and ongoing injustices.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's financial system is crucial for China to advance the internationalization of the yuan, also known as the renminbi (RMB), amid geopolitical tensions and discussions on de-dollarisation. Businesses in Qatar are keen to take advantage of the yuan by using a "toolbox" available in Hong Kong, such as settlement, payment, hedging and swaps. This trend showcases that the US’ trade war has spilled over to the financial market, prompting more countries and businesses to consider alternatives to the dominant US dollar in international trades, payments and investments. This urgency to “de-dollarise” dovetails with China’s effort to internationalise its currency, a strategy that dates back to the 2008 financial crisis.</p>

However, Andy Bell, the CEO of the Centre for Mental Health, is sceptical of the scheme because it is untested and calls for better funding of NHS mental health services.

Despite the police department recently pausing automated alerts from Project N.O.L.A., a private organization operating facial recognition cameras, the technology was used to recapture one of the fugitives. Critics, including the ACLU, raise concerns about the constitutional and privacy implications of live facial recognition, calling for a halt to the program.

          <p>Laura Piani's "Jane Austen Wrecked My Life" is a warm romance about a lonely bookstore clerk, Agathe, who gets an opportunity to attend a Jane Austen Residency. Agathe is picked up by Oliver, a handsome descendant of Jane Austen, with whom she develops a connection. The film is romantic about literature, writing, and poetry, as much as it is about love. It explores the idea that writing can help individuals open their hearts and welcome new opportunities. The film is a balm for any battered romantic’s soul, as it is utter fantasy, but it’s the kind of escape you’ll want to revisit again and again.</p>

Álvarez's U.S. work visa was previously revoked in 2017 due to alleged ties to a drug trafficker, but he was removed from the sanctions list in 2022 and regained his visa in 2025.</p>

          <p>Faced with record high prices for domestic rice, Japanese supermarket operators are increasing sales of cheaper, foreign-grown rice to offer consumers more affordable options. Aeon Co. will begin selling California-sourced rice at a significantly lower price than Japanese-grown rice. Other retailers like Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co. have also seen solid demand for rice from California and Taiwan. The move aims to address consumer concerns about rising prices and potential shortages of the country's staple food, and U.S. Ambassador to Japan George Glass called the sale of the U.S.-grown rice by Aeon "historic" for American farmers.</p>

          <p>With the UK set to ban disposable vapes starting June 1st, many vapers are stockpiling the products before they become illegal to sell. The ban is intended to reduce environmental impact and curb youth vaping. However, some former smokers say disposable vapes helped them quit cigarettes, and they worry about the transition to rechargeable devices. Some retailers have seen sales of popular vape flavors double in recent weeks, while others fear the ban will drive customers back to smoking cigarettes. The government hopes reusable vapes will continue to offer a healthier alternative to cigarettes, but others argue environmental concerns are trumping public health concerns.</p>

Akazawa strongly urged the removal of additional tariffs imposed on Japan. While the U.S. and Japan agreed to continue close ministerial discussions, preliminary trade agreements suggest that Trump has no plans to roll back his administration's baseline tariff on imports from nearly all countries.</p>

          <p>Karan Kandhari's "Sister Midnight" is a gritty comedy about Uma, a restless housewife in Mumbai, who embarks on a series of nocturnal adventures. The film explores Uma's urban malaise and her hidden strength. Though the movie ultimately can’t square its episodic unpredictability with the bubbling feminist-outlaw energy at its core, that’s less a bug than a feature. Kandhari captures a pulpy mood of big-city dislocation, building a trippy, jarring and blackly funny experience out of a city’s stray colors, sounds and personalities.</p>

The Pentagon Press Association has criticized the move as an attack on freedom of the press. Hegseth has taken an adversarial posture towards the news media since his arrival, and the investigation also developed a criminal component after allegedly classified information about flexible options for the US military to take control of the Panama canal, including by sending US troops, emerged in news reports.</p>
