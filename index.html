          <p>An appeals court in New York has overturned the monetary penalty of over $500 million imposed on Donald Trump and his company in a civil fraud case, deeming it an "excessive fine" under the U.S. Constitution. The court, however, upheld the original ruling that Trump and other defendants committed business fraud by inflating asset values to secure better financial terms. While non-monetary sanctions remain in place, the state's Attorney General has announced plans to appeal the decision regarding the fine to New York's highest court.</p>

          <p>The rainbow crosswalk memorializing the 49 victims of the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando has been painted over by the state of Florida. Orlando's mayor condemned the action as a "cruel political act," stating the memorial was safe and had been installed by the state itself. This removal follows a Florida Department of Transportation memo prohibiting "surface art" with social or political messages on public roads, a move that has drawn criticism from survivors and local officials.</p>

The five-year project, which will serve clients like Regeneron and Johnson & Johnson, underscores the difficulty of quickly shifting supply chains in response to potential tariffs from the Trump administration. While companies were already increasing U.S. manufacturing due to tax incentives, the complexity and long timelines involved show that outrunning new trade policies will be a formidable challenge for the industry.</p>

While stationed on the U.S.S. Essex in San Diego, Wei provided photographs, videos, and technical data about the warship's weapons and vulnerabilities. Prosecutors stated Wei used encrypted apps and admitted his actions constituted espionage upon his arrest. His defense argued he was young and naive, believing the low-level information sold had no impact on national security.</p>

The pilot program, dubbed "Zipotle," will use Zipline's aircraft, which can hover 300 feet in the air and lower orders to the ground via a robot. This initiative aims to enhance the customer experience and appeal to a younger, tech-savvy consumer base as the fast-casual restaurant industry faces slowing sales. The company suggests that the wide coverage radius of drones could make a national expansion relatively straightforward.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice is set to investigate Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook after receiving a criminal referral from a Trump administration housing official. The referral, initiated by FHFA Director Bill Pulte, accuses Cook of potential mortgage fraud related to claims of primary residence on two different properties. In a letter to Fed Chair Jerome Powell, a DOJ attorney urged Cook's removal, though Powell lacks the authority to fire a governor. Cook has stated she will not be bullied into resigning and is gathering information to respond to the allegations.</p>

Menendez's defense maintains he acted in self-defense after years of abuse, while the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office strongly opposes his release, arguing he has not taken full responsibility.

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. increased by 2% in July compared to June, defying analyst expectations of a decline. The rise is attributed to a temporary dip in mortgage rates during May and June when these sales contracts were likely signed.

          <p>The Israeli military has issued warnings to medical officials and international aid organizations to prepare for a planned evacuation of Gaza City's one million residents ahead of an anticipated ground offensive. The military stated that hospitals in southern Gaza are being prepared to receive patients, but Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry and the UN have rejected the plan, vowing to remain to help those unable to leave. The move comes as indirect ceasefire talks have broken down and Israel's Prime Minister prepares to approve plans to occupy the entire Gaza Strip.</p>

          <h2>Global Study Finds Artificial Light Is Extending Birds' Daily Activity by Nearly an Hour</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 14:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive global study analyzing millions of birdsong recordings has found that light pollution is significantly altering the daily routines of birds. Researchers discovered that artificial light causes birds to begin vocalizing about 20 minutes earlier in the morning and cease 30 minutes later in the evening, effectively lengthening their day by an average of 50 minutes. The study, which covered over 500 species, noted that birds with larger eyes, like the American Robin, were most affected. The long-term consequences of this extended activity on bird health and reproduction remain unknown.</p>

          <p>In a significant diplomatic development, high-level officials from Syria and Israel have held direct, US-brokered talks in Paris for the first time in decades. The discussions focused on de-escalating tensions, reactivating a 1974 disengagement agreement, and providing humanitarian aid to Syria's Druze minority. The two nations have technically been at war since 1967, and tensions have been high since the fall of the Assad regime. While observers see this as a potential step toward regional stability, the prospect of full normalization of ties remains distant.</p>

          <p>A resident of South Lake Tahoe, California, has tested positive for the plague and is currently recovering at home under medical care. Health officials believe the individual was likely infected after being bitten by a flea while camping in the area. Plague is naturally present in California's higher elevations, transmitted by fleas from wild rodents like squirrels and chipmunks. While human cases are rare, they can be serious if not treated promptly with antibiotics. This is the first confirmed human case in El Dorado county since 2020.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, is moving away from the North Carolina coast after bringing tropical storm conditions and dangerous surf to the Outer Banks. While the hurricane is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., its powerful winds and large size are generating life-threatening surf and rip currents along most of the East Coast. Storm surge warnings and some evacuation orders remain in effect for parts of North Carolina. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that Erin will gradually weaken and become a post-tropical storm by the weekend.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to join police and National Guard members on patrol in Washington, D.C., on Thursday night as part of his administration's anti-crime initiative.

The administration claims 630 arrests have been made and 86 illegal guns seized, and Trump asserts that residents feel safer. However, local police data indicates that violent crime in the district has been on a downward trend for the past year and a half.</p>

The number of asylum seekers housed in hotels has risen slightly, posing an ongoing challenge for the Labour government's pledge to clear the backlog and end hotel use.</p>

The statement aligns China with the government of Nicolás Maduro, who recently met with China's ambassador to praise their joint projects.

The news wiped nearly £600 million off the company's market value and has drawn comparisons to a previous accounting scandal at Tesco. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New data from the UK's GCSE results day reveals a record number of students aged 17 and older are resitting their Maths and English exams, prompting concerns of a "resit crisis." In England, students who do not achieve a passing grade at age 16 must continue to study and retake the exams, but pass rates for these resits are low. Education leaders suggest the curriculum may be too demanding and that many students are falling behind on fundamental skills much earlier in their education. This places a significant logistical and financial strain on colleges that facilitate the resits.</p>
