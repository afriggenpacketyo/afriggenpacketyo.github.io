          <p>In a symbolic "passing of the torch" moment, Cody Rhodes defeated John Cena in a street fight to reclaim the Undisputed WWE Championship at SummerSlam. The match, held at MetLife Stadium, was a violent and dramatic affair, featuring multiple signature moves and the use of foreign objects. After a grueling back-and-forth battle that saw both competitors push their limits, Rhodes ultimately secured the victory with three Cross Rhodes finishers. The event concluded with Cena acknowledging the crowd, signaling a potential end to his era while cementing Rhodes's position at the top.</p>

          <p>According to an Israeli official, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is advocating for a "military solution" to rescue the approximately 20 living hostages still held by Hamas. This shift in strategy comes from a growing belief within the Israeli government that Hamas is not interested in a diplomatic agreement for their release. The push for expanded military operations occurs as thousands of protesters in Tel Aviv continue to demand the government prioritize the hostages' safe return. The situation is compounded by a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with international organizations reporting critical levels of hunger and malnutrition.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotechnology companies Innovent and BeOne are projected to achieve profitability in 2025, marking a significant milestone for the country's biotech startup sector. Innovent, which went public in 2018 under a Hong Kong rule allowing pre-profit companies to list, is expected to see substantial revenue from its new weight-loss drug, mazdutide. This development signals a maturation of the Chinese biotech industry, suggesting that leading firms are becoming financially self-sufficient and are no longer solely reliant on investor funding to operate and grow.

          <p>The UK's Home Office has allocated an extra £100 million to intensify efforts against people-smuggling gangs operating across the English Channel, as a record number of people have made the crossing this year. The funding will support up to 300 new National Crime Agency officers and advanced technology to disrupt the criminal networks. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the investment would help track and dismantle the gangs, though opposition parties have criticized the move as insufficient. This comes as the government also plans to introduce new legislation criminalizing the online promotion of illegal immigration services.</p>

Two other girls, ages 7 and 13, also died in the crash, while another was injured but has since been released from the hospital. The U.S. Coast Guard is leading a thorough investigation into the tragic collision, with participation from international authorities as one of the victims was from Argentina.</p>

          <p>A group of more than 50 Democratic legislators have left Texas to break the state House's quorum, aiming to block a special session focused on passing a new congressional map. Republicans, who control the legislature, have proposed a map that could create up to five new GOP-leaning districts. In response to the walkout, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton called for the fleeing lawmakers to be found, arrested, and returned to the Capitol. This marks the third time in recent years that Texas Democrats have used this tactic to halt Republican legislative priorities, running out the clock on the session.</p>

          <p>A riot at the Taxpan prison in the eastern Mexican state of Veracruz has resulted in the deaths of seven inmates and left eleven others injured, according to regional authorities. The unrest reportedly began on Saturday, fueled by inmate anger over alleged extortion and abuse by members of the Grupo Sombra criminal organization within the facility. This event highlights ongoing issues in Mexico's prison system, including overcrowding and the significant influence of gangs and drug cartels. The Tuxpan prison was already operating over its designed capacity, a common problem contributing to instability in the country's penal system.</p>

          <p>On the island of Ninoshima, south of Hiroshima, efforts persist to find the remains of thousands who died there in the aftermath of the 1945 atomic bombing. In the chaotic days following the attack, an estimated 10,000 victims were transported to the island, but most perished and were buried in unmarked locations. Researchers and locals continue to search for these remains, driven by a desire to provide closure for surviving family members and properly honor the dead. Recent discoveries include about 100 bone fragments, among them an infant's jaw bone, underscoring the lingering, deeply personal impact of the war.</p>

          <p>Drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine, a team of Chinese aerospace engineers has proposed a new technology to dramatically improve drone survivability against missile attacks. The concept involves fitting small drones with side-mounted rocket boosters that can execute high-G, last-second maneuvers to evade incoming projectiles. According to digital simulations published in a Chinese defense journal, this "terminal evasion" system could increase a drone's survival rate to nearly 90 percent. This innovation reflects a direct response to battlefield data showing that improved air defenses are becoming more effective at neutralizing unmanned aerial vehicles.</p>

Animal rights activists have documented the network's horrific scale, estimating a new video of cat torture is uploaded every 14 hours.

          <p>The practice of egg freezing is rapidly gaining popularity among American women seeking to preserve their fertility, with some viewing it as revolutionary as the birth control pill. The procedure allows women to freeze their eggs at a younger age, providing an "insurance policy" against future fertility decline and reducing the pressure to have children before they are ready. However, the process is expensive, often costing over $12,000 per cycle plus storage fees, and is not a guarantee of a future baby. Bioethicists caution that it is a gamble and raises societal questions about delaying motherhood.</p>

          <p>Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, predicts that artificial intelligence is on an exponential curve of progress and could achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) within the next decade. He believes AI will revolutionize human health, potentially curing all diseases, and could lead to an era of "radical abundance" by eliminating scarcity. Hassabis also acknowledges the significant risks, including misuse by bad actors and the challenge of ensuring advanced AI remains aligned with human values. He stresses the need for international coordination and robust safety guardrails as these powerful systems are developed and integrated into daily life.</p>

          <p>Economist Jeffrey Sachs has stated that the United States initiated the trade war with China and that its continued sabre-rattling could become a self-fulfilling prophecy of conflict. He argues that the U.S. learned it cannot impose its will on China and that a measure of rationality should prevail due to the mutual benefits of trade. Sachs advises that China should focus its export growth on markets in Africa, Asia, and Latin America rather than relying on the U.S. and Europe. He views China as a key partner in the global transition to zero-carbon energy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash plume miles into the sky. The eruption occurred just days after a powerful magnitude 8.8 earthquake shook the region. Seismologists suggest the volcanic activity could be linked to the quake, as the seismic waves may have disturbed the magma system of a volcano that was already near eruption. The event prompted an aviation alert, but the sparsely populated area is not under direct threat, and reserve employees have been evacuated as a precaution.</p>

This comes during a difficult week for the 25-year-old athlete, who was arrested over a domestic violence allegation involving her boyfriend.

This arrangement, negotiated by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), grants the president veto power over major operational changes, such as factory closures or salary reductions. While not a literal equity stake, it represents an expansion of CFIUS's role into broader economic security, reflecting a trend of increased government intervention in deals with national strategic importance.

          <p>World Athletics has approved new regulations requiring athletes in the female category to undergo genetic testing to confirm their biological sex, reigniting a long-standing and complex debate. This policy formalizes and combines previous rules for transgender athletes and those with differences in sex development (DSD). Critics argue that such policies are invasive, unscientific, and unfairly target certain women, while proponents claim they are necessary to protect the fairness of the female category. The move puts World Athletics at odds with the International Olympic Committee's framework, which emphasizes inclusion and non-discrimination.</p>
