          <p>The Trump administration has formally announced new tariffs on nearly 70 U.S. trading partners, with rates ranging from 10% to over 40%. The executive order, signed just before an August 1 deadline, delays the implementation for seven days to allow for customs processing. The tariff rates are largely determined by the trade deficit the U.S. holds with each nation, with higher deficits leading to higher tariffs. The move is part of a broader strategy to renegotiate global trade rules, which has included separate, higher tariffs on major partners like Canada, and ongoing negotiations with Mexico and China.</p>

The article explores the experiences of people who have integrated AI companions into their lives for friendship and romance, highlighting how these bots can alleviate loneliness but also raise significant ethical concerns. While some users find a supportive, non-judgmental presence, experts and victims' advocates worry about the potential for emotional dependency, manipulation, and the tragic consequences seen in cases where AI interactions have been linked to self-harm. This trend coincides with a reported loneliness epidemic and prompts a debate on the future of human connection.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United has turned down an opening offer from Liverpool for their 25-year-old striker, Alexander Isak. While the exact amount of Liverpool's bid has not been confirmed, it reportedly falls short of Newcastle's valuation of approximately £150 million. Isak, who was left out of Newcastle's pre-season tour, is said to be exploring a potential move and is currently training alone. Liverpool manager Arne Slot is keen on adding the Sweden international to his squad before the start of the new season, but it remains uncertain if an improved offer will be made.</p>

          <p>Moderna has revised its full-year 2025 revenue projection, lowering the upper end of its forecast to a range between $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion. The adjustment stems from a delay in Covid vaccine shipments to the United Kingdom, which will now occur in early 2026 instead of late 2025. Despite the lowered outlook, the company's second-quarter results surpassed Wall Street expectations, with a smaller-than-anticipated loss and higher revenue, attributed to significant cost-cutting measures, including a planned 10% reduction in its workforce. The total value of the UK contract remains unchanged. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a social media post, former President Donald Trump singled out Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine, advising his supporters to oppose her legislative positions. He suggested that voting the opposite of how she does is generally a reliable strategy for Republicans. The post highlights a history of disagreement, noting Collins' votes against key Trump-backed legislation and nominees, as well as her 2021 vote to convict him following his impeachment. This public criticism underscores ongoing tensions within the Republican party and Trump's continued influence over its base and direction.</p>

For example, a preferred seat on a peak travel route could cost over $40 each way, while extra-legroom seats could be nearly $100. This shift, along with new baggage fees, aligns Southwest with its competitors and follows pressure from investors to increase revenue, marking a major change in its half-century-old business model.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese President William Lai has pledged to continue negotiations with the United States after a 20% tariff was imposed on Taiwanese exports. This rate, part of a broader set of U.S. tariffs on various trading partners, is lower than an earlier threat of 32% but higher than the 15% secured by regional economies like Japan and South Korea. President Lai described the current levy as a temporary, phased outcome of ongoing talks. He expressed hope that further discussions would lead to a more reasonable and favorable rate for Taiwan, emphasizing the U.S. government's willingness to continue the dialogue.</p>

          <p>Chevron reported a significant 44% drop in its second-quarter net income, which fell to $2.49 billion, impacted by lower crude oil prices and a financial loss related to its recent acquisition of Hess Corporation.

The oil major achieved record worldwide production of 3.4 million barrels per day, with U.S. output seeing an 8% jump. The completed Hess acquisition is expected to boost earnings starting in the fourth quarter and contribute to a goal of $1 billion in annual cost reductions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>EU to Implement Biometric Border Checks Starting in October, Replacing Passport Stamps</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 06:39:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union will begin phasing out traditional passport stamps in favor of a new biometric Entry/Exit System (EES) starting October 12. Under the new rules, non-EU travelers, including those from the UK, will need to have their fingerprints and facial images scanned to cross an EU border. This data will be registered and remain valid for three years, intended to streamline future crossings. The system aims to enhance border security, but it has raised concerns about potential initial delays, with the UK government warning travelers to be prepared for longer wait times during the rollout period.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's demand that India cease importing Russian oil could severely impact Russia's revenue and potentially trigger a retaliatory response from Moscow, such as shutting down a major U.S.-led pipeline. India has become Russia's largest oil customer, and a disruption to this trade could force a massive realignment of global energy flows in an already tight market. Analysts suggest that if this critical income stream is cut, Russia might halt the CPC pipeline from Kazakhstan, which is crucial for Western oil majors like Chevron and Exxon, potentially causing a significant spike in global oil prices.

          <p>The daughter of a 79-year-old woman who died in a car crash in Cornwall is advocating for an overhaul of the UK's regulations for older drivers. She believes her mother's death could have been prevented if rules were stricter, citing that her mother had been struggling to drive but felt dependent on her car. Currently, drivers must self-declare medical conditions and renew their license every three years after age 70. With an aging population, road safety experts and some medical professionals support mandatory health referrals and vision checks to ensure fitness to drive, though some elderly drivers see it as a threat to their independence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a recent poll showing the Democratic Party's favorability at a 35-year low, a deeper analysis suggests its position may not be as dire as it appears. Much of the low approval is driven by disaffected but loyal Democratic voters, a common trend for a party after an election loss. However, the party faces significant long-term challenges, including a weaker standing than in 2017 and a difficult path to regaining a Senate majority due to the electoral map favoring more rural, Republican-leaning states. This structural disadvantage means Democrats may struggle to fully control the federal government even with national popular vote victories.</p>

          <p>Having an emergency fund significantly reduces the likelihood that individuals will tap into their 401(k) retirement savings prematurely, according to new research from Vanguard. The study found that investors with at least $2,000 in a rainy-day fund are much less likely to take out 401(k) loans or make hardship withdrawals. This is particularly crucial for hourly workers, who have more volatile incomes and are more prone to early withdrawals. Experts emphasize that these emergency funds act as a vital buffer, preventing the long-term damage to retirement security caused by so-called "leakage" from retirement plans.

          <p>The UK's Met Office has officially named Storm Floris, which is expected to hit the country on Monday with strong winds and heavy rain. It is the fifth named storm of the season and the first since January. Forecasts predict the storm will track across the northern UK, with the most disruptive winds, potentially gusting between 60 and 80 mph, affecting southern and western areas. Due to trees being in full leaf, there is an increased risk of falling branches and power disruption. Travelers are advised to stay updated on forecasts as the storm's exact path will determine the severity of its impact.</p>

          <p>In an effort to increase social mobility within Whitehall, the UK government has announced that its main civil service internship program will now be exclusively for university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. A student's eligibility will be determined by their parents' occupations when they were 14. Successful interns will then be given priority for the Fast Stream, the primary graduate entry route into the civil service. The move, driven by minister Pat McFadden, aims to ensure the civil service better reflects the country it serves, though it has drawn criticism for what some call "leftist social engineering."</p>

After six years of research, tests have confirmed the process is safe for the animals but effective in tracking the illicit trade.

While federal tax incentives for hydrogen are set to expire, project developers are relying on state-level regulations and grants to move forward.

          <p>An abandoned Southern California Edison power line suspected of starting the deadly Eaton fire could have been removed years ago under a safety rule that was weakened after opposition from utility companies. In 2001, state regulators proposed forcing utilities to remove old lines, but after years of industry-funded workshops and lobbying, the rule was diluted to let companies decide when a line was "permanently abandoned." This allowed hundreds of miles of potentially hazardous, inactive lines to remain in place across California. A former regulator stated the fire, which killed 19 people, could have been prevented if the original, stronger rule had been adopted.</p>

Critics argue the panel used poorly controlled or debunked studies and failed to adequately address the known dangers of untreated depression in pregnant women, which include suicide and preterm birth.
