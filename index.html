          <p>Jafar Panahi, an Iranian filmmaker, defied a 20-year ban and presented his latest film, "It Was Just an Accident," at the Cannes Film Festival.  The film, shot clandestinely, directly confronts state violence and repression in Iran, featuring unveiled women in defiance of the hijab law.  Panahi's return to Cannes after two decades is a powerful testament to his artistic resilience and a condemnation of the Iranian regime's censorship. His work is a poignant reflection of the ongoing struggle for freedom of expression in Iran.</p>

          <p>California initiated a project to create new wetlands on the receding Salton Sea shoreline, aiming to restore habitats and control dust pollution.

The project, delayed for years, will initially cover 2,000 acres and is expected to expand to over 9,000 acres with additional federal funding.  This is a significant step towards fulfilling the state's commitments made in 2003.</p>
