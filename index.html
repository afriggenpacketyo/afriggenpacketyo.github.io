          <p>Swarthmore College's pro-Palestinian encampment was dismantled by police, resulting in the arrest of nine activists who were protesting the college's ties to Cisco. The college president cited safety concerns and the presence of unaffiliated individuals as reasons for seeking law enforcement assistance. Students were suspended without due process for violating college policies by erecting the encampment, which called for divestment from companies linked to the Israeli government. The crackdown occurred amid increased scrutiny of campus protests and punitive measures from the Trump administration, though activists remain steadfast in their cause, drawing perspective from the destruction of educational institutions in Palestine.</p>

          <p>As Europe commemorates VE Day, there are concerns about transatlantic relations, particularly in light of President Trump's approach to Russia and NATO. The article examines the historical context of allied ties after World War II, noting that Russia was never a true friend of the West. Trump's apparent respect for Putin and threats to traditionally close allies have shocked many Europeans, leading to fears that the U.S. may abandon them. The war in Ukraine has heightened these anxieties, with some viewing Trump's actions as emboldening Putin and undermining European security.</p>

          <h2>Reform Party's Triumph in Local Elections: More Than Just a Protest Vote</h2>

          <p>Reform performed well in recent local council elections, winning the most votes and seats, and gaining overall control of several councils. The party's success is attributed to its popularity among those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and Boris Johnson in 2019, indicating it is more than a short-lived protest vote. Reform's appeal is concentrated among those who believe the Brexit decision was right, and its support is stronger in working-class areas with more conservative views on immigration. Both the Conservatives and Labour face challenges in regaining support from this segment of the electorate.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition. The bill provides most students attending accredited private schools with $10,000 per year, while students with disabilities receive up to $30,000 per year. Democrats argue that the legislation will hurt public schools and primarily benefit wealthier students already in private schools.
