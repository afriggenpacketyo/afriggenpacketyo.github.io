          <p>A farm worker has died from injuries after falling from a greenhouse roof during an immigration raid at a California cannabis farm. The incident, which led to the arrest of about 200 undocumented migrants, has intensified debates over the Trump administration's immigration tactics. In response to protests, President Trump authorized law enforcement to use necessary means against demonstrators, while a federal judge has since temporarily restricted certain aggressive arrest tactics in the state. The article provides an international perspective on the event and its political fallout.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is facing its third major heatwave of the year, with temperatures predicted to peak at 34°C (93°F) on Saturday. The intense heat has prompted amber health alerts for several regions in England and wildfire warnings in Scotland and Northern Ireland. This extended period of warm, dry weather has also led to hosepipe bans affecting over seven million people in areas like Yorkshire, Kent, and Sussex. Scientists attribute the increasing frequency of such extreme weather events to manmade climate change.</p>

          <p>The Welsh national rugby team has ended an 18-match losing streak by defeating Japan 31-22 in Kobe, securing their first international win in over 21 months. The victory, achieved under the challenging hot and humid conditions of a closed-roof stadium, levels the series at 1-1. Tries from Kieran Hardy and Josh Adams, combined with a crucial late score from Cai Edwards, sealed the much-needed win for the tourists. The result provides a positive conclusion for interim head coach Matt Sherratt's tenure.</p>

          <p>France's far-right National Rally party is cautiously managing its relationship with the Trump administration as it aims for victory in the 2027 presidential election. While ideologically aligned on many issues, the party maintains distance due to French voters' general antipathy towards Trump and concerns over potentially harmful US trade tariffs. The party, led by Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella, is pursuing a strategy to appear moderate and capable of governing, avoiding associations that could alienate its electorate. This balancing act reflects the broader trend of rising far-right movements in Europe navigating their ties with the US.</p>

          <p>A proposal by German Education Minister Karin Prien to introduce a quota for students with immigrant backgrounds in schools has ignited a nationwide debate. Proponents argue it could improve educational outcomes by creating more balanced classroom compositions, but critics, including teachers' associations and student bodies, warn it is impractical and discriminatory. They argue the focus should be on language support and resources for schools with high immigrant populations, not on stigmatizing quotas. The discussion highlights broader challenges within Germany's education system, which has shown declining performance in recent international studies.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of Chinese law firms are establishing a global presence, driven by demand from Chinese companies expanding abroad and a push from Beijing. These firms are finding that Chinese businesses prefer legal support from compatriots they trust, though winning over non-Chinese clients remains a challenge amid geopolitical tensions. According to China's Ministry of Justice, the number of overseas branches of Chinese law firms has grown significantly in recent years. This expansion is seen as a pivotal moment for China's legal services industry as it adapts to support the country's global economic footprint.</p>

          <h2>Investigation into Air India Crash Deepens After Cockpit Audio Reveals Puzzling Final Moments</h2>

          <p>The preliminary investigation into the Air India Flight 171 crash has revealed that both engine fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position seconds after takeoff, causing a total loss of power. Cockpit audio captured one pilot asking the other why he had cut the fuel, with the other denying he did so, deepening the mystery of the crash that killed 260 people. Investigators are trying to determine if the action was intentional, accidental, or the result of a malfunction, as the switches have multiple safety features to prevent accidental activation.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities arrested around 200 immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally during raids on two cannabis farm sites in Southern California. The operations, which involved criminal warrants, led to a tense standoff between protesters and law enforcement in Camarillo, where at least 12 people were injured. In response to the clashes, President Trump authorized officers to use "whatever means is necessary" to arrest protesters he labeled as agitators. The raids and ensuing fear in immigrant communities come as a federal judge has temporarily halted such enforcement actions.</p>

          <h2>Explainer: Spate of In-Flight Fires Leads to Ban on Substandard Power Banks in China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 22:30:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's civil aviation authority has implemented an emergency ban on air passengers carrying substandard power banks following several incidents where they caught fire on commercial flights. The new rule bars any portable lithium-ion batteries that do not have the mandatory China Compulsory Certification (3C) safety mark from domestic flights. This has caused confusion and led to large numbers of power banks being abandoned at airports. The move is part of a broader safety push, as aviation authorities across Asia had already prohibited the in-flight charging of these devices.</p>

          <h2>Northern Arizona Resident Dies from Plague, Health Officials Report</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 22:28:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health officials in Coconino County, Arizona, have confirmed that a local resident has died from pneumonic plague, the most deadly and easily spreadable form of the bacterial infection. This is the first recorded death from this type of plague in the county since 2007, though further details about the victim were not released. Plague is rare in humans but is naturally present in rodent populations in western US states, transmitted through infected flea bites. While deadly in the past, it is now easily treatable with antibiotics if caught early.</p>
