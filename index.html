          <p>President Trump stated that reaching a deal with China's President Xi is proving difficult, amidst ongoing trade tensions between the two nations. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that trade talks have stalled, suggesting the leaders' intervention is needed. Trump voiced his sentiment on Truth Social, acknowledging Xi's toughness in negotiations. The two countries blame each other for violating a trade agreement made in Switzerland, which included a 90-day suspension of tariffs and a repeal of trade countermeasures. The US has been critical of China's restrictions on rare earth exports and China has criticized the US for limiting its access to advanced technology and revoking visas for Chinese students. Optimism regarding a swift resolution to the trade dispute remains low. </p>

          <p>Erin Patterson, on trial for murder, testified that she threw up the mushroom meal that led to the deaths of her relatives. Patterson stated she only ate a small portion of the lunch and later consumed cake before vomiting. Prosecutors allege Patterson deliberately served toxic death cap mushrooms only to her guests, while her defense claims it was a tragic accident that also made her sick. Patterson pleaded not guilty to three murder charges and one attempted murder charge stemming from a beef Wellington lunch in July 2023. She also admitted to lying about a cancer diagnosis to secure childcare for weight-loss surgery. </p>

          <p>Thomas Mann, a Nobel laureate and literary exile, is remembered as a significant cultural figure 150 years after his birth. Mann's works reflected his life of wandering and his opposition to the Nazi regime, which led to his exile. He gained global recognition after winning the Nobel Prize in 1929 for his novel "Buddenbrooks" and his masterpiece, "The Magic Mountain." During his exile, Mann wrote political essays and delivered radio speeches condemning the German "catastrophe" that led to the Holocaust, often incorporating these views into his literary creations. Mann's legacy includes his courageous stance against fascism and his contributions to 20th-century literature.</p>

Powell has stated that the Federal Open Market Committee will continue to focus on economic data and balance risks to promote maximum employment and stable prices.

          <p>President Trump's 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to the U.S. have taken effect, affecting European exporters but granting the U.K. a temporary exemption. The U.K. maintains a 25% tariff while details of a recently signed trade deal with the U.S. are finalized. Trump indicated the U.K. warranted "different treatment" due to the "Economic Prosperity Deal," although the 50% tariff could be reinstated if the U.S. determines non-compliance. UK Steel expressed relief at the pause but cautioned about ongoing uncertainty and potential hesitancy from U.S. customers. This development introduces new uncertainties for the global steel industry.</p>

          <p>The United States has doubled its tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%, intensifying trade war concerns as President Trump's actions weigh on the global economy. The increased levies have strained U.S. ties with trading partners and sparked negotiations to avoid the duties. The OECD has cut its global growth forecast due to the tariffs, predicting the U.S. economy will face the biggest repercussions. While the U.K. is temporarily exempt, the EU and Canada have expressed strong opposition, with the EU threatening retaliation.

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the Navy to rename the USNS Harvey Milk, a ship named after the gay rights activist and sailor, Harvey Milk. The decision aligns with President Trump and Hegseth's aim to "re-establish the warrior culture." This move is part of a broader effort to remove references to diversity, equity, and inclusion from the Department of Defense. The USNS Harvey Milk was originally named in 2016 to honor leaders who fought for civil and human rights. </p>
