          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly called on pharmaceutical companies to release data justifying the success of their COVID-19 drugs and vaccines. In a social media post, he referenced the ongoing turmoil at the CDC, where several top officials have recently resigned, and urged drugmakers to be more transparent to "clear up this MESS." Trump's comments come as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. overhauls federal health agencies, a move that former CDC directors have warned is "endangering" American health.</p>

          <p>An 11-year-old boy was shot and killed in Houston while playing a "ding-dong ditch" prank with friends. According to witnesses and police, the boy was running away from a home after ringing the doorbell when an occupant emerged and opened fire, striking him in the back. A middle-aged man was arrested in connection with the shooting, and several weapons were recovered from the residence. The incident highlights a tragic trend, as a similar prank in California previously resulted in the deaths of three teenagers in 2023.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study from the University of Exeter indicates that daily consumption of nitrate-rich beetroot juice could help reduce blood pressure in older adults. The research found that the juice alters the oral microbiome, promoting helpful bacteria and reducing microbes linked to inflammation. Participants in their 60s and 70s who drank the juice showed a decrease in blood pressure, unlike the placebo group. Medical experts note that the body converts nitrates into nitric oxide, which helps dilate blood vessels and is crucial for vascular health.</p>

          <p>A new documentary, "The Haydn Expedition," explores the unique democratic structure of The Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen, a world-renowned orchestra. Founded in 1980 by music students, the orchestra operates as a corporation where all 41 musicians have a say in artistic and financial decisions, from selecting conductors to choosing repertoire. This collaborative approach, once compared to a hippie commune, is credited by its leadership as the foundation of its artistic and commercial success. The film showcases their interpretation of Joseph Haydn's music, connecting the composer's own journey to freedom with the orchestra's independent and democratic spirit.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has officially confirmed that the summer of 2025 was the hottest on record for the UK, with a mean temperature of 16.10°C, which is 1.51°C above the long-term average. This summer's heat was notable for its prolonged and widespread nature, featuring four separate heatwave events, rather than exceptionally high single-day temperatures. Climate scientists at the agency have calculated that a summer this hot is now 70 times more likely due to human-induced climate change.

          <p>A shooting during a school Mass at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis resulted in the deaths of an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old, with 21 others injured. The 23-year-old shooter, identified as Robin Westman, fired a rifle through the church windows before taking their own life. Authorities reported that the shooter had legally purchased the firearms recently and had posted videos online detailing plans for an attack. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics, though a specific motive has not yet been officially confirmed.</p>

          <p>Chelsea Football Club has finalized an agreement to transfer striker Nicolas Jackson to Bayern Munich in a deal valued at over £70 million. The arrangement begins as an initial loan for £14.3 million, which includes a mandatory purchase obligation of £56.2 million triggered by a minimum number of appearances. The 24-year-old Senegal forward, who joined Chelsea in 2023, reportedly lost the trust of manager Enzo Maresca after receiving two red cards during the season. To fill the gap in their attack, Chelsea has signed 20-year-old Argentine Facundo Buonanotte on a season-long loan from Brighton.</p>

The diplomatic developments come as Kyiv condemned the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) for omitting the Ukraine war from its closing statement, and as India's Prime Minister Modi urged Russia's Putin to end the conflict during the SCO summit.</p>

It is understood that the families who arrived successfully obtained their visas after filing lawsuits against the government's decision to halt the process. The situation highlights the ongoing challenges for Afghans seeking refuge since the Taliban's return to power in 2021 and the complexities of German immigration policy.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that heightened immigration enforcement under the Trump administration could significantly harm key sectors of California's $4 trillion economy. A study by the Bay Area Economic Institute and UC Merced estimates the state could lose up to $278 billion in GDP due to the potential loss of its immigrant workforce, which is crucial for industries like agriculture, construction, and hospitality. Business owners report that recent ICE raids have already created a climate of fear, leading to decreased sales and operational uncertainty, while the state's economy heavily relies on these workers to function.

Rescue operations are severely hampered by the rugged terrain and by landslides that have blocked roads.

The move comes as Western nations accuse Tehran of violating UN resolutions by developing ballistic missiles and demand full IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities.

          <p>A coronal mass ejection from the sun is expected to interact with Earth's magnetic field, potentially creating a visible aurora borealis display across parts of Canada and 18 U.S. states. According to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center, the geomagnetic storm is forecasted to peak late Monday into early Tuesday morning. States as far south as Illinois and Oregon may have a chance to see the northern lights. For the best viewing experience, experts recommend finding a dark location away from city lights, such as a park, and checking local weather forecasts for clear skies.</p>

          <p>Financial coach Bernadette Joy advises homebuyers to opt for a 15-year mortgage, arguing that if one cannot afford its higher payments, they cannot truly afford the home. She cautions that with a 30-year mortgage, a significant portion of early payments goes toward interest, building very little equity in the initial years. Joy also highlights the often-overlooked "hidden costs" of homeownership, such as furnishing, increased utilities, and unexpected maintenance, which average over $8,800 annually. She recommends that total living expenses, including a mortgage, should not exceed 50% of one's income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Piotr Szczerek, the CEO of a Polish paving company, has issued a public apology after a video of him snatching a hat intended for a young boy at the US Open went viral. The incident occurred after tennis player Kamil Majchrzak won his match and threw his cap toward the child. Szczerek claimed he made a "huge mistake" and was mistakenly convinced the player was passing the hat to him. He stated that it was not his intention to take a memento from a child and has since returned the hat, hoping to have repaired the damage done.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly 6.0 magnitude earthquake in eastern Afghanistan, significant challenges are hampering rescue efforts and the dissemination of information. The mountainous terrain, combined with landslides blocking roads, makes access to the worst-hit areas extremely difficult, forcing the Taliban government to rely on helicopters. The country's ability to cope is severely strained by the economic collapse that followed the Taliban takeover, the suspension of most foreign aid, and a collapsed public healthcare system. Aid organizations also warn that restrictions on women could limit their access to life-saving services in the aftermath of the disaster.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated on his social media platform that India has offered to reduce its tariffs on U.S. goods to zero. The claim comes after his administration implemented duties as high as 50% on some Indian products, straining the trade relationship between the two countries. Trump's comment was made while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in China for a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, where he met with Chinese and Russian leaders. The White House has not yet provided further details on the alleged offer from New Delhi to completely remove the trade barriers.</p>

          <p>ScotRail, the government-owned rail operator in Scotland, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares on its trains, meaning passengers will no longer pay higher prices for traveling during busy weekday hours. The move is intended to encourage more commuters to switch from cars to trains, offering significant savings; a peak trip from Edinburgh to Glasgow will now be almost 50% cheaper. The policy follows a pilot scheme in 2023, and First Minister John Swinney stated the annual cost of £40-£45 million is a sustainable investment in the rail network and the public, helping to ease financial burdens during a cost-of-living crisis.</p>

The closures are attributed to a combination of factors, including high tariffs on imported goods, inflation, and shifting consumer spending habits.

          <p>Amid rising UK government bond yields, which have surprisingly increased more than those in the US, an analyst suggests the UK government must take bold action to restore market confidence. The article argues that despite the UK's adherence to fiscal rules, investors are concerned about optimistic growth projections and the impact of recent tax changes. To counter a potential "doom loop," the author proposes significant tax reforms, such as a land tax to fund reductions in taxes on labor, and growth-oriented policies like rejoining the EU customs union to change the negative market narrative.

While the Commerce Department intends to grant licenses for continued operation, it will not approve requests to expand capacity or upgrade technology. This move aims to close export-control loopholes and is part of a broader U.S. strategy to curb China's technological development and push for greater self-reliance within the Chinese semiconductor industry.

          <p>As the Federal Reserve considers a potential rate cut, financial experts advise that short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are currently offering the highest returns for savers. Six-month CDs are identified as a "sweet spot," providing attractive APYs without locking up funds for an extended period. While longer-term CDs historically offered better rates, the current inverted yield curve makes shorter terms more lucrative. Experts suggest that savers looking to maximize immediate returns should focus on these options, while those seeking long-term stability might still consider a CD ladder strategy to lock in current rates.
