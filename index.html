          <p>Israel's Security Cabinet has approved a plan for the military to assume control of Gaza City while aiming to provide humanitarian aid outside combat zones. The plan outlines five principles for ending the war, including the disarmament of Hamas, the return of all hostages, and the establishment of an alternative civilian government. Prime Minister Netanyahu stated the intention is not to permanently govern the territory but to establish a security perimeter and transfer governance to Arab forces. This move faces strong international opposition amid stalled ceasefire negotiations and a worsening humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>A brush fire in Southern California, dubbed the Canyon Fire, grew explosively from 50 to over 1,000 acres within hours on Thursday. The blaze started in Ventura County near Lake Piru and quickly spread into Los Angeles County, triggering mandatory evacuation orders for the Lake Piru Recreation Area and surrounding communities. Firefighting efforts are underway with water-dropping aircraft using the nearby reservoir to refill. This is one of several fires currently burning in the region, contributing to a more active fire season than the previous year.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued a nationwide preliminary injunction, marking the fourth court ruling to block the Trump administration's order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. The order sought to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are undocumented or on temporary visas. The judge certified a class action, arguing the plaintiffs were highly likely to win on the grounds that the order violates the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause. This decision follows a Supreme Court ruling that limited nationwide injunctions but left open other legal avenues for challenges.</p>

          <p>Shares of Japan's SoftBank Group jumped 13% to a record high following a fiscal first-quarter profit that significantly surpassed analyst expectations. The company reported a profit of 421.8 billion yen, a stark turnaround from a loss in the same period last year. This success was driven by a $4.8 billion gain in the value of its Vision Funds, their largest since 2021, thanks to strong performance from portfolio companies like Grab and Swiggy. Several other SoftBank-backed companies, including Lenskart and PayPay, are also expected to go public soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has publicly stated that the University of California should not "bend on their knees" in negotiations with the Trump administration. The administration has frozen over half a billion dollars in federal research grants for UCLA amid allegations of on-campus antisemitism. Newsom criticized recent settlements by Columbia and Brown universities, which involved large payments and concessions, as selling their souls. He expressed confidence that the UC system will uphold its principles of academic freedom while working to restore the crucial funding for research in areas like cancer and clean energy.</p>

His departure from office means he will no longer receive a parliamentary salary and triggers a by-election for the seat he held as an independent.</p>

The ruling came after environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe argued the facility was built without required environmental impact studies, threatening a sensitive ecosystem and sacred tribal lands. While the facility can continue to house detainees, the 14-day order prevents new work, such as paving, which experts testified could cause contaminated runoff.

          <p>A new study published in Science Advances reveals that California's fire season is starting significantly earlier and lasting longer than it did three decades ago, a shift attributed mainly to human-caused climate change. Researchers found that in some regions, like the Cascade Range, the season begins 46 days earlier. The primary drivers are earlier snowmelt and the increased drying of vegetation due to rising average temperatures, not an increase in human-ignited fires. The findings quantify the anecdotal sense among residents that the threat of wildfire has become a near-constant, year-round concern in the state.</p>

The move is an escalation of long-standing tensions between the two countries, with the U.S. having previously indicted Maduro on narco-terrorism charges.

          <p>The implementation of President Trump's latest tariffs has pushed the average duty on imported products in the U.S. to 18.3%, the highest level seen since 1934. The move has prompted global reactions, with countries like Brazil and Switzerland planning responses to mitigate the economic impact on their industries. According to the Budget Lab at Yale, these tariffs represent a significant shift in U.S. trade policy. The White House remains confident that the policy will spur domestic investment and manufacturing, despite the widespread international concern and uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has begun detaining migrants who crossed the English Channel under a new "one in, one out" pilot scheme with France. According to a government source, several dozen individuals have been detained and could be returned to France within weeks. Under the deal, for every migrant returned to France, the UK will accept one vetted asylum seeker from France through a safe and legal route. The Home Office stated that anyone arriving by small boat is now eligible for immediate detention and return, a move the government says it will robustly defend against legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Instagram's launch of a new "Map" feature has triggered a significant backlash from users concerned about privacy and the sharing of their location data. The tool, similar to Snapchat's Snap Map, is designed to let users share their "last active location" with friends. Although parent company Meta stated the feature is opt-in by default, many users claimed their location was being shared without their explicit consent. Instagram chief Adam Mosseri addressed the complaints, suggesting most users were confused, but promised the company was investigating to ensure no location data is shared unintentionally.</p>

          <p>The UK government is developing legislation to create new restriction zones for serious violent and sexual offenders upon their release from prison. Unlike current exclusion zones that bar offenders from specific places, the new system would confine them to a designated geographical area, policed by enhanced electronic monitoring. The Ministry of Justice says this approach is designed to give victims greater peace of mind. However, probation officers have raised concerns that the plan will add significant pressure to an already strained service.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to lift a lower court's ban on the use of "roving patrols" for immigration enforcement in Southern California. A federal judge had restricted the tactic, finding that agents were likely violating the 4th Amendment by stopping individuals based on factors like race or location without reasonable suspicion. The administration argues the ban irreparably harms its ability to enforce immigration laws in the nation's most populous district. Civil rights lawyers contend that lifting the ban would effectively "bless open season" on Latino residents.</p>
