          <p>Stock trading app eToro experienced a significant surge of 30% in its Nasdaq debut after raising nearly $310 million through its initial public offering, pricing shares above the anticipated range. The Israel-based company sold almost six million shares at $52 each, valuing the company at approximately $4.2 billion. This IPO is being closely watched as a potential indicator of renewed interest in the IPO market, particularly after delays caused by tariff concerns. eToro, founded in 2007, has seen substantial growth, especially in cryptocurrency trading, with net income increasing thirteenfold last year, however, they expect crypto assets to account for less of their commission from trading activities in the first quarter.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's stock has turned positive for the year, joining Meta and Microsoft as the third 'Magnificent 7' member to achieve this milestone amidst a broader market recovery. The surge follows CEO Jensen Huang's announcement of a major AI chip sale to Saudi Arabia, potentially mitigating revenue headwinds from China restrictions. Analysts suggest this deal could offset billions in revenue losses tied to constraints on goods going to China, bolstering investor confidence in Nvidia's growth trajectory. With this recovery, Nvidia's market capitalization has surpassed $3 trillion, although it remains below its 52-week high from January. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's tariffs are facing legal challenges that could bring them before the Supreme Court, potentially testing the limits of executive power. Several lawsuits argue that the tariffs, imposed through executive orders, violate the major questions and nondelegation doctrines, which require clear congressional authorization for actions with significant economic impact. These challenges come amid fluctuating tariffs and ongoing trade negotiations with countries like the United Kingdom and China, but the lawsuits are moving forward with the U.S. Court of International Trade weighing a temporary bid to block the tariffs in one of the cases, which was the first major test of their legality. If the Supreme Court hears the case, it could scrutinize the president's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs under laws like the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.</p>

          <p>Filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy can provide a financial reset by discharging most unsecured debts, but it comes with several limitations that individuals should consider. Not all debts are dischargeable, including child support, alimony, recent income taxes, and most student loans. Filers may have to surrender non-exempt assets, and co-signers on loans are not protected from collections. Rebuilding credit after Chapter 7 takes time and effort, as the bankruptcy remains on the credit report for 10 years, making it more difficult to rent an apartment, finance a car, or get a mortgage.</p>

          <p>Following recent radar outages at major airports, discussions have resurfaced regarding the technology's origins and advancements. The term "radar" is an acronym for RAdio Detection And Ranging, a system that uses radio waves to detect objects. The concept dates back to the late 19th century, with German physicist Christian HÃ¼lsmeyer creating the Telemobiloskop in 1904 to prevent ship collisions. Radar became crucial during World War II, and today, modern aircraft rely on it to avoid collisions, however, some airports still rely on systems that use floppy disks and copper wire, highlighting the need for modernization and upgrades.</p>

          <p>A two-year-old child, Maikelys Espinoza, who was separated from her parents due to their deportation by the Trump administration, has been reunited with her mother in Caracas, Venezuela. The child was among 220 migrants on a flight from the U.S. to Venezuela, and her return was facilitated through diplomatic efforts. While the child's return was celebrated, it highlights the ongoing challenges faced by families separated due to immigration policies, with Trump designating Tren de Aragua a terrorist organization earlier this year and has used the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 as justification for carrying out mass deportations since returning to office.</p>

          <p>Mass firings of federal employees by the Trump administration's "department of government efficiency" are causing economic retrenchment and displacement, particularly in areas with a high concentration of government jobs. Hundreds of thousands of former federal employees are facing tough life decisions, such as moving to cheaper areas, as job losses and government cuts crop up constantly in conversation. Experts warn of a growing risk that these cuts combine to trigger an economic downturn, especially in towns and counties around Washington DC, where businesses that rely on government workers for custom are also feeling the chill.</p>

The lawsuit alleges that Capital One failed to inform customers about its new "360 Performance Savings" product, which offered higher interest rates, while freezing the interest rate of its "360 Savings" account at 0.3%. This action comes months after the Trump administration's Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) dropped a similar suit against the financial institution, and the bank strongly disagrees with the attorney general's claims and will "rigorously defend" itself in court.</p>

          <p>Uber is introducing "Route Share," a cheaper pooled rides option, and a price-lock pass for commuters, aiming to attract more daily users amidst rising costs. Route Share offers rides up to 50% cheaper than UberX during weekday commuting hours, while the price-lock pass allows passengers to lock in fares on as many as 10 distinct routes. These initiatives reflect Uber's strategy to compete with rivals like Lyft by offering diverse rideshare options to cater to various customer needs and budgets.</p>
