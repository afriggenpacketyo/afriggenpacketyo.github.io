          <p>The U.S. Senate is conducting an extended "vote-a-rama" on President Trump's sweeping budget proposal, a nearly 1,000-page bill central to his agenda. The legislation includes increased spending for border security and defense, offset by significant cuts to healthcare and food assistance programs. Its passage is uncertain due to divisions within the Republican party over the extent of welfare cuts needed to fund tax break extensions. The bill has drawn criticism for potentially adding over $3 trillion to the national debt and stripping health insurance from millions of Americans.</p>

          <p>In a tense, prolonged session, Senate Republican leaders are struggling to secure enough votes to pass President Trump's major budget bill. The focus is on wavering senators like Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, and Rand Paul, whose concerns over Medicaid cuts and the national debt are creating uncertainty. Vice President JD Vance is on Capitol Hill, prepared to cast a potential tie-breaking vote. The ongoing "vote-a-rama" has seen numerous amendments debated as leadership engages in last-minute negotiations to prevent the bill's failure on the Senate floor.</p>

          <p>Turkish police have detained four employees of the satirical magazine LeMan following the publication of a cartoon that officials alleged depicted the Prophet Muhammad. The government initiated an investigation for "publicly insulting religious values," leading to protests and the arrests of the cartoonist and senior staff. The magazine denies the cartoon depicted the prophet, stating it was a fictional character named Muhammad intended to highlight the suffering of Muslims.

          <p>Denmark has enacted a new law requiring women to be included in the military conscription lottery system alongside men when they turn 18. This policy change extends the service period from four to eleven months and aims to increase the number of annual service members to 6,500 by 2033. The move follows similar policies in neighboring Norway and Sweden and comes as Denmark increases its defense spending to meet NATO targets amid heightened security concerns in Europe. Previously, military service for Danish women was voluntary.</p>

          <p>A new study from the Institute for Employment Research indicates that one in four migrants in Germany is contemplating leaving the country, with the highly educated and well-integrated being the most likely to depart. The report cites experiences of discrimination, a feeling of not being accepted, bureaucracy, and political dissatisfaction as key drivers for this trend. Personal accounts from former residents highlight a persistent sense of being treated as an outsider, regardless of their professional success or German language skills, which ultimately prompted their decision to emigrate.</p>

          <p>Jewish leaders in the United Kingdom are expressing alarm over rising antisemitism, underscored by recent events at the Glastonbury music festival where a performer led chants of "Death to the IDF." This incident occurs amid a documented surge in antisemitic attacks since October 2023, with many British Jews reporting they feel unwelcome and considering emigration. A recent survey shows a majority feel the need to hide their Judaism and believe authorities are not doing enough to combat the issue. The BBC, which broadcast the festival, has been criticized for its role in platforming the content.</p>

The deployment, ordered by the Trump administration to manage protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has been controversial and legally challenged by Governor Gavin Newsom. State officials had warned the move would deplete firefighting resources during a peak wildfire season.

          <p>Chelsea's recent transfer activities, including the pursuit of Brighton's JoÃ£o Pedro, reflect head coach Enzo Maresca's goal of creating a more versatile and unpredictable attack. Maresca's system often eschews traditional overlapping full-backs in favor of numerical superiority in the midfield, which can sometimes isolate wingers. By acquiring players with different profiles like JoÃ£o Pedro, who can drop deep and link play, the team aims to overcome struggles against defensive low blocks. This strategy is about adding new dimensions to the offense and ensuring the squad has multiple ways to break down opponents.</p>

The campaign's success in mobilizing a diverse coalition of young, working-class voters demonstrates a path forward for progressives that doesn't rely on fear-based politics or compromising on core values.</p>

          <p>Experts argue that unlike in countries like Sweden where children's rights are codified into law, the United States does not guarantee a right to healthcare for its youth. This makes programs like Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which cover two in five U.S. children, susceptible to political budget cuts. The article highlights that the current federal budget proposal includes significant reductions to these programs. This vulnerability is contrasted with the Swedish system, where youth clinics provide comprehensive, accessible care as a matter of legal obligation, not political discretion.</p>

This incentive, which can be applied retroactively to the start of 2025, is part of a broader government effort to signal openness and stabilize foreign investment flows.

          <p>Residents of Leavenworth, Kansas, are actively resisting an effort by the private prison firm CoreCivic to reopen a local facility to house immigration detainees. The facility, which closed in 2021, has a troubled history of understaffing, violence, and alleged abuses, prompting opposition from a coalition of locals, including former prison employees and a Catholic convent. Despite the town's pro-prison reputation, city officials have sued CoreCivic to block the reopening, arguing the company must obtain a new permit. The conflict highlights a local battle over corporate accountability and the boom in private detention under current federal immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were pardoned by President Trump in May after being convicted of bank fraud and tax evasion, stated in a recent interview that they have no apologies to make. Todd Chrisley, who had been sentenced to 12 years, asserted his pride in the money he made and dismissed public opinion. The couple was convicted in 2022 of defrauding banks of over $30 million. Their pardons, which came after serving less than three years, were part of a series of controversial clemencies granted by the president, and the family is now planning a new reality show.</p>

          <p>The Oropouche virus, a midge-borne illness, has caused a major outbreak across South America, infecting thousands and spreading from remote rainforests to major cities. Previously rare, the virus's recent surge highlights the growing global threat of vector-borne diseases, driven by factors like deforestation, urbanization, and climate change. Scientists note the virus may have evolved, and increased travel has facilitated its spread, with cases now appearing in North America and Europe. The outbreak serves as a case study for how environmental and human factors are converging to expand the reach of once-localized tropical diseases.</p>

          <p>This opinion column contends that major employers like Walmart, McDonald's, and Amazon are effectively subsidized by taxpayers because many of their full-time employees must rely on public assistance programs such as Medicaid and food stamps. The author argues that these highly profitable corporations avoid paying a living wage, shifting the cost to government safety nets. This issue is framed as "corporate welfare" and is particularly relevant as Congress debates cuts to these same social programs. The piece criticizes the hypocrisy of targeting individual welfare recipients while ignoring this systemic corporate reliance on public funds.</p>

          <p>According to mortgage lender Nationwide, UK house prices fell by 0.8% in June, marking the most significant monthly decline since February 2023.

Despite the monthly drop, the annual price growth rate was still positive at 2.1%, though this is the slowest pace in nearly a year.

          <h2>Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra Suspended by Constitutional Court</h2>

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court has suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from her duties while it considers a petition for her dismissal. The case stems from a leaked phone call with former Cambodian leader Hun Sen, which sparked public anger and accusations that she undermined the military. This decision makes her the third member of the powerful Shinawatra clan to potentially be removed from power prematurely. The suspension adds to the country's political instability, as her ruling coalition already holds a slim majority and her father, former PM Thaksin Shinawatra, faces his own legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Colin Allred, a former Democratic representative and NFL player from the Dallas area, has announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate in Texas for the 2026 election. This sets up a high-profile race that is already drawing national attention, particularly with the contentious Republican primary between incumbent Senator John Cornyn and Attorney General Ken Paxton. Allred, who unsuccessfully challenged Senator Ted Cruz in 2024, is entering a potentially crowded Democratic field. National Democrats view the Texas seat as a key, albeit challenging, target in their efforts to regain a Senate majority.</p>
