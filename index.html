            <p>An American company, Cocona, decided to sell off its entire China reserve of its core product – a sweat-drying additive that treats the yarn used in fabrics for some of the world’s top clothing brands – to avoid tariffs. The CEO, Jeff Bowman, decided to sell it all at once to give buyers a supply that will last nine to 12 months before tariffs skyrocketed. Bowman expressed a lack of confidence in the competence of the US administration. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A three-year legal battle over the death of Charles Givens, an inmate with health problems, at Virginia's Marion Correctional Treatment Center has ended with a jury finding five former corrections officers not liable. The lawsuit, filed by Givens' sister, alleged the guards were responsible for his death, while the defense argued he died from a seizure. The case brought scrutiny to conditions at the facility, including reports of other inmates hospitalized for hypothermia, and the Virginia Department of Corrections has since added a camera to the shower room of Marion.</p>

            <p>American farmers are expressing concerns over China's imposition of significant tariffs on U.S. exports, raising costs for farm supplies and increasing the risk of retaliation against U.S. crops. The tariffs, part of an escalating trade fight, could lead to market losses as countries like Mexico seek alternative corn suppliers in South America. While the White House is considering mitigation efforts, similar to the aid provided during Trump's first term, farmers emphasize that government assistance is not a long-term solution. The timing of the tariffs coincides with farmers making crucial planting decisions, potentially distorting market signals. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A recent study has demonstrated that crows possess the ability to distinguish geometric regularity in shapes, marking the first time this cognitive skill has been observed in a non-human species. Researchers at the University of Tübingen found that crows could identify outliers among a group of shapes based on their geometric properties, such as right angles, parallel lines, and symmetry. This discovery challenges the notion that geometric intuition is exclusive to humans and opens new avenues for investigating mathematical abilities in animals. The study involved training crows to peck at the different shape in a set of six shapes to receive a treat.</p>

Once a peaceful nation, Ecuador has become a key transit point for cocaine destined for the U.S. and Europe, leading to a record-high homicide rate. The election is a rematch between incumbent Daniel Noboa, known for his tough stance and Trump ally status, and leftist challenger Luisa González, tied to former populist president Rafael Correa.

These talks occur nearly seven years after President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 nuclear deal. Despite heightened tensions and Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign, he has expressed hope for a new deal. Iran has rejected direct negotiations but remains open to assessing the other side’s intent.

This calls into question the premise of sustainable tourism in the region. This story shows the importance of being wary of taking national stereotypes to heart, as even in nature, there will be bad actors. Optimism score: 35</p>

            <p>The UK government is intervening to save British Steel, with Parliament set to vote on granting the business secretary the power to direct the company's actions. The government's action is a response to the Chinese owners of British Steel, Jingye, requesting a billion-pound taxpayer bailout without guarantees for jobs or the plant's future. This intervention does not constitute nationalization but keeps the company afloat. The government's long-term plan for British Steel is uncertain, with potential for nationalization, though significant investment is needed to modernize the plant. Optimism score: 50</p>
