          <p>An opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times argues that pushing more Americans into homelessness is not a viable strategy for revitalizing downtown areas. The author contends that cuts to social safety net programs, reminiscent of the Reagan era, contribute to the rise in homelessness, which in turn erodes the commercial real estate value of downtowns. The piece advocates for prioritizing the needs of vulnerable populations and providing shelter as a prerequisite for downtown revitalization, citing initiatives in California that focus on addressing homelessness to improve public safety and economic potential.</p>

          <h2>Study Links Tooth Sensitivity to Ancient Armored Fish</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research suggests that the sensitivity of human teeth, causing pain from cold or dental work, can be traced back to the exoskeletons of ancient, armored fish. Yara Haridy, an evolutionary biologist, discovered that structures in ancient invertebrate armor resembled vertebrate teeth, indicating a shared function of sensing. By examining modern-day fish embryos, she found nerves in tooth-like scales, suggesting that ancient fish used their armor to sense their surroundings. This research explains why humans experience toothaches, connecting it to our evolutionary history.</p>

          <p>Birmingham City Council has obtained a court order to prevent the obstruction of waste vehicles leaving depots, as an ongoing strike by refuse workers disrupts collections. Over 12,000 tonnes of uncollected waste have accumulated due to the strike, which is centered on proposed pay cuts for bin lorry drivers. Unite, the union representing the workers, maintains that picket lines are lawful and peaceful. The council says the court order is necessary to uphold its public health duty, while Unite criticizes the council for prioritizing legal action over fair negotiations.</p>
