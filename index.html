        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Romania is at a crossroads as it prepares for a presidential election rerun, following the annulment of the previous election due to illegal campaign financing. George Simion, a pro-Russian right-wing extremist and former football hooligan, is the frontrunner, raising concerns about the country's future direction. Romania's geographical proximity to the Ukraine war and frequent Russian provocations in the Black Sea, coupled with a history of simulated democracy and clientelistic political cliques, make this election crucial. Simion's rise reflects societal frustration, while other candidates like Crin Antonescu and Nicusor Dan offer contrasting visions for Romania's future, with the election's outcome set to significantly impact Romania's role in Europe.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thrombosis, the formation of blood clots in blood vessels, is a serious condition that can affect even top athletes, as seen with basketball superstar Victor Wembanyama's recent surgery. Sports physician Pascal Bauer explains that while exercise is important for prevention, athletes are still susceptible due to factors like muscle mass compressing veins, injuries, and frequent long-distance travel. Symptoms include one-sided swelling, pain, and discoloration in the affected area, and athletes should undergo preventive sports examinations, maintain good training hygiene, and stay hydrated. Diagnosis involves blood analysis and imaging, with treatment typically involving blood-thinning medication, and preventive measures include compression stockings during travel and avoiding doping.

          <p>Amid rising concerns over reliance on US payment giants like Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal, the European Central Bank is urging Europe to reduce vulnerabilities in its digital payment infrastructure. ECB President Christine Lagarde advocates for a European alternative to maintain control over digital payments, citing security risks and potential economic pressure. While some experts downplay the dominance of US systems, the rise of app-based payments through American tech firms exacerbates the issue. Russia's model of domestic payment processing offers a temporary solution, but the digital euro project and initiatives like Wero face hurdles in gaining traction and widespread adoption.

The Conservatives experienced heavy losses, and Northumberland County Council remains under no overall control, with the Conservatives having the most seats and Reform a close second.

          <p>Bill Belichick's transition to coaching at the University of North Carolina has been overshadowed by his relationship with his 24-year-old girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, leading to concerns about his control over the program.

This has raised questions about Belichick's focus and potential legacy-endangering distractions.

Analysts also suggest that China may seek to restore ties with neighboring countries, including South Korea, with cultural diplomacy emerging as a key starting point.

          <p>The Trump administration has ended the "de minimis" tariff loophole on low-value imports, which allowed goods worth less than $800 to enter the US without import fees. This policy change is expected to increase prices for consumers buying cheap goods from retailers like Shein and Temu. The White House argues that the loophole has been exploited by sellers in China and has allowed the unchecked flow of deadly drugs into the country. China's government and trade associations say the pain will be felt by American consumers rather than Chinese exporters. Optimism score: 40</p>

The judge found that the “plain ordinary meaning” of the act’s language, like “invasion” and “predatory incursion,” referred to an attack by “military forces” and did not line up with Mr. Trump’s claims about the activities of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan street gang, in a proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act.
