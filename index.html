          <p>The Co-op grocery chain expects its shelves to return to normal stock levels this weekend after resolving issues stemming from a recent cyberattack. The attack, attributed to the DragonForce group, compromised payment systems and supply chains, leading to widespread shortages. The company is gradually restoring its systems and working with suppliers to replenish stock both in-store and online, and all payment systems are now operational. Experts caution that the reputational and financial repercussions of the attack may linger, potentially affecting customer trust and requiring long-term investments in security upgrades.</p>

          <p>Rupert Lowe, a former Reform UK MP, will not face criminal charges related to allegations of threats made against the party's chairman.

          <p>NPR reported that three officials from the Trump administration have close connections to antisemitic extremists, including a Nazi sympathizer and a Holocaust denier. This comes as the Trump administration has used the fight against antisemitism as a justification for deporting pro-Palestinian student protesters and cutting funding to universities. Additionally, President Trump met with Syria's new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, in Saudi Arabia and plans to lift decades of U.S. sanctions on Syria, which could transform the region and prevent Iran from establishing a presence there.</p>

          <p>Japan's health ministry plans to eliminate out-of-pocket payments for childbirth, possibly starting in April 2026, to address the country's declining birthrate. The proposed policy would fully cover normal delivery expenses under the public medical insurance system, which currently excludes normal childbirth. While the government provides a lump-sum payment of 500,000 yen per birth, delivery costs often exceed that amount, and the unified pricing under the new system aims to alleviate financial burdens on families, though obstetricians have expressed concerns about potential financial strain on medical institutions.</p>

          <p>Burberry plans to cut approximately 1,700 jobs as part of a cost-reduction strategy to save money by 2027, the luxury fashion firm announced following a reported loss of £66m in the last financial year. The proposed job cuts, reducing the global workforce by nearly a fifth, include potential redundancies at its Castleford factory in West Yorkshire. CEO Joshua Schulman stated the majority of job losses would come from head office teams, and night shifts at the Castleford factory will be eliminated due to overcapacity, with plans to renovate the facility.</p>

          <p>Nine public companies, each valued at over $1 billion, are considering moving their incorporation out of Delaware, following Tesla's lead, due to increasing legal challenges. The trend, nicknamed "Dexit," is driven by concerns over Delaware court decisions that have expanded the stringent legal standard for situations involving controlling shareholders. Tesla and Trump Media & Technology have already reincorporated in Texas and Florida, respectively, citing Delaware's increasingly litigious environment, and this is creating unpredictability in decision-making.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs President John Waldron noted that investors have recently reduced their holdings of U.S. dollar assets, returning to more neutral positions after initially being heavily invested in American assets. This shift followed the Trump administration's decision to increase tariffs, prompting investors to reposition their portfolios in currencies, but Waldron emphasized that this was more of a correction of excess holdings rather than a complete withdrawal. Despite concerns about the volatility of U.S. policymaking, Waldron said that investors still have demand for access to Chinese equities and fixed income products.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is pushing to undo the Endangered Species Act, which has been credited with saving numerous species from extinction, and this is done by claiming the law needs updating. The proposed changes, including removing the regulatory definition of "harm," could undermine the act's power to preserve critical habitats. Critics argue the changes prioritize resources for people over preserving biodiversity, while supporters of the act emphasize its benefits for people and the planet, including potential medical and agricultural discoveries.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy and Congress are in disagreement with the Trump administration over funding for the F/A-XX program, which is intended to develop a next-generation fighter jet to replace the aging F/A-18 Super Hornet fleet. The Pentagon is considering delaying the program by up to three years, citing concerns about engineering and production capacity, while the Navy wants to move forward with awarding a contract. A delay could leave the Navy without a modern fighter in the 2030s, potentially undermining its ability to project power in contested environments, particularly against China's advanced fighter jets.</p>
