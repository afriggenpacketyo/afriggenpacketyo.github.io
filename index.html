        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City Democrats have cast their votes in the mayoral primary, but the race remains undecided due to ranked-choice voting. Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani holds a slight lead over former Governor Andrew Cuomo in initial tallies. Mamdani secured endorsements from prominent progressives, while Cuomo, despite past scandals, is considered a frontrunner. Ranked-choice voting will determine the winner as the process involves eliminating candidates with the least votes in each round until one candidate secures over 50% of the vote, with the final outcome expected in early July. The outcome of the election may have implications for the future direction of the Democratic Party.</p>

          <p>A classified intelligence assessment suggests that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have set back Tehran's nuclear program by several months. The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, indicates that the strikes sealed off entrances to enrichment facilities, but the underground infrastructure remains largely intact. Some of Iran's enriched uranium was reportedly moved before the strikes. The White House disputes these findings, while others maintain the strikes caused significant damage. The strikes occurred amid escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, raising concerns about regional stability.</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have used the slowing spin of dying stars to study star formation in the Milky Way's past. They found that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago. The extra spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. The study, based on data from the Gaia space telescope, provides direct evidence that star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time. The research offers a new way to study the galaxy's evolution.</p>

          <p>UK newspapers feature stories about the UK's acquisition of new fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear bombs. The Times describes it as the biggest expansion of the deterrent since the Cold War. The Daily Telegraph also leads with the UK's new jets, reporting that the Prime Minister will announce the purchase at the NATO summit. The Guardian reports on Trump's warning to Israel and carries a story about Sir Keir Starmer rejecting pleas to put the welfare bill on hold.</p>

          <p>President Trump reacted strongly after an Israel-Iran ceasefire he brokered was violated, expressing anger and frustration. A Pentagon report indicated that the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities were not as successful as initially claimed. Trump lashed out at Israel and Iran, using strong language to criticize their actions. He also addressed a report suggesting that the strikes only set back Iran's nuclear program by months. Separately, ICE is reportedly detaining more immigrants without criminal records.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran after accusing both countries of violating the initial agreement. He expressed frustration with both nations, particularly Israel, for launching attacks shortly after the ceasefire was supposed to take effect. Trump's intervention, including a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, appeared to halt further bombardments. The conflict between Israel and Iran has resulted in at least 1,000 deaths over 12 days. Drones have also hit bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops.</p>
