          <p>Ireland's government has formally expressed concern to German authorities after a video showed a 25-year-old Irish woman being struck by police during a protest in Berlin. The demonstration was against the killing of journalists in Gaza. The woman, identified as Kitty O'Brien, reportedly suffered a broken arm and required surgery, sparking protests at the German Embassy in Dublin. Berlin police stated they have referred the incident for oversight and claim officers were compelled to use force after protesters, at an unregistered event, ignored orders to disperse.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights amid reports of a potential deployment of federal agents to the city. The order, largely symbolic, seeks to bar federal agents from wearing masks and requires them to display identifying information. It also prohibits city departments from participating in federal actions that could violate rights to peacefully assemble. The move comes in response to concerns about potential militarized federal activity, similar to events seen in other cities under the Trump administration.</p>

This discovery follows the recent recovery of another hostage's body, bringing the number of remaining hostages to 48.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trend in nutritional supplements, known as "clear protein," is gaining popularity among consumers seeking high-protein options without the heavy, milky texture of traditional shakes. Made from whey protein isolate, these products mix with water to create a juice-like beverage and are often lower in fat, carbs, and lactose. While searches for the product have surged, nutrition experts note that it isn't inherently healthier than traditional whey concentrate and often contains artificial sweeteners. Both forms typically deliver a similar amount of protein per serving, making the choice a matter of personal preference and lifestyle.</p>

          <p>A new investigation by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation suggests that legendary sheriff Buford Pusser, who inspired the 1973 movie "Walking Tall," may have murdered his wife, Pauline Pusser, in 1967. For decades, it was believed she was killed in an ambush intended for him. However, modern forensic analysis of exhumed remains and the crime scene revealed inconsistencies with Pusser's account, including evidence that a gunshot wound he sustained was likely self-inflicted. Officials now believe the crime scene was staged, and if Pusser were alive today, he would likely face a murder indictment.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees Voice of America (VOA), has announced the elimination of over 500 jobs, escalating a legal battle over the news outlet's future. The move, announced by acting CEO Kari Lake, comes despite a federal judge recently blocking the administration's attempt to fire VOA's director. A group of agency employees, who have sued to prevent the dismantling of VOA, called the continued attacks "abhorrent" and plan to challenge the decision. The layoffs are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to reshape the government-funded international broadcaster.</p>

          <p>Pop singer Sabrina Carpenter has released her new album, "Man's Best Friend," which follows up on her successful 2024 record "Short n' Sweet." The album's central theme explores the singer's continued frustrations with her love life despite achieving superstardom, detailing encounters with various unimpressive men. Musically, the album continues to draw from 70s AM-radio pop, disco, and country influences, crafted with producer Jack Antonoff. While some critics find it slightly less sharp than its predecessor, the album is noted for its witty lyricism and Carpenter's versatile vocal performance.</p>

          <p>The use of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) in the Premier League has once again come under fire following several controversial decisions in recent matches. Burnley manager Scott Parker criticized the system for turning football into "the most sterile game there is" after a late penalty decision in their loss to Manchester United. Similarly, Fulham manager Marco Silva expressed frustration over a disallowed goal in their match against Chelsea. These incidents have reignited the debate over whether VAR is improving the sport or detracting from its spontaneity and enjoyment.</p>

In her apology, Ostapenko explained that English is not her native language and she was referring to tennis etiquette, but understood how her words could be offensive.

          <p>Chelsea FC has abruptly canceled striker Nicolas Jackson's planned loan move to Bayern Munich after another one of their forwards, Liam Delap, sustained a serious injury. Jackson was already in Germany to complete the deal when Chelsea revoked permission for his medical and instructed him to return to London. The sudden decision was prompted by Delap's hamstring injury during a match, which could sideline him for up to eight weeks, leaving the team with only one fit striker.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump overstepped his authority by imposing widespread "reciprocal tariffs" on most countries, declaring the move illegal. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which Trump cited, does not grant the president the power to implement such broad levies, a power that resides with Congress. The ruling affects tariffs on goods from over 60 countries but does not impact sector-specific levies on steel and aluminum. The Trump administration is expected to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump made his first public appearance after unfounded rumors of his death circulated widely on social media platforms. The 79-year-old was photographed with his grandchildren on the south lawn of the White House before a family golf trip. The online speculation was fueled by recent comments from Vice President J.D. Vance about being prepared to step in if a "terrible tragedy" were to occur. This incident follows other recent public concerns about Trump's health, including observations of bruising on his hand and a diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that a direct, bilateral meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is unlikely to happen soon. In an interview, Trump stated, "A bi, I don't know about, but a tri will happen," suggesting a trilateral meeting involving the U.S. is more plausible. He also expressed openness to the U.S. providing a security guarantee, possibly involving aircraft, to help end the war, emphasizing the high weekly death toll. This comes as French President Emmanuel Macron pushes for a meeting to occur, setting a deadline for Putin to agree.</p>

          <p>New York City's health department has officially declared the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem to be over, as no new cases have been reported since August 9. The outbreak resulted in 114 confirmed cases, leading to 90 hospitalizations and seven deaths. The source of the bacteria was traced to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been cleaned and disinfected. In response, the city administration has proposed new regulations to enhance the inspection and testing frequency of cooling towers to prevent future clusters.</p>

Pakistan has announced it will resume deportations in September, potentially affecting over a million people. The resumption of the German admission process follows pressure from human rights groups and German court rulings that affirmed the government's legally binding commitment to these individuals.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that stethoscopes enhanced with artificial intelligence can detect three major heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—almost instantly. Researchers in the UK conducted a study across 205 GP surgeries, finding the AI tool significantly increased the detection rates for these conditions compared to traditional methods. The device analyzes subtle heart sounds and electrical signals that are undetectable by the human ear, sending the data to an AI for analysis. Experts believe this innovation could be a "game-changer," enabling earlier diagnosis and treatment for patients.</p>
