          <p>U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune stated he offered Democrats a vote on extending Affordable Care Act subsidies in an attempt to end the government shutdown, now in its 16th day. However, he could not guarantee the outcome of such a vote, a key point of contention. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer disputed this, claiming no formal proposal was presented, highlighting the deep divisions preventing a resolution. The continued stalemate ensures the government will remain closed, as procedural votes to advance funding legislation have repeatedly failed.</p>

          <p>The United States military conducted missions with three B-52 long-range bombers in the Caribbean Sea, flying near the coast of Venezuela. This action is part of the Trump administration's strategy to increase pressure on President Nicolás Maduro's government. The flight is the latest in a series of military escalations in the region, which includes the deployment of warships, a submarine, and approximately 10,000 U.S. forces. The administration has also authorized airstrikes on alleged drug vessels and covert CIA operations within the country.</p>

During her trip, she publicly called on Serbia to improve its rule of law, media freedom, and align with EU sanctions against Russia. In contrast, she praised Montenegro as a "frontrunner" in the accession process, highlighting its alignment with EU foreign policy.

          <p>U.S. Capitol Police are investigating the distribution of American flags to multiple congressional offices that contain a hidden swastika pattern. The symbol is reportedly difficult to see with the naked eye but becomes clear when photographed or filmed, described by sources as an "optical illusion." The discovery, including one flag in the office of Republican Rep. Dave Taylor, has prompted concerns about whether the flags were distributed to covertly spread a hate symbol or to embarrass lawmakers. Rep. Taylor condemned the symbol and stated a thorough investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>A procedural vote to advance a House-passed bill that would fund the U.S. military during the government shutdown failed in the Senate, falling short of the required 60-vote threshold. Most Democrats opposed the measure, arguing it contained controversial policy provisions, or "poison pills," that limited assistance to Ukraine and restricted service members' access to certain health care. Republican leader John Thune criticized the move as dysfunctional, while Democrats insisted on a bipartisan appropriations process that doesn't isolate defense funding from other national priorities. The vote underscores the deep partisan divide prolonging the shutdown.</p>

The report suggests that this financial burden will not be borne by companies alone; it conservatively estimates that two-thirds of these costs will be passed on to consumers through higher prices. This transfer of wealth is attributed to the tariffs acting as a tax on supply chains, compounded by logistical delays and increased freight expenses. The findings challenge the administration's assertion that foreign exporters would primarily absorb the impact of the duties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite broader economic concerns, U.S. consumers are planning to spend significantly on Halloween this year, according to a new survey from PwC. Nearly 80% of Americans intend to participate in the holiday, with an expected average spending of $289 per person. Parents with young children are projected to spend even more, at an average of $445. The top spending categories are costumes and decorations, followed closely by party supplies and candy for trick-or-treaters. The findings suggest that consumers are prioritizing seasonal celebrations and experiences, viewing Halloween as a relatively smaller expense they are unwilling to cut back on.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. federal budget deficit decreased slightly to $1.78 trillion for the 2025 fiscal year, according to the Treasury Department. A key factor in the reduction was a record-setting $202 billion collected from customs duties, a 142% increase driven by the Trump administration's tariffs. This surge in revenue helped to counterbalance another record: over $1.2 trillion in interest payments on the nation's $38 trillion debt. Despite the marginal improvement, the deficit remains historically high, representing an estimated 5.9% of the nation's gross domestic product. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released its winter outlook for 2025-2026, forecasting warmer-than-average temperatures across a large portion of the contiguous United States. The prediction is heavily influenced by an active La Niña climate pattern, which typically brings cooler, wetter conditions to the northern states and warmer, drier weather to the South. Consequently, the Pacific Northwest, northern Rockies, and western Great Lakes are expected to see above-normal precipitation. In contrast, the Southwest, southern Texas, and the Southeast are likely to experience a drier winter than usual.</p>

          <p>The J. M. Smucker Company has filed a federal lawsuit against grocery chain Trader Joe's, accusing it of trademark infringement over its frozen, crustless peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Smucker's claims that the Trader Joe's product too closely mimics the unique disc shape and crimped edges of its popular "Uncrustables" brand, for which it holds several trademarks. The lawsuit alleges that the similar appearance and packaging constitute unfair competition and trademark dilution. Smucker's is seeking damages and a court order to stop the sale of the Trader Joe's version of the sandwich.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has affirmed his determination to pressure Hamas for the return of the remaining 19 dead hostages held in Gaza. His statement followed the handover of two more bodies, after which Hamas claimed it was unable to access the other remains due to the level of destruction in the territory. The delay has caused anger in Israel, though U.S. officials have downplayed it as a breach of last week's ceasefire agreement. Concurrently, U.S. President Donald Trump warned that fighting could resume if Hamas "continues to kill people," referencing reports of internal violence within Gaza.</p>
