        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has withdrawn Alina Habba's nomination to be the U.S. attorney for New Jersey, a move that legally allows her to serve in the position in an acting capacity. This decision follows a federal court's attempt to replace her with her deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, as Habba's initial 120-day interim term was expiring. The Justice Department, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, strongly opposed the court's action, creating a contentious leadership dispute. By pulling the nomination, the administration circumvents a federal law that would have prevented her from serving as an acting officer while a formal nomination was pending in the Senate.</p>

          <p>Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley is set to announce his candidacy for North Carolina's open U.S. Senate seat, with an expected endorsement from President Trump. This development follows Lara Trump's decision not to run for the position herself. On the Democratic side, former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper is also expected to declare his candidacy for the seat being vacated by Republican Senator Thom Tillis. The race is anticipated to be a major battleground contest in the 2026 midterm elections, setting the stage for a high-profile political showdown.</p>

          <h2>Columbia University Agrees to $221 Million Settlement to Restore Federal Research Funding</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 18:24:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Columbia University has reached a deal with the Trump administration, agreeing to pay over $221 million and make other concessions to restore hundreds of millions in federal research funding. The administration had frozen approximately $400 million in grants in March, citing allegations of antisemitism on campus amid pro-Palestinian protests. This settlement resolves the dispute for Columbia but highlights a broader pattern of the administration targeting higher education institutions, with similar actions taken against Harvard and other universities. The agreement includes provisions related to DEI programs, international student admissions, and Title IX compliance.</p>

          <p>A significant car explosion occurred in a parking lot in Arlington, Virginia, a suburb near Washington, D.C., with the incident captured on video. The Arlington Fire & EMS department attributed the blast to a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE) from the vehicle's ruptured fuel tank. The fire was quickly extinguished by firefighters, and fortunately, no injuries to the public or emergency responders were reported. The explosion damaged at least three other vehicles, and fire marshals have determined that the incident was not suspicious and are investigating the specific cause.</p>

This action comes as the U.S. faces a record high in homelessness, driven by a severe housing shortage.

          <p>Alice Bag and Kid Congo Powers, two influential figures from the early Los Angeles Chicano punk scene, are collaborating as the musical duo Juanita y Juan. Their project, which they describe as "loud lounge," merges electro-cumbia with punk sensibilities, and they recently performed at a children's event with the Bob Baker Marionette Theater. Both artists have chronicled their experiences as Mexican Americans in the punk movement through memoirs. They continue to serve as icons for new generations, emphasizing the significant but often overlooked contributions of Latino artists to the history of punk rock.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that investors own 19% of all homes in California, a figure that underscores the state's deepening housing affordability crisis. While this rate is just below the national average, it translates to 1.45 million investor-owned homes in a state with a severe housing shortage and soaring prices. The data shows higher concentrations in mountain counties, while major urban areas like Los Angeles and San Francisco have slightly lower rates. Although rising mortgage rates have sidelined many traditional homebuyers, investors continue to provide liquidity to the market, though experts debate whether this helps or hurts overall affordability.

          <p>A discussion on CNN's "NewsNight with Abby Phillip" grew heated when conservative commentator Scott Jennings called fellow panelist Keith Boykin, a former Clinton aide, "whiny." The exchange occurred during a segment about Columbia University's settlement with the Trump administration, after Boykin criticized Jennings for repeatedly interrupting other speakers. Boykin challenged Jennings to repeat the insult, leading to a tense on-air moment. The incident drew criticism on social media and was analyzed by a therapist who described the name-calling as a "communication interrupter" designed to dismiss and condescend.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture is implementing a major restructuring that will force thousands of employees to relocate from the Washington D.C. area and accept salary cuts. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced that over half of the D.C.-based staff will be moved to one of five new hub locations as part of a plan to reduce the department's footprint in the capital. Critics and experts warn that the move will weaken support for farmers, complicate wildfire response, and result in a mass loss of experienced staff. The reorganization is part of the broader Trump administration effort to reduce the size of the federal government.</p>

Macron stated the move is consistent with France's historical commitment to peace in the Middle East and emphasized the urgent need for a ceasefire in Gaza. The decision makes France one of the most powerful European nations to take this step, joining over 140 other countries.

In a column, Starmer warned the strike would cause "huge loss for the NHS and the country" and criticized the British Medical Association (BMA) for "rushing" into industrial action. The BMA maintains the strike is necessary because doctors' real-term wages have been significantly eroded over the past 17 years. The government has offered a 5.4% pay rise but has rejected the BMA's demand for full pay restoration to 2008 levels.</p>

Riley noted that a playoff model with automatic qualifiers for the Big Ten, which his conference supports, would help preserve important nonconference rivalries.

          <p>California's State Water Resources Control Board has released a draft plan that would give water agencies more flexibility in meeting water quality standards for the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. The controversial proposal, backed by Governor Gavin Newsom, offers a pathway for agencies to use "voluntary agreements"—combining habitat restoration with water flow commitments—as an alternative to stricter, flow-based regulations. Environmental groups strongly oppose this approach, arguing it will harm the Delta's fragile ecosystem and endangered fish species by allowing excessive water diversions.

          <p>A federal appeals court has declared California's law requiring background checks for all ammunition purchases to be unconstitutional, upholding a lower court's 2024 ruling. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the voter-approved 2016 law violates the Second Amendment by placing a significant burden on the right to keep and bear arms. The court reasoned that since ammunition is necessary to operate a firearm for self-defense, the requirement to be rechecked for every purchase is an unconstitutional constraint. Governor Gavin Newsom condemned the decision, while gun rights advocates praised it as a victory against overreaching government control.</p>
