          <p>Eric Trump has hinted at a potential future presidential run for himself or another family member once his father's term concludes. In an interview, he stated that the political path would be an "easy one" but expressed hesitation about subjecting his family to the "brutality" of the political system. While his siblings have been more politically involved, Eric Trump, who has primarily focused on the family business, claimed he is "wholly unimpressed" by many current politicians and believes he could do the job effectively. He also defended his family against accusations of profiting from the presidency, asserting the financial and personal costs have been "astronomical."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's domestic policy legislation includes proposed cuts of up to $300 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps. These cuts, the largest in the program's history, would fund tax breaks for the wealthy and come as food insecurity is already rising nationwide. The changes would impose stricter work requirements on parents and older adults, putting millions at risk of losing their benefits. Anti-hunger advocates warn the move would be catastrophic, damaging the health of children and families and devastating local economies that rely on the program.</p>

          <p>The Department of Defense is set to halt data collection from its Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) by the end of June, giving forecasters only days to prepare for the change. Scientists warn this decision could severely hamper hurricane forecasting capabilities, potentially setting them back decades, just as an active season begins. The DMSP satellites provide unique data that allows researchers to see inside developing storms, a critical tool for predicting rapid intensification. Despite government assurances, multiple experts assert there is no adequate replacement, creating a significant gap in monitoring both hurricanes and polar sea ice.</p>

          <p>New York's financial elite has reacted with alarm to Zohran Mamdani's victory in the Democratic mayoral primary, with some billionaires threatening to move their businesses out of the city. Mamdani, a self-described socialist, defeated a more moderate, establishment-backed candidate, prompting fears of "class warfare" and policies that could harm the city's economy. Business leaders have pledged millions to oppose his campaign, arguing his agenda would destroy the tax base that funds public services. This outcome represents a significant defeat for Wall Street donors who heavily funded Mamdani's opponent and signals a potential shift in the city's political landscape.</p>

          <p>The Eastern Kentucky Remembrance Project (EKRP) is working to uncover and memorialize the forgotten history of racial lynchings in the region. The group recently installed a historical marker for Fred Shannon, a Black musician who was lynched by a mob in 1924 after being falsely accused of murder. Founded in 2021, the interracial coalition researches these violent events, places markers at the sites, and collects soil for a national memorial. Despite some local opposition, members say the work is vital for confronting a painful past, especially amid modern efforts to suppress Black history.</p>

          <p>An investigation by the nonprofit Earthsight has linked several high-end fashion brands, including Fendi, Coach, and Hugo Boss, to leather sourced from illegally deforested areas in Brazil. The report traces the supply chain from cattle farms operating on protected Indigenous land to Brazilian meatpackers and tanneries in Italy that supply the luxury houses. While most of the accused brands have denied the specific allegations or stated the leather they use is not from Brazil, the findings highlight significant gaps in supply chain traceability. The report calls for better enforcement and transparency, especially with a new EU anti-deforestation law set to take effect.</p>

The report, which quotes anonymous soldiers, describes the areas as "killing fields" where gunfire is used instead of crowd control, even when no threat is posed. Israel's government labeled the article "blood libel" and a "malicious falsehood," while the military rejected the accusations but stated it is examining the incidents. Aid groups like Doctors Without Borders have corroborated treating numerous patients shot near these sites, calling the distribution system a "slaughter masquerading as humanitarian aid."</p>

          <p>In a major policy shift driven by a new Trump presidency and the war in Europe, Germany plans to significantly increase its military spending to 3.5% of its GDP. Incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced the goal is to build the strongest armed forces in Europe, a move made possible by a constitutional change and a special $117 billion fund. This represents a historic change for a country that has long underspent on defense, reflecting a new sense of urgency among its leaders. While defense companies are seeing a surge in business, the plan also involves the long-term challenge of rebuilding a culture of military service.</p>

          <p>Despite Kentucky being a strong base of support for Donald Trump, some of the state's most prominent Republican lawmakers are notable for their opposition to his policies. Senator Rand Paul, Senator Mitch McConnell, and Representative Thomas Massie have all publicly criticized or voted against key parts of the president's agenda, from tariffs to his "big, beautiful bill." This resistance has angered many of Trump's supporters in the state and prompted the former president to call for a primary challenger against Massie. The dynamic has created a unique pocket of intra-party dissent within an otherwise highly unified national Republican party.</p>

          <p>Following devastating wildfires, some Los Angeles County residents are seeking to rebuild their homes using fire-resistant, eco-friendly materials like adobe and straw bale. However, architects and engineers report that the county's permitting process for these non-traditional materials is unclear and potentially onerous, discouraging many from pursuing this path. While county officials express openness to alternative construction, they require extensive and costly testing that can be prohibitive for individual homeowners. This has created a frustrating bottleneck for fire victims who want to build more resiliently and sustainably but are forced to opt for conventional methods due to the regulatory uncertainty.</p>

The measures effectively dismantled a newly created parent review board for children's books and barred the privatization of the city's libraries. This outcome serves as a strong rebuke to the city's MAGA-aligned council supermajority, which had pushed for these changes, alleging the library contained inappropriate materials.

His attorney, a young Johnnie Cochran, was haunted by the case, believing his client was framed by law enforcement as part of the FBI's COINTELPRO program. Pratt spent 27 years in prison before his conviction was overturned in 1997, after evidence emerged that prosecutors had hidden key information, including the fact that their star witness was a police informant. The case stands as a stark example of official corruption and the lengths to which authorities went to dismantle Black militant groups.</p>

          <p>California is using the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, a law forbidding the use of the military for civilian law enforcement, in its legal challenge against President Trump's deployment of troops in Los Angeles. A federal judge has ordered the government to provide evidence regarding how federalized National Guard and Marine forces are being used, which is central to the state's case. The law originated after the Civil War to end the Reconstruction era, and its use today highlights a fundamental conflict over presidential power. Legal experts note the law is full of loopholes, suggesting California faces an uphill battle to limit the White House's authority.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues against the "respectability politics" being promoted by some conservative gay figures who seek to distance the LGBTQ+ community from its more flamboyant or radical members. The author references the film "Flawless" and historical events like the Stonewall Riots, emphasizing that drag queens and gender-nonconforming individuals have always been at the forefront of the fight for gay rights. The piece criticizes attempts to create a "normal gay" archetype, asserting that the movement's strength and beauty come from its diversity. It concludes that progress has always been driven by the entire, multifaceted community, not a sanitized, monolithic version of it.</p>

          <p>A homeowner in a remote area of Northern California was forced to flee her residence after it was repeatedly ransacked by a group of at least 11 burglars. The extensive damage caused by the break-ins created an opening for a group of bears to enter and occupy the house, causing further destruction. The Butte County district attorneyâ€™s office has announced charges against the 11 suspects for first-degree residential burglary. This bizarre sequence of events left the 64-year-old victim displaced and facing significant financial loss from both the human and wildlife intrusions.</p>

          <p>Many financial analysts are forecasting that the U.S. stock market will experience flat or only meager gains in 2025, a departure from the historical average of 10% annual growth. This conservative outlook is driven by several factors, including stocks starting the year at high valuations and significant economic uncertainty related to trade tariffs, inflation, and potential recession. Some experts also note that forecasters tend to be cautious and that long-term investors shouldn't be swayed by single-year projections. However, some suggest this environment may warrant diversifying portfolios beyond traditional large-cap U.S. stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

The author argues that while unprecedented for a president in such a public forum, the moment came across as authentic and reflected a frustration shared by many observers. The piece suggests that the public's distrust of polished, scripted political speech is a major problem for the political class. While not endorsing profanity as a standard, the author posits that judicious, genuine moments of unscripted emotion could help politicians seem more human and trustworthy to voters.</p>

          <p>The upcoming Fourth of July celebrations may feature more expensive and less available fireworks due to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports. The U.S. is almost entirely dependent on China for both consumer and professional pyrotechnics, which were hit with steep tariffs this spring. Importers have faced volatile pricing and, in some cases, halted deliveries to avoid the high taxes, likely leading to product shortages and higher costs for consumers. The industry is particularly concerned about 2026, the nation's 250th birthday, fearing that continued high tariffs could turn major celebratory displays into duds.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has unexpectedly punted on a decision in a Louisiana congressional redistricting case, scheduling it for re-argument in the next term. The case, which centers on whether the state's new map is an unconstitutional racial gerrymander, could significantly impact the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Voting rights advocates fear a ruling against the current map could further weaken Section 2 protections against diluting the power of minority voters.
