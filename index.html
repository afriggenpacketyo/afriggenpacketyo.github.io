          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 09:25:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>North Carolina's Democratic Governor, Josh Stein, has vetoed four Republican-led bills, including three that aimed to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in state government and schools. Stein criticized the legislation as "mean-spirited" and accused Republicans of stoking culture wars instead of passing a state budget. The fourth bill combined anti-sexual exploitation measures with controversial provisions restricting transgender rights, such as banning state-funded gender-affirming care for prisoners. The bills now return to the General Assembly, where Republicans are one vote short of a veto-proof supermajority in the House and may attempt an override.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Inspired by a trip to Denmark, Emory University professor Marina Cooley undertook a year-long experiment, trying 17 different hobbies to combat burnout and find more balance in her life. She discovered that engaging in activities like tennis, mahjong, and home DIY projects helped her overcome doomscrolling, feel less lonely by building community, and redefine her concept of self-care. Cooley argues that hobbies are not a reward for achieving work-life balance but are the key to creating it in the first place. She now feels fundamentally changed, more connected to others, and is modeling a healthier lifestyle for her children.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of mourners, including family, fans, and prominent football figures like Virgil van Dijk, gathered in Gondomar, Portugal, for the funeral of brothers Diogo Jota, 28, and André Silva, 25. The two professional footballers died in a car crash in Spain while traveling back to Liverpool for Jota's pre-season training. The tragedy occurred just 11 days after Jota, a forward for Liverpool FC, had married his long-term partner, with whom he had three children. The service was a somber and emotional affair, reflecting the deep impact the brothers had on their local community and the wider football world.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the mixed verdict in Sean "Diddy" Combs's federal trial demonstrates the legal system's failure to adequately handle cases of intimate partner violence and coercive control. While Combs was acquitted of the most serious racketeering and sex-trafficking charges, he was convicted of lesser charges and his defense admitted to his history of domestic abuse against Cassie Ventura. The author suggests that prosecutors resorted to trafficking charges because existing domestic violence laws are often outdated and ill-equipped to address the complexities of abuse by wealthy, powerful individuals. The piece critiques the media's portrayal and public reaction, expressing concern that Combs could still find a path back to prominence.</p>

          <p>In the Utah desert, the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS), run by the nonprofit Mars Society, provides a realistic environment for "analog astronauts" to prepare for future missions to Mars. Crews of five live in a simulated habitat for two-week missions, following strict protocols similar to those they would face on the red planet. Their daily routine includes planning meetings and extravehicular activities (EVAs), where they wear mock spacesuits to conduct research in the Mars-like terrain. The experience is designed to test human endurance, teamwork, and scientific procedures in an isolated, high-stakes environment, anticipating potential human missions to Mars as early as 2029.</p>

          <p>A study by SmartAsset reveals that Florida was the most popular state for retirees in 2023, attracting a net migration of over 44,500 residents aged 60 and older. This figure, while still the highest in the nation, represents a significant decrease from the previous year. North Carolina and Arizona followed as the next most popular destinations. The primary driver for Florida's popularity among retirees is its favorable tax policies, including no state income tax on Social Security benefits, pensions, or retirement account withdrawals, as well as no estate or inheritance tax. California saw the largest exodus of retirees, with a net loss of nearly 57,000.</p>

          <p>A recent study highlights remarkable progress in combating heart disease, with the proportion of deaths from heart attacks in the U.S. falling by nearly 90 percent between 1970 and 2022. This significant decline is attributed to a combination of public health campaigns against smoking, the development of statin drugs to manage cholesterol, and improved emergency treatments like CPR and angioplasty. While heart disease remains a leading cause of death, often in more chronic forms, this success in treating acute heart attacks has saved tens of millions of lives.

          <p>Reverend William Barber, a prominent civil rights leader, is continuing his "Moral Mondays" protests and the Poor People's Campaign, a national movement aimed at combating poverty and systemic injustice. Grounded in a theological tradition of nonviolent protest, the movement challenges what Barber calls "policy murder"—legislation that cuts social safety nets for the poor while benefiting the wealthy. The article follows a recent protest in Washington D.C., highlighting the campaign's "fusion" strategy of uniting diverse groups of poor and working-class people. Barber argues that such moral witness is essential to challenge a political system that he believes has become disconnected from the needs of its most vulnerable citizens.</p>

          <p>Credit scoring company FICO has announced it will begin incorporating buy now, pay later (BNPL) loan data into its credit score models, a move that will affect millions of users of services like Affirm and Klarna. For consumers who make their BNPL payments on time, this change could help them build a positive credit history, which is particularly beneficial for younger users or those with limited credit. However, it also means that late payments or accumulating too much debt through these services could negatively impact a person's credit score. The change reflects the growing role of BNPL in consumer finance, though its full impact may take time as lenders slowly adopt the newest FICO models.</p>

          <p>Michigan's tart cherry industry, which produces 75% of the U.S. crop, is facing a severe crisis due to a combination of climate change, development, and economic challenges. Warmer springs lead to early budding, making the crop vulnerable to late frosts, which significantly reduced this year's expected harvest. Farmers are also grappling with rising land prices, labor shortages, and low prices for their fruit, which last year sold for far below the cost of production. These pressures threaten not only the cherry farmers but also the broader agrotourism industry in regions like Traverse City, the self-proclaimed "cherry capital of the world."</p>

          <p>A Guardian investigation has revealed the existence of the Old Glory Club (OGC), a network of at least 26 far-right, men-only clubs operating across 20 U.S. states. The group, which includes military personnel, lawyers, and prominent antisemitic influencers, promotes extremist ideologies and aims to build an offline social network to advance its political goals. Key members use podcasts and social media to spread racist and antisemitic views, while the organization holds conferences and meetups. Anti-hate groups describe the OGC as a new breed of extremist organization that lowers the bar for participation in the far-right, posing a potential national security threat.</p>

          <p>The discovery of 38 bodies, mostly young men, in or near Austin's Lady Bird Lake since 2022 has sparked fears of a serial killer among the local community. Despite police assurances that most deaths are accidental drownings often involving alcohol, the pattern has led to speculation about foul play, possibly linked to victims being drugged at nearby bars. A forensic psychiatrist quoted in the article suggests that ruling out a serial killer is premature given the high number of victims of the same gender. Authorities maintain there is no evidence of a serial killer and no ongoing threat to the public.</p>

          <p>A new study by researchers from several prominent Chinese institutions suggests that sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, could have cancer-fighting properties. The research, published in the journal Nature, found that the drug may help combat tumors by strengthening the immune system's dendritic cells. These crucial "intelligence agent" cells can become depleted as cancer progresses, and the study indicates that sildenafil could help reverse this process and restore their anti-tumor function. The discovery is being hailed as a potential new strategy for tumor immunotherapy, repurposing a well-known drug for a new life-saving application.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece from The Atlantic argues that Sean "Diddy" Combs's acquittal on racketeering and sex trafficking charges should not be mistaken for a full exoneration, as his defense team openly admitted to his history of domestic violence. The author criticizes the defense's triumphant post-verdict narrative, pointing out that Combs was still found guilty of lesser charges and that video evidence confirms his violent assault on Cassie Ventura. The trial is framed as a grim example of how power, wealth, and a savvy legal strategy can obscure the core issue of abuse, leaving the public with a distorted view of justice and accountability.</p>

This has left many professors feeling burned out and despairing, as policing the issue is nearly impossible and raises uncomfortable questions about the value of assignments and degrees. The piece argues that this isn't just a moral panic about new technology but a seismic shift exposing the transactional nature of the university system. With the potential for AI to grade essays written by AI, the very purpose of writing and thinking in academia is being called into question.</p>

While U.S. and Israeli strikes significantly damaged enrichment facilities and killed key personnel, experts believe Iran retains the knowledge, centrifuges, and enriched uranium to reconstitute its program. Tehran has already signaled its defiance by suspending cooperation with IAEA inspectors and asserting that its nuclear ambitions are a matter of national pride. The conflict is seen less as a final resolution and more as an intermission, setting the stage for a long-term, high-stakes game of concealment and surveillance between the regional adversaries.</p>
