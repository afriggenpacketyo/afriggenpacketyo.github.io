          <p>India reported conducting strikes against Pakistan, targeting what it identified as terrorist infrastructure in response to a militant attack in Kashmir that killed 26 people last month. The Indian government stated that the strikes were focused and non-escalatory, avoiding Pakistani military facilities. Pakistan's Prime Minister condemned the strikes as an act of war, vowing a strong response and claiming five Indian jets were shot down. The United Nations Secretary General called for restraint, emphasizing the potential for the conflict to spiral out of control and urging both nations to pursue dialogue for regional peace and stability.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a truce between the United States and the Houthis in Yemen, stating that the Iranian-backed militants had agreed to cease attacks against American vessels in the Red Sea. However, the Houthis stopped short of declaring a full ceasefire, indicating they would continue to fight Israel. The United States began striking Houthi targets in mid-March to reopen international shipping lanes, costing over $1 billion. The agreement's impact on international shipping and the broader conflict remains uncertain, as experts express skepticism about the Houthis' commitment to a lasting cessation of attacks.</p>

          <p>China experienced a surge in domestic tourism during the May Labor Day holiday, with 314 million trips reported nationwide, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. This increase is attributed to rising interest in cultural and historical sites, as well as improved transportation infrastructure connecting smaller cities. While retail sales have remained tepid, the services sector, including tourism, has shown faster growth, indicating a shift in consumer spending priorities. Chinese cities are also enhancing their efforts to attract tourists through various means, including social media and virtual reality experiences, while the country is expanding its visa-free policies to attract foreign tourists.</p>

          <p>Newly released audio recordings capture the tense moments when air traffic controllers at Newark Liberty International Airport temporarily lost communication with planes under their control. The audio reveals a pilot repeatedly asking, "Approach, are you there?" without response, highlighting the potential dangers of the equipment failure. The incident, which lasted between 30 and 90 seconds, contributed to significant flight delays and led to multiple air traffic controllers requesting trauma leave. The Transportation Secretary acknowledged the system's fragility and the need for improvements.</p>

          <p>China, a major aluminium producer and consumer, may soon reduce its reliance on imported aluminium ore thanks to French technology. A plant in Shanxi province is being upgraded with technology from IB2, a green tech company, which will enable it to produce aluminium from China's low-grade ore that was previously unusable. The process neutralises silica and sulphur, meaning high-silica bauxite can be refined using the Bayer method. IB2 signed a 22-year agreement with Chinese firm Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum to switch over to the technology in 2023.</p>
