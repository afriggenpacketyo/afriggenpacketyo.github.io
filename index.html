          <p>Dr. Phil McGraw, the television personality, accompanied Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers during raids in Los Angeles, his TV network confirmed. This marks the second time this year that McGraw has embedded with ICE, previously joining the U.S. border czar in Chicago. The raids in Los Angeles led to numerous arrests and sparked widespread condemnation from California's governor and L.A.'s mayor.

          <p>Canada has pledged to significantly increase its defense spending to meet NATO's 2% of GDP target years ahead of schedule, now aiming for March of next year. Prime Minister Mark Carney announced this military buildup, including investments in submarines, aircraft, and ships, to counter threats from hostile governments and ensure Arctic security. He also criticized Washington's approach to trade, stating that the country was "too reliant" on the United States for defense. The plan includes a C$9.3 billion increase in funding and the creation of a new defense procurement agency to expedite equipment acquisition.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million countersuit against Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and others, ending a heated legal feud between the "It Ends With Us" co-stars. The lawsuit stemmed from Lively's accusations of sexual harassment against Baldoni, which he denied, claiming Lively pushed a false narrative against him. Lively's lawyers hailed the dismissal as a complete vindication and look forward to seeking attorneys' fees and damages against Baldoni. The judge's decision follows DailyMail reporter James Vituscka's admission of a mistake in the use of the phrase "sexually assaulted" in text messages related to the case.</p>

          <p>The increasing demand for clean energy technologies is driving a surge in the need for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, and copper, essential for solar panels, batteries, and electric motors. These minerals are unevenly distributed globally, leading to potential supply chain vulnerabilities and environmental concerns. The Trump administration is focused on increasing domestic production of these minerals, while China, a major producer, has imposed export limits, disrupting the market. Scientists are also exploring alternative materials and more efficient mining methods to mitigate these constraints and ensure a sustainable clean energy future.</p>

          <p>The income needed to buy a median-priced home in the U.S. has surged to $114,000, a 70.1% increase from six years ago, pricing many Americans out of the housing market. A chronic lack of housing supply and rising interest rates are key factors driving this affordability crisis. While construction of new homes has decreased, some homeowners are starting to reduce prices, offering a glimmer of hope for potential buyers in high-cost markets. The report indicates that housing inventory is starting to build in several high-cost markets, including San Diego, San Jose, and Washington, D.C.</p>

          <p>The White House stated that President Trump deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles with the expectation that their presence would deter violence during immigration protests. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed that Governor Newsom and Mayor Bass have hindered the Los Angeles Police Department's ability to enforce immigration laws. Leavitt suggested that Newsom could face arrest for obstructing federal enforcement and did not rule out invoking the Insurrection Act. The deployment allows for a 60-day operation, which will continue until the violence subsides.</p>
