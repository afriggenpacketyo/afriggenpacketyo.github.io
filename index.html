          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing a significant rebellion from within his own Labour party over planned welfare cuts aimed at saving Â£5 billion annually by 2030. Despite opposition from over 120 Labour MPs, Starmer insists the reforms are necessary, arguing that the current welfare system is unsustainable and traps people on benefits. The proposed Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill would make it more difficult for disabled individuals with less severe conditions to claim personal independence payment. Rebel MPs cite concerns about increased poverty, inadequate consultation, and insufficient impact assessments as reasons for their opposition.</p>

          <p>NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has affirmed the U.S.'s unwavering commitment to the alliance, aiming to alleviate concerns about Washington's potential abandonment due to disagreements over defense spending. Speaking at the NATO summit in The Hague, Rutte emphasized that the U.S. expects European and Canadian allies to increase their defense spending to align more closely with American contributions. This year's summit occurs against a backdrop of conflict in the Middle East and the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia. Member states have agreed to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2035, though some countries have expressed reservations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has voiced his displeasure with both Israel and Iran, alleging that both nations violated the recently brokered ceasefire agreement.

          <p>Marina Hyde argues that world leaders should cease attempting to understand or rationalize Donald Trump's behavior, likening it to analyzing the actions of a disinterested romantic partner. She suggests that Trump's actions are primarily self-serving and that leaders should avoid over-interpreting his motives. Instead of trying to find hidden meanings, she advocates for a straightforward recognition that Trump's focus is primarily on himself. The columnist draws a parallel to self-help books that encourage individuals to stop overanalyzing obvious behavior.</p>

          <p>Giulia Gwinn has big boots to fill, having taken over from retired captain Alexandra Popp just a few months ago. Gwinn started playing football at the age of eight â€“ as the only girl on a boys' team at TSG Ailingen, her hometown club in the southwest of Germany. After four years at Freiburg, Gwinn moved to Bayern Munich in 2019. Looking ahead to next month's Euros, Gwinn is positive about Germany's potential on the pitch but sees her team's role as much bigger than that.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has warned Israel against launching further attacks on Iran, hours after he said a ceasefire between the two sides had taken effect. Two hours after Israel said it had agreed to the truce, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had identified missiles launched from Iran. Before the truce began, Iran and Israel exchanged heavy fire. According to Israel's health ministry, four people were killed on Tuesday, bringing the death toll since 13 June to 28.</p>

          <p>Two bears who sparked the evacuation of a wildlife park involving trained firearms staff and police had headed straight for the honey store, the park has said. Wildwood Devon, a conservation charity near Exeter, said European brown bears Mish and Lucy made their way to the food store after breaking free - and then consumed a "week's worth of honey". The park was evacuated after the alarm was raised at about 15:00 BST on Monday - 16 people including children were locked into a play barn for their safety.</p>
