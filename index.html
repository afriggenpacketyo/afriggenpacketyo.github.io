          <p>Severe flash floods have devastated central Texas, resulting in at least 24 fatalities. The rapid rise of the Guadalupe River caught communities by surprise, with officials noting that the area received several months' worth of rain in just a few hours. A large-scale search and rescue operation is underway for numerous missing people, including up to 25 children from a summer camp. Local authorities acknowledged the lack of an adequate warning system for such an unprecedented and catastrophic event.</p>

          <p>Authorities have confirmed the discovery of human remains at the scene of a major explosion and fire at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Esparto, California. The incident, which occurred on Tuesday, also left seven people unaccounted for, including family members of those who worked at the facility. Investigations revealed the warehouse, located on property owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant, was operating without the necessary local permits for storing commercial fireworks. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is assisting in the ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in downtown Los Angeles on the Fourth of July to protest against recent and ongoing immigration raids conducted by federal authorities. The march went through Olvera Street and concluded outside the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building, where military personnel stood guard. Protesters chanted slogans like “No more occupation! No more deportation!” to voice their opposition to the tactics and increased funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The event remained peaceful, with police monitoring from a distance.</p>

          <p>The administration of Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te is facing a dilemma over how to commemorate the Republic of China's (ROC) role in World War II. Critics accuse the government of attempting to honor the ROC's victory against Japan while simultaneously downplaying its historical roots on the Chinese mainland before 1949. This approach aligns with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) focus on a distinct Taiwanese identity, separate from the mainland. The Kuomintang (KMT) forces retreated to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the civil war but continued to use the ROC title.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that to understand Donald Trump's style of governance, one should look beyond Eurocentric comparisons and consider the parallels with cold war-era African dictators. The author points to tactics like deploying military force against domestic protesters, theatrical economic policies, and self-aggrandizing projects as reminiscent of leaders like Mobutu Sese Seko and Idi Amin. The piece suggests that the U.S., having supported such regimes during the cold war, is now seeing some of those authoritarian traits manifest at home. It concludes that while this is alarming, the history of these regimes also shows the resilience of civil society against tyranny.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump recently renewed his attacks on renewable energy, falsely suggesting that China does not use wind power by stating, "I have never seen a wind farm in China." Social media users and news outlets immediately fact-checked the claim, pointing out that China is the world's leading producer of wind energy, with significantly more capacity than the United States. The statement comes as Trump's new legislative bill is set to eliminate tax credits for wind and solar power, a move critics argue will harm the U.S. renewable energy industry and benefit competitors like China.</p>

The act makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent, increases defense and border security funding, and enacts significant spending cuts to federal safety-net programs. While Trump celebrated the law as a victory for the country, Democrats heavily criticized it, warning it primarily benefits the wealthy and could add over $3 trillion to the national debt.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite claims that President Trump's new bill eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security, the legislation does not actually change how benefits are taxed. Instead, the bill introduces a new, temporary "bonus" tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older who fall below certain income thresholds. Policy experts explain this provides some relief but is far from a full repeal of the tax on benefits. Critics also note the deduction will not help the lowest-income seniors who already pay no federal income tax, and the largest benefits will go to higher-income retirees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Is Crying at Work a Sign of Weakness or a Human Moment?</h2>

          <p>A recent emotional public appearance by UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has sparked a broader conversation about the acceptability of crying in the workplace. The article explores different perspectives on whether showing such emotion is a career liability or a sign of strength and emotional intelligence. While some still view it as unprofessional, many, including career coaches and employees, argue that it is a normal human response and that supportive work environments are more productive. The piece suggests that while a single instance is unlikely to ruin a career, perceptions can still vary depending on the workplace culture.</p>

          <h2>Tiny Zooplankton Play a Major Role in Combating Global Warming, New Research Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 19:10:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that tiny marine creatures called zooplankton are "unsung heroes" in the fight against climate change. These animals gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton near the ocean surface in Antarctica and then sink deep into the ocean to hibernate, locking away vast amounts of carbon. This seasonal migration process stores as much carbon as the annual emissions of approximately 55 million gasoline-powered cars, a much larger amount than previously estimated. The findings highlight the critical but often overlooked role of these small organisms in regulating the global climate.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC News investigation has exposed a criminal gang in the UK that is systematically committing will fraud, stealing millions of pounds from the estates of deceased individuals. The fraudsters exploit weaknesses in the online probate system by identifying unclaimed estates and producing forged wills that name them as the sole heir. This allows them to illegally claim property and assets, often while also committing tax fraud by undervaluing the estates. The report highlights several cases where families were denied their rightful inheritance, revealing significant flaws in the current legal and administrative processes.</p>

          <p>This article shares the personal story of a woman named Abbie, who began using ketamine at 16 to escape negative thoughts and ended up in a life-threatening addiction. Her experience illustrates why the drug has become popular among young people with mental health issues, as it provides a feeling of detachment from reality. The piece also details the severe physical damage caused by long-term use, such as "K-cramps" and permanent bladder damage. The story serves as a warning and comes as the UK's NHS opens its first clinic dedicated to helping children struggling with ketamine use.</p>

          <p>The direct-action group Palestine Action has been officially banned in the UK after a High Court judge rejected its last-minute bid to block the government from proscribing it as a terrorist organization. The ban, which came into effect on Saturday, makes it a criminal offense to be a member of or support the group, punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The government moved to ban the group following a history of criminal damage, including an incident at an RAF base. The group's lawyers argued the ban was an "authoritarian abuse" of power against a civil disobedience organization.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy reveals that the tax cuts in President Trump's newly signed legislation disproportionately benefit the wealthiest U.S. households, with the impact varying by state. The top 1% in states with no personal income tax, such as Wyoming, South Dakota, and Texas, are projected to receive the largest benefits, with average tax cuts exceeding $100,000 annually. Conversely, the wealthiest residents in high-tax states like California and New Jersey will see smaller benefits due to the bill's cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions.

After being contacted by a senior Hamas member, Dr. Bahbah has been in Qatar, relaying messages to help facilitate ceasefire and hostage release negotiations. His involvement, which reportedly played a role in the release of an Israeli-American hostage in May, exemplifies the unconventional diplomatic methods being used. The connection was reportedly made through the widow of former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, with whom Dr. Bahbah had worked in the past.</p>

Musk responded to a social media post about the idea with "100% This is the way," endorsing the blunt accountability measure. The renewed attention to the concept, promoted by figures like Republican Senator Mike Lee, taps into public frustration over fiscal irresponsibility and ballooning national debt.

Zookeepers gave the pair one of two eggs laid by another couple to increase the chances of both chicks surviving. This event is part of a successful breeding season for the zoo's colony of Humboldt penguins, which are a vulnerable species. Same-sex penguin parenting, while not common, has been observed in several zoos worldwide, with penguin parents sharing incubation and feeding duties.</p>
