          <p>International students at Harvard University are facing uncertainty and fear due to the Trump administration's recent actions that threaten their ability to enroll and continue their studies. The article highlights the experiences of students from India and Pakistan, who express their disappointment and concern over the potential disruption to their academic and professional futures. The policy changes are viewed as part of a broader crackdown on higher education institutions, particularly those with pro-Palestinian protests, and have led to revoked visas and detentions. Harvard is challenging the move, but the situation has left many students feeling unwelcome and anxious about their prospects in the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on Apple if the company does not shift its iPhone production to the United States, criticizing the company's decision to manufacture in India. Industry analysts, however, deem a US-bound relocation of Apple's supply chain highly unlikely due to the time, expense, and higher labor costs involved. The article discusses the potential consequences of such a move, including increased prices for consumers and the possible shift to cheaper alternatives. It also mentions Apple's existing US-based manufacturing of some components and the broader implications for American manufacturing jobs.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has extended the block on the Trump administration's plans to significantly cut jobs and reorganize federal agencies under the DOGE initiative. The preliminary injunction halts further reductions in force and reorganization of the executive branch, pending the outcome of a lawsuit. The judge emphasized that Congress creates and funds federal agencies, giving them duties that must be carried out, and that large-scale reorganizations cannot occur without congressional partnership. The Trump administration has appealed the decision, seeking to overturn the injunction.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union and a 25% tariff on iPhones not manufactured in the United States, causing market jitters. The EU has not commented on the latest threat. Trump's complaints about Europe have focused on the uneven trade relationship, as the EU sells more goods to the US than it buys from America. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the US wanted to see more concessions from Europe. Shares in the US and EU fell after the threats, with Apple stock opening more than 2% lower.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent threats to impose steep tariffs on goods from the European Union and Apple have sent stock markets into a downturn.

Trump's social media posts calling for a 50 percent tariff on EU goods and a 25 percent tariff on foreign-made iPhones sparked concerns about escalating trade tensions. Treasury Secretary Bessent stated that the president was frustrated with trade talks with the EU, hoping the new threat would incentivize progress. However, some analysts believe the tariffs are unlikely to be implemented long-term due to the potential harm to the U.S. economy.</p>

The proposed tariffs led to an immediate drop in U.S. stock futures and a decline in European stock markets. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed hope that the tariff threat would prompt the EU to offer better concessions.

          <p>President Trump's threat of a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union has cast doubt on the possibility of a trade pact between the two entities. The threat comes ahead of a call between EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who is expected to reject the EU's new list of proposals. The EU has already threatened new tariffs on $107 billion of US goods in response to Trump's earlier tariffs on aluminum, steel, and European automakers. While some EU states may be open to bilateral deals, Trump's antagonism is seen as boosting EU unity.</p>

          <p>A tax and policy bill passed by House Republicans would significantly reduce incentives for electric vehicles (EVs) and their production in the United States. The measure would eliminate subsidies for battery manufacturing, incentives for EV purchases, and funding for charging stations. Republican leaders argue that these subsidies primarily benefit affluent car buyers and aim to use the savings to cut taxes for high-income households and businesses.

          <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee indicated that President Trump's recent tariff threats have complicated monetary policy, likely delaying any changes to interest rates. Goolsbee stated that the Fed will likely remain on hold to assess the impact of trade policy on inflation and employment. While he remains optimistic about long-term economic growth, Goolsbee acknowledged that tariffs with a stagflationary impact present a challenging situation for the central bank. He emphasized the need to evaluate the effects on prices before making any decisions regarding interest rates.</p>

          <p>Stock markets opened lower on Friday after President Trump threatened new tariffs aimed at Apple and the European Union. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all experienced declines in early trading. The market downturn followed Trump's posts on Truth Social regarding his tariff policy, which included a 25% tariff on Apple if it did not shift some of its iPhone production to the U.S. and a 50% tariff on the European Union. European markets also reacted negatively, with Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 falling sharply.</p>

          <p>A tax bill passed by House Republicans, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is projected to disproportionately benefit wealthy Americans while negatively impacting low-income households. The bill includes tax cuts for business owners, investors, and homeowners, while offsetting these cuts with reductions in social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that income for the bottom tenth of households would fall, while those in the top 10% would see an increase. Economists argue that the legislation exacerbates the regressive nature of the Trump administration's recent tariff policies.</p>

          <p>NATO allies are exploring ways to meet President Trump's demand that they spend 5 percent of their national income on defense by broadening the definition of what qualifies as security-related expenditures. Under a proposed plan, countries would aim for military spending at 3.5 percent of their GDP, with an additional 1.5 percent allocated to non-traditional defense-related areas like infrastructure and cybersecurity. The move reflects efforts to appease Trump and acknowledge the need for increased defense spending in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The discussion on NATO spending is expected to be a central focus at the upcoming summit in The Hague.</p>
