          <p>Oracle's recent earnings report, driven by surging demand for its cloud services, has significantly propelled AI-related stocks to record highs. Shares of Oracle jumped 39%, nearing a $1 trillion market capitalization, with gas turbine maker GE Vernova and electrical component supplier Eaton also seeing substantial gains. CNBC's Jim Cramer highlighted the cooler-than-expected August producer price index as a factor sparking speculation of a Federal Reserve rate cut, creating a favorable market backdrop. He also endorsed Apple and Danaher, emphasizing long-term investing and aggressive buybacks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Three senior FBI agents have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging they were fired for political reasons after refusing to demonstrate loyalty to President Trump. The lawsuit claims FBI Director Kash Patel prioritized White House directives over federal law, leading to the dismissal of experienced leaders in national security and violent crime prevention. The agents, including Brian Driscoll and Steven Jensen, assert their Fifth and First Amendment rights were violated. This case marks the second such lawsuit against the Bureau this year, raising concerns about the politicization of the agency's core mission.</p>

          <p>The Universities of Kent and Greenwich are set to merge by autumn 2026, creating the UK's first "super-university" under the name London and South East University Group. This move, welcomed by the Office for Students, aims to provide a stronger financial foundation as 40% of English universities face deficits. While officials insist it's not a takeover, the University and College Union expressed concerns about potential redundancies, calling it a "takeover by Greenwich" due to Kent's financial struggles. The new institution will serve almost 50,000 students across existing campuses, with degrees still awarded under individual university names.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock surged by 40% following its report of extraordinary cloud demand, marking its best day since 1992 and pushing its market capitalization towards $1 trillion. The company disclosed $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, a 359% increase year-over-year, significantly exceeding analyst expectations. This boom is attributed to Oracle's cloud infrastructure business and access to Nvidia's GPUs, capitalizing on the artificial intelligence surge despite fierce competition. Analysts described the results as "astounding" and a "momentous confirmation" of the AI trade, upgrading their ratings and price targets for the stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Labor Department's Office of Inspector General has launched an investigation into the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) methods for collecting jobs and inflation data. This probe follows pressure from the Trump administration and significant downward revisions to employment figures, including a 911,000 drop in new jobs for the year ending March 2025. The inquiry will focus on challenges in collecting Producer Price Index and Consumer Price Index data, as well as the collection and revision of monthly employment data. The move comes after President Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, raising concerns about data integrity and politicization.</p>

          <p>Four men—Craig Colquhoun, Raymond Platt, Joseph McCulloch, and Robert Park—have been unanimously found guilty of murdering Tony Ferns, who died from a stab wound to the heart in April 2019. The High Court in Glasgow heard that Park, 69, orchestrated the "targeted and pre-planned assassination" due to a long-running feud, with Platt delivering the fatal blow. Ferns' girlfriend and mother witnessed parts of the aftermath. Sentences ranged from 18 to 23 years, with Lord Fairley emphasizing the premeditated nature of the crime. The verdict provides some closure for Ferns' family, who described their enduring loss.</p>

          <p>Poland, with NATO allies, scrambled warplanes to shoot down multiple Russian drones that violated its airspace during an attack on Ukraine, marking an unprecedented engagement for NATO in allied territory. Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed the downing of drones posing a direct threat, calling it an "act of aggression." Initial indications suggest the incursion was intentional, leading Poland to formally request invocation of NATO's Article 4. The incident, which saw Polish and Dutch jets engage and German Patriot missiles on alert, underscores escalating regional tensions and calls from Ukrainian and EU officials for stronger responses to Russia's expanding war.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has blocked President Donald Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, granting a preliminary injunction that cites the importance of Fed independence. The judge ruled that Trump's stated "for cause" reason—allegations of mortgage fraud predating Cook's tenure—did not meet the legal standard for removal, which is limited to behavior in office. Cook, the first Black female Fed governor, denies wrongdoing. This decision ensures Cook's participation in the upcoming Fed meeting where a rate cut is expected, and safeguards the central bank's autonomy against political interference, a key concern during Trump's presidency.</p>
