        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom has strongly criticized Israel's military actions in Gaza, with Foreign Secretary David Lammy labeling them "intolerable" and "monstrous." The UK has suspended free trade talks with Israel and imposed sanctions on West Bank settlers in response to the ongoing blockade of supplies into Gaza and expansion of illegal settlements. Lammy emphasized that blocking aid and dismissing the concerns of allies is indefensible and must stop. This move signals a significant downturn in UK-Israel relations, reflecting growing international pressure on Israel to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The UK's Middle East minister has called the 11-week blockade of aid to Gaza "cruel and indefensible."</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has reportedly reached a tentative agreement with blue state Republicans to raise the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions to $40,000 per household for taxpayers earning less than $500,000 annually. This proposal aims to address concerns from Republicans representing high-cost-of-living areas who argue that failing to raise the SALT deduction could jeopardize the GOP's House majority in the 2026 midterms. However, it remains uncertain whether GOP hardliners, who oppose raising the SALT cap, will support the measure, highlighting ongoing internal debates within the House GOP regarding taxes and economic policy.</p>

          <p>The first blood test designed to aid in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is set to become available in the United States starting in late June, following regulatory clearance from the FDA. Developed by Fujirebio Holdings, the test detects amyloid, a protein that accumulates in the brain and is a hallmark of Alzheimer's. This new test offers a less expensive and less invasive alternative to PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid tests, potentially improving access to diagnosis and treatment for the nearly 7 million Americans affected by Alzheimer's. The test will initially be available at around 50 American research institutes and hospitals that specialize in Alzheimer's disease.</p>

          <p>China has warned that it will use its anti-sanctions law to retaliate against the United States if the US enforces its ban on Chinese-made chips. The Ministry of Commerce has condemned Washington's measures as "unilateral bullying and protectionism," asserting that they violate international laws and harm the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises. China's anti-sanction law, passed in 2021, allows for prosecution and compensation claims against those implementing or assisting sanctions against China.

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, has resigned following public criticism of his remarks about never having to buy rice because he receives it as gifts from supporters. His comments were particularly ill-timed, as Japan is grappling with soaring rice prices due to inclement weather and protectionist policies. Eto's resignation comes as Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government faces low approval ratings and ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S. Former Environment Minister Koizumi Shinjiro has been appointed as Eto's successor.

          <p>New satellite analysis reveals that tropical forests disappeared at the fastest rate ever recorded in 2024, primarily due to fires, which surpassed agriculture as the leading cause for the first time. Approximately 67,000 square kilometers of pristine, old-growth forests were lost, releasing 3.1 billion tonnes of planet-warming gases. The Amazon rainforest was particularly affected due to record drought conditions fueled by climate change and El Niño. While Southeast Asia showed progress in reducing forest loss through government policies, the overall trend raises concerns about the resilience of tropical forests in a warming world.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans for the "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, an ambitious project to expand the country's air defense system, aiming for completion by the end of his term. U.S. officials claim it is necessary to protect against "catastrophic attacks," but experts cite logistical and financial hurdles. The project, a priority for Trump, is envisioned as a system with air defense capabilities to intercept rockets and missiles, similar to Israel’s Iron Dome. The president estimates the cost at $175 billion, while the Congressional Budget Office suggests it could be much higher, potentially reaching $542 billion.</p>

          <p>Malaysia, a key player in the global semiconductor industry, is facing uncertainty due to President Trump's evolving trade policies, which include potential tariffs on Malaysian exports to the United States. While Malaysia has benefited from Washington's desire to limit China's access to advanced chips, Trump's proposed levies could undermine Malaysia's ambitious plans to develop high-tech chip manufacturing. The tariffs could also raise costs for American consumers, as Malaysia is a significant source of semiconductors for the U.S. market.

The report underscores that climate change is a key driver of more intense and widespread wildfires.

          <p>Numerous articles and podcasts suggest that young men are fueling the rise of the far right, but this media focus overlooks a more significant shift in public opinion among young people. Research indicates that young women are increasingly turning towards the left, holding more progressive values than previous generations. This shift is evident in their greater support for abortion rights, feminism, environmental protection, and redistribution policies.

          <p>New emails reveal that a top aide to the director of national intelligence, Joe Kent, pressured analysts to revise an intelligence assessment on the relationship between Venezuela's government and the Tren de Aragua gang. Kent sought to align the assessment with President Trump's claim that the gang is controlled by the Maduro regime, a claim contradicted by the original intelligence. The emails have raised concerns about politicizing intelligence analysis and manipulating information to support the administration's policy agenda. The final memo still contradicts a key claim Trump made to justify sending people accused of being members of the gang to a Salvadoran prison without due process.</p>

The decline in exports of transport equipment, including motor vehicles, contributed to the overall decrease.
