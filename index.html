          <p>A U.S. Navy F/A-18E fighter jet rolled off an aircraft carrier into the Red Sea during towing operations, resulting in one minor injury. The incident occurred on the USS Harry S. Truman, which has been deployed in the region to protect commercial ships from Houthi rebel attacks. An investigation is underway to determine the cause of the mishap, with initial reports suggesting possible carrier movement due to Houthi fire as a contributing factor. The carrier was also involved in a collision with a merchant ship near the Suez Canal earlier this year.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem asserts that there's a "night and day difference" at the U.S.-Mexico border since President Trump assumed office, citing a substantial decrease in illegal border crossings. According to Customs and Border Protection data, illegal crossings in March reached a record low, plummeting by 95% compared to the previous year. Noem attributes this decline to the Trump administration's crackdown on undocumented immigrants, claiming that border agents are no longer overwhelmed as they were in the past.</p>
