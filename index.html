          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has appointed eight new members to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), replacing all 17 previous members. The new picks include individuals known for their skepticism towards vaccines, particularly mRNA vaccines and COVID-19 vaccines, raising concerns among public health experts. Kennedy defends his choices as "highly credentialed scientists" committed to evidence-based medicine, while critics argue the new committee may provide less informed advice and undermine public trust in immunization. Some appointees have previously spread misinformation about vaccines, while others have questioned the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>According to sources, Israel is contemplating military action against Iran in the coming days, potentially without direct U.S. involvement, although logistical support and intelligence sharing from the U.S. are possibilities. This consideration arises as the U.S. plans to hold nuclear talks with Iranian officials in Oman, and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian vows to continue uranium enrichment and rebuild any destroyed facilities. Tensions remain high in the Middle East, with the potential for a U.S.-Iran nuclear deal and the possibility of an Israeli strike if no deal is reached. Iranian officials have warned of a strong reaction to any strategic mistakes by European powers.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats are urging an investigation into Justice Department official Ed Martin, citing concerns over his plans to "shame" political opponents of President Trump and his role in the 'Weaponization Working Group'. Martin's controversial tenure as interim U.S. Attorney for D.C. raised concerns, and he has stated his intention to target the alleged 'weaponization' of the department under the Biden administration. Democrats argue that Martin's approach conflicts with DOJ policy prohibiting prosecutors from disparaging individuals they don't intend to charge, potentially undermining public trust in the department.</p>

          <p>Despite fears that President Trump's tariffs would drive up inflation, traditional data points measuring inflation have not yet reflected this impact. Consumer and producer prices rose only 0.1% in May, but three factors are believed to be keeping inflation in check: companies stockpiling imported goods, a time lag before tariffs affect the real economy, and limited pricing power due to cautious consumer spending. Economists anticipate that the impact of tariffs will become more apparent in the coming months as these factors dissipate.</p>

          <p>Despite an invitation from President Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping is unlikely to attend the UN General Assembly in September, which would have been the earliest opportunity for a meeting. Instead, China will send Premier Li Qiang to represent the country at the event in New York. The bilateral relationship between the U.S. and China seems to have improved following a phone call between Xi and Trump, during which both leaders extended invitations to visit each other's countries.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to Iran to accept restrictions on its nuclear program is facing a ticking clock, as Israel considers potential military action, possibly with U.S. support. The U.S. is seeking to prevent Iran from developing domestic enrichment of nuclear fuel, proposing that Iran procure enriched fuel from outside the country. Meanwhile, the IAEA has stated that Iran is not complying with nuclear non-proliferation obligations, prompting accusations of confrontation from Iranian officials. Russia has offered to participate in discussions with Iran, potentially serving as a source for nuclear fuel purchase or storage of enriched uranium.</p>
