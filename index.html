          <p>The Pentagon has announced the release of approximately 2,000 California National Guard members from federal duty in Los Angeles, a month after their controversial deployment. The troops were sent by President Trump, against the objections of Governor Gavin Newsom, to address protests related to Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions. While the Pentagon cited subsiding lawlessness, Newsom criticized the deployment as political maneuvering and called for the remaining forces to be sent home as well. The move signals a de-escalation of federal presence in the city.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a new trade agreement with Indonesia, reducing a threatened 32% tariff on Indonesian goods to 19%. In exchange, the U.S. will gain "full access" to Indonesian markets, with the country reportedly agreeing to lower its own tariffs on American products. As part of the deal, Indonesia has also committed to purchasing billions in U.S. energy and agricultural goods, as well as 50 Boeing jets. This agreement is the latest in a series of trade negotiations initiated by the White House after threatening widespread tariffs earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>Forty-six years after assassinating authoritarian President Park Chung-hee, South Korean spy chief Kim Jae-gyu is being retried, posthumously, to determine if his act was treason or a patriotic move to restore democracy. Kim was executed in 1980 after a swift military trial, but his family has long argued he acted to prevent a potential bloodbath by the dictator. The retrial, granted based on evidence of torture during the initial investigation, revisits a pivotal and polarizing moment in the nation's history. The case forces a re-evaluation of both Kim's motives and Park's controversial legacy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has accused Senator Adam Schiff of committing mortgage fraud, claiming Schiff misrepresented his primary residence to secure a cheaper loan. Schiff vehemently denied the allegations, labeling them a "baseless attempt at political retribution" and an effort to distract from the controversy surrounding the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. A Fannie Mae memo cited by Trump did not accuse Schiff of fraud but noted "possible occupancy misrepresentation." Schiff’s office maintains that all lenders were aware of his two residences, a common arrangement for members of Congress.</p>

          <p>During a summit at Carnegie Mellon University, President Trump, alongside tech and energy leaders, announced over $90 billion in new investments for Pennsylvania. The initiatives aim to establish a new artificial intelligence economy in the state, leveraging its energy resources like natural gas and nuclear power. Key projects include building new data centers to meet AI's high energy demands and an innovation center for workforce training. Hosted by Senator Dave McCormick, the event also highlighted a major partnership between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, with organizers hoping it marks the beginning of Pittsburgh's transformation into a national AI hub.</p>

This change follows reports of a call where Trump asked President Zelenskyy about Ukraine's capability to strike major Russian cities.

          <p>The family of Sayfollah Musallet, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen from Florida, is calling on the Trump administration to prosecute the Israeli settlers who beat him to death in the occupied West Bank. Musallet was visiting family and was killed while trying to protect their farm from an attack that also left a Palestinian man dead. His family and advocates from the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) are urging the U.S. government to hold the perpetrators accountable. In response, the U.S. ambassador to Israel stated he has asked Israel to "aggressively investigate" the "criminal and terrorist act."</p>

          <p>Michael Bernard Bell, 54, was executed by lethal injection in Florida for the 1993 murders of Jimmy West and Tamecka Smith. Bell had shot the two individuals outside a bar in what was believed to be a mistaken-identity revenge killing. His execution is the 26th in the U.S. this year, a number that already matches the total for all of 2024, with Florida leading the nation in executions. Bell was also convicted of three other murders committed in separate incidents. His final appeals were denied by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier in the day.</p>

          <p>A parliamentary watchdog has found that UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves inadvertently breached rules by failing to declare gifts within the required 28-day period. Reeves had referred herself for investigation after realizing she had not registered tickets from the National Theatre on the register for Members of Parliament, only on the ministerial list. The commissioner for standards noted her apology and accepted the failure was inadvertent, though he stated greater attention should have been paid. Reeves has since implemented new procedures in her office to prevent future oversights.</p>

          <p>A Florida man has filed a lawsuit against Harrah's Cherokee Casino in North Carolina, alleging it initially refused to pay out over $500,000 in winnings from a successful NBA Championship bet. The plaintiff, Emmanuel Kromah, claims that when he went to collect his money, he was escorted out by security. Although the casino eventually paid him 10 days later, they also issued him a lifetime ban from all their properties. Kromah is now seeking damages for the ordeal, but the casino's parent company, Caesar's Entertainment, has not yet commented on the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the European Union's strategy of pressuring China over its support for Russia's war in Ukraine could backfire on its own economic interests. As the EU seeks to "de-risk" its economy and address a significant trade deficit with Beijing, adopting an aggressive "if you're not with us, you're against us" approach may not be effective. The author suggests that Beijing's position is more nuanced than simply wanting a Russian victory, and that escalating tensions serves neither side. The EU's tough rhetoric may ultimately fail to influence China's foreign policy.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of people from Afghanistan. The administration had planned to end the protections, which shield migrants from deportation and provide work permits, arguing the situation in Afghanistan had improved. However, immigrant advocacy groups sued, and the court has paused the termination for one week to allow for legal briefings. The move provides a brief reprieve for approximately 11,700 Afghans enrolled in the program, which was implemented after the Taliban's takeover in 2021.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is exploring the possibility of hiring experienced international air traffic controllers to address significant staffing shortages across the U.S., according to a report. An internal FAA summary outlines the initiative as a way to create a sustainable workforce, though it acknowledges major hurdles related to safety, training, and national security. The plan has reportedly caused alarm among security experts concerned about giving foreign nationals access to sensitive aerospace systems. The move comes as chronic understaffing has led to flight delays and may have contributed to recent aviation incidents.</p>

The violence in the city of Sweida prompted Israeli airstrikes against Syrian government forces that had entered the area, with Israel portraying itself as a defender of the Druze community. Despite a government-announced ceasefire, a prominent Druze leader accused state forces of shelling civilians and called for defiance. The conflict highlights the instability and sectarian tensions challenging Syria's new government, which took power after ousting Bashar Assad.</p>
