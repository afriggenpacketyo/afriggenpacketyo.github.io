          <p>Alibaba has engineered a new generation AI foundation model, Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B, that delivers top-tier performance while being significantly smaller and more cost-efficient than its predecessors. This technological advancement allows the model to perform some tasks ten times faster than previous versions and reduces training costs by 90 percent, estimated at under $500,000. The innovation stands in stark contrast to competitors like Google's Gemini Ultra, which had an estimated training cost of $191 million. This development marks a significant step toward making powerful AI more accessible and economical.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump claimed credit for a reduction in crime in Memphis, Tennessee, attributing the improvement to his deployment of the FBI and other federal officers over the past five months. He also suggested he is considering deploying the National Guard to the city, which has one of the highest violent crime rates in the U.S. The proposal has drawn support from Tennessee's Republican governor and senator but has been met with strong opposition from local officials like the Shelby County Mayor, who called the move anti-democratic and feared it would cause confusion and fear.</p>

          <p>Australia's Defence Minister has confirmed that the United States will have access to a planned nuclear submarine facility in Western Australia, which is being upgraded as part of the AUKUS security pact. The government is investing A$12 billion to transform the Henderson shipyard into a maintenance hub for the submarine fleet acquired through the deal with the U.S. and Britain. This strategic move aims to sustain Australia's future submarine capabilities and strengthen the AUKUS alliance, designed to counter China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>Egypt is reviving a proposal for a joint Arab military force, modeled after NATO, that could provide rapid defense for any member state under attack. The initiative has gained new urgency following a recent Israeli strike on Hamas leaders in Qatar and is being discussed ahead of an Arab-Islamic summit in Doha. Cairo is reportedly willing to contribute around 20,000 troops and seeks a leading command role, with Saudi Arabia as a key partner. The plan, first floated nearly a decade ago, signals Egypt's ambition to establish a new regional security framework.</p>

The girl was reported missing on September 11 after being picked up from school, sparking a wide-scale search involving multiple fire departments and law enforcement agencies, including the FBI. The family later informed authorities they suspected the girl's uncle had taken her. The successful recovery brought a positive resolution to a situation that had deeply concerned the local community.</p>

          <p>Following the identification of 22-year-old Tyler Robinson as the suspect in the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, questions surrounding his motive have intensified political debates. Utah's governor stated that investigators believe Robinson was "deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology," though his personal political beliefs remain unconfirmed. Reports from various media outlets have explored unverified claims about his personal life, including his living situation with a transgender partner. The lack of a clear motive has led to widespread speculation and has been leveraged by figures across the political spectrum to frame the tragedy.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that the economic development of China's Hainan province should be viewed as a complementary opportunity for Hong Kong, not as competition. A recent memorandum of understanding between the two regions opens avenues for collaboration across finance, trade, and tourism. The article argues that Hainan's free trade port can leverage Hong Kong's world-class financial infrastructure, legal services, and global connectivity to attract and manage capital flows. This partnership could enhance the regional competitiveness of southern China by combining Hainan's duty-free ecosystem with Hong Kong's high-end services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Earl Richardson, the former president of Morgan State University who led a transformative legal battle for equitable funding for historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), has died at 81. He was the visionary behind a 15-year lawsuit against the state of Maryland that resulted in a historic $577 million settlement in 2021 for four of the state's HBCUs. Richardson's tireless advocacy exposed systemic underfunding and led to what is known as "Morgan's Renaissance," which included doubled enrollment and significant campus expansion during his tenure, leaving a lasting legacy for higher education.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United's new striker, Nick Woltemade, made an immediate impact by scoring the winning goal on his debut in a 1-0 victory against Wolves. The 6ft 6in German forward, signed from Stuttgart, headed in a cross in the 29th minute, providing a much-needed boost for the team. His performance was particularly timely, as it came after the high-profile departure of star striker Alexander Isak and news of an injury to fellow new signing Yoane Wissa. Woltemade's successful start has already earned him a chant from the supportive home crowd.</p>

          <p>On the television show "The View," co-host Whoopi Goldberg criticized the Democratic party for its public handling of concerns regarding former President Joe Biden's age and fitness for office. Goldberg argued that the party should have addressed the issue "in-house" instead of allowing it to become a "public spectacle." Her comments were made during a discussion about an excerpt from former Vice President Kamala Harris's new book, in which Harris described Biden's decision to run for re-election as "reckless." Goldberg suggested that internal management would have led to a better public perception.</p>

          <p>A large-scale protest in central London, organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, resulted in violent clashes that left 26 police officers injured, four of them seriously. The "Unite the Kingdom" rally drew an estimated crowd of up to 150,000 people, far exceeding expectations and leading to tensions with a nearby counter-protest. Some demonstrators threw bottles and other projectiles at police, who used riot gear to maintain control. The Metropolitan Police condemned the "wholly unacceptable" violence and have made 25 arrests, with investigations ongoing to identify more individuals involved in the disorder.</p>

          <p>Leaked military planning documents indicate the Trump administration has drafted a proposal to deploy 1,000 Louisiana National Guard troops for law enforcement operations in the state's urban centers, including New Orleans and Baton Rouge.

While the Pentagon has not confirmed the plan is approved, it suggests a robust operation is under consideration, pending a formal request from Louisiana's governor.</p>

Authorities allege that she left the children unsupervised at the time the fire broke out. When the first deputy arrived, the home was already fully engulfed in flames, making rescue impossible.

          <p>A staffer for Mexico's ruling Morena party has resigned after making controversial comments about the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk on a major television news program. The staffer, Salvador Ramírez, suggested Kirk received "a spoonful of his own chocolate" due to his pro-gun stance. The remarks drew a sharp rebuke from a U.S. State Department official, who threatened visa revocations for foreigners glorifying violence. The news network, Milenio, issued a public apology, and Ramírez subsequently resigned from his position, becoming another individual to face professional consequences for commentary on Kirk's death.</p>

Experts in media and extremism caution against drawing simple conclusions about the shooter's ideology from these messages. They suggest the eclectic and memetic nature of the engravings indicates a desire for viral exposure and was likely designed to create confusion and generate online discussion, rather than convey a coherent political motive.</p>

          <p>Rangers football club manager Russell Martin is facing intense pressure from fans and media after a 2-0 home defeat to Hearts left the team winless through their first five league games. This marks the club's worst start to a season in 47 years, leading to venomous reactions from supporters at Ibrox. In a post-match press conference, Martin firmly stated he would not resign but acknowledged the difficulty of winning over the fanbase. The crisis comes after a summer of renewed hope for the club following a takeover by a U.S.-led consortium.</p>
