        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association reveals a connection between prolonged screen time and higher risks for cardiometabolic diseases in children and teens. Researchers found that for every additional hour spent on devices, the overall risk for conditions like high blood pressure and insulin resistance increased, particularly in 18-year-olds. The study also noted that reduced sleep amplified these negative health effects, suggesting that limiting screen time is crucial for protecting long-term cardiovascular health from an early age. The findings are observational but add to a growing body of evidence on the physical impacts of digital device usage on young people.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, elevating the total levy to 50% in response to India's continued importation of oil from Russia. President Trump stated the measure is a consequence of India "fueling the war machine," with the new tariffs set to take effect in 21 days. This move represents a significant escalation in trade pressure, making the tariff rate on India one of the highest among U.S. trading partners. India's Ministry of External Affairs has countered, arguing that it is being unfairly targeted by nations that are themselves still engaged in trade with Russia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has characterized multibillion-dollar investment pledges from trade partners like Japan and the European Union as "gifts" and "signing bonuses," a view that contrasts sharply with the interpretations of these partners. For instance, the White House presented a $600 billion EU investment as a firm commitment, while the European Commission described it as an "interest" from private companies, which it cannot enforce. Similar discrepancies exist with investment promises from Japan and South Korea, highlighting a fundamental disconnect in how these non-binding framework agreements are perceived. The White House has warned of potential retaliation if these commitments are not met. (not investment advice)</p>

The vessel, which features a helipad and a pool, will be sold via sealed bids, with potential buyers required to have a net worth of at least $500 million and provide a $10 million deposit. The Justice Department asserts the yacht is owned by gold magnate Suleiman Kerimov, though a holding company claims it belongs to a non-sanctioned individual. The owner's lawyer has warned that any sale will be legally challenged, creating uncertainty for potential buyers.</p>

          <p>A large-scale evacuation was initiated in Dresden's Old Town after an unexploded World War II bomb was found during construction work. Approximately 17,000 people were instructed to leave their homes while experts worked to defuse the 250-kilogram British-made bomb. The discovery was made near the Carola Bridge, which is scheduled for demolition, and the evacuation zone included the historic Frauenkirche church. Such finds are still common in Germany, highlighting the lingering dangers of the war, with a similar large-scale evacuation having occurred in Cologne in June for the same reason.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren has formally requested that the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice investigate the proposed $2.4 billion merger between Dick's Sporting Goods and Foot Locker. In a letter, Warren raised concerns that the deal could violate antitrust laws, leading to a duopoly in the athletic shoe market, which would ultimately harm consumers through higher prices and hurt smaller independent retailers. She argued that the consolidation would give the new entity significant power over suppliers, potentially disadvantaging smaller competitors. This call for scrutiny comes as the Trump administration's approach to large-scale mergers is still being established. (not investment advice)</p>

These programs grant citizenship in exchange for significant investments, typically a government contribution or real estate purchase starting at $200,000. The appeal lies in tax advantages, as many of these nations have no wealth, inheritance, or capital gains taxes, and the passports provide visa-free travel to many countries. Real estate agents in the region report a surge in U.S. buyers seeking citizenship, a trend attributed to global uncertainty and a desire for a secure alternative.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government, under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has canceled 22 mRNA vaccine research projects, totaling $500 million in funding. Kennedy, a noted vaccine skeptic, justified the decision by claiming the data shows mRNA vaccines fail to effectively protect against respiratory infections like COVID-19 and the flu. The article explores the scientific debate around this move, with some experts acknowledging that mRNA technology was perhaps overhyped during the pandemic. However, many leading scientists call the decision "stupid" and a "catastrophic error," arguing that while not perfect, the technology saved millions of lives and its key advantage is the speed at which new vaccines can be developed for future pandemics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For retirees on a fixed income, accessing home equity is a key financial strategy, with two primary options: selling the home or obtaining a reverse mortgage. A reverse mortgage allows homeowners to convert equity into cash without a monthly payment, which can help cover rising living costs, but it reduces the inheritance left to heirs and comes with its own fees and risks. Selling the home provides a lump sum of cash but means leaving a familiar property and navigating a potentially challenging housing market. Experts advise that a reverse mortgage is best for those who wish to stay in their home and need supplemental income. (not investment advice)</p>

The class included a session on a stationary airplane, where attendees learned breathing techniques and other coping mechanisms. While the class did not completely cure the author's fear, it provided new tools and a sense of community, reframing the anxiety as a manageable challenge rather than a personal failing.</p>

          <p>The University of California president has stated that the Trump administration has suspended a total of $584 million in federal research grants at UCLA, a figure more than double what was initially reported. The cuts, affecting over 800 grants in fields like medicine and clean energy, are described as a "death knell" for critical research. This action follows a Justice Department finding that UCLA acted with "deliberate indifference" to the civil rights of Jewish and Israeli students amid campus protests. UC has agreed to enter negotiations with federal officials to restore the funding, a situation similar to recent agreements made by other universities.</p>

          <p>McDonald's exceeded Wall Street's quarterly expectations for earnings and revenue, driven by a 2.5% increase in U.S. same-store sales, which reversed two quarters of decline. Promotions like a "Minecraft" movie tie-in and the return of Snack Wraps helped boost performance. However, CEO Chris Kempczinski expressed concern about the financial health of low-income consumers, noting that their visits to restaurants industry-wide have declined significantly. The company is working on making its core menu more affordable to re-engage this critical customer base, acknowledging a "bifurcated" consumer environment where international markets are showing stronger growth.

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency is contemplating the termination of its $7 billion Solar for All program, which was designed to help low-income communities access affordable renewable energy. The program, which has awarded grants to 60 state, tribal, and multi-state recipients, aims to benefit 900,000 households by lowering their energy bills through solar power. The potential cancellation, reportedly prompted by the Office of Management and Budget, has caused alarm among grant recipients and bipartisan senators who have asked the EPA to reconsider. If terminated, the move would jeopardize numerous projects already underway and is seen as a broken promise to disadvantaged communities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is facing widespread criticism for racist comments made during a CNBC interview, where he claimed that migrant laborers are "naturally" suited for strenuous farm work. While acknowledging the agricultural sector's reliance on this workforce, Trump suggested that people from inner cities are not capable of the same labor and recounted a farmer's comment that such workers "don't get a bad back... they die." The remarks, which echo antebellum justifications for slavery, were condemned on social media as "grotesquely amoral" and bigoted. The comments have drawn fire from critics who decry the racism and some supporters who see it as a reversal of his hardline immigration stance.</p>

          <p>Firefighters in Ashcroft, British Columbia, have identified an unusual cause for a recent wildfire: a fish dropped by a bird onto a power line. Investigators believe an osprey caught the fish from a nearby river and, while in flight, dropped its meal onto the electrical wires. The resulting sparks ignited the dry grass below, leading to a "heavy fire" that required approximately 4,800 gallons of water to extinguish. The fire department confirmed that the fish was found charred at the scene and joked on social media that the osprey, which was unharmed, was a "flight risk" and had been held for questioning.</p>

          <p>In northern Nigeria, villagers in states like Zamfara and Sokoto are increasingly making peace deals with violent bandit groups to survive, a sign of the government's failure to provide security. For years, these communities have faced killings and abductions, with their agricultural livelihoods destroyed. These agreements often involve paying protection fees, but they are fragile as one group's deal is not respected by others. Analysts describe this as a "rational survival calculus" born from a broken social contract, but warn that it grants legitimacy to the bandits and undermines national security, creating a form of parallel governance in the region.</p>

Despite occasional tensions, the relationship is largely amicable, with Pakistan recently supporting Iran during its conflict with Israel. The article notes that while Tehran views Islamabad as a strategic partner, Pakistan's growing ties with the United States could introduce a complex dynamic, though experts believe Pakistan will continue to avoid direct military alignment against Iran.</p>

The report upheld over 40 complaints against Wallace and one against Torode.

Experts blame decades of resource mismanagement, over-consumption, and uncontrolled urban growth for the crisis, which they had long predicted.
