            <p>Stanislaus County has agreed to a $22.5 million settlement in a malicious prosecution lawsuit brought by Modesto defense attorney Frank Carson and his co-defendants, who were acquitted of murder conspiracy charges in 2019. The plaintiffs alleged that police and prosecutors fabricated charges against them. The case centered on Carson, who was accused of masterminding a plot to kill a scrap-metal thief, and involved an 18-month preliminary hearing and a 17-month trial.</p>

            <p>UnitedHealth Group's stock experienced a significant decline after the company reduced its annual profit forecast, citing higher-than-expected medical costs in its Medicare Advantage plans. This development raises concerns for other insurers with similar plans. The rise in medical costs is attributed to increased care utilization, particularly in doctor and outpatient services. The Trump administration said it would substantially increase reimbursement rates for Medicare Advantage insurers, hiking an earlier proposal from the Biden administration (not investment advice).</p>
