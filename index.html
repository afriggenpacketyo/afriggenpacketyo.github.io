        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration announced that the FDA will advise physicians on a potential link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and an increased risk of autism. This guidance, promoted by President Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., suggests limiting the use of drugs like Tylenol unless medically necessary. However, major medical organizations and the drug's manufacturer, Kenvue, strongly dispute this claim, citing robust scientific evidence that finds no causal link and highlighting the medication's safety and importance for treating conditions like fever in expectant mothers. The administration also announced FDA approval of the drug leucovorin for treating some children with autism.</p>

          <p>Disney announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will resume airing this Tuesday, nearly a week after being suspended indefinitely. The suspension followed host Jimmy Kimmel's on-air comments regarding the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which Disney described as "ill-timed and thus insensitive." The decision to return the show came after "thoughtful conversations" with Kimmel. The controversy had drawn criticism from conservatives and led major station owners like Nexstar and Sinclair to pull the program, sparking a broader debate on free speech and media responsibility.</p>

          <p>Actress Emma Watson recently reflected on her decision to step back from her acting career, explaining that the promotional aspect of the job became overwhelming. While expressing gratitude for her early success in the "Harry Potter" franchise, she stated she does not miss the constant need to sell her work, which she found to be "quite soul-destroying." Watson elaborated that the pressure of maintaining a public persona was energy-intensive and that stepping away has allowed her to focus on personal relationships and her own critical thinking. She affirmed that she still misses the artistic craft of acting itself.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a new $100,000 annual fee for companies applying for H-1B visas, which are used to hire highly skilled foreign workers in sectors like technology and healthcare. The policy aims to encourage companies to prioritize hiring American workers by significantly increasing the cost of sponsoring foreign talent. The move has sparked concern among economists about a potential "brain drain" and weaker economic growth, while some business leaders have praised it as a way to ensure visas go to the highest-value jobs.

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries this week to negotiate a funding deal and avert a potential government shutdown. The meeting comes after competing Republican and Democratic proposals to extend government funding past the September 30 deadline failed in the Senate. Democratic leaders have insisted they will not support a bill that does not address their healthcare priorities. With Congress in recess, the direct negotiation between the President and Democratic leadership is a critical step in breaking the legislative impasse.</p>

According to the DA, the choice of an ABC station as a target, combined with the timing and the content of the notes, provides circumstantial evidence of a political motive.

          <p>A new study conducted in Rajasthan, India, has revealed that expanding forests can surprisingly boost agricultural output, challenging the conventional view that the two land uses are in competition. The research, published in Land Economics, found that reforestation led to a 24% increase in crop production over a 7 to 14-year period, particularly for rainfed crops. This increase is linked to modest rises in local rainfall and enhanced pollinator activity from the expanded forest ecosystem. The findings suggest that reforestation can serve as a dual-purpose tool for carbon sequestration and improving food security, creating co-benefits for the environment and local farmers.</p>

          <p>Gabrielle has intensified into a major Category 4 hurricane, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. With maximum sustained winds of 140 mph, the storm's center is expected to pass east of Bermuda, though no direct warnings have been issued for the island. The National Hurricane Center has advised those in the Azores to monitor the storm's progress. While not projected to make a direct landfall on the U.S. mainland, swells generated by Gabrielle are forecast to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the East Coast from North Carolina northward.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old man charged with misdemeanor assault for swinging a pipe at protesters in a pro-Palestinian encampment at UCLA last year has been granted diversion, allowing him to avoid jail time. The judge cited the man's age and lack of a criminal record in the decision, which was made over the objection of prosecutors. As part of the diversion agreement, he must complete community service, attend anti-bias training, and stay away from the UCLA campus. The case was one of the few criminal proceedings to result from the violent clashes that occurred at the university's encampment last year.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic frontrunner for New York City mayor, announced he was pulling out of a scheduled town hall on WABC-TV in protest of ABC's decision to suspend "Jimmy Kimmel Live!". Mamdani stated that it is not the government's role to "bully talk show hosts off of the air," referencing the pressure from the FCC chairman that preceded the suspension. His withdrawal occurred just before Disney announced Kimmel's show would return, and it is unclear if that decision will affect Mamdani's participation. The move highlights how the controversy surrounding Kimmel has extended into the political arena, becoming a flashpoint in debates over free speech.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers are urging treasury watchdogs to investigate allegations that Trump administration border czar Tom Homan accepted a $50,000 cash bribe from an undercover FBI agent. The alleged payment was reportedly in exchange for promises of future government contracts related to immigration. A Justice Department investigation into the matter was subsequently closed. Congressman Dave Min has formally requested an inquiry into whether Homan properly reported the payment as income to the IRS. The White House has denied the allegations, stating that Homan did nothing wrong and never accepted the money.</p>

          <p>Ryan Routh, the man on trial for the attempted assassination of President Trump at his Florida golf club, has rested his case without taking the stand to testify in his own defense. Routh, who is representing himself, questioned three witnesses before concluding his defense. Prosecutors allege that Routh plotted for weeks before aiming a rifle at the then-presidential candidate in September 2024, but was spotted by a Secret Service agent and fled without firing a shot. Closing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday, after which the jury will begin deliberations on the serious federal charges.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications is causing widespread confusion, with immigration attorneys advising clients to avoid international travel until the policy is clarified. While the White House stated the fee only applies to new applicants and not current visa holders, lawyers note gray areas remain for those needing to renew or amend their status. The high cost is expected to have a "chilling effect" on hiring skilled foreign workers, a stated goal of the administration. However, the lack of clear guidance on implementation and exemptions for "national interest" cases has left many companies and their employees in a state of uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A black and white photograph of President Trump speaking at a memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, shared by the official White House social media account, has drawn significant online criticism. Commenters were quick to point out the visual similarities between the image and a well-known 1933 photograph of Adolf Hitler addressing Nazi stormtroopers. The post, captioned "This is the turning point," a reference to Kirk's organization, was described by critics as a "dog whistle" and another example of the administration using imagery reminiscent of historical authoritarian regimes. The incident fueled further debate about the administration's messaging and style.</p>

          <p>A sense of apprehension is reportedly growing within the Department of Justice as President Trump openly calls for criminal investigations into his political adversaries, including former FBI Director Jim Comey and New York AG Letitia James. This follows the recent departure of a top federal prosecutor in Virginia who was allegedly pressured to pursue charges desired by the president. Former DOJ employees and legal experts express concern that the traditional independence of the department is eroding, creating an environment where legal decisions may be driven by political retribution rather than the rule of law, which could destabilize the justice system.</p>
