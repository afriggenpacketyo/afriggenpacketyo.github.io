          <p>YouTube and Fox have successfully negotiated a new distribution deal, ensuring that channels like Fox News and Fox Sports remain available on the YouTube TV streaming platform. The agreement was reached following a brief standoff where YouTube had warned of a potential blackout due to Fox's demands for higher fees. This resolution prevents service disruption for YouTube TV's 9.4 million subscribers, who will continue to have access to major sporting events like college football and the upcoming NFL season.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has deferred a decision on whether to grant a temporary restraining order to Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, who is suing to prevent President Trump from firing her. Cook's legal team argued that the president lacks legal cause for her removal, dismissing allegations of mortgage fraud as a "smear campaign." The Department of Justice contended that the president has the discretion to determine cause, setting the stage for a significant legal battle over the independence of the Federal Reserve.</p>

          <p>As market expectations grow for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut, certain sectors like housing and finance could see significant benefits. Companies such as Home Depot, Capital One, and Wells Fargo are highlighted as being well-positioned to gain from a lower-interest-rate environment, which typically stimulates consumer spending and loan activity. The article notes that the actual impact will depend on whether bond yields, which influence mortgage rates, follow their historical pattern of declining alongside the Fed's benchmark rate.

          <p>A pro-Palestinian conference in Detroit is drawing scrutiny for its lineup of speakers, which includes Representative Rashida Tlaib alongside several controversial figures. Among the scheduled speakers are individuals who have been accused of antisemitic rhetoric and two former Israeli prisoners who were released in a deal with Hamas. The event, titled the "People's Conference for Palestine," has amplified criticism of Tlaib, who was previously censured by Congress for her rhetoric regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict.</p>

The author contends that this focus on vocational training has diminished critical thinking skills and historical literacy, making the public more vulnerable to propaganda and political manipulation. The piece suggests that the current battles over history curricula are a symptom of this larger problem and calls for a renewed emphasis on the humanities to cultivate empathy and responsible citizenship.</p>

          <p>A long-standing trade provision known as the "de minimis" exemption, which allowed shipments valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, officially ended following a presidential executive order.

The move is expected to lead to higher prices for consumers, shipping delays, and a potential shift in market share toward larger retailers like Amazon and Walmart.</p>
