          <p>Authorities are searching for an Ethiopian asylum seeker, Hadush Kebatu, who was mistakenly released from a UK prison after being jailed for sexually assaulting a schoolgirl. Kebatu was supposed to be transferred to an immigration detention center for deportation, but was released instead. High-ranking officials have expressed outrage, and an investigation is underway to determine how the error occurred. Kebatu was convicted of multiple offenses, including sexual assault, and was subject to a sexual harm prevention order. The article details the events leading up to his arrest and conviction, which involved sexually assaulting a teenage girl and a woman. The authorities are working to locate and detain him.

          <p>Argentina is holding parliamentary elections amid growing criticism of President Javier Milei's economic policies. Marcela Pagano, a member of parliament, has voiced concerns about the impact of austerity measures on the middle class and disadvantaged groups. While inflation has decreased, many small businesses have closed, and purchasing power has declined significantly. President Milei's administration has cut state spending and subsidies, leading to a budget surplus but also hardship for many Argentinians. Donald Trump has offered financial support to Milei, linking it to the election outcome. With corruption scandals and waning popularity, Milei faces a tough challenge in the upcoming elections. The optimism score is 30.</p>

          <p>England's Herbie Farnworth, an NRL star in Australia, is set to play a key role in England's quest for their first Ashes series victory since 1970. Farnworth, considered one of the best centers in the world, brings exceptional abilities and experience from the NRL. He was instrumental in England's previous successes, including the World Cup semi-final and a series win against Samoa. Farnworth's rise to prominence involved a shift from Manchester United's youth football program to rugby league, excelling under his uncle's guidance. The article highlights Farnworth's modesty and connection to his roots, despite his status as a key player. The optimism score is 75.</p>

          <p>Children in Gaza are in dire need of medical evacuation following years of conflict, but are facing obstacles despite a fragile ceasefire. Two 10-year-old boys, one paralyzed by Israeli fire and another with a brain tumor, exemplify the urgent need for medical assistance. Thousands of patients require urgent evacuation, but hospitals are in critical condition. The WHO has coordinated some medical convoys, but Israel is keeping the Rafah border crossing closed until Hamas fulfills its commitments. Medical professionals urge Israel to allow Gazan patients to be treated in the West Bank, but there has been no approval. The article underscores the frustration and loss of life due to the lack of capabilities. The optimism score is 10.</p>
