          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a 25% tariff on Indian imports, but New Delhi has not rushed to negotiate a new deal. India is protecting its agricultural sector, a crucial voting bloc, and believes its strategic importance to the U.S. as a counterbalance to China provides leverage. Analysts suggest the U.S. views India as a key partner in the Indo-Pacific and a potential alternative for manufacturing supply chains, giving India flexibility in trade talks. This dynamic is further complicated by India's role in the BRICS bloc, which the U.S. views with suspicion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. and South Korea have reached a trade deal, setting a blanket tariff of 15% on South Korean exports, a reduction from the threatened 25%. The agreement includes a $350 billion investment from South Korea into U.S.-controlled industries, though the two nations appear to have different interpretations of how the funds will be managed. While Seoul successfully protected its sensitive agricultural markets, the deal negates some benefits of the existing U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement by imposing new tariffs. South Korea's President Lee Jae-myung expressed hope that the deal would strengthen the alliance between the two countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case, has set conditions for her testimony before a House committee. Her attorney stated she would only provide a deposition if granted immunity from further prosecution or a presidential pardon, citing risks to her pending legal appeals. The House Oversight Committee has rejected the idea of granting immunity, insisting on her testimony for their investigation into sex trafficking and plea agreements. Meanwhile, relatives of Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre, who died by suicide, have urged that Maxwell receive no leniency, calling her a "monster."</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics reported a significant drop in its second-quarter operating profit, falling by more than half compared to the previous year and missing analyst expectations. The decline was driven by a staggering 93.8% profit collapse in its crucial chip division, attributed to inventory adjustments and impacts from China-related export restrictions. Despite the downturn, the company expressed optimism for a gradual recovery in the second half of the year, fueled by AI and robotics momentum. Samsung's mobile division, however, saw an increase in sales and profit, buoyed by its Galaxy S25 and A series smartphones. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A failure in the UK's air traffic control (ATC) system caused widespread travel disruption, leading to over 150 flight cancellations and grounding thousands more. The provider, NATS, apologized for the "radar-related" issue, which it claims was resolved in 20 minutes by switching to a backup system. Airlines, including Ryanair and EasyJet, expressed frustration, with a Ryanair executive calling for the NATS CEO to resign, citing a similar major outage in 2023. The government is investigating the cause of the failure, which has left many passengers stranded and frustrated during a peak travel period.</p>

          <p>Shares of chip design company Arm Holdings fell after its first-quarter earnings report, where revenue slightly missed expectations. The company's guidance for the next quarter was in line with forecasts, but net income fell 42% year-over-year. A key concern for investors was the underwhelming growth in royalties from the smartphone sector, its largest business. CEO Rene Haas also confirmed Arm is exploring designing its own chiplets or full semiconductors, a move that could turn its current customers into competitors and which analysts on the earnings call flagged as a potential "execution risk."

This shift highlights the lack of a clear long-term U.S. plan for post-war Gaza, leaving a strategic vacuum that European and Arab countries are attempting to fill.

The quake caused flooding in Russia and appeared to trigger a volcanic eruption on the peninsula.

The average U.S. tariff rate has reached its highest point since 1934, tripling monthly government revenue from import taxes. However, the policy has not achieved its stated goal of reducing the trade deficit; instead, the deficit widened as U.S. firms stockpiled goods to avoid the new taxes. The tariffs have notably reduced Chinese exports to the U.S., but China has successfully shifted trade to other partners like India and the EU, while some economists warn of rising consumer prices in America.

          <h2>Federal Reserve Holds Interest Rates Steady Amid Presidential Pressure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 20:30:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to keep its key interest rate unchanged, resisting pressure from President Donald Trump to implement a cut. The rate remains between 4.25% and 4.5%, though in a rare move, two board members dissented, signaling broadening support for a future reduction. The decision comes as economic data shows a rebound in GDP growth, largely driven by a drop in imports due to Trump's tariffs, which analysts believe masks an underlying loss of momentum. Fed Chair Jerome Powell maintained a cautious stance, stating there is a long way to go before the full impact of tariffs becomes clear. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Three-time NBA All-Star Gilbert Arenas has been arrested and charged with operating an illegal, high-stakes poker ring from his Los Angeles-area home. Prosecutors allege that Arenas, along with five co-defendants, organized games where a "rake" was collected from each pot for the organizers. The operation allegedly involved hiring women to provide companionship to players, as well as chefs and armed security. Arenas, who pleaded not guilty and was released on a $50,000 bond, faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted on all charges, which include making false statements to investigators.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Using the recent 8.8-magnitude earthquake off Russia's coast as an example, this article explains the science of tsunamis. These powerful waves are typically generated by large, shallow underwater earthquakes that cause vertical movement of the seafloor, displacing massive volumes of water. Tsunamis travel at jet-plane speeds in the deep ocean but slow down and increase dramatically in height as they approach shallower coastal waters, which is when they become most dangerous. While forecasting remains challenging, scientists use a network of tide gauges and deep-ocean pressure sensors to better predict a tsunami's arrival time and potential impact, urging people to always heed official warnings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research expedition using a human-occupied submersible has discovered and filmed abundant communities of life at depths of over 9 kilometers in the Pacific Ocean. The Chinese-led team captured images of what they describe as "thriving communities" of tube worms, clams, and bacteria, challenging previous assumptions about the limits of life in such extreme, high-pressure environments. These ecosystems are not fueled by sunlight but by chemicals like methane and hydrogen sulfide seeping from the ocean floor. The findings suggest that such chemosynthetic communities may be widespread in the planet's deepest regions, opening new avenues for studying adaptation to extreme conditions.</p>

          <p>The long-held belief that screen time is inherently harmful to children's brains is being challenged by a group of scientists who argue that concrete evidence is lacking. Professor Pete Etchells points out that much of the research relies on flawed self-reporting and fails to distinguish between different types of screen use. While some studies link screen time to depression, others suggest loneliness is the primary factor and that online interaction can even boost well-being. The debate divides the scientific community, leaving parents with inconsistent guidance and raising questions about whether limiting technology access creates a disadvantage for children in a digital world.</p>

          <p>Advanced imaging technology has revealed the sophisticated details of tattoos on a 2,500-year-old female mummy from the Pazyryk culture of Siberia. The high-resolution scans show intricate designs of leopards, a stag, and mythical creatures that researchers say would be challenging for a modern tattooist to replicate. Found preserved in an ice tomb, the woman's tattoos shed light on the ancient nomadic warrior culture. By collaborating with a researcher who recreates ancient tattoos, the team concluded the designs were likely stenciled before being applied with multi-pointed tools, demonstrating the remarkable artistry and skill of these ancient people.</p>

After being re-signed to a one-year deal, Witherspoon is embracing his role as a veteran leader for a young defensive group, with defensive coordinator Chris Shula calling him the "Yoda" of the position. The Rams have shown confidence in their secondary by not adding any new cornerbacks or safeties in the offseason. Witherspoon believes this continuity, combined with an aggressive defensive front, will allow the secondary to play to its strengths and be special this season.</p>
