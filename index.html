          <p>A four-year-old girl from Mexico, identified as Sofia, who has been receiving critical medical treatment in the United States for short bowel syndrome, has been granted humanitarian parole for one year, allowing her and her mother to remain in the country. Sofia and her mother, Deysi Vargas, have been living in the U.S. since 2023, but recently received notices that their parole was being terminated. Her lawyers emphasized the systemic challenges that brought Sofia to the brink, highlighting the need for immigration system reform to protect those facing life-threatening harm. This decision ensures Sofia can continue receiving specialized IV treatments, which are only available in the U.S., allowing her to live a more normal life with her family. The humanitarian parole will expire on June 1, 2026. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an order doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%, a move intended to bolster the American steel industry. This marks the second increase since March and aims to secure the future of American steel production, but critics warn it could disrupt steel producers outside the U.S., provoke retaliation from trade partners, and raise costs for American consumers. The UK has been granted a carve-out, maintaining duties at 25% due to ongoing trade discussions with the U.S. Economists anticipate job losses in sectors reliant on these metals due to increased production costs, with one analysis suggesting previous tariffs created 1,000 steel jobs but cost 75,000 jobs in other industries (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has strongly criticized President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill, labeling it a "disgusting abomination" on X. Musk, previously involved with the administration as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, expressed concern over the bill's potential to massively increase the national debt to $2.5 trillion. Surprisingly, Senator Bernie Sanders echoed Musk's sentiments, also calling the bill an "abomination" due to its tax breaks for the wealthy and cuts to food aid for the impoverished. The bill aims to extend tax breaks from Trump's first term, partly financed by cuts in social benefits, leading to bipartisan criticism of the legislation.</p>

The players allege that Bomba regularly performed unnecessary rectal exams on male athletes during physicals, which they considered sexual misconduct. Despite complaints and requests for a different physician, the athletes claim that Knight and head athletic trainer Tim Garl instructed them to continue seeing Bomba. The university commissioned an investigation that found Bomba's exams were performed appropriately, but some players contradict this finding, alleging additional misconduct.</p>

The suspects have admitted to the allegations, which came to light after a tip from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.

          <p>Shares of Toyota Industries experienced a significant drop, plummeting as much as 13%, due to investor disappointment over Toyota Group's $33 billion deal to take the company private. The deal involves a tender offer of $26 billion for shares of Toyota Industries at 16,300 yen apiece, lower than the closing price before the announcement. This move occurs amid increasing pressure on Japanese firms to unwind long-established cross-shareholding ties, with Japan's Financial Services Agency advocating for a reduction in such arrangements. Toyota employed cross-shareholding in 2005 to protect itself from acquisition threats, but the current deal signals a shift in strategy (not investment advice).</p>

Trump's announcement to double tariffs on foreign steel to 50% is also met with skepticism, with some arguing it won't address the cyclical nature of the industry.

Critics from both the left and right criticize the decision, stating that it undermines the tradition of freedom of expression and democratic participation. The decision exposes a flaw in Denmark's current order, where the government supports Ukraine against a larger aggressor but remains complicit in war crimes in Gaza. This action highlights a moral scandal in the West, as leaders avoid discussing the issue to prevent exposing their own failures.</p>

          <p>A manhunt is ongoing for Travis Decker, a former soldier suspected of kidnapping and murdering his three daughters in Washington state. Decker, who has extensive military training, is considered a significant risk. The girls were reported missing after Decker failed to return them following a visit, and their bodies were later found near a campground. Questions are being raised about the delay in issuing an amber alert, as police initially did not meet the criteria for abduction.</p>

The increase applies to all trading partners except Britain, and is expected to heavily impact Canada and Mexico. Senior EU officials hope to secure an exemption from the higher tariffs, but retaliation is unlikely given ongoing talks. The move is also driven by concerns about Chinese oversupply affecting the European steel industry (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Australia's economic growth fell short of expectations in the first quarter of 2025, expanding by 1.3% year-on-year, compared to the estimated 1.5%.

Extreme weather events also impacted mining, tourism, and shipping, further contributing to the slowdown. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) previously cut rates to 3.85% and may consider further monetary policy easing to bolster growth (not investment advice).</p>
