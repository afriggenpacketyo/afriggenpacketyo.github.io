            <p>President Trump has intensified his pressure on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, labeling him a "major loser" and warning of economic slowdown unless interest rates are lowered immediately. Trump argues that low inflation justifies preemptive rate cuts, while also claiming that energy costs are trending downward. This latest attack raises questions about the president's intentions and the potential for intervention in the Fed's independence. Experts warn that any attempt to remove Powell could trigger a significant market sell-off.</p>

            <p>Pope Francis, who passed away on April 21, 2025, leaves behind a complex legacy as a progressive leader who challenged Catholic orthodoxy and embraced social justice. As the first pope from the Americas, he addressed controversial topics such as gay priests and the role of women in leadership, offering a more welcoming tone to the LGBTQ community. His focus on climate change, criticism of the global financial system, and advocacy for migrants earned him the title "the People's Pope," though his views also sparked criticism from conservatives within the Church. His papacy marked a significant shift in the Vatican's approach to modern issues.</p>

            <p>Simone Biles's former coach, Aimee Boorman, revealed that the gymnast experienced the "twisties" prior to the 2016 Olympics, years before the condition disrupted her performance at the Tokyo Games. The twisties, which cause gymnasts to lose spatial awareness in the air, can lead to serious injuries. Boorman noted that Biles had trouble twisting on various skills after feeling pressure at the 2015 world championships. Biles has not publicly commented on Boorman's claims, but she has since overcome the twisties to continue her career.</p>

            <p>The US supreme court is hearing arguments today in a case that could threaten Americans’ access to free preventive healthcare services under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. At issue is the constitutionality of the US preventive services taskforce, which plays a critical role in determining which preventive services health insurers must cover without cost to patients. The 16-member panel of medical experts, appointed by the health secretary without Senate confirmation, has designated dozens of life-saving screenings and treatments as essential preventive care. A big critic of the program during his first term, Trump and his administration have now taken over the case after the Biden administration initially filed the appeal.</p>

            <p>Faced with President Trump's tariffs, companies are increasingly turning to foreign trade zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to defer or avoid paying duties on imports. FTZs allow companies to store imported goods indefinitely without paying tariffs until the goods enter the US market. The interest in FTZs has surged, with the National Association of Foreign Trade-Zones reporting a record high in membership. The strategy provides companies with cost savings, operational flexibility, and improved cash flow in the face of trade uncertainty.</p>
