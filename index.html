            <p>An Israeli military inquiry concluded that an "operational misunderstanding" and "breach of orders" led to the deaths of 15 emergency workers in Gaza. The IDF initially claimed the medics' vehicles lacked emergency signals, but video evidence contradicted this account, showing the vehicles with lights and visible logos. The inquiry determined that poor visibility led a commander to mistakenly identify the ambulances as belonging to Hamas militants, resulting in the opening of fire. The deputy commander involved has been dismissed for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report, highlighting failures in communication and assessment during the incident.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen defended his trip to El Salvador, stating his purpose was to uphold the constitutional rights of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident wrongfully deported.

The Supreme Court has ordered the government to "facilitate" his return, but Trump administration officials continue to resist the order.

            <p>Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are considering investing in Alaska LNG, a massive natural gas project, to mitigate the impact of President Trump's tariffs and meet trade demands. The project, estimated to cost over $40 billion, aims to build a pipeline from Alaska's North Slope to the Cook Inlet for LNG export to Asia. Trump administration officials see the project as strategically important, facilitating trade negotiations and reducing the U.S. trade deficit. However, the project's commercial viability and potential political risks remain concerns for investors.</p>

            <p>The CEO of Back Market, Thibaud Hug de Larauze, reports a threefold increase in sales following President Trump's tariff announcements, suggesting Americans are opting for used or refurbished tech to avoid higher prices on new electronics. This surge indicates a potential shift in consumer behavior, with more people considering used devices as tariffs raise prices on new smartphones and computers. While analysts predict a short-term boost for the used market, they also suggest that most consumers will eventually return to buying new tech when affordable. The long-term impact of the tariffs on consumer habits remains uncertain.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court temporarily blocked the deportation of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, following an appeal by the ACLU. The ACLU argued that immigration authorities were moving to restart removals under the AEA, potentially sending individuals to dangerous foreign prisons without due process. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, but the court's order prevents immediate deportations while the case is considered. This decision follows previous legal challenges and concerns over the administration's use of the AEA to deport immigrants with alleged gang ties.</p>

He suggests focusing on actual data from companies driving consumer spending, capital, and labor, such as retailers, banks, and payroll companies. By examining reports from Walmart, Amazon, JPMorgan, and Paychex, investors can gain a more accurate understanding of the economy's health.

            <p>New technologies, including robotic dogs and AI-driven applications, are making construction jobs more appealing to women by reducing physical demands and streamlining administrative tasks. Companies like LAT are using these technologies to automate data collection, improve documentation, and enhance work safety. This transformation aims to address the construction industry's labor shortage and attract more women by offering flexible hours, remote work options, and reduced paperwork. The integration of AI and digitization is creating new roles and opportunities for women in the traditionally male-dominated field.</p>

            <p>Germany is seeking to deport an American and three EU citizens over their alleged involvement in pro-Palestinian protests, sparking comparisons to the Trump administration's handling of similar protests in the U.S. The individuals, who have not been convicted of any crimes, face deportation orders related to a protest at Berlin's Free University. Concerns have been raised about the legality of restricting the freedom of movement for the EU citizens. The Berlin Immigration Office cites Germany's StaatsrÃ¤son, its commitment to Israel's right to exist, as justification for the deportations.</p>

            <p>Investors nearing retirement should consider strategies to protect their savings from market volatility caused by tariffs. Lee Baker and Jon Ulin recommend rebalancing portfolios based on risk tolerance, building cash reserves, and considering a bond ladder. Keeping two years of income in cash can protect retirees from early losses by allowing them to tap cash reserves while their portfolios recover. These strategies aim to mitigate the impact of market downturns and ensure long-term financial stability in retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Emma Beddington reflects on a lie she told on a first date 30 years ago, claiming to drive a Land Rover despite knowing nothing about cars. She uses this anecdote to discuss the prevalence of dishonesty in dating, from catfishing to more serious deceptions. While egregious lies can cause real harm, smaller fibs often stem from insecurity or a desire to present a better version of oneself. The author questions whether all dating lies are inherently awful, suggesting that some may be attempts at kindness or wishful thinking.</p>
