        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese automakers, including Toyota and Honda, are bracing for the impact of additional U.S. tariffs on cars and auto parts, which took effect on April 3. These tariffs are expected to significantly reduce profits, with Toyota projecting a 35% drop and Honda a 70% plunge in net profit. The companies are considering strategies such as increasing local production in the U.S., focusing on popular fuel-efficient models, and potentially raising prices, though the latter carries the risk of losing customers. Toyota is hesitant to make any hasty moves, while Honda plans to move some production to the U.S. from Japan and Canada. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A series of music festivals scheduled to take place in Brockwell Park, south London, from May 23 to June 8 are in jeopardy after resident Rebekah Shaman won a High Court challenge, arguing that Lambeth Council did not have the correct planning permission for the events. The cancellation would have a devastating blow, impacting thousands of people, businesses, and the local economy. The judge found that the council granted use of the park for nine days more than allowed without additional planning consent, and lawyers for the Protect Brockwell Park campaign group are calling for the events to be called off.</p>

The government confirmed that the trio arrived in the UK by "irregular means" between 2016 and 2022, and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that Iran must be held accountable for its actions and that the UK will strengthen its national security powers.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration ramps up collection efforts on student loans, borrowers are advised to understand the difference between delinquency and default. Delinquency occurs after missing a payment, while default happens after 270 days of non-payment. Borrowers in default face garnishments of tax refunds, paychecks, and Social Security benefits. Experts recommend contacting loan servicers to request retroactive forbearance and enroll in income-driven repayment plans to avoid delinquency and default.</p>

          <p>Viktor Orban's Fidesz party in Hungary has proposed a law that could be used to ban political parties and media outlets critical of the government. The draft law on "transparency of public life" would allow the government to monitor, restrict, penalize, and potentially ban organizations deemed a threat to national sovereignty. Critics say the bill follows the Russian playbook and will make the work of independent media outlets and NGOs extremely difficult.</p>

          <p>Experts are warning that long-term care costs can be a significant financial burden, often exceeding $100,000, and many households are unprepared. Over half of Americans turning 65 today will require long-term care, with average future costs around $122,400. Many types of insurance, including health insurance and Medicare, often don't cover these costs, leaving individuals to rely on out-of-pocket funds or Medicaid, which requires exhausting financial assets.
