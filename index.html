          <p>Jim Lovell, the esteemed astronaut who commanded the Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97. His 1970 lunar mission became famously known as a "successful failure" after an onboard oxygen tank explosion forced the crew to abort their moon landing and execute a perilous but safe return to Earth. In a statement, NASA honored Lovell for his steadfast courage and for turning a potential tragedy into a monumental learning experience for the space program, inspiring millions with his leadership and resilience.</p>

          <p>Texas Democrats once again broke quorum in the state legislature to block a controversial Republican-led redistricting plan that would likely increase the GOP's congressional seats. Despite threats of arrest and loss of pay from Governor Greg Abbott, the Democratic members refused to attend the special session, preventing a vote. The political showdown has drawn national attention, with Democrats vowing to remain absent until the end of the session to prevent the maps from passing.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reportedly authorized the Pentagon to develop military options for potential use against Latin American drug cartels that have been designated as foreign terrorist organizations. This directive allows for the planning of operations targeting groups like the Sinaloa Cartel and MS-13, treating them as armed terrorist organizations rather than just criminal enterprises. While officials state that military action is not imminent, the move signals a significant escalation in the administration's strategy to combat drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>In a pointed diplomatic gesture, Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly gave an award to a Trump envoy intended for a senior CIA official whose son was killed in Ukraine while fighting for Russian forces. The award, the Order of Lenin, was meant for Juliane Gallina, the CIA's deputy director for digital innovation, whose son Michael Gloss died in 2024. Sources suggest Putin's move was a psychological tactic designed to highlight a sensitive and tragic situation during high-stakes negotiations.</p>

The administration's statement helped calm market fears, causing the price of gold to stabilize at a lower level.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire raging in the Keratea region, southeast of Athens, has killed one elderly man and forced the evacuation of thousands of residents from seven different areas. Fanned by powerful winds, the blaze spread rapidly, destroying homes and burning through dry grasslands and a pine forest. With over 50 fires breaking out across Greece in 24 hours, authorities are facing one of the most challenging days of the summer wildfire season.</p>

          <p>Spain's national ombudsman has launched an investigation into the municipality of Jumilla for banning Muslim religious celebrations, such as Eid, from being held in public facilities like sports centers and gyms. The measure was passed by the conservative-led local government after a proposal from the far-right Vox party, which framed it as a defense of traditional cultural identity. The ban has been widely condemned as discriminatory and Islamophobic by religious and political leaders.</p>

          <p>The daughter of Bhim Kohli, an 80-year-old man killed by two teenagers, claims police inaction may have contributed to his death. A report revealed that police knew the identities of two other youths who had racially assaulted another man two weeks prior—an incident Mr. Kohli witnessed—but failed to make arrests until after his killing. His daughter argues that swifter police action could have sent a deterrent message and potentially prevented the fatal attack.</p>

          <p>The European Union has sanctioned an Indian energy company, Nayara Energy, for refining discounted Russian crude oil and exporting the products, some of which are sold to Europe. This move, part of the EU's broader sanctions against Russia, has created friction in EU-India trade relations. However, some experts believe the greater threat of high U.S. tariffs on Indian goods could paradoxically motivate India to accelerate the finalization of a free trade agreement with the EU.</p>

          <p>The U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, launched a sharp, undiplomatic attack on UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer for criticizing Israel's expansion of the war in Gaza. On social media, Huckabee provocatively compared Israel's actions to the Allied bombing of Dresden in World War II, asking Starmer if the UK surrendered to the Nazis and dropped food on them. The comments represent a severe diplomatic rebuke and reflect Huckabee's history of making intemperate remarks in support of Israel.</p>

          <p>As total U.S. credit card debt surpasses a record $1.21 trillion, this article outlines several strategies for consumers to eliminate or reduce high interest charges. Key methods discussed include transferring balances to a credit card with a 0% introductory APR, which can provide an interest-free period of up to 21 months. Other options include enrolling in a card issuer's hardship program, consolidating debt with a lower-rate personal loan, or paying off the balance before the statement closing date.

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has officially terminated its $7 billion Solar for All program, which was designed to fund the development of affordable solar energy projects in low-income communities across the United States. The EPA administrator stated that the agency no longer possesses the statutory authority or appropriated funds to continue the program.

          <p>A federal appeals court has thrown out a criminal contempt finding against the Trump administration concerning its deportation of over 250 Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador. A lower court judge had ruled that the administration willfully ignored his order to halt the deportations, which were carried out without due process. However, the divided appeals panel decided that the initial order overstepped judicial authority by attempting to control core executive functions like foreign policy.</p>
