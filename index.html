          <p>A shooting incident in a Midtown Manhattan office building at 345 Park Avenue has resulted in three fatalities, including an off-duty police officer who was working as a security guard. The suspect, armed with a long gun, barricaded himself on the 33rd floor before being found deceased from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. The building, which houses the headquarters for Blackstone and the National Football League, was placed on lockdown as authorities investigated the motive behind the attack. Employees were advised to shelter in place until they could be escorted out by police.</p>

          <p>Two high-ranking officials within the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division, Roger Alford and Bill Rinner, have been abruptly fired. The oustings come amid reports of significant internal tension and disagreements over the handling of major investigations into companies like T-Mobile and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Sources indicated that insubordination was cited in the dismissals, which follow friction between division head Gail Slater and some staff members over the direction of monopoly-fighting enforcement under the Trump administration. The division is responsible for preventing anticompetitive corporate behavior and mergers.</p>

          <p>A spokesperson for actor Anthony Anderson has addressed a recently resurfaced 2003 interview clip in which he made controversial remarks to a then-17-year-old Lindsay Lohan. The representative stated that the interview on "The Sharon Osbourne Show" was intended to be comedic and that Anderson regrets if the humor was in poor taste. In the clip, Anderson commented that he likes women "young" after Lohan noted she was "illegal" for older men. The spokesperson emphasized Anderson's respect for Lohan and described any contrary implication as inaccurate.</p>

          <p>USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA in an effort to play his final season of college football after the organization denied his eligibility waiver. The lawsuit challenges the NCAA’s “Five-Year Rule,” which limits athletes to four seasons of competition within a five-year period. Wingfield argues his circumstances, including time at a junior college and a season-ending injury, were not properly considered. The legal action claims the denial robs him of a significant name, image, and likeness (NIL) opportunity and a chance to enhance his professional prospects.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the significant legal legacy of Hulk Hogan's successful lawsuit against Gawker Media, following the wrestler's death at age 71. The case, in which a jury awarded Hogan $140 million for the publication of a sex tape, is remembered as a landmark moment for privacy rights in the digital age. It established a powerful precedent that even for public figures, the newsworthiness of an event does not grant media outlets an unlimited right to publish graphic, private content. The verdict ultimately led to Gawker's bankruptcy and reshaped media ethics discussions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected a lawsuit filed by Azoria Capital, an investment fund allied with President Trump, that sought to compel the Federal Reserve to open its interest rate-setting meetings to the public. The judge ruled that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is not a government agency subject to the federal "Sunshine Act," thereby upholding its long-standing practice of conducting meetings behind closed doors. The lawsuit had accused the Fed of maintaining high interest rates to undermine Trump's economic agenda. (not investment advice)</p>
