        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's largest private refiner, Reliance Industries, is reportedly stopping its purchases of Russian crude oil following new U.S. sanctions against Russian energy firms Rosneft and Lukoil. This move could impact Reliance's profit margins, as Russian crude constituted over half its supply and was bought at a significant discount. While alternative sources from the Middle East or the Americas are available, they will likely be more expensive. The decision highlights the complex position of India, which became a top buyer of discounted Russian oil after the invasion of Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Stephan Smerk, a 52-year-old New York man with a clean record, has confessed to the 1994 murder of Robin Warr Lawrence in Virginia, a cold case that remained unsolved for three decades. Investigators identified Smerk as a potential suspect after three years of painstaking genetic genealogy research, which linked crime scene DNA to his distant relatives. After detectives approached him for a DNA sample, Smerk voluntarily went to a local police station and confessed, stating he had an uncontrollable compulsion and had chosen his victim at random. He chillingly described himself as "a serial killer who's only killed once."</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is gathering strength in the Atlantic and is forecast to become a major hurricane by the weekend, posing a significant threat to several Caribbean islands. The National Hurricane Center has issued warnings for Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic, which are expected to receive 8 to 14 inches of rain. This heavy rainfall is likely to cause "catastrophic" and "life-threatening" flash flooding and landslides. While the storm is not expected to have a major impact on the mainland United States, its slow movement will prolong the severe weather conditions in the affected Caribbean regions.</p>

          <p>The total amount of assets managed by hedge funds globally has reached an all-time high of nearly $5 trillion, according to new industry data. This historic growth was driven by a combination of strong investment returns and the largest quarterly net inflow of new capital from investors in 18 years. The surge is attributed to successful bets on the technology and AI boom, rising M&A activity, and expectations of lower interest rates. Industry leaders anticipate that institutions will continue to increase allocations to hedge funds to navigate geopolitical risks and policy uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Current mortgage and refinance rates in the U.S. remain elevated compared to recent years, though they have stabilized, offering potential opportunities for homebuyers and those looking to refinance. As of late October, the average 30-year mortgage rate is around 6.34%, while a 15-year loan averages approximately 5.71%. The article suggests that strengthening one's credit profile is a key strategy for securing a better rate in the current environment. Experts note that if the Federal Reserve halts its rate hikes, mortgage rates are likely to stop rising as well, which would be welcome news for borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have dismantled a sophisticated, mafia-operated illegal poker scheme that allegedly cheated wealthy victims out of at least $7 million. The operation utilized high-tech methods, including X-ray tables, rigged shuffling machines, and special contact lenses to read marked cards. More than 30 individuals were arrested, including members of several notorious crime families and professional athletes who were allegedly used as "face cards" to entice victims. Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and former NBA player Damon Jones were among those arrested in connection with the sprawling fraud.</p>

          <p>As of late October, the price of gold is approximately $4,131 per ounce, continuing its role as an attractive commodity for investors, particularly during times of economic uncertainty. The article explains that gold is often viewed as a safe-haven asset and a hedge against inflation, historically holding its value over the long term. Its price is influenced by numerous factors, including global supply and demand, inflation rates, interest rates, and geopolitical instability. The value of the U.S. dollar also plays a significant role, as a weaker dollar can make gold cheaper for foreign investors, thereby increasing demand. (not investment advice)</p>

He stated the term did not reflect official government policy at the time.

          <p>German law enforcement is grappling with a dramatic increase in synthetic drugs, with seizures of new psychoactive substances more than tripling in 2024 compared to the previous year. The spike is largely driven by the rising popularity of ketamine as a party drug, alongside the growing presence of highly potent synthetic opioids like fentanyl and nitazene. Authorities have uncovered large-scale labs capable of producing tons of drugs in weeks and warn that smugglers are using new, more brutal methods. The trend poses a significant public health risk, as even tiny doses of these opioids can be fatal.</p>

          <p>The new biopic "Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere" focuses on the creation of Bruce Springsteen's seminal 1982 album, "Nebraska," but ultimately falls short of capturing its artistic depth. The film frames the album's stark, desolate songs primarily as a product of Springsteen's personal turmoil and conflict with his father. This review argues that by reducing the record to a simple autobiographical exercise, the movie undersells its broader engagement with American iconography, musical traditions, and the wider social landscape that Springsteen so powerfully channeled.</p>

          <h2>Turkish Court Dismisses Corruption Case Against Main Opposition Party CHP</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A court in Turkey has dismissed a corruption lawsuit against the country's main opposition party, the CHP, ruling that the case lacked merit. The lawsuit sought to annul the party's 2023 congress, where a new leader was elected, alleging procedural violations and vote-buying. The CHP has maintained that the legal action was a politically motivated attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's government to undermine the opposition. The dismissal is seen as a significant victory for the party, potentially easing a year-long legal crackdown it has faced.</p>

          <p>While the U.S. economy has remained largely resilient, economists are warning that a prolonged government shutdown could pose a significant threat, potentially tipping the nation into a recession. The immediate impact is being felt by hundreds of thousands of furloughed federal workers missing paychecks, with millions more set to lose food assistance soon. Experts suggest a long-term standoff could exhaust savings, sap broader consumer confidence, and create economic uncertainty due to the lack of reliable government-issued data. The shutdown acts as an additional headwind for an economy already facing a hiring slowdown and persistent inflation.</p>

          <p>A gallery attendant at the Louvre has provided the first staff account of the audacious heist of eight French crown jewels, describing the moment as something "no-one could have been prepared for." The attendant recalled hearing a "huge, dull, slightly metallic noise" as thieves used an angle grinder to break through a reinforced window into the Gallery of Apollo. She described seeing a criminal with what looked like a chainsaw before yelling for her colleagues to evacuate. The account underscores the shock of the event and backs the museum director's claims of long-term underfunding and security lapses.</p>

          <p>Mexican authorities have recovered 48 bags containing human remains from a clandestine grave in Zapopan, a municipality within the state of Jalisco, a stronghold of one of Mexico's most violent drug cartels. The grim discovery was made by a civilian search group on a vacant lot four weeks ago. Officials are now undertaking the difficult forensic work to determine the exact number of victims represented in the remains. The finding adds to the hundreds of mass graves found in Jalisco, the state most affected by Mexico's crisis of over 127,000 missing persons.</p>

          <p>The upcoming presidential election in Ivory Coast is under a cloud of controversy as incumbent President Alassane Ouattara, 83, seeks an unprecedented fourth term. His candidacy, made possible by 2016 constitutional changes that reset term limits, has drawn criticism, especially since several prominent opposition figures have been barred from running. While the nation has experienced a decade of strong economic growth under Ouattara's leadership, the exclusion of key challengers has raised serious concerns about the fairness of the electoral process and the health of the country's democracy.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has issued preliminary findings that TikTok and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, have breached transparency obligations under the Digital Services Act (DSA). The EU's executive body alleges the platforms failed to provide researchers with adequate access to public data, a key requirement for scrutinizing their societal impact. Meta was also cited for not offering simple mechanisms for users to report illegal content or challenge moderation decisions. If confirmed, these breaches could lead to substantial fines of up to 6% of the companies' global annual turnover.</p>

At the Fort Worth Zoo, scientists are employing advanced assisted reproduction techniques, including hormone injections and ultrasounds, to breed the toads in captivity. These efforts are coupled with an innovative program that partners with private Texas landowners, who receive property tax incentives for restoring and maintaining the toad's native habitat. This combination of cutting-edge science and public-private partnership offers a hopeful model for the recovery of an endangered species.</p>

Its unique combination of a crunchy shell and a gooey, colorful interior made it perfect for ASMR-style videos on TikTok, leading to an explosion in demand. The high price point and foreign origin have also turned the bar into an unlikely, and messy, luxury status symbol.</p>

The researcher, Gu Jianyi, pointed to the success of U.S. firms like SpaceX and Palantir, which are defined by Silicon Valley-style innovation and agile development. He argued that China should remove institutional barriers to better integrate the technological prowess of its own civilian tech giants, such as Huawei and Tencent, into the country's defense industrial base, which could inject revolutionary momentum into its weapons development.</p>

The event aims to defend the integrity of historical scholarship against political interference and the promotion of a whitewashed, patriotic narrative. Drawing inspiration from 1960s anti-war protests, the teach-in will provide the public with evidence-based historical context, framing the act of teaching truth as a form of defiance against authoritarian tendencies to control the past.</p>

In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, young Muslim New Yorkers began building local political institutions to counter widespread suspicion and surveillance, gradually developing a formidable and progressive political force. This movement, born from a need for self-defense and representation, has steadily grown in influence, pushing the Democratic party to the left.

However, this article questions whether his phenomenal performance has translated into the anticipated transformative growth for the league within the United States. While his global appeal is undeniable, domestic MLS attendance has actually dipped year-over-year, and viewership growth figures are ambiguous. The narrative around his success is complicated, as his dominance is expected, leaving the league still searching for a way to convert his stardom into a sustained domestic fanbase.</p>
