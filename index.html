The summit, which convenes over 550 delegates from 40 nations, is considered Asia's top defense summit. Gabbard is expected to discuss major security challenges with regional leaders, building on her recent trip to India and meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This diplomatic tour highlights the administration's broader efforts to elevate U.S. engagement in the Indo-Pacific region, shifting Gabbard's role from military service to high-stakes diplomacy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has partially reversed its decision to revoke Harvard University's certification to enroll international students, granting the school 30 days to challenge the decision. This action followed Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem's allegations of Harvard fostering an unsafe environment hostile to Jewish students and promoting pro-Hamas sympathies. A U.S. District Judge, Allison Burroughs, intends to issue a preliminary injunction to protect Harvard's international students, despite the administration's backtracking. Harvard is also contesting the Trump administration's attempt to freeze over $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts to the school, asserting that these actions are retaliatory for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights.</p>

The court, comprised of nine judges appointed for life, ruled that Trump exceeded his legal authority in imposing the tariffs.

The report highlights issues such as asbestos, electrical and fire safety concerns, pest control, and leaks, damp, and mould.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the Trump administration will "aggressively revoke visas" for Chinese students at U.S. universities, escalating the administration's dispute with Harvard. This move aligns with the administration's crackdown on student visas, as a federal court ruling challenges President Trump's power to unilaterally impose tariffs. The Department of Justice has requested a delay in the ruling, claiming it could cause a "foreign policy disaster scenario" and weaken the president's negotiating position.</p>

          <p>After a U.S. court blocked President Trump's tariffs, the administration has several tools at its disposal to potentially circumvent the ruling. These options include utilizing Section 122 of U.S. trade law, launching Section 301 investigations, and broadening Section 232 tariffs. The court ruling blocked the 10% baseline tariff and additional duties on China, Canada, and Mexico, but not sectoral levies like those on steel and autos. The administration's appeal of the ruling suggests it intends to pursue these other legal avenues (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Salesforce shares experienced a slump despite exceeding Wall Street's fiscal first-quarter estimates and increasing its full-year guidance due to artificial intelligence tailwinds. The company now projects adjusted earnings per share between $11.27 and $11.33, and revenue between $41.0 billion and $41.3 billion for the fiscal year. Analysts attributed the decline to a slight miss on current remaining performance obligation growth for the second quarter and a minor operating margin miss.

          <p>An op-ed challenges Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's claim that U.S. export controls on AI chips are a "failure" and are spurring China's innovation. The author argues that the controls reflect a sober reality that the U.S. cannot afford to fuel the military rise of its chief strategic rival. The author also says that Nvidia's arc in China follows a familiar pattern, where foreign firms are welcomed, dominate temporarily, and are ultimately displaced. The author concludes that U.S. semiconductor policy isn't about one firm's earnings or market access, but about protecting America's strategic edge in a high-stakes geopolitical contest.</p>

The ruling offers a fragile chance at reprieve for economies like Australia, Britain, Canada, the European Union, and India, but guarantees continued chaos. The court's decision blocks a set of tariffs enacted after an early April announcement, but does not roll back sector-specific tariffs.</p>
