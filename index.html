          <h2>Trump's First 100 Days See Stock Market Downturn Compared to Nixon Era</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-28 13:04:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's initial 100 days in office have marked the worst start for the stock market since the Nixon administration, with the S&P 500 dropping 7.9% due to investor concerns over Trump's aggressive trade policies. This contrasts sharply with the post-election surge driven by hopes of tax cuts and deregulation, as the market reacted negatively to tariff announcements, causing a brief bear market scare. Investors are wary of further downside amid continued uncertainty in Washington, with analysts suggesting the recent rally might just be a temporary bounce. The S&P 500 typically rises 2.1% in a president's first 100 days, making Trump's performance a notable outlier.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Investors are increasingly withdrawing funds from ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investments, driven by a backlash against President Trump's policies, particularly his stance on climate change and DEI initiatives. Morningstar reports that ESG funds saw $6.1 billion in outflows in the first quarter of 2025, continuing a trend from the previous quarter, marking the tenth consecutive quarter of outflows. This shift reflects a growing skepticism among U.S. investors toward socially responsible investing amid political polarization and policy changes. As of the end of Q1, U.S. investors held $330 billion in ESG funds, which accounts for about 10% of the global total.</p>

          <p>A new BBC workplace review, prompted by recent scandals, aims to foster a culture of respect and address bullying and inappropriate behavior within the corporation. The review follows previous efforts to improve workplace culture but acknowledges persistent power imbalances and a lack of confidence among staff and freelancers to report misconduct. BBC Chairman Samir Shah vowed to hold individuals accountable, while Director General Tim Davie announced measures such as a new code of conduct and leadership training. The report highlights the need for employees to feel safe speaking up without fear of reprisal, addressing concerns that offenders often go unpunished.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers are calling for a White House investigation into potential insider trading activities surrounding President Trump's recent pause on tariffs. Senators and Representatives have requested a full disclosure of financial transactions by senior White House officials, raising concerns that individuals close to the President may have violated ethics and insider trading laws. The request follows a surge in the stock market after Trump announced the tariff rollback, prompting questions about whether non-public information was used for financial gain.

Spending at stores catering to lower-income consumers has decreased, contrasting with increased spending at establishments favored by wealthier clientele.

          <p>President Trump suggested on social media that Canada should become the 51st state of the U.S., proposing benefits like tax cuts and increased military power if Canadians voted for him, despite him not being on the ballot.

          <h2>Trump's Administration Accused of Bungling COVID-19 Origins Investigation</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for its handling of the investigation into the origins of COVID-19, with some accusing the White House of sensationalizing the issue. Critics argue that the administration's approach, including a website poster targeting Anthony Fauci, hinders rather than helps the search for the truth. The administration is accused of not opening the books on the matter and for appointing Jeff Taubenberger, described as a "gain-of-function fanatic," as Fauci's temporary replacement. The topic of the origin of Covid-19 deserves more serious debate.</p>

          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, claims to have saved $160 billion through cost-cutting measures, but a new analysis suggests these efforts may have cost taxpayers $135 billion this fiscal year. The analysis, by the Partnership for Public Service, tallies the costs associated with paid leave for federal employees, re-hiring mistakenly fired workers, and lost productivity. The White House disputes the analysis, while polls indicate that most voters disapprove of Musk's handling of his role in the Trump administration. The IRS, which is planning on cutting roughly 40% of its workforce, could forego $323 billion in tax revenue over the next decade due to lower tax compliance and a decline in audits, according to an estimate from the Yale Budget Lab.</p>

The move comes as the administration faces legal challenges in its efforts to penalize sanctuary cities, with a federal judge blocking the withholding of federal funds from municipalities that limit cooperation with immigration enforcement.
