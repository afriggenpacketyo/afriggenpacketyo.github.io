          <p>President Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies produced outside the United States, claiming it is a national security threat due to other countries offering incentives to attract filmmakers. The Motion Picture Association declined to comment, while governments of Australia and New Zealand have spoken out in support of their countries' film industries. This move follows earlier actions, such as China reducing its quota of American films, and is part of Trump's broader trade policies aimed at boosting US manufacturers and protecting jobs. The industry is still trying to ascertain if this is in reference to films which are made in America but filmed abroad. The goal is to bring more film production back to the United States. The article details the potential impact on the film industry and responses from various stakeholders.</p>

          <p>Since their clash in 2019, India and Pakistan have significantly upgraded their military capabilities, increasing the risk of escalation in any future conflict. India believes it was at a disadvantage in 2019 and has since inducted French-made Rafale fighter jets, while Pakistan has acquired Chinese J-10 warplanes. Both countries have also bolstered their air defenses with missile systems from Russia and China. Experts suggest that decision-makers in both states have a higher risk appetite for conflict, but the lack of clear understanding about what actions could trigger escalation remains a concern.

          <p>China is striving to help exporters divert sales to the domestic market as U.S. orders for Chinese goods decline due to high tariffs, but this move threatens to drive the economy into deeper deflation. Local governments and major businesses are supporting the effort, but the influx of discounted goods could erode companies' profitability and weigh on employment. After hovering just above zero in 2023 and 2024, the consumer price index slipped into negative territory, declining for two straight months in February and March. The article explores the potential economic consequences of this shift and the challenges facing China's economy.</p>
