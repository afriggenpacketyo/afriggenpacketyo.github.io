          <p>Supporters of LGBTQ+ rights from approximately 30 countries are anticipated to participate in the Budapest Pride march, defying a police ban enacted under new legislation. The event has become a symbol of opposition to the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, drawing support from over 30 embassies and members of the European Parliament. Despite the risk of fines and potential jail time for organizers, the march is seen as a significant stand for civil liberties in Hungary. The government's actions are viewed by critics as part of a broader crackdown on democratic freedoms ahead of next year's elections.</p>

          <p>At least 11 people have died, including four children and three women, due to severe flash floods and landslides in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The flooding, which damaged dozens of homes in the Swat Valley, has prompted ongoing rescue operations as the national meteorological department warns of more heavy rainfall. This event highlights Pakistan's extreme vulnerability to climate change, following other recent deadly weather events. The country's former climate change minister criticized the government for failing to take the threat seriously, stating that such crises are intensifying and require urgent action.</p>

          <p>A rift has emerged within Germany's ruling coalition over the future of nuclear energy, exposing differing philosophies between the Economy and Environment ministries. The dispute was highlighted when the Economy Minister attended a meeting of pro-nuclear EU states, despite Germany's official phase-out of nuclear power in 2023. This follows a joint German-French paper supporting all low-emission energy forms, which critics fear could jeopardize climate goals. The government also faces internal conflict over plans to build 20 new gas-fired power plants, a move that climate experts warn could undermine Germany's 2045 climate neutrality target.</p>

          <p>Ahead of their Saturday boxing match, Julio CÃ©sar ChÃ¡vez Jr. and Jake Paul are both insisting their fight is a legitimate contest with significant career implications, not a staged event. For ChÃ¡vez Jr., son of a boxing legend, the fight is a chance to revitalize his career after personal struggles and potentially secure more significant future bouts. For Paul, a victory over a former world champion would be a major step toward silencing critics and establishing his credibility in the sport. Both fighters have dismissed skepticism, promising a genuine and competitive match with much at stake for their respective futures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Peng Wensheng, chief economist at China International Capital Corporation, China's established third-party payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay give the nation a significant edge in the global stablecoin race. He argues that these platforms function similarly to stablecoins by extending legal tender and are backed by a mature regulatory framework that ensures a 1:1 peg with fiat currency. Peng's analysis suggests that the stability of this system is reinforced by strict safeguards, including customer funds being backed by central bank money. This perspective emerges as Chinese state media encourages policymakers to remain proactive in the evolving digital currency landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent study from the Japan Institute for Health Security has found a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals who consume a Japanese-style diet. The research assessed the benefits of a traditional diet rich in rice, miso soup, soy products, fish, and green tea. The study also looked at a modified version that included fruit and dairy. This is the first study of its kind to specifically link the components of a traditional Japanese diet to mental health outcomes, suggesting a potential nutritional strategy in the fight against depression.</p>

          <p>The European Union has officially proposed new international restrictions on the trade of all eel species, a move that faces strong opposition from Japan. The proposal, submitted under the Washington Convention, would require export permits and proof of legal capture for species like the Japanese eel starting in June 2027. This measure aims to protect endangered eel populations by regulating the global market more tightly. The final decision on the proposal will be made at the upcoming conference of the parties to the convention, setting the stage for a significant international trade and conservation debate.</p>

The plan allows affected students from Harvard's Kennedy School to continue their studies at Toronto's Munk School through a special visiting program if visa restrictions are upheld. This move comes after the Department of Homeland Security attempted to terminate Harvard's ability to enroll international students, an effort currently blocked by a federal judge.

The move, part of Labour's new 10-year health strategy, will eliminate bodies including patient advocate Healthwatch England and the National Guardian's Office, which supports whistleblowers. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the current system is overly complex and needs "more doers and fewer checkers."

This situation has left the community with a profound sense of powerlessness and has become a focal point for a wider debate about concentrated land ownership and accountability in rural England.

Ken Holland, the general manager for the LA Kings, was among those who expressed a preference for the traditional, in-person format, citing the energy and excitement it provides for drafted players and their families.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4, extending their winning streak despite what their manager described as a flawed performance. The team overcame a rough four-inning start from pitcher Dustin May and defensive errors, thanks to key offensive plays, including a leadoff home run from Shohei Ohtani and a two-run homer by Max Muncy. The game was ultimately decided by a bases-loaded, game-ending double play in the ninth inning. The victory pushed the Dodgers into sole possession of the best record in the majors, showcasing their ability to win even when not playing at their peak.</p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court decision allowing parents to opt their children out of certain lessons was centered on nine specific LGBTQ+ themed picture books used in a Maryland school district. This article details the content of books like "Pride Puppy," "Uncle Bobbyâ€™s Wedding," and "Born Ready," which were part of the district's effort to include LGBTQ+ families in its curriculum. The case brought the story lines of these books into the legal record, with justices debating their messages. For instance, the majority opinion expressed concern that a book celebrating a same-sex wedding could undermine parents' religious teachings.</p>

The author recounts an anecdote where a U.S. senator allegedly stated the goal was not regime change in Iraq, but to reduce any regional rival to a "pre-industrial society." The article suggests this neoconservative-driven agenda became official U.S. policy following the September 11 attacks. It frames decades of conflict and intervention in the region, from Iraq to Iran, as part of this overarching strategic quest for Israeli military superiority.</p>

          <p>China's solar panel manufacturing industry is experiencing a significant downturn, grappling with both a domestic supply glut and a fierce price war that has driven down prices by up to 80% since 2023. This internal pressure is compounded by U.S. tariffs that are blocking access to key export markets, leading to billions in losses for photovoltaic producers. The mood at a recent major industry conference in Shanghai was described as weary, with several leading companies skipping the event. The dual challenges have caused the stock prices of major Chinese solar firms to plummet, raising questions about the industry's near-term stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several communities across Los Angeles County have canceled or postponed Independence Day parades and other July events due to widespread fear among residents over ongoing immigration enforcement raids. The El Sereno Bicentennial Committee was among the first to cancel its 66th annual parade, citing the safety of participants and the withdrawal of numerous community groups. Residents report a climate of fear stoked by videos and accounts of people being detained in unmarked vans. The cancellations highlight the profound impact that current immigration enforcement tactics are having on community life and public gatherings in the city.</p>

          <h2>California Governor Warns Proposed GOP Bill Would Bring 'Devastating' Healthcare Cuts to State</h2>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has warned that a Republican budget bill advancing in the U.S. Senate could cause as many as 3.4 million Californians to lose their Medi-Cal health insurance. Newsom described the proposed cuts as "reckless and cruel," stating they could also force rural hospital closures and drive up insurance premiums. The bill includes a provision that would require many Medicaid recipients to prove they work at least 80 hours a month, a requirement the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates would leave millions uninsured nationwide. The governor argued the bill would gut an already vulnerable system and threaten California's progress in reducing its uninsured rate.</p>
