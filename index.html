          <p>Former Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney has commented on the transfer speculation surrounding Newcastle's Alexander Isak, suggesting it is becoming difficult for the player to remain at the club. Speaking on his new podcast, Rooney noted that while losing Isak would be a significant blow to Newcastle's ambitions, the financial reality of PSR rules might make selling him beneficial for strengthening the overall squad. He acknowledged the immense opportunity for Isak to join Liverpool, the reigning Premier League champions, framing the potential move as a logical career step for the talented Swedish striker.</p>

The agreement, announced by ASI President Teodoro Valente, will include experiments on plant growth, weather surveillance, and radiation. This move signals SpaceX's intent to commercialize interplanetary travel, although no specific timeline for the launches has been provided. The ambitious plan relies on the success of the company's Starship rocket, which has faced numerous setbacks in test flights and is not yet rated for crewed missions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A landmark advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has established that nations have a legal duty to protect the environment from greenhouse gas emissions. According to some financial experts, this ruling could have significant consequences for markets by creating legal risks for assets tied to fossil fuels, as government subsidies and production licenses may now be considered internationally wrongful acts. While the opinion is non-binding, it may influence national court decisions and force investors to re-evaluate the long-term viability and valuation of carbon-intensive industries, potentially shifting capital allocation.

          <p>Vectus Global, a security firm run by Blackwater founder Erik Prince, is set to deploy nearly 200 personnel to Haiti under a one-year contract to help the government combat soaring gang violence. The deployment aims to assist Haitian authorities in reclaiming territory controlled by heavily armed gangs and will also involve advising on restoring revenue collection capabilities. The move has raised concerns among some experts about the use of private military contractors and potential violations of U.S. law without government approval. U.S. officials have stated they are not involved in or funding the contract.</p>

          <p>The upcoming peace summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will address several critical issues to end the war in Ukraine. Key topics include territorial disputes, with Russia occupying about a fifth of Ukraine, and the establishment of long-term security guarantees, as Ukraine seeks protection outside of a formal NATO alliance. Other major points of contention are the lifting of economic sanctions against Russia, accountability for war crimes, and securing funding for Ukraine's extensive reconstruction needs. The return of prisoners of war and the status of the seized Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant will also be on the agenda.</p>

This move effectively ends the city's "sanctuary" policies, allowing local police to fully assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as part of President Trump's broader anti-crime initiative in the capital. The order reverses rules that prevented officers from inquiring about immigration status or making arrests based solely on administrative immigration warrants. D.C. officials, including the city's attorney general, have challenged the legality of the directive, creating a potential legal conflict.</p>

          <p>China's economy showed signs of faltering in July as key indicators like retail sales and industrial output missed forecasts, signaling a loss of momentum. Retail sales grew by 3.7%, slowing from the previous month, while industrial output recorded its weakest expansion since last November. The slowdown is attributed to persistent weak domestic demand, a complex external environment, and government efforts to curb excess industrial capacity and unsustainable price wars. This data raises concerns about achieving the annual growth target and may increase pressure for new policy support. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A children's playground in Wooler, Northumberland, has reopened after a shocking discovery of 177 World War II-era practice bombs buried just beneath the surface. The first device was found in January by a worker installing new equipment, leading to a specialist ordnance disposal team being called in. The bombs, which were not live but contained a charge, were found carefully stacked, suggesting they were deliberately buried after the war. The area was a significant military training ground, and historical records indicate an ordnance depot was located on the site, explaining the munitions' presence.</p>

          <p>A significant decline in close friendships among young men since 1990 has led to a widespread sense of loneliness and isolation, with two-thirds of American men aged 18-23 feeling that nobody truly knows them. This social disconnection contributes to societal problems, including the rise of misogynistic beliefs within online communities. The article argues that men must take responsibility for this issue by moving away from a masculinity grounded in domination and instead cultivating deeper, more emotionally open relationships. It suggests that fostering community and teaching boys to identify and discuss emotions could help counter this troubling trend.</p>

He highlighted that his party received over 4.1 million votes in the last general election and has since gained significant ground in local elections.

          <h2>Trump's Federal Takeover of D.C. Continues with Homeless Camp Clearances and False Crime Claims</h2>

          <p>As part of the federal takeover of Washington D.C., authorities have begun clearing homeless encampments, a long-standing focus of President Trump. Concurrently, Trump has made false claims that the city's crime rate is the "worst it's ever been," despite data showing a 30-year low in violent crime in 2024. The administration's actions, which include deploying the National Guard and federal agents, have drawn sharp criticism from local Democratic leaders and civil rights advocates. The move to clear encampments has created a chaotic and frightening situation for the city's unhoused population, who face a shortage of available shelter beds.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has started canceling flights as it faces a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants, which could ground the nation's largest airline and affect approximately 130,000 travelers daily. The union issued a 72-hour strike notice after contract negotiations with the airline reached an impasse, with a potential walkout beginning Saturday. The airline has begun a gradual suspension of operations, starting with long-haul overseas flights, and plans to be fully grounded by the weekend. Key disagreements in the talks revolve around wages and compensation for unpaid work time when aircraft are not in the air.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced that state Democrats will advance a plan to redraw congressional district maps, a direct response to a Republican-led effort in Texas to create more GOP-friendly districts. The proposed "election rigging response act" would override California's independent redistricting commission and would only take effect if a Republican-led state implements a partisan mid-cycle redistricting plan. Newsom framed the move as a necessary defensive measure to "neuter and neutralize" attempts to rig elections and protect democracy, vowing to meet "fire with fire." The plan will be put to voters in a special election on November 4th.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: 'And Just Like That' Finale Provides a Fittingly Independent End for Carrie Bradshaw</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The series finale of "And Just Like That" concludes with protagonist Carrie Bradshaw single once again, an ending that some critics argue is more true to the character's journey than the original "Sex and the City" finale. After exploring widowhood and a rekindled romance, the show leaves Carrie embracing her independence, finding fulfillment in her friendships rather than in a romantic partner. This conclusion revisits the original show's revolutionary theme that female friendships can be the most powerful and enduring soulmate connections. The finale suggests that a life lived alone is not a tragedy but another form of a happy, fabulous ending.</p>

          <p>Guangzhou Innogen Pharmaceutical Group's shares surged in their Hong Kong trading debut, closing at nearly four times their initial public offering price. The successful IPO reflects strong investor confidence in China's pharmaceutical sector, particularly for companies developing popular anti-obesity drugs. Innogen's strong performance was buoyed by a broader rally in Hong Kong's biotech industry, which has seen significant gains and rising valuations throughout the year. The company's founder highlighted the immense commercial opportunities driven by unmet clinical demand for metabolic drugs in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

Before his arrest for disturbing the peace, he described his actions as a "cry for help" related to personal and legal issues.

          <p>An 18-year-old high school senior was taken into custody by federal immigration agents in Van Nuys while he was walking his family's dog. The student, Benjamin Marcelo Guerrero-Cruz, was set to begin his senior year at Reseda Charter High School. According to DHS, he is an undocumented immigrant from Chile who overstayed his visa. The incident has intensified fears within the Los Angeles immigrant community, particularly as it follows other enforcement actions near schools. The LAUSD Superintendent expressed concern over the traumatic impact of such events on students and the dismal conditions the teen is reportedly facing in custody.</p>

Many have lost access to cherished photos and seen their businesses disrupted, with little recourse or explanation from the company. Although Meta has denied a widespread issue, it has frequently reinstated accounts after being contacted by the BBC regarding individual cases. Users suspect that flawed AI moderation tools are responsible for the unfair bans and that the appeals process is largely automated and ineffective.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a new high-speed jet drone with vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities, a technological breakthrough that could effectively turn any warship into an aircraft carrier. The uncrewed aircraft is designed to launch from the decks of vessels like destroyers and frigates, even in rough seas, and then transition to fast, long-range flight. According to the project team, the drone's speed is far superior to other mainstream VTOL drones. This innovation significantly enhances the operational flexibility and strike range of the Chinese navy by removing the need for traditional runways for drone deployment.</p>

          <p>President Trump downplayed the significance of Latin American nations, including Brazil, increasing their economic coordination with China in response to U.S. tariffs. When asked about the trend, Trump asserted that the U.S. economy is outperforming every other country, including China, stating, "we’re blowing everyone away." His comments came as Brazil is working with Beijing on a multilateral response to steep tariffs Washington imposed on a wide range of Brazilian exports. The tariffs, announced in late July, have threatened billions of dollars in trade and pushed key regional allies to seek stronger economic partnerships elsewhere.</p>

          <p>As the new school year starts in Los Angeles, undocumented families are living with heightened fear due to increased immigration enforcement activity in the area. Recent raids and the visible presence of federal agents near schools have left parents and students anxious, with some families considering keeping their children home to avoid potential separation. In response, the LAUSD has implemented "safe zones" around 100 schools in Latino-majority neighborhoods to monitor for federal activity. The detention of a 15-year-old student outside his high school has further amplified concerns about the trauma and disruption these enforcement actions cause for children.</p>
