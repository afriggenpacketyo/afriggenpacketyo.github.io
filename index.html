          <p>Iranian state-controlled media has praised Elias Rodriguez, the suspect in the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington, D.C., with one newspaper calling him "our dear brother." The victims, one of whom was an American citizen, were allegedly targeted due to the suspect's anti-Israeli sentiments. This glorification of the murders has drawn condemnation and heightened concerns about Iran's support for terrorism. It also coincides with reports of potential interim nuclear agreement discussions between the U.S. and Iran, raising questions about the regime's trustworthiness.</p>

          <p>Russia conducted one of its most significant air assaults on Ukraine, involving nearly 370 missiles and drones, resulting in at least 12 deaths and numerous injuries. The Ukrainian Air Force reported shooting down a majority of the incoming weapons. This attack is part of a recent escalation despite ongoing cease-fire negotiations, with civilian casualties rising since February. Ukrainian President Zelensky has criticized the lack of international pressure on Putin, while residents are exhausted from the continued war. The prisoner exchange program remains one of the few areas of communication between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated that the United States' "silence" following recent Russian attacks is emboldening President Vladimir Putin. This statement comes after Russia launched its largest aerial assault since the war began, resulting in multiple civilian casualties. Zelensky emphasized that Russia's "brutality cannot be stopped" without increased pressure on the Russian leadership. The attacks involved hundreds of missiles and drones, impacting numerous regions across Ukraine, and follow intensified aerial campaigns by Moscow despite international calls for a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>A police officer in Dalton, Georgia, has resigned after wrongfully arresting an undocumented teenager, Ximena Arias-Cristobal, leading to her detention in a federal immigration jail. The arrest, based on a dropped traffic charge, sparked outrage due to Arias-Cristobal's immigration status and the timing of her arrival in the U.S., which narrowly missed the deadline for DACA eligibility. Her detention highlights the increasing immigration enforcement efforts and the controversial 287(g) contracts between local law enforcement and ICE. Arias-Cristobal has since been released on bond, and efforts are underway to secure her permanent residency.</p>

The broadcast also includes segments on journalist Steve Rosenberg's reporting from Russia, a food-as-art feature, and an interview with novelist Anne Tyler.

The reported budget for “Lilo & Stitch” was $100 million, while “Mission: Impossible” reportedly cost $300 million to $400 million to produce.</p>
