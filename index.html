          <p>California Senator Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a press conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles after interrupting her remarks on immigration enforcement. Padilla, who was attempting to ask questions about the administration's immigration policies, was physically escorted out of the room and handcuffed, though not detained or arrested. DHS officials claimed Padilla did not identify himself and lunged toward Secretary Noem, leading them to believe he was an attacker, while Padilla stated he was already in the federal building for a scheduled meeting and was seeking information about DHS actions. The incident has sparked outrage among Democratic lawmakers, with California Governor Gavin Newsom calling it "outrageous, dictatorial, and shameful."</p>

          <p>A federal judge is expected to issue an order soon regarding California's challenge to the Trump administration's deployment of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles to assist with enforcing federal immigration laws. California Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta filed an emergency request to block the expansion of what they called the administration's "unlawful militarization." The state argues that there is no rebellion or invasion in Los Angeles, and the situation can be managed by local authorities, while the Department of Justice claims that limiting the military to protecting federal buildings would give rioters a veto over federal law enforcement. The judge acknowledged the significance and urgency of the issues at hand.</p>

The new track league is reportedly looking towards 2026 and expects to announce new investors next week, with the decision attributed to economic problems with the venue.

He stated that military strikes are an option if talks fail to curb Iran's ability to enrich uranium, following a United Nations' nuclear watchdog report that Tehran failed to comply with nonproliferation obligations. Trump also cited the State Department's evacuation of staff from the Baghdad embassy and the military's evacuation of non-essential personnel from U.S. bases in the Middle East as precautionary measures.

The London talks followed Trump's call with Xi, with China's tightening of rare earth exports being a key factor.

          <p>Michael Avenatti, the former lawyer for Stormy Daniels, was resentenced to 11 years in prison for tax evasion and stealing millions from clients, but received credit for time served, reducing his sentence to nearly eight years. Judge James V. Selna stated that Avenatti had done both noble and evil things, and his actions showed an abandonment of fairness. Avenatti pleaded guilty to wire fraud and obstructing tax collection, with restitution ordered for his victims, including Geoffrey Ernest Johnson and the IRS. Alexis Gardner, a former client, spoke at the hearing, detailing how Avenatti misappropriated her settlement funds.</p>

          <p>A growing wildfire in Oregon has destroyed multiple homes and prompted evacuation orders in the Columbia River Gorge area, serving as an early warning for the upcoming fire season. The Rowena fire has expanded to 3,500 acres with 0% containment, leading Governor Tina Kotek to invoke the Emergency Conflagration Act to mobilize resources. Approximately 20 homes have been destroyed, and nearly 2,200 structures are threatened, amidst record-breaking early season heat. The wildfire highlights the potential for a brutal fire season exacerbated by a dry winter and warming temperatures.</p>

The cuts to the lowest-income households come from proposed cuts to social safety net programs including Medicaid and a food assistance program.
