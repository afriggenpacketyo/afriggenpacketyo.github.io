          <h2>South Korean Court Upholds Dismissal of 'Baby Shark' Copyright Infringement Lawsuit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 02:21:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's Supreme Court has definitively rejected a significant copyright claim against Pinkfong's globally viral children's song "Baby Shark." US composer Jonathan Wright had sought $21,600, asserting the 2015 hit copied his earlier 2011 rendition, but the court upheld previous decisions. It ruled that Wright's version lacked sufficient originality to qualify for copyright protection, as both songs are rooted in a traditional melody popular at US summer camps. This final judgment solidifies Pinkfong's stance that "Baby Shark" is based on a public domain singalong chant, concluding a protracted legal dispute that garnered international attention due to the song's immense popularity and cultural impact. The decision provides clarity for the music industry regarding the originality of folk-inspired works.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over 115 education scholars have condemned Harvard University's publishing group for canceling a special issue of the Harvard Educational Review dedicated to Palestine, calling it an act of censorship. The scholars argue this action attempts to silence academic examination of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and constitutes anti-Palestinian discrimination, especially amidst the ongoing situation in Gaza. Despite the publisher citing review process issues, authors and editors rejected this, viewing the cancellation as a dangerous precedent and an example of the "Palestine exception" to academic freedom. Critics emphasize the importance of open inquiry, particularly when educational infrastructure in Gaza has been devastated.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong property developer Road King has officially defaulted on $1.51 billion in offshore debts, encompassing bank loans and notes, after its creditors rejected proposed amendments to the terms. This significant financial setback means the company will suspend $22.62 million in interest payments and defer $56.46 million in distributions on perpetual securities. While Road King has not yet received demands for accelerated repayment, it is actively seeking a comprehensive restructuring solution. The developer aims to engage in discussions with a select group of bondholders who previously provided feedback, signaling a difficult path ahead for its financial stability.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney expressed deep disappointment over Tom Brady's "very unfair" comments questioning his work ethic as head coach of Birmingham City. Brady, a minority owner of the club, made the remarks in a documentary after Rooney's 83-day tenure ended in January 2024. Rooney, speaking on his new podcast, clarified that Brady's single visit on a lighter training day might have led to a misunderstanding of football's demands compared to NFL. He acknowledged Brady's hard work but emphasized the differences in sports, highlighting the team's prior "mess" and subsequent struggles under other managers.</p>

          <p>Over 100 humanitarian organizations, including Oxfam and Médecins Sans Frontières, have jointly called on Israel to cease the "weaponization of aid" in Gaza, citing deepening starvation. They report increasing denials for aid delivery unless stricter Israeli regulations are met, which include prohibitions on "delegitimizing" Israel or withholding detailed Palestinian staff information. While Israel denies restrictions, claiming rules prevent Hamas involvement, aid groups state most major international NGOs haven't delivered supplies since March 2, leading to critical shortages in hospitals and preventable deaths.

          <p>Nicholas Rossi, an American fugitive who infamously faked his death and fled to Scotland to evade justice, has been found guilty of sexual assault in the United States. This conviction stems from an attack in Salt Lake County, with an additional trial for another alleged sexual assault still scheduled for September in Utah County. The victim testified that Rossi sexually assaulted her after she attempted to end their brief, online-initiated engagement, during which he became controlling. Rossi, who had been apprehended in a Glasgow hospital after being identified by distinctive tattoos, had previously asserted a false identity. This verdict marks a significant step in bringing him to justice after years of evasion.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at easing regulations for commercial rocket launches, directing the US transportation secretary to eliminate or expedite environmental reviews for FAA launch licenses. The order cites inefficient permitting processes as a deterrent to investment and innovation in global space markets. It also calls for canceling "outdated, redundant or overly restrictive rules." This move could potentially benefit private space companies like Elon Musk's SpaceX, which has faced delays due to environmental studies and licensing reviews, though environmental groups have criticized the deregulation for potentially risking people and wildlife.</p>

          <h2>Gallup Poll Reveals Record Low in American Alcohol Consumption, Citing Health Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 23:10:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has fallen to a record low of 54%, coinciding with increased public concern about the health risks of even moderate drinking. Experts suggest this shift is driven by greater knowledge of alcohol's negative effects, including increased risks of cancer and mental health issues, debunking previous notions of moderate benefits. Young people, in particular, are more likely to perceive moderate drinking as harmful and are less inclined to consume alcohol, influenced by evolving social norms, the rise of alcohol-free alternatives, and economic factors.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a significant warning regarding popular mousse sunscreen products, including Supergoop!'s body mousse, cautioning that they may not effectively protect users from the sun's harmful UV rays. The FDA sent warning letters to five companies, asserting that these products are unapproved drugs and are "misbranded" because their packaging resembles whipped cream containers, which poses a serious risk of accidental ingestion, especially by children. While Supergoop! stated its commitment to resolving a "product labeling" matter, other companies like Vacation Inc. and Kalani Sunwear also received these warnings. This article highlights critical safety and efficacy concerns for consumers relying on these widely marketed personal care items.</p>
