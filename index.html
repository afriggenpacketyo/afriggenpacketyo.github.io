          <p>Canada announced it would lift billions in retaliatory tariffs on various U.S. goods, effective September 1st, following a phone call between Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Donald Trump. This decision aims to re-establish free trade for a significant portion of goods under the USMCA agreement, though tariffs on American autos, steel, and aluminum will remain in place as negotiations continue. The White House welcomed the move as "long overdue," expressing a desire for continued discussions on trade and national security. Carney highlighted the importance of preserving Canada's unique trade advantage for workers and businesses, with a focus on accelerating talks for key sectors ahead of the USMCA review next year.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump indicated a potential federal intervention in Chicago to address its crime rate, following a similar push in Washington D.C. He described Chicago as "a mess" and criticized Mayor Brandon Johnson as "grossly incompetent," stating that his administration would likely tackle the city next after the D.C. initiative. Trump claimed Chicago residents were "screaming" for federal assistance to reduce crime, asserting that the operation would not be difficult. This announcement signals a broader focus on urban crime rates, with the President aiming to make American cities "very, very safe."</p>

Authorities have not yet released details on possible injuries, and all lanes on the thruway at Pembroke were closed due to the incident, causing heavy delays and prompting alternate travel routes.

          <p>Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack expressed significant hesitancy about lowering interest rates, stressing the importance of maintaining a "modestly restrictive" policy stance to bring inflation back to the Fed's target. Her remarks, made in a CNBC interview, contrasted with market enthusiasm for cuts sparked by Chair Jerome Powell's earlier speech suggesting potential policy easing. Hammack, who will be a rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee voter in 2026, noted her belief that the "neutral" interest rate is higher than most other Fed officials. This indicates a cautious internal view within the Fed on avoiding any premature accommodation that could reignite inflationary pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kimbal Musk, Elon Musk's brother, publicly stated that Elon "deserves to be paid," highlighting that the Tesla CEO has received no salary or cash bonuses for years, relying instead on performance-based stock options. This defense comes as Tesla navigates a legal challenge over Elon Musk's 2018 $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge ordered revoked. Tesla's board recently granted an "interim" pay package of 96 million shares, worth about $29 billion, without a shareholder vote, which is now facing scrutiny from investment groups. The new package is contingent on the outcome of Tesla's appeal in Delaware, with a longer-term strategy planned for a future shareholder vote.</p>

          <p>The UK government has agreed to an out-of-court settlement to compensate over 7,700 Kenyans affected by a 2021 fire in the Lolldaiga conservancy, which was caused by a British military training exercise. Claimants had sought damages for lost property and health complications due to the blaze. While the UK did not disclose the exact compensation amount, the lawyer for the claimants stated it was £2.9 million, describing it as the "best possible outcome" despite client complaints about insufficient sums. The fire, likely caused by a camp stove, damaged thousands of acres, leading to environmental concerns and property destruction from stampeding wild animals.</p>

          <p>Millions of American retirees rely on Social Security benefits, yet many are unaware that these payments can be reduced by several factors beyond simply claiming them early. Continuing to work before reaching full retirement age can trigger the earnings test, leading to temporary deductions from benefits. Medicare Part B premiums, particularly Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amounts (IRMAA) for high-income earners, are automatically deducted, significantly reducing monthly payments. Furthermore, a portion of Social Security benefits can become subject to federal income tax if combined income exceeds specific thresholds, often surprising retirees. Understanding these potential pitfalls is crucial for effective retirement planning and maintaining one's standard of living. (not investment advice)</p>

Her journey reflects themes prevalent in her own fiction, like the dichotomy of "dominion versus care" and a heterodox interpretation of Christianity. A tea-and-meditation ceremony at Shunkō-in Temple ultimately helped her understand the orderly disorder and ambiguity in Murasaki's writing, and also provided valuable self-awareness.</p>

          <p>Over 2,000-year-old ancient statues, Roman coins, and other artifacts have been recovered from a sunken city in Abu Qir Bay off Egypt's coast. Egyptian authorities believe the site may be an extension of the ancient city of Canopus, a prominent center during the Ptolemaic and Roman eras, which was submerged by a series of earthquakes and rising sea levels. Notable finds include limestone buildings that may have served as places of worship, royal figures, sphinxes, and a merchant ship. This discovery offers invaluable insights into historical civilizations, but also highlights the modern threat to coastal cities like Alexandria, which is sinking and vulnerable to climate change.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered National Guard troops patrolling Washington D.C. as part of President Trump's law enforcement crackdown to be armed, escalating the federal intervention in the capital. This directive reverses previous guidance that troops would not carry weapons, with nearly 2,000 National Guard members now stationed in the city. Their deployment, including hundreds from Republican-led states, has focused on protecting landmarks and crowd control. Local officials, however, dispute the necessity of this armed presence, noting that violent crime in D.C. has been declining for the past year and a half, contrary to the administration's claims.</p>

          <p>The summer box office for 2025 surpassed last year's figures, reaching $3.75 billion, primarily driven by superhero films, dinosaurs, and Disney's live-action "Lilo & Stitch" remake. Despite hopes for a $4 billion return to pre-pandemic levels, major franchise reboots underperformed, with "Lilo & Stitch" being the highest-grossing film. Movie theater operators reported solid second-quarter numbers, but industry analysts predict a significant cooldown in ticket sales through August, September, and October. The industry anticipates a strong resurgence in the fourth quarter, with highly anticipated sequels like "Wicked: For Good," "Zootopia 2," and "Avatar: Fire and Ash" expected to boost revenues significantly from late November.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell significantly raised expectations for a September interest rate cut during his Jackson Hole speech, a move long demanded by President Trump. Powell suggested that the inflationary impact of Trump's tariffs could be temporary and acknowledged rising downside risks to employment, hinting that adjusting policy might be warranted. While boosting market confidence, he did not directly address the political pressure from Trump, only cautioning that monetary policy is not on a preset course and decisions are based solely on data. This dovish shift, combined with his emphasis on data-driven decisions, sent share prices higher, reflecting investor optimism about easing borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo's future is uncertain due to a breakdown in his relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis, despite leading the team to European qualification last season. Nuno confirmed their relationship is "not so well" this season, acknowledging the squad's awareness of the situation and expressing concern about his involvement in transfer market activity. Rumors of his job being at risk persist, even after signing a new three-year contract in June, which Marinakis had previously described as "strong and solid."

          <p>Record-breaking heat waves disproportionately affect marginalized communities, particularly people of color and low-income residents, a disparity linked to historical discriminatory housing policies like redlining.

Environmental justice advocates are actively pushing for solutions such as planting more trees and creating parks, as demonstrated by successful initiatives in Arizona and New York City.
