        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Texas Representative Beto O'Rourke is urging the Democratic party to adopt a more aggressive strategy against Republican redistricting efforts, particularly in Texas. Speaking at a Center for American Progress event, O'Rourke expressed support for California's own potential redistricting to counter GOP moves, arguing that the future of the republic is at stake. He criticized Democrats for often prioritizing being "right" over being in power, stating that the party must be "ruthlessly focused on winning power" to combat what he views as an emerging authoritarian threat. O'Rourke's comments highlight the escalating partisan battle over congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>A Delta flight bound for Atlanta was forced to abort its takeoff at Mexico City's Benito Juárez International Airport after another aircraft landed on the same runway. The pilots of Delta flight 590 applied the brakes as the plane reached approximately 71 miles per hour, narrowly avoiding a potential disaster with the landing Aeromexico jet. The Delta plane, carrying 144 passengers and six crew members, returned to the gate and later departed safely for Atlanta. Delta is cooperating with U.S. and Mexican authorities who are now investigating the serious runway incursion incident.</p>

          <p>Lynsi Snyder, the billionaire CEO of In-N-Out Burger, has clarified that the company's corporate headquarters will not be relocating to Tennessee, despite her personal family move to the state. Following speculation, Snyder affirmed the popular burger chain's commitment to its California roots, stating that a new office in Tennessee is for regional expansion, not a full relocation. The company plans to close its Irvine headquarters by 2029 but will base its main operations in Baldwin Park, its original home. This announcement addresses criticism that the company was abandoning the state that fostered its success.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its decision to withdraw the United States from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for a second time. The U.S. State Department cited the agency's alleged support for "woke, divisive cultural and social causes" and a "globalist, ideological agenda" as reasons for the departure, which is set to take effect in December 2026. UNESCO's Director-General Audrey Azoulay called the decision "regrettable," defending the organization's work in areas like Holocaust education. This move follows a previous withdrawal under Trump in 2017, which was later reversed by the Biden administration.</p>

          <p>Players for the England women's national football team stood arm-in-arm before their Euro 2025 semi-final match in a powerful show of solidarity with teammate Jess Carter. The gesture came after Carter revealed she had been subjected to racist abuse online throughout the tournament, which also prompted the team to stop its prior practice of taking the knee. During the match, sections of the crowd also applauded in the 16th minute, corresponding to Carter's jersey number. The team's actions highlight the ongoing issue of racism in football and their collective decision to find new ways to confront it.</p>

          <p>All-rounder Liam Dawson is set to make his return to England's Test cricket team for the first time in eight years, replacing the injured Shoaib Bashir for the fourth Test against India. The 35-year-old's selection marks a significant comeback, as he had previously believed his international career was over. Dawson, a left-arm spinner and capable batsman, offers a different style of play compared to the younger Bashir and strengthens England's batting lineup. His recall is a reward for consistent high-level performance in domestic cricket and comes at a crucial moment in the series against India.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's convicted accomplice, is back in the spotlight as the Justice Department has scheduled a meeting with her, and a House committee has moved to subpoena her testimony.

Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking. The developments have fueled bipartisan suspicion about the DOJ's motives, with speculation that a cooperation deal could be in the works.</p>

He acknowledged this view is contrary to the Wall Street consensus, which prefers Powell to complete his term.

          <p>President Trump has indicated that he will not attempt to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, stating that Powell will be "out pretty soon anyway." Powell's term as chair is set to end in May of the following year. The comment follows weeks of relentless attacks by the president, who has criticized Powell for not cutting interest rates more aggressively. While signaling he would wait for the term to expire, Trump continued his criticism, calling Powell "too late all the time." This appears to de-escalate the immediate threat of a leadership crisis at the independent central bank.</p>

Merics, one of Europe's largest China-focused research centers, expressed hope that this signals an easing of travel restrictions that have prevented its researchers from visiting the country.

According to a report from FilmLA, a significant drop in the production of feature films and commercials drove the decrease. However, the television sector provided a bright spot, with TV production increasing by 17%, fueled by gains in dramas and reality TV. Despite the television rebound, the total number of shoot days remains well below the region's five-year average, indicating a continued challenging environment for Hollywood production.</p>
