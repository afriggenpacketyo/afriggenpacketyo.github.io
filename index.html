          <p>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has been diagnosed with an early form of skin cancer following the removal and testing of two skin lesions. The diagnosis was announced after he was discharged from a hospital where he was being treated for unrelated issues. Bolsonaro is currently under house arrest after being convicted for plotting a coup to overthrow the current government after his 2022 election defeat, for which he was sentenced to 27 years in prison. His doctors stated he will require regular monitoring to ensure the cancer was completely removed and no new lesions appear.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced its experimental oral drug for Type 2 diabetes, orforglipron, outperformed Novo Nordisk's approved pill, Rybelsus, in a late-stage clinical trial. The study showed Eli Lilly's pill was more effective at lowering blood sugar levels and promoting weight loss over a 52-week period. This development intensifies the competition between the two pharmaceutical giants for dominance in the lucrative GLP-1 drug market, which is rapidly expanding with demand for more convenient, needle-free treatment options. Eli Lilly plans to seek regulatory approval for orforglipron in 2026, aiming to capture a significant share of the growing oral medication space.</p>

          <p>Thousands of demonstrators participated in a large-scale protest in London against U.S. President Donald Trump's second state visit to the United Kingdom. Organized by the Stop Trump Coalition, the march featured protesters with signs condemning racism and Trump's politics, moving from central London toward Whitehall. The demonstration included a variety of groups, from climate campaigners to anti-racism organizations, who aimed to send a clear message that the president was not welcome. Speakers at a rally in Parliament Square included former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and comedian Nish Kumar, highlighting widespread opposition to the visit among certain segments of the British public.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama addressed the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, stating that while political violence is not new in U.S. history, it is antithetical to a democratic society. Speaking in Pennsylvania, Obama criticized President Trump's response, arguing that it sought to identify an enemy and deepen divisions rather than unite the country in a moment of tragedy. He contrasted this with his own approach after the 2015 Charleston church shooting and warned that the current administration's rhetoric and actions are eroding democratic norms. The White House responded by calling Obama the "architect of modern political division," escalating the political fallout from the killing.</p>

          <p>Dr. Susan Monarez, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), testified before a Senate committee that she was fired for refusing to comply with demands from Health Secretary Robert F.

Monarez claimed that when she refused, Kennedy told her to resign, stating he was in frequent communication with President Trump about changing U.S. vaccine policy. Her testimony highlights the intense political pressure and turmoil within federal health agencies under the current administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino asserted that despite public perception of rising costs, concert tickets are still relatively underpriced when compared to major sporting events. Speaking at a conference, Rapino highlighted the immense demand for live music post-pandemic, driven by a cultural shift where experiences are highly valued. He explained that touring is now the primary revenue source for artists, with elaborate productions costing millions, likening a Beyoncé tour to staging a Super Bowl every night. Rapino noted the average concert ticket price is $72, significantly less than premium seats at professional sports games, suggesting there is still room for price growth in the live music industry.</p>

The updated test, first introduced in 2020 but scrapped by the Biden administration, will have 128 potential questions, and applicants must correctly answer 12 out of 20. This is an increase from the 2008 version, which had 100 questions and required 6 correct answers out of 10. This policy change is part of a broader effort to tighten legal immigration processes, which also includes expanded background checks and scrutiny of applicants' "good moral character."</p>

This initiative comes as the U.S. imposes heavy tariffs on India for purchasing Russian fuel, but the EU is opting for a collaborative approach rather than a punitive one. The new strategy emphasizes India's role as a reliable partner, a counterweight to China, and a key player in diversifying global supply chains. The plan also includes fostering defense industry cooperation, viewing India as a major market for European arms manufacturers as it seeks to modernize its military.</p>

This poses a road hazard for other drivers and increases the risk of a crash. Chrysler has reported over 400 warranty claims related to the issue but no accidents or injuries.

          <p>England secured a four-wicket victory against Ireland in the first match of their three-game T20 series, largely thanks to a powerful performance by opener Phil Salt. Salt scored 89 runs off just 46 balls, setting a strong foundation for England's chase of Ireland's 196-run total. Despite Ireland posting a competitive score with half-centuries from Harry Tector and Lorcan Tucker, England's aggressive start allowed them to reach the target with more than two overs to spare. The match marked Jacob Bethell's debut as England's captain and was England's first T20 win over Ireland in their second completed match against each other.</p>

          <p>The reliability of official U.S. government economic statistics, such as jobs and inflation data, is increasingly being questioned due to systemic issues within data-gathering agencies. A significant drop in response rates for crucial surveys, like the Current Population Survey, is skewing results and making it harder to get an accurate picture of the economy. This problem is compounded by chronic underfunding of statistical agencies and long delays in data release, which can hinder effective policymaking. While a wealth of real-time private-sector data exists, the government has been slow to integrate these alternative sources to supplement its traditional, and increasingly creaky, methods.</p>

Key drivers discussed include the prospect of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, which can make non-yielding assets like gold more attractive to investors. Additionally, rising inflation and general market uncertainty are cited as reasons why investors may increasingly turn to gold as a traditional safe-haven asset. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, making it the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Currently, forecasters expect the storm to remain over open water and pose no immediate threat to land. However, the system is projected to strengthen as it moves northwest, potentially developing into a low-grade hurricane by the weekend. While its current track keeps it north of the Caribbean, Bermuda could be in its path next week as it continues to intensify. The formation of Gabrielle comes about a week after the historical peak of the Atlantic hurricane season.</p>

          <p>Commissioners from the Big East, ACC, and Big 12 conferences are navigating a new financial landscape in college sports, shaped by direct payments to athletes and revenue-sharing models. Speaking at a conference, the leaders discussed the sustainability of rising expenses and the search for new revenue streams to offset the costs of paying players. The potential for private equity investment is being explored by all three conferences, though they are proceeding cautiously. The commissioners also addressed the complexities of allocating revenue between different sports and the ongoing debate over how television money should be distributed in this evolving, more professionalized era of collegiate athletics.</p>

The decision was driven by a strong desire from the players to compete for their home countries on the world's biggest stage. A new agreement with the International Olympic Committee addresses previous concerns by improving commercial arrangements and player accommodations, making the return a more balanced proposition for the league.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The IRS is anticipated to adjust federal income tax brackets for 2026 to account for inflation, a move that could result in lower tax bills for many American households. Analysts project an inflation adjustment of around 2.7%, which would raise the income thresholds for each tax bracket, preventing "bracket creep" where cost-of-living pay increases push workers into higher tax rates. Additionally, the bottom two brackets are expected to see a larger adjustment of about 4% due to a new tax law. These annual adjustments also apply to other tax items like the standard deduction, ensuring their value keeps pace with inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

McEntarfer was dismissed after the BLS revised job growth figures downward, which Trump claimed without evidence was an attempt to make him look bad.

The reforms will also increase the jury majority required for a guilty verdict from a simple majority to two-thirds. Additional measures include the creation of a specialized sexual offenses court, a new victims and witnesses commissioner, and permanent free access to court transcripts for victims of sexual assault and serious sexual offenses.</p>

His comments were a direct response to Kirby, who predicted the demise of Spirit Airlines and dismissed the viability of deep discounters.
