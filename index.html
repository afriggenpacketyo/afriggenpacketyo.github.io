          <h2>UK Nurses Poised for Strike Action After Rejecting Pay Increase</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 21:59:47 EDT</div>

          <p>The Royal College of Nursing in England is expected to overwhelmingly reject a 3.6% pay award, which the union has labeled "grotesque." This sets the stage for a potential formal strike ballot in the autumn if the government does not enter into negotiations over the summer. The GMB union, representing other health workers, has also rejected the deal, highlighting widespread dissatisfaction within the NHS. The situation is further complicated by an ongoing five-day strike by resident doctors over their own pay dispute.</p>

          <p>Top medical groups, including the American Medical Association, are voicing deep concern over reports that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. may dismiss the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. This independent panel of experts has provided trusted, evidence-based guidelines for preventive care like cancer screenings and disease management since 1984. The potential move follows Kennedy's recent replacement of a CDC vaccine advisory committee, raising fears of political interference that could erode trust in crucial public health recommendations.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics has announced a major long-term contract worth $16.5 billion to supply semiconductors to an unnamed company. The deal, which runs until the end of 2033, has boosted Samsung's share price by over 2%. The company is keeping the counterparty's identity confidential at their request to protect trade secrets. This significant contract comes as Samsung's foundry service, the world's second-largest, has been facing weak orders and struggling to compete in the market for advanced AI chips.</p>

          <p>The RSPCA is calling for mandatory licensing of all dog rescue organizations in the UK amid growing concerns over imported pets. Thousands of dogs, many from Eastern Europe, are brought into the country with minimal vetting, leading to issues with aggressive behavior and the spread of infectious diseases like Brucella canis. Experts describe the situation as a "ticking time bomb" and a "Deliveroo for dogs," putting pressure on UK-based shelters that must deal with the fallout from poorly matched and unscreened animals.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has begun a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in fighting in three areas of Gaza to allow aid agencies to address a severe hunger crisis. The move is intended to create secure land routes for the United Nations and other groups to deliver humanitarian supplies. While the UN's food agency welcomed the step, it reiterated that a broader ceasefire is necessary to reach everyone in need. The pause comes as food experts have been warning of famine and global criticism of Israel's aid restrictions has mounted.</p>

          <p>Google has admitted its Android Earthquake Alerts system failed to perform as expected during the catastrophic 2023 earthquake in Turkey, which killed over 55,000 people. The system severely underestimated the quake's magnitude, sending only 469 high-level "Take Action" alarms when ten million people were in the zone that should have received one. Most users received a lower-level "Be Aware" warning not designed to wake people up. Google has since updated its algorithm after researchers detailed the system's limitations in a scientific journal.</p>

          <p>Tom Lehrer, the influential and sharply witty musical satirist, has died at the age of 97. Famous in the 1950s and '60s for his piano-led songs that cleverly targeted politics, nuclear war, and social mores, Lehrer largely retired from public performance in the 1970s to focus on a career teaching mathematics. His work, known for its subversive intelligence and ahead-of-its-time commentary on topics like pollution, left a lasting impact on generations of comedy songwriters and satirists.</p>

          <p>Police officers who were first on the scene of the deadly 2024 stabbing attack in Southport have described confronting the killer.

They came face-to-face with the blood-stained 17-year-old perpetrator, who was holding a knife. The officers, recognized for their bravery, reflected on the profound and lasting impact of the horrific event that claimed the lives of three young girls.</p>

Archaeologists say the findings, which include brick structures and Tamil Brahmi script dating to 580 BCE, challenge the narrative that civilization and literacy spread from northern to southern India. The discoveries have become a symbol of Tamil pride and identity, fueling a deep-rooted cultural and political divide between India's north and south, with accusations that the federal government is suppressing the findings.</p>

Decker, who has extensive military survival training, disappeared after failing to return the children to their mother. A warrant for his arrest on murder and kidnapping charges remains active, and it is unknown if he is still alive.</p>

          <p>Argentina's new government under President Javier Milei has initiated mass layoffs at human rights organizations and government agencies dedicated to investigating the country's former military dictatorship. Key institutions, such as the National Archive of Remembrance and the Human Rights Secretariat, have seen their staff cut by roughly half. The austerity measures threaten the work of groups like the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, who search for children stolen during the dictatorship, and undermine the decades-long process of seeking truth and justice for the regime's victims.</p>

Oliver, now a U.S. citizen, explains that he criticizes his adopted homeland not out of disdain, but out of a desire to see it improve, using humor as a tool to illuminate entrenched issues.</p>

An Italian photographer and an Argentine journalist, herself a survivor of a detention camp, tracked the plane to the United States. They used its flight logs as crucial evidence to prove the fate of 12 disappeared activists and to secure life sentences for the pilots, bringing the plane back to Argentina as an irrefutable witness to the regime's crimes.</p>

          <p>Despite reporting a "beat and raise" quarter, Honeywell's stock experienced a significant drop, a situation that has frustrated some market observers. The conglomerate is in the process of a multi-year plan to split into three separate companies, a period which can create investor impatience and uncertainty, known as "spin purgatory." The analysis suggests the sell-off was an overreaction, possibly due to the complexity of the company's structure and a lack of significant exposure to the currently popular data center sector.
