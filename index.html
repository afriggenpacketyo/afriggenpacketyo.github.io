        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Navin Khanna of New Jersey has pleaded guilty to leading a sophisticated criminal enterprise that stole catalytic converters across multiple states. The ring generated over $600 million by selling the stolen parts to a metal refinery, which extracted valuable precious metals like platinum and palladium. This plea is a major development in a case that came to light after a routine traffic stop in Oklahoma uncovered a truck filled with the stolen devices. Khanna now faces a potential prison sentence of up to 17.5 years for his role in the nationwide scheme.</p>

          <p>Six months after devastating wildfires swept through Los Angeles, the remains of another victim have been discovered in Altadena, bringing the total death toll to 31. The discovery was made west of North Lake Avenue, an area where residents did not receive evacuation alerts before the firestorm arrived. The Palisades and Eaton fires were among California's deadliest, destroying over 16,000 structures, primarily homes. Officials are now working to identify the victim, a complex process that relies on dental records, DNA, and other forensic methods.</p>

          <p>Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of "South Park," have finalized two major deals with Paramount Global valued at a minimum of $2 billion over five years. One agreement gives Paramount's streaming service, Paramount+, exclusive global rights to the show for $300 million annually. A separate production deal extends their contract through 2030, guaranteeing their company at least $250 million per year to produce new episodes. The negotiations were complex, involving a temporary pause by Paramount's prospective buyer, Skydance Media, but ultimately secured one of the most lucrative deals in television history.</p>

          <p>Following Bryan Kohberger's guilty plea for the murders of four University of Idaho students, prosecutors are requesting that a judge extend his no-contact order with the victims' families for 99 years. The current order is set to expire in 2027, and the motion aims to protect the families long after Kohberger's sentencing. Kohberger pleaded guilty to the November 2022 home invasion stabbings to avoid a potential death penalty. He is expected to receive four consecutive life sentences without parole, and the victims' families will have the opportunity to deliver impact statements at his sentencing.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos held a private meeting at the White House last week that lasted for over an hour. While the specific topics of discussion were not disclosed, the meeting signals a warming relationship between the two, who were often at odds during Trump's first term. In recent months, Bezos has reportedly sought to improve ties with the administration, especially as his company Blue Origin competes with Elon Musk's SpaceX for government contracts. This meeting occurs amid a notable falling out between Trump and Musk, creating a potential opening for Bezos to gain influence.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its decision to withdraw the United States from UNESCO, the United Nations' cultural and educational agency, for the second time. The State Department cited the organization's promotion of "divisive social and cultural causes" and a "globalist, ideological agenda" as reasons for the departure, which will take effect at the end of 2026. The administration also reiterated its objection to UNESCO's 2011 admission of Palestine as a member state.

          <p>First amendment and rights groups are alleging that Mario Guevara, a Salvadoran journalist, is being detained by ICE as a form of punishment for his work. Guevara, known for his coverage of immigration issues for a Spanish-speaking audience, was arrested while livestreaming a protest in Georgia. Although the initial charges were dropped, he remains in an immigration detention center. His attorneys and supporters argue that his continued detention is a direct retaliation for his journalism, making him the only journalist currently imprisoned in the U.S. for their reporting.</p>

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick defended the move, arguing it is strategic to sell lower-tier technology to keep Chinese developers dependent on the American tech ecosystem.
