          <p>Lawyers for music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs have urged a New York federal judge to impose a sentence of no more than 14 months for his two prostitution-related convictions. The defense emphasized Combs's exoneration on more severe racketeering and sex trafficking charges, arguing the jury's verdict signals an "affirmative indication of innocence" on the most serious allegations. However, prosecutors plan to recommend a significantly longer prison term, following a trial that included testimonies from former girlfriends detailing forced participation in sex acts and domestic abuse.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has mandated the Trump administration to restore $500 million in frozen UCLA medical research grants, effectively halting a significant funding crisis for the University of California system. The article explains that the grants were suspended through "un-reasoned mass terminations," which the judge deemed a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. This ruling offers crucial relief to UC campuses, which had faced the prospect of layoffs and lab closures, stemming from the administration's claims of campus antisemitism, race-based admissions, and recognition of transgender identities.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of pigs have been released into England's New Forest for the traditional "pannage" season, an ancient practice crucial for ecological stewardship. The article explains that these pigs act as "nature's cleanup crew," grazing on acorns, chestnuts, and beech mast, which are toxic to other free-roaming livestock like ponies and cattle. This centuries-old tradition helps maintain the forest's ecosystem, but officials remind visitors to keep a safe distance and drive cautiously to prevent incidents with the foraging animals.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced that the FDA would advise pregnant women to limit Tylenol use, citing a potential link to autism, a recommendation that contradicts established medical guidance. President Trump personally urged women to "Don't take Tylenol" unless absolutely necessary, admitting his advice stemmed from "common sense" rather than scientific consensus. Medical organizations strongly condemned the announcement as irresponsible, warning of potential harm and confusion. However, the official FDA note was more nuanced, stating that while an association is debated, a causal relationship between Tylenol and autism has not been definitively established.</p>
