          <p>President Trump's decision to remove a close associate of Elon Musk from consideration to lead NASA significantly contributed to the dissolution of their alliance. The partnership, once promising, deteriorated as Trump's actions undermined Musk's influence and priorities within the administration. This shift highlights the challenges of maintaining alliances when political interests diverge, especially when dealing with individuals who have strong and differing opinions. The breakdown reveals the complexities of power dynamics in Washington and the potential consequences of decisions that impact key relationships. Optimism regarding future collaborations between the two figures appears low given the circumstances.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has granted a partial stay, allowing the Trump White House to restrict the Associated Press' access to spaces like the Oval Office. The court argued these areas aren't public forums and the White House can decide which journalists are admitted. The AP sued after being denied access due to a dispute over the AP Stylebook's usage of 'Gulf of Mexico' instead of 'Gulf of America.' White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the AP isn't guaranteed special access and the administration will expand access to new media. This decision underscores the ongoing tensions between the administration and legacy media outlets.</p>

His identity was confirmed through fingerprint analysis, and authorities have assured the public that there is no longer an active threat.

          <p>Chicago police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of Officer Krystal Rivera, who was shot while conducting an investigatory stop. Rivera, part of a tactical team, pursued a suspect into an apartment where she was confronted by a second individual with a rifle. During the incident, a weapon was discharged, and Rivera was struck by gunfire; she later died at the hospital after the transport vehicle caught fire and she needed to be transferred. Three weapons were recovered from the scene, and several individuals are in custody, with the investigation ongoing to determine who fired the fatal shot. The Cook County Medical Examiner's office determined Rivera was shot in the back.</p>

          <p>President Trump has options to penalize Elon Musk even if terminating federal contracts is unfeasible due to the Pentagon and NASA's reliance on Musk's companies. The president could increase federal oversight of Musk's businesses, potentially impacting their operations and profitability. This move comes amid a growing feud between the two figures, raising concerns about the intersection of politics and business.

          <p>Elon Musk's public dispute with President Donald Trump has raised concerns about the potential impact on his businesses, particularly Tesla. Tesla shares experienced a significant drop following Musk's criticism of Trump on social media. While some analysts believe Tesla's problems run deeper than this feud, others suggest Musk's divided attention could hinder projects like the autonomous robo-taxi launch in Austin. The #TeslaTakedown protests and Musk's political stances have already negatively impacted Tesla's sales, and the feud with Trump could further damage the company's reputation. The article explores whether this fallout will help or harm his businesses.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's restrictive immigration policies, including travel bans and increased scrutiny of foreign nationals, are creating a perception of the United States as a 'fortress.' These policies are deterring tourists and impacting international relations, with reports of foreign visitors facing detentions and deportations. The World Travel & Tourism Council forecasts a significant decline in tourist spending in the U.S., contrasting with growth in other countries. The administration's approach, influenced by figures like Vice President J.D. Vance and Stephen Miller, extends beyond illegal immigration to limiting legal immigration, reflecting a broader xenophobic agenda. The implications extend to discouraging even Americans from traveling abroad.</p>

Inspection reports reveal some farms repeatedly ignored health advice, allowing children to handle sick animals in unsanitary conditions. The organizers of Open Farm Sunday maintain high health and safety standards, but concerns remain about the potential for infection.

          <p>Welsh rarebit, a beloved Welsh dish of cheese sauce on toast, has varied origin stories, some suggesting it began as an English joke. While some believe it was a substitute for rabbit meat for poor farmers, others think English pubs mocked the Welsh for not affording real rabbit. Food historians associate it with Welsh culture, cheese being vital in European diets, especially in Wales, where dairy thrived. The dish evolved from melted cheese in Wales, brought to English cities after the 1536 Act of Union, and the name 'Welsh rarebit' appeared later in English cookbooks, but there's no evidence linking it to actual rabbits.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Russian truck drivers were unaware of their role in transporting drones used in a large-scale attack on Russian warplanes. The drones were hidden in 'mobile houses' with retractable roofs, which were remotely opened to conduct the operation. Zelenskyy emphasized that Ukraine used only its own weapons in the attack, without deploying equipment from allies. Ukraine claims to have damaged over 40 Russian bombers in the attacks, significantly impacting Russia's strategic bomber fleet. This operation underscores Ukraine's ability to execute complex attacks within Russia.</p>

          <p>An executive order issued by President Trump, imposing sanctions targeting the International Criminal Court (I.C.C.), is being challenged in federal court. The lawsuit, filed by Matthew Smith, co-founder of Fortify Rights, argues that the order infringes on First Amendment rights. The order sanctions the court's chief prosecutor and prohibits providing 'services' to the prosecutor's office, impacting efforts to pursue international justice for crimes against humanity. Smith, with representation from the ACLU, argues the order hinders human rights defenders' work in documenting atrocities and seeking justice. The situation highlights the tension between national sovereignty and international justice efforts.</p>

The administration argues that DOGE needs the information to target waste and fraud in the federal government. The decision has raised concerns among privacy advocates and Democrats, who fear the data could be misused.
