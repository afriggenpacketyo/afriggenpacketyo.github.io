        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senate Republicans are urgently working to pass a pivotal budget bill before a July 4th deadline, a key component of Donald Trump's second-term agenda. The massive bill aims to extend $3.8 trillion in tax cuts by making significant reductions to welfare programs, creating deep divisions within the party. The latest 940-page version includes new concessions, such as increased funding for rural hospitals and a temporary lift on the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap, in an effort to win over holdout senators. However, its passage remains uncertain as some Republicans, like Senator Ron Johnson, have expressed opposition, citing the need for more time to review the complex legislation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following U.S. airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, conflicting reports have emerged from the Trump administration regarding the extent of the damage. While President Trump and the Defense Secretary claimed the sites were "obliterated," initial intelligence assessments from the Defense Intelligence Agency suggested the setback to Iran's program might only be a matter of months. Officials have offered evolving characterizations throughout the week, with some acknowledging the difficulty in assessing the fortified Fordo facility. This uncertainty is compounded by questions about whether Iran successfully moved enriched uranium before the attacks, creating an unclear picture of the mission's ultimate strategic success.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of demonstrators, led by university students, rallied in Belgrade to demand early parliamentary elections, issuing an ultimatum to President Aleksandar Vucic. The protests, which have been ongoing for months, were initially sparked by a deadly train station collapse blamed on government corruption and negligence. Protesters have threatened a campaign of civil disobedience if their demands for a snap vote are not met. President Vucic has rejected the calls, blaming foreign influence for the unrest, while his supporters held a counter-rally, highlighting the deep political divisions within the country.</p>

          <p>The long-standing mystery of Glastonbury's secret act, billed as "Patchwork," was solved when the iconic Britpop band Pulp took to the Pyramid Stage. Despite the band's attempts to maintain secrecy, the performance was a widely anticipated highlight, marking the 30th anniversary of their historic 1995 headline set at the festival. Lead singer Jarvis Cocker led the band through classic hits like "Common People" and new material, delighting a massive crowd that included festival organizer Emily Eavis. The triumphant and nostalgic set was a celebratory moment, reaffirming the band's cherished status in British music history.</p>

          <p>The Belfast-based Irish-language rap group Kneecap drew a massive crowd for a highly controversial and politically charged performance at the Glastonbury Festival. The set came after UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer deemed their appearance inappropriate, following a terrorism charge against one member for allegedly displaying a Hezbollah flag. On stage, the band addressed the charge, voiced strong support for Palestine, and led the audience in chants against the prime minister. The performance highlighted the festival's role as a platform for contentious political expression, with organizers defending their decision to keep the band on the bill despite the political pressure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an interview, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi stated that U.S. strikes caused a "very serious level of damage" to Iran's nuclear facilities. However, he emphasized that the full extent is unknown and that some capabilities likely remain intact. Grossi expressed significant concern over the location of nearly 900 pounds of highly enriched uranium, which he presumes was moved by Iran before the attack, and stressed the urgent need for IAEA inspectors to regain access to the sites. He concluded that despite the military action, a long-term diplomatic solution and a robust inspection system are the only ways to provide lasting security assurances.</p>

Other incidents include the arrest of a Marine veteran's father and the detention of another Marine's wife.

          <p>Recent anti-government protests in Kenya have resulted in at least 19 deaths and 500 injuries, with police reportedly using live ammunition on demonstrators. The government's harsh response has been accompanied by an attempt to suppress media freedom, with the Communications Authority issuing an order to ban live coverage of the protests, a move that was swiftly revoked by judges. Journalists report being targeted by security forces despite being clearly identifiable as press. This crackdown on both protesters and the media has intensified concerns about the state of democracy and freedom of expression in the country.</p>

In response, some Democrats have defended Mamdani against what they describe as Islamophobic and racist attacks from certain Republican figures.

Demonstrators marched against over-tourism and the environmental impact of the wealthy elite, hanging a "no space for Bezos" banner from the Rialto bridge. City officials defended the wedding as "high-quality tourism," but for many locals, it symbolized the transformation of Venice into a playground for the rich, exacerbating issues of affordability and displacement.</p>

Mandhana's explosive innings of 112 from 62 balls propelled India to a formidable total of 210-5, the second-highest score ever conceded by England in the format. England's chase faltered early, and they were ultimately bowled out for 113, with captain Nat Sciver-Brunt providing the only significant resistance. The decisive win gives India a strong start in the five-match series and highlights areas for improvement for the English side.</p>

          <p>Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has strongly condemned the newly expanded 32-team FIFA Club World Cup, labeling it "the worst idea ever implemented in football." Now serving as Red Bull's head of global soccer, Klopp voiced serious fears about player welfare, citing the intense fixture congestion and lack of adequate recovery time for athletes. He warned that the relentless schedule, which includes major international tournaments year after year, will lead to unprecedented injuries and ultimately devalue the sport. His comments echo concerns from players' union Fifpro, which has also taken legal action against FIFA over the tournament.</p>

          <p>In a powerful act of defiance, tens of thousands of people marched in the Budapest Pride parade, despite a government ban and legal threats from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's administration. Organizers estimated a record turnout, with crowds celebrating LGBTQ+ rights and protesting the government's increasing repression of civil liberties. The event proceeded after Budapest's mayor declared it a municipal event, a move intended to bypass the ban. Supported by numerous EU officials and foreign embassies, the march symbolized a growing resistance to Orban's nationalist government ahead of next year's elections.</p>

By smuggling and launching drones from close range, Ukraine successfully destroyed or damaged numerous strategic bombers, challenging the long-held military doctrine that rear areas are safe havens. This low-cost, high-impact strategy demonstrates how a smaller military can effectively counter a larger nation's airpower by targeting vulnerable aircraft on the ground.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has sharply criticized a proposal by Reform UK leader Nigel Farage regarding the Port Talbot steelworks in Wales. Starmer claimed that Farage's plan to reopen a blast furnace is ill-conceived and would lead to the cancellation of 5,000 jobs. These jobs are associated with the planned construction of a new electric arc furnace, which is set to begin in a few weeks. The Prime Minister accused Farage of not understanding the issue and using it for political gain, highlighting the deep political divisions over the future of the UK steel industry.</p>
