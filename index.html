          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly confirmed that music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs requested a presidential pardon following his recent conviction. Combs was sentenced to just over four years in federal prison on charges related to transportation for prostitution. While Trump acknowledged the request, referring to the rapper by his old moniker "Puff Daddy," he did not indicate whether he would grant it, stating he would first need to review the facts of the case. The development follows speculation that Combs' legal team would pursue a pardon as a primary avenue for his release from prison.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The World Trade Organization has revised its forecast for global trade volume growth in 2025, increasing it to 2.4% from a previous estimate of 0.9%. This upward revision is attributed to factors like strong U.S. import demand ahead of tariff hikes and a surge in trade for AI-related goods. However, the WTO significantly lowered its growth projection for 2026 to just 0.5%, citing the cooling global economy and the delayed full impact of trade tariffs. The organization warns that trade-restrictive measures remain a key downside risk to the global economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 12:46:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has outlined a compensation plan for millions of drivers affected by the car finance mis-selling scandal. The regulator estimates that the average payout could be around £700 per person for approximately 14 million agreements made between 2007 and 2024. The issue stems from unfair commission arrangements, where dealers were incentivized to charge customers higher interest rates, leading to overpayment. If approved, the scheme would see lenders contact affected customers to process the compensation, with total payouts potentially reaching £8.2 billion.</p>

          <h2>September Shipping Data Indicates Potential Freight Recession Despite Typical Holiday Boom</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 12:45:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to its usual status as a peak month for holiday shipping, September's freight activity has shown signs of a potential recession, according to the latest Logistics Managers' Index (LMI). The index recorded its lowest-ever reading for transportation utilization in September, suggesting a significant slowdown in the movement of goods from warehouses. Experts attribute this to businesses front-loading inventory earlier in the year to get ahead of tariffs, which has led to full warehouses and reduced demand for immediate transport. This trend, if it continues, could signal a broader downturn in the logistics sector. (not investment advice)</p>

According to internal documents cited in the report, Oracle's gross margin on this segment was only 14%, a stark contrast to its overall company margin of around 70%. This has raised concerns about the long-term profitability of Oracle's strategy to invest billions in expensive Nvidia chips to rent out for AI applications.

          <p>Orlando Bravo, a prominent tech investor and co-founder of Thoma Bravo, has stated that valuations for artificial intelligence companies are currently "at a bubble," drawing parallels to the dot-com era. Speaking to CNBC, Bravo cautioned against valuing young companies with modest revenues at billions of dollars, calling it a "tall order" managerially to generate the necessary returns. However, he noted a key difference from the late 1990s is that today's AI boom is financed by large, established companies with healthy balance sheets. His firm continues to see AI as an exciting tailwind for the software industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's cricket team narrowly avoided an upset against Bangladesh in the Women's World Cup, securing a four-wicket victory thanks to an unbeaten 79 from captain Heather Knight. Chasing a modest target of 179, England's batting lineup struggled against spin, collapsing to 103-6 at one point and creating a tense situation. However, a resilient partnership between Knight and Charlie Dean guided the team to victory in the 47th over. The unconvincing win maintains England's perfect start to the tournament but highlights potential vulnerabilities as they prepare for their next match against Sri Lanka.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is set to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House to discuss the ongoing trade war between the two nations. The meeting follows President Trump's imposition of a 35% tariff on most Canadian goods in July, a move that prompted retaliatory measures from Canada. Although Canada later created exemptions for goods covered by the USMCA trade pact, significant tensions remain. During their previous meeting, Carney firmly rejected a proposal from Trump about Canada potentially becoming the 51st U.S. state, underscoring the strained diplomatic relationship.</p>

          <p>An analysis explores the complex factors contributing to the United States having the highest prescription drug prices in the world, a topic recently highlighted by President Trump's policy proposals. Unlike many other developed nations with national health systems that negotiate prices for their entire populations, the U.S. has a fragmented system of private and public insurers, which weakens its bargaining power. Additionally, the U.S. prioritizes broad access to all available drugs, making it difficult to refuse coverage for a medication based on cost-effectiveness. These structural issues make it challenging for political promises to translate into meaningful price reductions for the average American.</p>

Badenoch defended a colleague's controversial remarks about a lack of integration in Birmingham, asserting that politicians should not be afraid to address these issues for fear of being labeled racist. She emphasized the need for immigrants to understand and adopt British values to maintain a cohesive society.</p>

The venue is split between a dining room and a hi-fi listening lounge where Brock and other DJs play records.

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is confronting a severe political crisis as his third prime minister in a year resigned after just 26 days, and opinion polls show nearly three-quarters of voters want Macron himself to step down. The turmoil stems from the government's inability to form a stable majority in a hung parliament to address France's massive national debt. Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu's departure highlights the deep ideological divisions preventing the formation of a coalition government. With political factions focused on the 2027 presidential election, Macron is running out of options to stabilize an increasingly ungovernable country.</p>

At 40 years old and entering his 23rd NBA season, James's future remains a topic of intense interest, but for now, he continues to play while expanding his significant off-court business ventures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to author Morgan Housel, true happiness is more dependent on contentment than on accumulating wealth. In his work, he outlines principles for a happier life, emphasizing the importance of appreciating the ordinary and recognizing that contentment is the state where nothing feels missing. He argues that the happiest people are not the richest, but those who are satisfied with what they have, as their low expectations create immense psychological wealth. A key insight is that happiness is ultimately the gap between one's expectations and circumstances, making contentment a more valuable asset than money.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has heard oral arguments in a case concerning Colorado's law banning "conversion therapy" for minors. The challenge was brought by a Christian counselor who argues the ban violates her free speech rights by preventing her from having certain conversations with young clients about gender identity and sexual orientation. Colorado defends the law as a regulation of professional conduct designed to protect minors from a harmful and ineffective practice. The justices grappled with whether the law unconstitutionally discriminates based on viewpoint and whether it regulates speech or professional conduct, a key distinction in the case.</p>
