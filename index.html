          <p>The father of Fletcher Merkel, an 8-year-old boy killed in the Annunciation Catholic School shooting, released a poignant statement. He described his son as a loving boy who enjoyed family, fishing, and sports, and lamented the loss of watching him grow up. He expressed gratitude for the heroic actions of others inside the church that prevented further tragedy and asked for empathy, not sympathy, for his grieving family and community. He urged other parents to cherish their children and remember Fletcher for the person he was, not the violent act that took his life.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has denied Saudi Arabia's motion to dismiss a long-running lawsuit filed by the families of 9/11 victims. The ruling allows the families to proceed with their case, which alleges that the Saudi government provided material support to some of the hijackers. The lawsuit, strengthened by the 2016 Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, focuses on alleged connections between Saudi officials and two of the hijackers who settled in California before the attacks. The judge found that the plaintiffs provided reasonable evidence of these connections, overcoming the kingdom's claims of coincidence and innocent assistance.</p>

          <p>Public media stations in rural America are warning that tens of millions of dollars in federal funding for the Next Generation Warning System grant program are in jeopardy. This program was designed to help broadcasters in rural and tribal areas upgrade critical emergency alert equipment, which is often the only source of information during disasters. Following the defunding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which administered the grants, and alleged reimbursement delays from FEMA, many stations have been forced to halt projects. This leaves communities vulnerable with aging infrastructure as they face increasing threats from extreme weather events.</p>

The parliament's chief executive informed members of the decision to deactivate his pass, and support services have been offered to staff who may be distressed by the allegations.</p>

          <p>The Dallas Cowboys have traded three-time All-Pro linebacker Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers in a major move that alters the competitive balance in the NFC. As part of the deal, Parsons has agreed to a four-year, $188 million contract extension with the Packers, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. The trade follows a period of growing tension between Parsons and the Cowboys, during which he had not fully practiced and had formally requested a trade. The acquisition provides a significant boost to the Packers' defense.</p>

          <p>Shares of Gap Inc. fell after the apparel retailer reported second-quarter sales that slightly missed Wall Street expectations and warned of increased costs from tariffs. The company now anticipates tariffs will impact profits by $150 million to $175 million, leading to a lower full-year operating margin forecast. While the Gap and Banana Republic brands saw comparable sales growth, the company's Athleta brand continued to struggle with a 9% decline in comps. CEO Richard Dickson acknowledged Athleta's disappointing performance, stating the brand is in a "year of reset" to refocus on its core customer. (not investment advice)</p>

The unprecedented move by Trump to fire Cook was based on allegations of mortgage fraud, which her lawsuit describes as a "nakedly pretextual" justification. The suit argues that the president can only remove a Fed governor "for cause," a standard these allegations do not meet, and that the attempt undermines the Federal Reserve's independence. A federal judge has scheduled an emergency hearing to consider Cook's request for a temporary restraining order against the termination.</p>

          <p>South Carolina officials have filed an emergency request with the U.S. Supreme Court, asking to be allowed to fully enforce a state policy that restricts transgender students from using bathrooms that align with their gender identity. The policy ties a portion of state education funding to compliance with this rule. The state's appeal comes after a federal appeals court blocked the enforcement of the policy against a specific transgender high school student who had challenged the law. State officials argue the policy reflects the will of the legislature and is necessary to protect student privacy, asking the high court to intervene while the case is litigated.</p>

          <p>Average interest rates for home equity loans have dropped to their lowest level in 2025, reaching 8.22% and making them a more competitive borrowing option. With U.S. homeowners' collective equity hitting a record high of nearly $18 trillion, many have substantial funds they can tap into. These loans offer a fixed interest rate, providing protection against future market volatility compared to variable-rate HELOCs. Furthermore, the interest paid on a home equity loan may be tax-deductible if the funds are used for eligible home improvements, adding to its potential financial benefits for homeowners.

          <p>Amazon is expanding its grocery business by adding fresh and perishable items to its existing same-day delivery service for Prime members in over 1,000 cities. This move allows customers to order items like eggs and produce alongside non-perishables and other goods for a single, combined delivery. The company is leveraging and retrofitting its network of same-day fulfillment hubs with temperature-controlled environments to handle the new offerings. While the expansion aims to increase convenience and compete with traditional grocers, analysts note that initial selection may be limited and the low-margin grocery business presents operational challenges.

          <p>A North Carolina election official, James Yokeley Jr., has been arrested and has since resigned after allegedly contaminating his granddaughters' ice cream with illegal drugs. Police were alerted after Yokeley claimed the girls found pills in ice cream purchased from a Dairy Queen. However, an investigation and review of video footage allegedly showed Yokeley himself placing the pills, later identified as containing MDMA and cocaine, into the food. He has been charged with contaminating food with a controlled substance and felony child abuse, and has been released after posting a $100,000 bond.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a massive overnight missile and drone attack on Kyiv, killing at least 21 people and causing widespread damage. The strikes hit multiple civilian areas, including an office of the European Union's delegation to Ukraine and the British Council building. European leaders, including Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, strongly condemned the attack as an act of "terror and barbarism" and called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to engage in peace negotiations. The attack is one of the deadliest on the Ukrainian capital since recent diplomatic efforts, including a summit between the U.S. and Russian presidents.</p>

          <p>Nike is implementing another round of layoffs, affecting less than 1% of its corporate staff, as part of a broader business realignment under CEO Elliott Hill. The move aims to refocus the company on sports and culture by restructuring teams around specific sports categories rather than by gender or age demographics. This change undoes a previous structure and is intended to reignite the company's innovation pipeline. Affected employees are expected to be notified by early September as the company works to reverse a recent sales decline and drive new growth.</p>
