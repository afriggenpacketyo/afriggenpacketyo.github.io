          <p>Chinese quantitative hedge funds are capitalizing on funding cuts and stricter visa policies in American universities to hire top-tier PhD talent. Firms like Shanghai-based Mingshi are offering competitive, and sometimes superior, salaries compared to US counterparts to attract scientists and engineers. This brain drain is fueling the expansion of China's rapidly growing quant sector, which leverages artificial intelligence and aims to compete on a global scale. The trend highlights a significant shift in the global competition for financial and technological expertise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Voters in Taiwan are participating in a historic mass recall election targeting 24 lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party. The referendum could potentially restore a parliamentary majority for President Lai Ching-te's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which it lost in the 2024 elections. The recall effort was initiated by civic groups following accusations that the KMT, which favors closer ties with Beijing, has obstructed the government's agenda and pushed controversial parliamentary reforms. The outcome is being closely watched amid concerns over China's growing influence and interference in the island's politics.</p>

          <p>Authorities have confirmed that one of two grenades recovered from a Santa Monica garage is missing following a deadly explosion at a training facility that killed three Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies. The blast occurred when one of the grenades, mistakenly believed to be inert, detonated. An extensive search is underway for the second explosive device, which investigators believe was transported to the training facility but has not been located since the incident. The Sheriff's Department has implemented new protocols, vowing to treat all future explosive devices as live to prevent a similar tragedy.</p>

          <p>Two Democratic congressmen, Ro Khanna and Robert Garcia, have formally requested that the estate of Jeffrey Epstein provide a complete, unredacted copy of a "birthday book" compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell. The book reportedly contains messages from powerful individuals, including a crude poem allegedly from Donald Trump, celebrating Epstein's 50th birthday. The lawmakers argue the book's contents are essential for congressional oversight regarding the Trump administration's handling of the Epstein investigation. This move intensifies the political pressure surrounding the Epstein files and the late sex offender's network of associates.</p>

          <p>The parents of a deceased man have filed a lawsuit against two funeral homes for allegedly sending them their son's brain in an unmarked, leaking cardboard box. The family discovered the horrific mistake days after receiving their son's belongings when the box began to emit a foul odor and leak fluid inside their car. The lawsuit accuses the Georgia and Pennsylvania-based funeral homes of negligent mishandling of human remains and inflicting severe emotional distress. The family is seeking compensation and answers, stating they still do not know if their son, a US Marine veteran, was buried with his brain.</p>

          <p>Despite CEO Elon Musk's recent teases of expanding a robotaxi service, California regulators have clarified that Tesla is not authorized to operate autonomous passenger vehicles in the state. The California Public Utilities Commission stated that Tesla's existing permit only allows for a charter-party service with human drivers, similar to a limousine company. While Tesla has notified the state of its plans to offer a "friends and family" service in the Bay Area, it must comply with the non-autonomous vehicle rule. This development comes as the DMV separately accuses Tesla of misleading consumers about its "Full Self-Driving" capabilities.</p>

The suspension was a direct result of both players skipping the MLS All-Star game, a violation of league rules.

Prosecutors stated he used the illicitly gained funds for personal enrichment, including luxury goods and Botox treatments.

          <p>A BBC investigation has found that at least 245 18-year-old soldiers have been killed in Ukraine, despite President Putin's promises that young conscripts would not be sent to the front lines. Recent rule changes allow Russian school-leavers to sign contracts with the regular army immediately, bypassing traditional military service. Lured by significant cash bonuses and patriotic propaganda, these young men are enlisting voluntarily, often coming from poorer regions with limited job prospects.

          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has led to a significant increase in certain insect populations, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The abundance of aphids, a key food source, has particularly benefited ladybirds, while butterflies have been sighted weeks earlier than average. However, experts express concern that the prolonged dry conditions could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year by drying out wetlands and preventing eggs from being laid. This short-term boom contrasts with the long-term trend of declining flying insect populations across the UK.</p>

          <p>An Illinois federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration that challenged Chicago's sanctuary city laws. The lawsuit, filed in February, argued that the city's policies unlawfully restrict local law enforcement from sharing immigration information with federal agents. In her ruling, Judge Lindsay Jenkins sided with the city, a decision praised by Mayor Brandon Johnson, who stated that Chicago is safer when its police focus on local needs rather than federal immigration enforcement. This ruling represents a significant legal victory for cities with sanctuary policies against federal pressure to cooperate with immigration agents.</p>

The population had been decimated by 50% in the last five years due to a disease spread from non-native animals. Last fall, biologists captured dozens of healthy sheep, including pregnant ewes, from the state's last disease-free herd. The animals were airlifted over 200 miles to an isolated, disease-free mountain range. A recent follow-up revealed the relocated herd is not only surviving but growing, with newborn lambs spotted, marking a monumental success for the conservation program.</p>

          <p>Following his dismissal from the show, former MasterChef host Gregg Wallace has issued an apology to anyone he hurt, while insisting he is "not a groper, a sex pest or a flasher."

In an interview, Wallace attributed some of his comments to his background but denied more serious allegations. He also defended his former co-host John Torode, who was also sacked over a racism claim, stating Torode is "not a racist."

          <p>An analysis of the food aid boxes distributed in Gaza by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has raised concerns among nutrition experts. While the boxes, containing items like pasta, lentils, and flour, provide sufficient calories for survival, they are critically deficient in essential micronutrients like iron, calcium, and various vitamins. Experts warn that a prolonged diet of this nature could lead to "hidden hunger" and diseases like scurvy and anemia, and lacks suitable food for young children. The aid, which requires scarce water and fuel for preparation, is being distributed as the UN warns of a deepening starvation crisis.</p>

          <p>Twenty-five years after 'Big Brother' first aired, a new perspective is emerging on the impact of reality television. While often criticized as superficial, some sociologists and psychologists argue the genre can be a tool for greater social understanding. By showcasing diverse demographics and raw, unfiltered emotions, reality TV can expose viewers to different lifestyles and perspectives, potentially reducing feelings of isolation and alienation. It has also sparked national conversations on complex issues like gaslighting, racism, and disability awareness, suggesting that even constructed scenarios can prompt valuable self-reflection and societal debate.</p>
