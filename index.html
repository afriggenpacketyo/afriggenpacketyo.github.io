          <p>Newly released transcripts from Ghislaine Maxwell's two-day interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche indicate she provided no incriminating information regarding high-profile individuals associated with Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year sentence for aiding Epstein's sexual abuse of minors, denied any knowledge of a client list or blackmail scheme, and asserted that former Presidents Trump and Clinton were never involved in inappropriate activities to her knowledge. She also claimed wrongful conviction, maintaining she never recruited underage women for Epstein. The Justice Department released these redacted transcripts, which span over 300 pages, in the interest of transparency, amidst ongoing public pressure to disclose more information on Epstein's extensive network and alleged crimes.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at potential interest rate cuts during his much-anticipated Jackson Hole speech, citing "sweeping changes" in tax, trade, and immigration policies and a "shifting balance of risks" to the economy. Despite a robust labor market, Powell noted rising downside dangers, including the uncertain impact of tariffs on inflation, which could lead to a stagflation scenario. He reaffirmed the Fed's commitment to its 2% inflation target and emphasized its independence from political pressure, including President Trump's demands for aggressive cuts. Powell also acknowledged the painful lessons learned from the 2020 policy review, where the idea of an intentional inflation overshoot proved irrelevant amidst soaring prices.

          <p>King Charles and Queen Camilla are contending with a "terrible" wasp invasion at their Sandringham estate, disrupting their royal summer activities. Queen Camilla also noted issues with her own bees swarming at her private Wiltshire home, while King Charles had previously issued a formal warning to visitors about high wasp activity. This pest problem follows a reported pheasant shortage, which could impact the traditional Boxing Day shoot, a central part of the royal family’s holiday plans, and has left the King "livid." The monarch, currently battling an undisclosed form of cancer, prefers to maintain the estate's game population rather than importing birds, an eco-friendly approach that has unfortunately failed this season, adding to the challenges at the royal residence.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native who was wrongly deported in March before being brought back to the U.S., has been released from criminal custody in Tennessee and is now en route to Maryland. A federal judge had previously ordered his return to Maryland and blocked immigration authorities from detaining him upon his release, allowing him to reunite with his wife and children under specific conditions. Abrego Garcia faces human smuggling charges, which his attorneys have described as "vindictive and selective prosecution," arguing he was targeted for fighting against the administration's actions. Despite this release, his legal team maintains he is "far from safe" from potential future immigration detention or deportation, as his trial is set for January 2027.</p>

Trump acknowledged the difficulty, stating the two leaders "don't get along too well," while Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed Putin is ready for a summit only "when the agenda is ready," blaming Zelensky for inflexibility. Ukraine, backed by NATO, seeks robust security guarantees reflecting Article 5 to prevent future attacks, with Secretary General Mark Rutte indicating ongoing work on these commitments. The diplomatic efforts unfold amidst intensified Russian attacks on Ukraine and Ukrainian strikes on Russian oil infrastructure, further complicating prospects for peace and highlighting the deep divisions.</p>

          <p>The FBI's search of former National Security Adviser John Bolton's home and office, reportedly for classified documents, has sparked significant concerns about the "weaponization" of the Justice Department. This incident marks the fifth investigation targeting individuals from FBI Director Kash Patel's 2023 book, "Government Gangsters," which controversially listed critics of President Trump. Critics argue the pattern suggests retaliatory federal investigations, particularly as a previous probe into Bolton's memoir, "The Room Where it Happened," was definitively closed by the Biden administration in 2021. President Trump denied directly ordering the searches but publicly called Bolton a "sleazebag," while top law enforcement officials, including Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi, posted on social media that "no one is above the law," fueling the debate.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball is reportedly finalizing new media rights agreements with ESPN, NBC, and Netflix, aiming to secure long-term partnerships and expand its audience. Under the proposed three-year deals, NBC would acquire all Sunday night games and Wild Card playoff games for approximately $200 million annually, while Netflix would gain the rights to the Home Run Derby for about $50 million per year. ESPN is set to receive a new package worth $550 million, including MLB TV, the league's digital out-of-market package, and in-market games for five local teams, alongside a new mid-week national game package. These agreements, which would expire after the 2028 season, reflect MLB's strategic pivot to develop new media partnerships and enhance reach, even if it doesn't fully recoup previous revenue losses from ESPN's early opt-out.

Law enforcement sources confirmed at least four people were killed, including at least one child, with many passengers ejected or trapped inside the vehicle.

Barton rejected the notion of Menendez being a "model prisoner," detailing his involvement in fights, past drug use, a tax-fraud scam linked to a gang, and repeated illicit use of a mobile phone. Menendez, who along with his brother Lyle, claimed the killings were self-defense due to their father's sexual abuse and his mother's complicity, expressed deep remorse to his family during the hearing. Despite 18 relatives speaking in support of his release, the parole board determined his institutional misconduct demonstrated a lack of self-awareness, making him unsuitable for parole at this time, though he can re-apply in three years.</p>

Jeffrey Kruse, head of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, following an intelligence assessment of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites that reportedly angered President Donald Trump. The assessment indicated Iran's nuclear program was set back only a few months, directly contradicting more optimistic assertions from Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. This dismissal marks the latest in a series of upheavals within military and intelligence leadership, coming months after the assessment's details leaked to the media.

He subsequently stopped the vehicle, dropped the girl off, and fled the scene. Deputies quickly located his vehicle near his home and arrested him, booking him on suspicion of kidnapping, lewd acts with a child under 14, and lewd acts with a child using force or fear. Authorities believe other victims may exist and plan to release photos of Cascante and his vehicle to the public to aid further investigation.</p>

The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, stated that starving Gaza could amount to a war crime, directly attributing the famine to actions taken by the Israeli government.

This guidance, consistent with previous IRS interpretations and legislative intent, is particularly helpful for those purchasing out-of-state vehicles or ordering custom-built cars. The Trump administration is rolling back a suite of policies designed to promote EVs, and while a near-term sales bump is expected before the deadline, analysts predict a subsequent drop in sales.

Democrats have vehemently vowed to challenge the map's legality in court, arguing it undermines fair representation and dilutes minority voting power. A previous attempt to pass a similar bill led to a weeks-long House standoff where Texas Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum.

          <p>FBI agents raided the Maryland home and Washington, D.C. office of John Bolton, former National Security Advisor to President Trump and a vocal critic, as part of a national security investigation into classified records. The probe, which reportedly began during the Biden administration but did not proceed further before President Joe Biden left office, has now been reactivated. Sources close to Bolton believe the raids are "retribution, pure and simple" for his frequent criticism of the Trump administration, including his damning memoir "The Room Where it Happened." Trump denied prior knowledge of the raid but publicly called Bolton a "lowlife," while FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on social media about "no one is above the law," fueling speculation about political motivations behind the action.</p>

          <p>Jossimar Cabrera, 36, has been charged with one count of murder in Los Angeles County after the remains of his wife, Sheylla Cabrera, 33, were discovered in the Angeles National Forest. Investigators suspect foul play, citing doorbell camera footage that allegedly showed Jossimar dragging a large object from their apartment complex the day after Sheylla was reported missing. Authorities believe he fled to Peru with their three young sons, who were later found safe and taken into protective custody in that country. Jossimar was detained twice, in Mexico and Peru, but released because he had not yet been charged with a crime. Sheylla's mother reported that her daughter was a victim of domestic violence and had planned to report her husband shortly before her disappearance.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Chicago would likely be the federal government's next target for its anti-crime efforts, following the ongoing operation in Washington, D.C., with New York City slated to follow. He expressed willingness to deploy "regular military" in D.C. if necessary, a significant escalation of presidential power on U.S. soil. Trump criticized Chicago's "incompetent mayor" and claimed residents were "screaming for us to come," citing support from the "Black vote." It remains unclear how the federal government or National Guard could legally intervene in cities outside D.C., as state National Guard units are under gubernatorial control, and the Democratic governors and mayors of Illinois and New York would likely oppose such federal plans, setting up potential constitutional conflicts.</p>

          <p>Joseph Robert Milford, a 29-year-old Montgomery man, has been sentenced to 105 months, or over eight years, in federal prison for orchestrating a sophisticated mail and bank fraud scheme that resulted in over $1 million in losses. He was also convicted for illegally possessing firearms as a convicted felon, adding to the severity of his offenses. From October 2021 through December 2023, Milford and his co-conspirators actively solicited stolen checks using messaging apps and social media platforms. They then meticulously altered these checks to list co-conspirators as payees and often changed the check amounts, quickly withdrawing or converting the fraudulent proceeds. Acting U.S. Attorney Kevin Davidson emphasized that such fraud schemes not only cause significant financial harm but also erode public trust in the nation's banking and mail systems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The film "Splitsville," directed by Michael Angelo Covino, who also co-writes and co-stars alongside Kyle Marvin, is reviewed as ultimately falling short of the cutting comedy it aspires to be. The article describes the movie as an outward satire of bourgeois aspirations, modern marriage, and the dynamics of other couples, primarily concerned with the absurdities of male friendship, where men repeatedly make poor decisions, depicted as vain and infantile. The plot involves Carey's divorce, his best friend Paul's open relationship, and a subsequent affair between Carey and Paul's wife, Julie. While the film attempts to interrogate contemporary masculinity, it is criticized for its smug self-regard and prioritizing the male leads' antics over meaningful insights. Despite strong performances from Adria Arjona and Dakota Johnson, the movie struggles to fully cohere, leaving a disappointing impression.</p>

          <p>Fifteen young climate activists, aged eight to 17, have sued the state of Wisconsin, alleging its pro-fossil fuel policies violate their constitutional rights, including the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Lead plaintiff Kaarina, 17, was forced to relocate due to increased flooding caused by climate change, a personal experience that deeply inspired her involvement in the case. The lawsuit, filed by Our Children’s Trust and Midwest Environmental Advocates, specifically targets two state laws that prohibit the Public Service Commission from considering climate pollution when permitting new fossil fuel plants and from requiring utilities to increase renewable energy. The plaintiffs seek to declare these laws unconstitutional, arguing they impede the state's decarbonization goals and disproportionately harm youth health, homes, and safety, especially amidst mounting climate impacts.</p>

          <p>Federal student loan borrowers in default face imminent wage garnishment as the Trump administration prepares to resume collection efforts, though a specific date for this resumption has not yet been announced. Collection activity on federal student loans has been largely paused for approximately five years, dating back to the start of the Covid pandemic in 2020. With over 5.3 million student loan borrowers currently in default, consumer advocates are strongly urging individuals to take proactive action before garnishment begins, as it could significantly reduce their paychecks. The Student Loan Servicing Alliance, a trade group for federal student loan servicers, anticipates garnishment could begin in a month or more, marking a substantial and potentially difficult change for borrowers previously shielded from such actions.

While the company stated its values haven't changed and the man, known as "Uncle Herschel," remains prominent in restaurants and on menus, the market reaction highlights how politically charged marketing moves can significantly impact investor confidence. Despite a slight recovery the next day, the incident underscores the challenges companies face in rebranding and navigating cultural sensitivities in the current climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) has officially confirmed famine in parts of Gaza, marking a grim milestone amidst Israel's ongoing blockade and bombardment. The report indicates that over half a million people face catastrophic food insecurity, with conditions expected to worsen significantly between mid-August and the end of September. While such a classification typically aims to focus international attention and donor aid, the article highlights that the fundamental issue in Gaza is not a lack of resources but a critical lack of political will, as thousands of aid trucks remain stalled outside or within the enclave. Israel's government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has vehemently rejected the IPC's findings as "an outright lie," further complicating humanitarian efforts in a conflict already under intense global scrutiny.</p>

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the government is committed to closing all asylum hotels in a "properly managed way," arguing that piecemeal court decisions could create chaos and problems for other areas. The council's case cited escalating community tensions and the risk of irreparable harm, particularly after an asylum seeker from the hotel was charged with sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in the town. This legal challenge has prompted several other councils to consider similar actions, directly challenging the government's current approach to asylum accommodation and its broader immigration policies.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that air pollution from the oil and gas industry causes over 90,000 premature deaths and sickens hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. annually, disproportionately affecting communities of color. The comprehensive research, conducted by University College London and the Stockholm Environment Institute, attributes over 10,000 annual pre-term births and 216,000 childhood-onset asthma cases to the sector's emissions, along with 1,610 lifetime cancer cases. California, Texas, and New York experience the highest impacts, while Indigenous, Hispanic, Black, and Asian populations bear unequal health burdens, often due to historic discriminatory policies like redlining. The study, based on 2017 data, suggests current impacts are likely significantly higher given increased oil and gas production, raising urgent concerns amidst the Trump administration's pro-fossil fuel policies.</p>
