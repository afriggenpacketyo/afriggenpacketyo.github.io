          <p>T. Rowe Price is experiencing growth in actively managed ETFs, particularly the T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation Equity ETF (TCAF) and the T. Rowe Price U.S. Equity Research ETF (TSPA), as investors seek professionally managed portfolios amid market volatility. According to Tim Coyne, head of ETFs, TCAF aims to outperform the S&P 500 with lower volatility, holding a concentrated portfolio of around 100 names, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple. The TSPA follows a similar strategy with a heavier weighting in top tech stocks and is managed by the firm's North American directors of research, but its performance is roughly identical to the S&P 500's performance.

          <p>Amherst College, historically known for its diversity, faces an identity crisis after a significant drop in Black student enrollment in the freshman class, falling from 11% to 3%. This decline has impacted the Black student community, leading to decreased engagement in meetings and events, according to students like Quincy Smith. The shift raises concerns about the college's commitment to diversity and inclusion, prompting discussions about how to address the disparity and support Black students on campus. The drop in Black enrollment follows affirmative action being ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2023.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government is considering tariff exemptions on some essential U.S. imports to mitigate the impact of retaliatory tariffs, according to the American Chamber of Commerce in China. Chinese officials are assessing which U.S. imports are crucial to supply chains and vulnerable to trade barriers, with lifesaving drugs and health-care products being primary concerns. Some companies have warned that their business models would be unsustainable in China if the tariff war continues, potentially leading to their exit, which the Chinese government is trying to avoid to foster foreign direct investment.</p>

          <p>Jian-Ping Wang, a China-born scientist, has developed a rare-earth-free magnet, potentially providing Western technology and automotive giants an alternative to China's dominance in rare earth elements. Wang's iron nitride magnet, created at the University of Minnesota, is gaining attention as U.S.-China tensions escalate over rare earth exports. His spin-off company, Niron Magnetics, is racing to commercialize these magnets, offering a lifeline to manufacturers seeking to avoid shortages amid China's tightening export controls.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy is facing the potential return of stagflation, characterized by stagnation and inflation, reminiscent of the economic turmoil of the 1970s. President Trump's tariff policies are seen as self-inflicted economic shocks, disrupting trade and causing uncertainty for businesses and consumers. The situation could lead to disinvestment, higher prices, and job losses, with the government potentially resorting to interventionist measures, and the grim fact about stagflation is that once stumbled into, it is very hard to escape.</p>

          <p>Nightclubs are facing a growing issue of patrons not dancing, instead standing around, talking, or using their phones, which threatens the core purpose of these venues. This trend is attributed to various factors, including the influence of social media, the concertification of DJ sets, and a lack of diverse club options, with some clubs implementing strict rules to encourage dancing. The shift raises questions about the changing nature of nightlife and whether the act of not dancing at a dance club is a new phenomenon or a reflection of deeper cultural trends.</p>

          <p>Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko suggested that Ukraine may need to give up land as part of a peace deal with Russia, amidst growing pressure from President Trump to accept territorial concessions. While emphasizing that Ukrainians would "never accept occupation", Klitschko indicated a "painful solution" may be necessary, but stated bluntly that President Zelensky does not discuss any details of a possible settlement with him. Klitschko made these comments hours after a Russian missile attack on Kyiv killed 12 people and injured more than 80.</p>
