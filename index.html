          <p>The Tennessee Titans selected Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, fulfilling weeks of predictions by football analysts. Ward's selection marks the third consecutive year a quarterback has been chosen as the top pick. The Jacksonville Jaguars traded up to secure Colorado's two-way star Travis Hunter as the second pick, while the rest of the draft order remained unpredictable, differing significantly from the talent-rich 2024 class. The draft is being held in Green Bay, Wisconsin, outside Lambeau Field. </p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors intend to seek the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The prosecution cited Mangione's alleged desire to incite resistance against the victim's industry as a key factor. Mangione is expected to plead not guilty at his arraignment. Attorney General Pam Bondi signaled the Trump administration's intention to execute Mangione as part of a broader effort to reinstate capital punishment. Defense attorneys have criticized the decision as a "barbaric" and "political stunt."</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering recognizing Russian control over Crimea as part of a negotiation to end the war between Russia and Ukraine.

Now, he is prepared to abandon that declaration in an effort to broker a peace agreement.</p>
