          <p>A London court has affirmed a 2020 law in the Cayman Islands that provides legal recognition for same-sex civil partnerships. The ruling by the privy council, the final court of appeal for the British overseas territory, rejected a challenge arguing the governor overstepped his authority by enacting the law after the local parliament voted it down. This decision is seen by advocates as a significant victory for LGBTQ+ rights and could set a precedent for other British overseas territories. The case originated from a lawsuit by a lesbian couple who were denied the right to marry.</p>

          <p>A massive spending and tax bill supported by President Trump is causing anxiety for many Americans who rely on federal assistance programs. The legislation proposes significant cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid to offset trillions in tax cuts. The bill also includes new work requirements for Medicaid recipients and phases out green energy incentives, potentially threatening jobs in the renewable sector. While some, like firefighters, are encouraged by proposed tax exemptions on overtime, others fear the cuts will severely impact their health and financial stability.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the suspect accused of murdering four University of Idaho students in November 2022, has reportedly accepted a plea deal. In exchange for a guilty plea to all counts, prosecutors will not seek the death penalty. Kohberger is expected to receive four consecutive life sentences and will waive his right to appeal the conviction. The victims—Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle, and Ethan Chapin—were stabbed in an off-campus home, and a knife sheath with Kohberger's DNA was found at the scene.</p>

          <p>GE Appliances is accelerating its plan to move washer and dryer production from China to a new plant in Kentucky, an investment of $490 million. This move, which will create 800 new U.S. jobs, is primarily driven by a desire to avoid high tariffs on Chinese imports imposed by the Trump administration. The company stated that while its long-term strategy involves manufacturing products closer to where they are sold, the current tariff environment made the decision more urgent. The new Kentucky facility is expected to be operational by early 2027, at which point the corresponding factory in China will close. (not investment advice)</p>

The concept, inspired by Israel's Iron Dome, aims to create a shield to protect the U.S. from long-range missiles using a network of satellites and space-based sensors. While proponents believe it could enhance U.S. security and deter military actions near regions like the Taiwan Strait, significant questions remain.

The billionaire, who previously supported Trump, criticized the bill for its massive increase in government debt, calling it a "disgusting abomination." Musk's criticism also targets the bill's cuts to green energy tax credits, which he argues will destroy American jobs and cause strategic harm.

          <p>Despite widespread concerns that President Trump's tariffs would trigger a surge in inflation, U.S. prices have remained relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several short-term strategies employed by businesses, including pre-ordering large amounts of inventory before the tariffs took effect. Companies have also been absorbing some of the costs to avoid alienating consumers and have utilized legal loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay duty payments. However, experts warn that these are temporary measures and that consumers will likely see higher prices in the latter half of the year if the tariffs remain in place. (not investment advice)</p>

The cuts are expected to lead to staff layoffs, though faculty hiring will continue at a slower pace. The university, which has the third-largest endowment in the U.S., is particularly vulnerable to a proposed endowment tax included in President Trump's budget bill.</p>

With over 95% of American fireworks sourced from China, a 30% tariff has created supply chain disruptions and is expected to lead to higher prices and reduced selection for consumers. Some importers had previously halted shipments when a much higher tariff rate was in place, causing a supply crunch just before the industry's busiest season. Major retailers have indicated that while they will absorb some of the increased costs, consumers will likely notice the price effects.</p>

When asked about China's malign activities, Trump responded, “You don’t think we do that to them?” The author argues this reflects a pattern, citing a previous instance where Trump defended Vladimir Putin by saying the U.S. also has "a lot of killers." The piece contends that such statements are not a considered moral position but rather a lazy equivocation that undermines America's global standing and democratic principles.</p>

A key provision imposes new work requirements on many recipients, which critics argue will disproportionately harm older adults and those with health issues who cannot consistently meet the hourly threshold.

          <p>Circle Internet Group, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, has applied for a national trust bank charter with the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). If approved, Circle would become one of the few crypto-native firms to receive such a federal license, allowing it to establish the First National Digital Currency Bank. This move aligns with the company's goal of integrating stablecoins into the traditional financial system and would help it comply with emerging U.S. regulations. The charter would also permit Circle to offer custody services for tokenized assets to institutional clients in the future.</p>

The judges agreed to return to work following the retirement of the court's controversial president, Judge Jassim Mohammed Abboud Al-Amiri, who was accused of undermining the court's independence. The court had been embroiled in several politically charged rulings, including the dismissal of a prominent Sunni parliament speaker.

The bill has faced strong opposition from Democrats and has caused rifts within the Republican party, with some conservatives objecting to its $5 trillion increase in the national debt.

The report projects that the bill would increase the annual income of the top 20% of households by an average of $5,700, while reducing the income of the bottom 20% by about $700. This disparity is primarily attributed to the bill's sharp cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP. These cuts would more than offset any minor tax benefits for low-income families.
