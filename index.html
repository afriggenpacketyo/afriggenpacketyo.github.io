        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pepsico has revised its full-year forecast, citing a decrease in consumer spending and the impact of increasing global tariffs; the company's CFO, Jamie Caulfield, noted a less optimistic outlook on consumer sentiment compared to three months prior. For the quarter ending March 22, Pepsico reported a 1.8% decline in revenue, totaling $17.9 billion, and a 10% drop in net income, reaching $1.8 billion, compared to the previous year. This adjustment reflects broader concerns about the economy affecting consumer behavior and the performance of major consumer-oriented businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has partially blocked the Trump administration from cutting funding to public schools that maintain diversity programs, deeming the move a likely violation of the First Amendment. Judge Landya McCafferty criticized the Education Department's memo threatening to withhold Title I funds from schools promoting DEI, calling it "textbook viewpoint discrimination." The ruling prevents the administration from halting funds to schools employing plaintiffs in the lawsuit, but stops short of a nationwide injunction. McCafferty also noted the administration's failure to adequately define the DEI programs at risk.</p>

          <p>Warnings of empty store shelves are increasing as CEOs of major retail stores inform President Trump that a prolonged trade war could cause shortages, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent describing the situation as "unsustainable." Apparel and footwear are particularly vulnerable, with imports from China accounting for a significant portion of U.S. supplies; the American Apparel and Footwear Association warns that high tariffs act as an import ban. Supply chain experts suggest that lower-end stores and fast-moving goods like toys, apparel, and budget home goods will be the first to experience shortages, and the next few months will be critical in assessing the health of the supply chain.

          <p>The United States and China are presenting conflicting accounts regarding the status of trade talks, with President Trump claiming active discussions and China dismissing this as "fake news." This disagreement occurs amidst escalating tensions, including tariffs of 145% on Chinese goods and retaliatory measures from China, raising concerns about a potential trade war. Experts suggest the Trump administration may be growing nervous about the economic fallout, but remains unwilling to commit to unilateral de-escalation, while China appears to perceive itself as having the upper hand in the standoff.</p>

          <p>Reform UK is facing criticism for fielding local election candidates who have allegedly posted hate speech, promoted far-right conspiracies, and praised extremists, despite claims by Nigel Farage of enhanced vetting. Campaign group Hope Not Hate has highlighted social media posts from candidates expressing anti-Islam sentiments and promoting conspiracy theories. The BBC has confirmed several posts, including one advocating a "nuke bomb" to remove Islam from the world and another describing a city with a large Muslim population as a "shithole," raising questions about the party's vetting process.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire federal judge has restricted the Trump administration's ability to cut or withhold federal funding from public schools that participate in some diversity and equity initiatives. Judge Landya McCafferty found that the administration's actions would "cripple the operations of many educational institutions" and violate executive branch power. The ruling, limited to schools working with the plaintiffs, follows the Trump administration's demands that states ensure their schools do not participate in programs violating the administration's definition of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</p>
