          <p>Daniel Noboa was sworn in for a second term as President of Ecuador, vowing to tackle corruption, drug trafficking, and violent crime, while also focusing on economic reforms and job creation. Noboa, who first assumed the presidency in November 2023, aims to work with the private sector to foster investment and address high unemployment levels, which contribute to the country's security issues. Despite facing criticism from the opposition, Noboa's National Democratic Action party holds a majority in Congress, crucial for advancing his agenda, including a crime-fighting bill with significant economic implications. His term will run until May 2029.</p>

          <p>John Woeltz, a 37-year-old crypto investor, was arrested in New York City for allegedly kidnapping and torturing an Italian tourist for as long as three weeks in his SoHo home.

A second person, Beatrice Folchi, was also arrested in connection to the case, but the Manhattan District Attorney's Office declined to prosecute her at the time pending further investigation; the motive for the alleged attack remains unclear, though there were two butlers at the residence who would also be interviewed.</p>

The investigation went cold until investigators traveled to Costa Rica and found the family’s former live-in nanny, who was willing to cooperate and provided information that corroborated evidence collected over the years. The Worrells had a live-in nanny from Venezuela, Paola Yarberry, who also worked at Jon’s Sports Park.</p>

          <p>A pediatrician and mother of 10 is mourning the deaths of nine of her young children after an Israeli airstrike hit their home near Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, according to hospital officials. Dr. Alaa al-Najjar's husband, also a doctor, was severely wounded and is now in intensive care, and their only surviving child was also injured. The Israel Defense Forces said its aircraft struck suspects operating from a structure adjacent to IDF troops in the area of Khan Yunis and that the claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review.</p>

          <p>A new food aid system in Gaza, portrayed as neutral and run by American contractors, originated in Israel and was designed to undermine Hamas and bypass the United Nations. The plan involves newly formed private organizations distributing food in Gaza, with security provided by a firm run by a former C.I.A. officer, and funding from a group headed by a former U.S. Marine. While supporters claim it's independent, critics argue it restricts aid to limited areas, could endanger civilians, and might facilitate displacement out of northern Gaza.</p>
