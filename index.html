          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have concluded their investigation into the Irish language rap group Kneecap following their performance at the Glastonbury festival. A senior detective was assigned to determine if on-stage comments constituted a criminal offense. After consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service, the force announced it would not take further action, citing insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of a conviction, thereby closing the controversial case.</p>

          <p>With U.S. inflation rising again and the Federal Reserve expected to hold interest rates steady, savers have an extended window to secure high returns. The article suggests that a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) for a sum like $10,000 can be a prudent move. This strategy allows individuals to earn significant interest in the interim while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to future economic shifts, as these accounts typically mature in a year or less.

          <p>President Trump has instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the unsealing of grand jury testimony related to the Jeffrey Epstein prosecution. This move comes amid growing public pressure and widespread speculation about the case and individuals connected to the disgraced financier. However, legal experts caution that federal rules protecting grand jury secrecy present a significant hurdle, and critics argue the transcripts would only reveal a small portion of the total evidence gathered by investigators.</p>

          <p>Worshippers at a Cincinnati mosque are reeling after their imam, Ayman Soliman, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) during a routine check-in. Soliman, an Egyptian native granted asylum in 2018, was recently informed his status was terminated, with officials alleging material support to a "Tier III" terrorist organization. His lawyers argue the claim is pretextual and possibly retaliatory, as community members rally in protest, fearing for the imam's safety if he is deported to Egypt.</p>
