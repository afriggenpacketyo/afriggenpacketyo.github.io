          <p>The core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation metric, increased to an annual rate of 2.9% in July. This figure, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, met economists' expectations but remains significantly above the central bank's 2% target. Despite the persistent inflation, consumer spending saw a healthy increase of 0.5%, suggesting resilience in the economy. Markets still anticipate the Fed will consider an interest rate cut at its next meeting to address potential labor market weakening. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has revoked the extended Secret Service protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris, a detail that had been prolonged by the previous administration. This action is one of several recent executive moves, including an order to investigate the use of federal grants for lobbying activities. Additionally, President Trump signed directives ending collective bargaining for some federal national security unions and mandating classical architecture for new federal buildings. These decisions reflect a broader effort by the administration to reshape federal operations and cultural policies.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national charged with human smuggling, have asked a federal judge to issue a gag order against Trump administration officials. The legal team argues that public statements from officials, including DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, have unfairly labeled their client as a dangerous gang member and predator. They contend these remarks could prejudice a potential jury and jeopardize the possibility of a fair trial. This is the second such request made by the defense in this case.</p>

Cook is challenging the President's authority to terminate her position on the board. In a separate filing, the Federal Reserve itself took a neutral stance on the lawsuit but urged the court to provide a swift resolution to the matter. The filings precede a court hearing on Cook's request for a temporary restraining order.</p>

          <p>A shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis resulted in the deaths of two children, 8-year-old Fletcher Merkel and 10-year-old Harper Moyski, and injured 18 others. The attacker, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, fired a rifle through church windows during a school Mass before dying by suicide. Authorities report Westman, a former student, was obsessed with past mass shootings and legally purchased the firearms used in the attack. The investigation is exploring motives, including potential hate crimes, as the community mourns the tragic loss.</p>

          <p>India's gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annual rate of 7.8% for the quarter ending in June, exceeding economists' forecasts. The expansion was primarily driven by strong performance in the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors. However, some economists note signs of a potential slowdown, pointing to a decrease in nominal GDP growth, which does not account for inflation. The strong real GDP figure comes amid concerns over the impact of new U.S. tariffs on Indian imports, which could soften growth in the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. has officially ended the 'de minimis' trade exemption, a provision that allowed shipments valued under $800 to enter the country duty-free. This executive order from President Trump accelerates a change that was previously slated for 2027, creating significant disruption for global supply chains and retailers. The move is expected to impact a wide range of businesses, from large corporations like Lululemon to small online sellers on platforms like Etsy.

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina made landfall, the storm is remembered as one of the costliest and deadliest disasters in U.S. history, causing nearly 1,400 deaths. The catastrophe was exacerbated by the failure of New Orleans' levee system, which led to at least 80% of the city being flooded. The delayed federal response created a humanitarian crisis, with thousands stranded without food or water. Decades later, communities like the Lower Ninth Ward have still not fully recovered, highlighting the storm's lasting impact on the region's infrastructure and social fabric.</p>

Waller expressed concern that the Fed should act preemptively to avoid falling behind the curve.

          <p>China's upcoming military parade to mark the anniversary of the end of World War II is being closely watched for indications of leadership changes within the People's Liberation Army (PLA). As the PLA does not publicly announce personnel shifts, the prominence of certain generals can signal who is rising through the ranks. Conversely, the absence of key figures may suggest they have been affected by President Xi Jinping's ongoing anti-corruption campaign. This campaign has already led to the removal of at least 16 military deputies from the National People's Congress.</p>

          <h2>New Tariffs on Indian Imports Could Increase the Cost of Pumpkin Spice Products</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 07:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The seasonal popularity of pumpkin spice products faces a new economic challenge due to the Trump administration's 50 percent tariffs on imports from India. India is a major exporter of key spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves, which are essential components of the popular fall flavor blend. While the immediate impact may be minimal due to existing stockpiles, the tariffs are expected to eventually raise costs for spice companies and, consequently, consumers. The situation presents a test of how much Americans are willing to pay for the ubiquitous taste of autumn.</p>

          <h2>Two Decades After Katrina, New Orleans' Advanced Levee System Faces New Threats</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 07:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans is protected by a sophisticated $14.4 billion levee system, yet its future remains uncertain. The city faces the dual threats of rising sea levels due to climate change and rapid land subsidence, which causes parts of the levee system to sink faster than projected. These environmental pressures diminish the effectiveness of the flood defenses each year. Furthermore, potential cuts to federal and state funding for maintenance and inspections could jeopardize the long-term resilience of this critical infrastructure, leaving the city vulnerable once again.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has declared there is 'no way' the U.S. could invade his country, despite the recent deployment of American warships and troops to the Caribbean for an anti-drug operation. In response, Venezuela has mobilized its own warships and initiated a militia recruitment drive to bolster its defenses. The U.S. has accused Maduro of leading a drug trafficking cartel and has a $50 million bounty for his capture. Maduro maintains that the U.S. military presence is part of a 'regime change' effort orchestrated by President Trump.</p>

          <p>The city of Kyiv is observing a day of mourning after a Russian aerial attack killed at least 23 people, including four children, in one of the largest strikes of the war. The attack, which primarily hit a five-story apartment building, has been widely condemned internationally. In response, EU defense ministers are meeting to discuss further military support for Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Moscow had chosen 'ballistics instead of the negotiating table,' reiterating his call for tougher sanctions against Russia as the conflict continues with intense fighting.</p>

          <p>Starting in January, the UK's National Health Service (NHS) will begin offering a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab, and a catch-up program is planned for older children. Previously, the vaccine was only available privately at a significant cost. Health officials hope the program will protect children from rare but severe complications and reduce the economic impact caused by parents taking time off work to care for sick children.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's legal team has filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC alleges Musk illegally saved about $150 million by failing to disclose his growing stake in Twitter (now X) within the required 10-day timeframe in 2022. Musk's lawyers argue the lawsuit is a 'waste of taxpayer resources,' claiming the late filing was a minor error that was immediately corrected and caused no investor harm. They also accuse the SEC of selectively targeting Musk due to his public criticism of the agency.</p>

          <p>Alibaba reported better-than-expected profits for the June quarter, largely due to a 26% year-over-year revenue increase in its cloud computing division. This growth was fueled by strong demand for AI-related products, which the company noted has become a significant revenue source. While overall revenue slightly missed analyst forecasts, the company's core e-commerce business also showed signs of revival. However, profitability in the e-commerce sector was impacted by heavy investment in the competitive 'instant commerce' space, reflecting the company's strategic balancing act.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey of 8,000 Americans found that Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology is a net negative for potential buyers, with 35% saying it makes them less likely to purchase a Tesla, compared to only 14% who are more likely. The majority of respondents stated the feature would not influence their decision. The findings suggest a significant consumer skepticism and lack of trust in the technology, which Elon Musk has positioned as central to the company's future. This comes as Tesla faces a sales slump and reputational challenges.</p>
