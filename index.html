          <p>An explosion and subsequent fire at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Esparto, California, has left seven individuals unaccounted for. The blast, which occurred Tuesday evening, prompted a one-mile evacuation zone and ignited multiple grass fires spanning approximately 80 acres. Officials confirmed two people sustained injuries, while family members of missing workers gathered nearby, awaiting news. The incident also caused significant power outages in the area, and an investigation into the cause, led by Cal Fire, is now underway.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of former federal health officials has warned that proposed budget cuts for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in fiscal year 2026 could have severe health consequences for Americans. The proposed budget would slash the CDC's funding by over 50%, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion, impacting state and local health departments that rely heavily on federal support. Experts predict these cuts will damage crucial programs for chronic disease prevention, including those for HIV and tobacco, leading to more illness and unnecessary deaths. These proposed cuts are separate from the major reconciliation bill currently in Congress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Pentagon's chief spokesperson announced Wednesday that recent U.S. strikes on three of Iran's key nuclear facilities have likely set its program back by approximately one to two years. This assessment, described as originating from within the defense department, is more measured than President Trump's claims of complete obliteration but more significant than an earlier low-confidence DIA report. The evaluation is reportedly based on intelligence suggesting critical centrifuges at the Fordow site were destroyed. The true extent of the damage remains difficult to verify, especially as Iran has now suspended cooperation with the IAEA.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Justice Department has filed an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court to remove three Biden-appointed members of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). The move follows lower court rulings that blocked the administration from firing the regulators, who serve protected seven-year terms. The administration argues the officials have shown "hostility to the President's agenda" and that their removal is justified under a previous Supreme Court decision regarding the president's authority over executive officers. A White House spokesperson criticized the lower court judges for defying what they see as a clear precedent.</p>

          <p>A small skydiving plane carrying 15 people went off the runway at Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey, injuring five passengers. The incident, involving a Cessna 208B, occurred Wednesday afternoon, and the Federal Aviation Administration is now investigating. The injured individuals were transported to a nearby hospital for treatment. The same aircraft was involved in a previous incident in July 2023, where an NTSB report determined the pilot's inadequate landing flare caused the plane to go off the runway and sustain substantial damage.</p>

          <p>Following recent U.S. and Israeli attacks on its nuclear facilities, Iran has halted cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), raising concerns among some experts that Tehran could become more secretive and dangerous. The move prevents independent verification of Iran's nuclear program status and has prompted fears the country might withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty, similar to North Korea. While the full extent of the damage from the strikes is unconfirmed, analysts worry that Iran will rebuild without international oversight, creating a more volatile situation and making future diplomatic solutions more difficult to achieve.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the doctoral student accused of the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, has pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary.

In court, Kohberger affirmed that he was guilty and had not been coerced into the agreement. The decision brings a resolution to the case without a trial, a move that has drawn mixed reactions from the victims' families but provides a guaranteed conviction.</p>

          <p>Passage of President Trump's major domestic policy bill is in jeopardy due to significant opposition from within the House Republican conference. Both conservative hardliners and moderates are resisting the version of the bill passed by the Senate, citing concerns over a growing national deficit and deep cuts to healthcare programs like Medicaid. House Speaker Mike Johnson and the White House are actively pressuring holdouts to secure the necessary votes ahead of a July 4th deadline. The internal divisions highlight the fragile GOP majority and the difficulty in reconciling different party factions.</p>

The group specifically targets the team's efforts to recruit women and people of color and its sponsorship of employee resource groups.

It also discusses the making of the 1987 biopic "La Bamba," and how the re-recorded soundtrack by Los Lobos introduced his music to a new generation.

          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic questions the position of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has praised a budget bill that would significantly cut Medicaid. Despite his stated mission to "Make America healthy again," Kennedy supports provisions that could remove nearly 12 million people from the health insurance program, a move that medical experts warn will harm public health. Kennedy has argued for shrinking the program to serve only the most vulnerable, but the article points out that Medicaid is a crucial tool for managing the very chronic diseases he aims to fix.

The bill proposes a one-year Medicaid ban on healthcare non-profits that offer abortions, which would strip Planned Parenthood of an estimated $700 million in federal funding. This could force the closure of nearly 200 health centers, primarily in blue states where abortion remains legal, and jeopardize care for over a million patients.

          <p>President Trump announced a new trade deal with Vietnam that imposes a 20% tariff on all Vietnamese imports into the U.S. and a 40% tariff on goods transshipped through the country to prevent circumvention by others. In exchange, the agreement reportedly grants the United States "total access" to Vietnam's markets with zero tariffs on American products. This deal averts a potential 46% blanket tariff that was set to take effect under Trump's broader "reciprocal" trade plan. The announcement provides some clarity for companies that rely on manufacturing in Vietnam, a major hub for many global brands. (not investment advice)</p>
