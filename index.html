          <p>An Afghan family residing in Pakistan has sued the German Foreign Ministry, claiming they have been waiting over 18 months for a visa they are legally entitled to, according to a report by German public broadcaster ARD. The main plaintiff, a writer and scientist known for her prior role in the Afghan government, was approved for relocation to Germany along with 13 relatives in October 2023. However, they have not received a visa appointment, facing potential deportation from Pakistan as their visas expire, highlighting the challenges faced by Afghan refugees seeking safety amid tightening immigration policies in Germany. The article notes that approximately 2,500 Afghans are in similar situations.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to a 90-day truce in their trade war, suspending steep tariffs in a move that sent stock market futures soaring. The U.S. will reduce its levies on Chinese imports to 30% from as high as 145%, while China will cut its tariffs on American goods to 10% from 125%. This agreement follows negotiations in Switzerland and aims to provide a window for further discussions to resolve trade tensions, although some analysts remain cautious about the long-term implications and potential for a lasting resolution.

          <p>The U.S. and China have reached a temporary agreement to significantly ease tariffs imposed in recent months, signaling a potential breakthrough in ongoing trade negotiations. The two countries will suspend most levies imposed since early April for 90 days, moving forward in a spirit of mutual opening, continued communication, cooperation, and mutual respect. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that both Washington and Beijing would reduce their reciprocal tariffs by 115 percentage points for three months to allow negotiations to progress, effectively reducing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to about 30% and China's levies on American imports to 10%. The article mentions the positive impact on commodities, currency markets, and stock futures, though some analysts remain skeptical about the long-term commitment to easing tensions.</p>

          <p>Crude oil futures jumped 4% following the agreement between the U.S. and China to slash tariffs, easing trade tensions between the world's two largest petroleum consumers. U.S. crude oil was up $2.52 to $63.54 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent rose $2.33 to $66.24 per barrel. The temporary reduction in tariffs, with U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports now at 30% and Beijing's tariffs on American goods at 10%, aims to foster further negotiations and alleviate concerns about a potential recession that would slow demand. The article notes that oil prices had previously plunged to a four-year low due to President Trump's global tariff regime.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party has announced its immigration plans, aiming for a "controlled, selective, and fair" system. Key measures include tightening work visa requirements by raising qualification thresholds, doubling the residency period for indefinite stay applications, and scrapping care visas. Simultaneously, the party intends to expand eligibility for the "high potential individual" visa and ease access for top scientific and design talent. Overseas graduates will have a shorter post-study stay, and there will be increased English language requirements for visa applicants. While seeking to reduce net migration, Labour avoids setting an overall cap, opting for a flexible approach.</p>

Qatar has denied that the plane would be a gift, but said the transfer of an aircraft for "temporary use" was under discussion between the two countries. The proposed plane, a Boeing 747-8, is a newer model than the current Air Force One planes and has been upgraded into a "flying palace".

          <p>China and the US have agreed to a 90-day pause in their trade war, lowering reciprocal tariffs by 115 percentage points, which will ease the strain on the global economy. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized mutual respect in the negotiations, stating neither side wants economic decoupling. The agreement involves lowering Chinese duties on US goods to 10% and US duties on Chinese goods to 30%, addressing non-tariff measures such as restrictions on critical mineral exports. The agreement has been met with positive reactions in financial markets and cautious optimism from analysts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to visit the Gulf region, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest due to his family's ongoing business ventures in the area. The Trump Organization has several active projects in the Gulf, including a new residential building in Dubai and a golf club in Qatar. Trump's visit to the UAE coincides with the announcement of the Trump International Hotel & Tower, Dubai. Critics argue that Trump's decisions as president could affect his business interests, and foreign officials could provide special treatment or exact punishment based on his decisions.</p>

The release follows talks with the U.S. and is intended to facilitate opening Gaza's border crossings and providing aid.

          <p>The article discusses the growing trend of homeowners switching from gas to electric appliances to reduce their carbon footprint and highlights the emergence of "climate coaches" who help navigate this transition. These coaches, offered by companies, non-profits, and government agencies, assist in finding vetted contractors, understanding government incentives, and making informed decisions about cleaner energy. Switching to electric appliances, such as heat pumps, is a key climate solution as it relies on an increasingly cleaner electric grid. The article provides examples of services offered by QuitCarbon, Efficiency Maine Trust, and Rewiring America to ease the electrification process.</p>
