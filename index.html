          <p>President Trump met with House Speaker Mike Johnson and the House Freedom Caucus to address sticking points in the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," including Medicaid work requirements and state and local tax deductions. While the White House described the meeting as productive, hard-liners remain critical of the bill, citing concerns about the national deficit. Johnson aims to move forward with a vote, but the timing is uncertain due to ongoing negotiations and potential opposition. The White House Office of Management and Budget urged passage of the bill, emphasizing Trump's commitment to his promises and warning against "the ultimate betrayal."</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Louisiana struck down EEOC regulations requiring employers to provide time off and accommodations for abortions, siding with conservative lawmakers and religious groups who argued the EEOC exceeded its authority. The ruling came in response to lawsuits challenging the inclusion of abortion as a pregnancy-related condition under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. While the judge vacated the abortion provision, the rest of the regulations remain in effect. Advocacy groups condemned the ruling as an attack on women's rights, while Republican lawmakers celebrated it as a victory for life.</p>

The government has also pledged to disrupt people-smuggling gangs, but it is unclear how progress will be measured. The number of people returned with no legal right to be in the UK has increased, but the backlog of court appeals from asylum seekers has worsened.</p>

Gulf leaders, who dealt with former President Bidenâ€™s relatively arms-length approach, likely view Trumpâ€™s transnationalism as a safer bet. The multitrillion-dollar deals signed signal a deliberate pivot by Gulf states to deepen ties with a potentially resurgent US economy, which carries risks for China, a key partner for energy imports and infrastructure projects. Trump's focus on redirecting Gulf capital into US markets threatens to squeeze Chinaâ€™s access to the petrodollar pipeline.</p>

          <p>President Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill faces challenges in Congress due to disagreements among Republicans. Key sticking points include the amount of spending cuts, Medicaid reductions, state and local tax deductions (SALT), and food assistance. The bill's potential to add trillions to the national debt has prompted opposition from the House Freedom Caucus. Disputes over Medicaid cuts and the SALT deduction cap further complicate the bill's passage, highlighting divisions within the Republican party.</p>

The selfie, a composite of 59 images, marks 1,500 sols for Perseverance on Mars. The rover, covered in red dust from drilling, is collecting samples for an eventual return to Earth from Jezero Crater, an ancient lakebed that could hold clues to past microbial life.

          <p>Oklahoma has been exemplary in cleaning up its streams, by some measures, more than any other state. A big part of the solution was simple: Give cows clean drinking water and keep them out of the streams. One farmer, Grant Victor, decided to fence his cattle off from Horse Creek, which wends through northeast Oklahoma, bisecting his familyâ€™s pastures and cropland. Today, Horse Creek is no longer on the stateâ€™s list of most contaminated waterways. And, thanks to practices such as the ones enacted by Mr. Victor, about 100 Oklahoman streams once polluted by runoff predominantly from farmland have been restored to health. Thatâ€™s more than in any other state, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>

          <p>Federal food assistance through SNAP may face a 30% cut under the proposed GOP tax bill, the "biggest cut in the program's history". The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, currently provides food assistance to more than 40 million individuals. The proposed cuts would expand work requirements to qualify for benefits and reduce federal funding for food benefits, potentially impacting millions of vulnerable individuals. The SNAP reform efforts come amid a broader effort to reduce waste and fraud in government programs.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has appointed Freddy Lim, the founder and lead singer of the heavy metal band Chthonic, as its envoy to Finland. The appointment has been met with enthusiasm from metalheads, given Finland's status as a heavy metal capital. Lim's selection is based on his human rights work and international experience, including his service as a national legislator and chairman of Amnesty International in Taiwan. Chthonic has used its music to call attention to the struggles of Taiwan.</p>

          <h2>Keir Starmer Announces U-Turn on Winter Fuel Payment Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 16:19:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Keir Starmer has announced plans to ease cuts to winter fuel payments, reversing an earlier decision following political pressure. More than 10 million pensioners lost out on the payments after the pension top-up became means-tested last year. The threshold will be changed to allow "more pensioners" to qualify again, though it remains unclear how many will regain their entitlement. The policy will be changed at the autumn Budget, with decisions made based on affordability.</p>
