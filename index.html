        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Boulder, Colorado, eight individuals were hospitalized following an attack on a pedestrian mall. The suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, allegedly yelled "Free Palestine" during the incident, which involved a "makeshift flamethrower" and an incendiary device. The victims, ranging in age from 52 to 88, were participating in a pro-Israel demonstration called Run for Their Lives, aimed at raising awareness about hostages in Gaza. The FBI is investigating the attack as a targeted act of terrorism, while local authorities initially hesitated to label it as such, emphasizing the need for further investigation. Optimism is tempered by the severity of the injuries and the potential for escalating tensions. The investigation remains ongoing to determine the full scope and motivations behind the attack.</p>

          <p>The United States defense sector's dependence on China for critical minerals is raising concerns about military readiness. China dominates the global supply of rare earths and other critical minerals, giving Beijing leverage in trade negotiations. Recent export restrictions imposed by China on gallium, germanium, antimony, and rare earth elements are affecting American military end users. These restrictions highlight the growing risk to the Pentagon's supply chain security and the need for the US to diversify its sources of critical minerals.</p>

          <p>A new book explores the significant impact of sibling relationships on individual lives, examining factors such as birth order and achievements. Studies suggest that eldest children may perform better on cognitive tests due to increased parental attention early in life. Sibling influence can be powerful, with individuals often driven to pursue different paths based on their siblings' choices. While these dynamics can create a sense of competition or comparison, they also offer opportunities for self-reflection and mutual understanding.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's promise to achieve peace in Ukraine within a day remains unfulfilled, despite ongoing negotiations. Russia and Ukraine are holding talks in Istanbul, but significant disagreements persist regarding territorial disputes and sovereignty. Trump has expressed frustration, hinting at a potential withdrawal of support if progress isn't made soon. Experts caution that reduced U.S. involvement could shift the war's balance of power in Russia's favor, while others suggest a less engaged approach might be beneficial if it doesn't involve cutting off military assistance to Kyiv.</p>
