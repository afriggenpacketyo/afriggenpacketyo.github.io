          <p>The stock market is showing gains as investors express hope for easing trade tensions. Reports suggest that the Chinese government is considering exempting some products from retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, signaling a potential de-escalation. The S&P 500 is heading for a weekly gain, though it remains lower since President Trump's return to office. The market has experienced dramatic swings amid uncertainty surrounding tariffs and trade policies.</p>

          <p>Rome is experiencing a hushed atmosphere as it mourns the death of Pope Francis, with a mix of mourning and reflection. The city has regained its reputation as the "capital of the world," with St Peter's Square at the center of Catholic attention. While there is sadness, there is also a sense of peace, and the city is preparing for the funeral and the subsequent conclave to elect a new Pope.</p>
