          <p>Japan has strongly urged China to prevent a recurrence after a Chinese military aircraft and a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force patrol plane were involved in a near miss over international waters in the Pacific. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said Japan conveyed its "serious concern" to China over the incident that could have led to a collision, adding it will continue to maintain communication at various levels. Japan has been on alert for increased Chinese military activity, including the first confirmed simultaneous operation of China's two aircraft carriers, the Shandong and Liaoning, in the Pacific. The incident underscores ongoing tensions in the region and the need for careful management of military interactions. </p>

          <p>Following two days of trade talks in London, US President Donald Trump announced a wide-ranging deal with China to maintain the truce established after earlier talks in Geneva. The agreement is expected to cover various points of contention, including shipments of rare earth minerals, student visas, and tariffs. While Trump declared the accord "done" on his Truth Social platform, Chinese representatives have remained reticent, stating they will submit a report for President Xi Jinping's approval.

          <p>A U.S. nuclear weapons expert, Jeffrey Lewis, posted a satellite image of what is believed to be a new uranium enrichment facility under construction in Yongbyon, North Korea. The image, taken in April, shows a building with similar features to an existing enrichment plant in Kangson near Pyongyang. The facility has a central hall approximately 95 meters long and 24 meters wide where centrifuges could be installed, surrounded by office and support spaces. This development raises concerns about North Korea's continued pursuit of nuclear weapons capabilities.</p>

          <p>In the Karen Read trial, the defense's final witness, Dr. Andrew Rentschler, challenged the prosecution's claims about how John O'Keefe died. Rentschler argued that O'Keefe's injuries were inconsistent with being struck by Read's SUV at approximately 24 miles per hour, citing a lack of broken bones on O'Keefe's right arm. Special prosecutor Hank Brennan questioned the thoroughness of Rentschler's testing, pointing out that he did not account for shattered taillight pieces found near O'Keefe. The jury will begin deliberations after receiving instructions from the judge and listening to closing arguments, with the outcome potentially hinging on their assessment of the competing expert testimonies.</p>

          <p>With US restrictions on advanced semiconductors used in AI development, China is focusing on domestic alternatives like Huawei. The task is challenging due to US curbs inhibiting access to technology vital for creating an AI chip ecosystem, spanning design, manufacturing equipment, and memory chips. Beijing has mobilized billions to fill these gaps, achieving some breakthroughs but still lagging behind, according to experts. While Huawei's Ascend chips show progress, the company is still behind Nvidia, and the lack of key manufacturing equipment limits advanced GPU production, making it difficult for China to create a competitive AI chip ecosystem.</p>

          <p>A strip club in Kharkiv, Ukraine, has become a refuge for traumatized soldiers seeking solace from the ongoing war. Dancers at the Flash Dancers club act as confidantes, listening to soldiers discuss their experiences and feelings. Some soldiers even share videos from the battlefield, including footage of wounded comrades or deceased Russian soldiers. The club aims to provide an escape for soldiers, though the realities of war often seep into the atmosphere.</p>

          <p>Rachel Reeves, the UK chancellor, has announced increased funding for the NHS and housing while squeezing some other departmental budgets. The NHS in England will receive an extra £29 billion per year, and £39 billion has been allocated for social and affordable housing over 10 years. The Spending Review also includes more money for artificial intelligence and transport projects. However, the Foreign Office and the environment department will see reductions in day-to-day spending, and the chancellor is restricted in how much can she spend as a result of her two self-imposed rules. </p>

The astronomers spotted a mysterious new star glowing in the southern sky and described it as being about the size of a cup-shaped oil lamp with a pure yellow color. The detailed account confirms that the phenomenon was a nova, a slow, temporary brightening caused by a dying star, rather than a comet or meteor.
