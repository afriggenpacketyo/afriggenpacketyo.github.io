          <h2>Supreme Court Decision Seen as Expanding Presidential Power</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 15:25:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court, in an unsigned order, has effectively granted President Trump considerable new authority by allowing the firings of high-level officials who normally retain their positions regardless of the current administration. This decision, according to legal experts, overrules a nearly century-old precedent without full briefing or argument, raising concerns about the consolidation of power within the presidency. The author argues that the court's action undermines lower courts seeking to uphold the rule of law and emboldens the administration to act outside traditional constitutional norms, potentially enabling the president to claim unchecked authority under Article II. This ruling risks assimilating a "move fast and break things" ethos into constitutional law.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Ron Johnson has indicated that there is enough resistance within the Senate to potentially halt President Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill" unless significant changes are made to reduce the deficit. Johnson criticized the bill for increasing the deficit and urged deeper spending cuts to pre-pandemic levels, while Senator Rand Paul also expressed opposition due to concerns about the debt ceiling increase. Speaker Johnson defended the bill as a major investment that will stimulate the economy through tax cuts and deregulation, but the Senate's concerns highlight the challenges in passing the package, especially given the narrow Republican majority and the need for House approval of any Senate modifications.</p>

          <p>Six months after President Trump's victory, the Democratic Party faces an identity crisis marked by plunging approval ratings and a sense of cultural rejection. The party has lost ground with key demographics, including young people, Black voters, and Latinos, and struggles with a perception of representing college-educated elites. The article is the first in a series examining the Democrats' predicament, exploring the challenges of rebuilding the party's image and finding new leadership. Fierce ideological debates over policies and the lack of resistance from congressional leaders are contributing to internal divisions and anxiety within the party.</p>

          <p>Rwanda's President Kagame has taken a significant gamble by allegedly backing the M23 rebels in eastern Congo, leading to international condemnation and comparisons to Vladimir Putin. Kagame's actions, including the storming of Goma, have strained Rwanda's relationship with the West, which had long overlooked his authoritarian rule due to his role as a key partner in African development. The situation has been further complicated by the US election and a potential minerals deal between Congo and the US, leaving Kagame facing increased pressure to withdraw and sign a peace agreement. The future of the conflict depends largely on Trump's involvement, as he is offering drones to the Congo as part of a package to deter Rwanda.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, his family is advocating for the area where he died to be commemorated as a historic site that launched a global racial justice movement. The Minneapolis City Council is divided on how best to commemorate the site, with some supporting a pedestrian plaza and others favoring a flexible open street plan to revive local businesses. Dwight Alexander, a local business owner, said that the area has become a "ghost town" and that the bus routes and traffic need to return to help revive his and others' businesses. The tension over the square illustrates the complicated dance between commemoration and moving on that American cities have to contend with following tragedies.</p>

          <p>Despite a pledge to halt funding for fossil fuel projects at the G7 summit in 2022, Japan remains a major public financier of oil and gas production, particularly in overseas liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects. This investment contradicts Japan's role in leading the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC), which aims to promote cooperation on net-zero emissions in Asia, with many AZEC projects focusing on natural gas and carbon capture storage (CCS) technology. Critics argue that Japan's promotion of LNG as a "transitional fuel" is a form of greenwashing, as LNG involves more emissions than coal when processing and shipping are considered, potentially hindering the transition to renewable energy in countries like Indonesia.</p>

          <p>A new parenting framework called emotionally safe parenting emphasizes attunement to a child's emotional needs, promoting resilience, trust, and connection through open and honest conversations. This approach involves accepting a child's emotions without rushing to fix them, responding without shaming, and viewing "bad" behavior as stress signals rather than defiance. Emotionally safe parents take responsibility after conflicts, do internal work to become less reactive, and create an environment where their child feels safe expressing themselves, ultimately leading with calm authority and compassion.</p>
