            <p>With the tax filing deadline approaching, this article provides guidance on how to file for an extension. Filing an extension grants taxpayers an additional six months to submit their federal income tax return, offering relief from the pressure of the immediate deadline. While an extension provides more time to file, it does not extend the deadline to pay any taxes owed, and penalties may apply for late payments. The article outlines the various methods for filing an extension, including online options and paper forms.</p>

            <p>A new CDC study reveals that 3% of children, or one in 31, have been identified with autism, marking a significant increase. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cited the figures as evidence of a growing "epidemic" of autism, a claim criticized by experts. The CDC authors suggest the rise may reflect improved screening and access to autism services. The study also found higher prevalence rates among Asian, Black, and Hispanic children compared to White children.</p>

            <p>Trump's second term has shifted from agency cuts to retribution against perceived enemies, targeting officials from his first administration and law firms involved in cases he dislikes. The administration is also rewarding loyal allies, with the Justice Department pushing for the release of individuals convicted of crimes related to the Biden family and the January 6th Capitol attack. These actions are driven by Trump's view of government power as a tool for personal revenge rather than legitimate governmental purpose.</p>

Former President Obama criticized the administration's actions as an "unlawful and ham-handed attempt to stifle academic freedom."</p>

            <p>A civil case brought by four women against Andrew Tate is believed to be a legal first, a barrister for his accusers has said. The women accuse Tate of rape, assault and coercive control between 2013 and 2015. One claims he threatened to kill her, another says he made clear he would kill anyone who spoke to her, and a third claims he convinced her he had killed others. In written submissions, Anne Studd KC said she believed this was the first case of its kind in which it is argued that coercive control amounted to "intentional infliction of harm" - a legal concept similar to emotional distress. Tate denies the claims, saying they are a "pack of lies" and "gross fabrications".</p>
