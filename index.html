          <p>Former President Donald Trump has voiced his support for a "partnership" between US Steel and Nippon Steel, a shift from his earlier opposition to the Japanese firm's $14.9 billion bid. Trump announced the agreement on social media, emphasizing that US Steel would remain in the US with its headquarters in Pittsburgh. The deal aims to create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. Shares in US Steel surged following the announcement, though the United Steelworkers union had previously urged Trump to reject the bid due to concerns about undercutting the domestic industry.

          <p>The Pentagon lost contact with an Army helicopter for approximately 20 seconds near the Pentagon on May 1, leading to two commercial jets aborting their landings at a Washington airport. The loss of contact occurred because a temporary control tower antenna was not optimally positioned during the construction of a new control tower. Federal air traffic controllers also had difficulty pinpointing the helicopter's location due to conflicting data feeds. The Army has paused flights into and out of the Pentagon while working with the FAA to resolve safety concerns following a deadly midair collision in January.</p>

          <p>A new study by First Street projects a significant increase in foreclosures across the U.S. due to extreme weather events linked to climate change, potentially rising by 380% over the next decade. Low- to moderate-income households are particularly vulnerable, with much of their wealth tied to property values. The study estimates lenders will face increasing losses, potentially reaching $5.4 billion annually in ten years, due to mortgage defaults caused by weather-related damage and rising insurance premiums. The report emphasizes that integrating climate risk into loan assessments could help lenders and homeowners prepare for potential disasters.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened a 50% tariff on all goods from the European Union and a 25% import tax on iPhones not manufactured in the United States. The announcements have sparked worries globally, because they will make it more expensive and difficult for foreign businesses to sell goods in the world's largest economy. The EU has stated it remains committed to securing a deal, while warning again that it was prepared to retaliate. Shares in the US and EU fell on Friday after the latest threats, with Apple shares also declining.</p>

          <p>Defaulting on credit card debt has significant consequences, including long-term damage to your credit report. While default typically occurs after 180 days of missed payments, credit scores can be negatively impacted much sooner. A defaulted account can remain on your credit history for up to seven years, making it difficult to secure loans or rent an apartment. Options to consider before defaulting include hardship programs, credit counseling, debt settlement, or bankruptcy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a New York Times guest essay, Harvard professor Steven Pinker argues against the extreme criticism aimed at Harvard University, which he calls "Harvard Derangement Syndrome." Pinker acknowledges that Harvard has issues, including a lack of viewpoint diversity and incidents of cancelled speech. He claims the Trump administration's punitive actions, such as slashing research funding and blocking international students, are disproportionate and harmful to the university's mission of discovering and transmitting knowledge.</p>
