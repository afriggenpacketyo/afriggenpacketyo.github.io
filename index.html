          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin will not participate in the upcoming peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv in Turkey, despite earlier suggestions of direct negotiations.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had stated he would only participate if Putin were present, lowering expectations for a significant breakthrough.

          <p>Smartmatic has accused Fox News and Fox Corp of destroying text messages related to the 2020 election claims, alleging that key executives, including Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, deleted texts from November and December 2020, creating an evidentiary void. Smartmatic argues that these texts would reveal what Fox executives knew about the falsity of their broadcasts. Fox News denies the allegations, calling it a distraction from Smartmatic's failing case and accusing Smartmatic of failing to preserve evidence, including instructions from their CEO to delete relevant text messages. A New York appeals judge ruled that Fox News can access documents related to a DOJ investigation into Smartmatic executives.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed a pause to the enrollment of more low-income immigrants without legal status for state-funded health care benefits starting in 2026, citing economic uncertainty and a $12 billion budget deficit. Those already enrolled in Medi-Cal will not be affected by the freeze, and children will continue to receive benefits. Starting in 2027, adults with "unsatisfactory immigration status" on Medi-Cal will be required to pay a $100 monthly premium, aligning with the average cost paid by those on subsidized health plans through California's marketplace. Newsom's office estimates these changes will save the state $5.4 billion by 2028-2029.</p>

          <p>The NTSB released its final report on a 2023 plane crash in Virginia, determining the likely cause was pilot incapacitation due to loss of cabin pressure for undetermined reasons. The report also cited the decision to operate the airplane without supplemental oxygen as a contributing factor. The victims included Adina Azarian, her daughter Aria, Ariaâ€™s nanny, and the pilot. Investigators were unable to determine if the loss of cabin pressure happened quickly or over time, and the plane likely continued on autopilot until it crashed.</p>

The Bayesian was also "vulnerable" to lighter winds, with speeds of 73mph able to tip it over, and the owner and crew were unaware of this.
