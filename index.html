          <p>A recent poll indicates that a significant portion of British adults feel they lack control over various aspects of their lives, including their personal finances, physical health, and work-life balance. The survey, commissioned by Smart Energy GB, highlights that managing personal finances is a particular concern for many. To address this, Smart Energy GB has partnered with the Professional Darts Corporation and a sports psychologist to offer strategies for regaining control, including using smart meters to manage energy bills more effectively. The initiative aims to provide practical tools and techniques to help households feel more confident and in control of their daily lives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Volvo Cars' shares plummeted following an announcement of significant cost-cutting measures due to a sharp decline in operating profit. The company's CEO, Håkan Samuelsson, cited adverse currency effects, a drop in wholesales, and increased price competition in the electric vehicle market as factors contributing to the financial strain. The cost-cutting plan includes reductions in investments and potential layoffs at Volvo's global operations. In response to rising tariffs, the company is also considering adjusting its U.S. product lineup and manufacturing footprint to better align production with sales locations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is considering expanding the sugar tax to include milkshakes and pre-packaged lattes, aiming to further reduce sugar consumption and tackle obesity, particularly among children. This proposal would remove the existing exemption for milk-based drinks and non-dairy substitutes, incentivizing manufacturers to lower sugar content. While some argue the levy disproportionately affects lower-income families, health advocates welcome the potential impact on children's health. The government estimates that many milk-based drinks on the market would be subject to the tax unless their sugar content is reduced.</p>

          <p>In the midst of ongoing trade disputes with the United States, Chinese state media is encouraging citizens to draw inspiration from Mao Zedong's essay "On Protracted War." The Beijing Daily suggests that Mao's insights on persevering through conflict can bolster confidence in achieving eventual victory in the trade war. This call to revisit historical strategies comes as both countries have imposed tariffs on each other's goods, escalating economic hostilities. The commentary emphasizes the importance of maintaining resolve and rejecting defeatist attitudes in the face of prolonged challenges.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party has secured victory in Canada's federal election, fueled by a backlash against President Trump's policies and rhetoric. Carney, a political newcomer, successfully positioned himself as the experienced leader needed to navigate the country through economic challenges and threats to its sovereignty. While the Conservative opposition made significant gains, the Liberal Party's focus on standing up to Trump resonated with voters. The election results highlight divisions within Canada, particularly in oil-rich provinces, posing a challenge for Carney as he seeks to unite the country and address economic concerns.</p>

          <p>Sophie Power's experience as an ultrarunner, highlighted by a viral photo of her breastfeeding during a race, has led to significant changes in sports policies. Initially, Power's redundancy led her to take on the challenge of an ultramarathon, but her journey became a catalyst for positive change for women in sport. The photo brought attention to the challenges faced by mothers and women athletes, and the need for greater support and flexibility. Many major events, including the London Marathon, have since implemented pregnancy deferral policies, largely due to Power's advocacy.</p>

          <p>Tomoyuki Sugano delivered five scoreless innings to earn his third win as the Baltimore Orioles defeated the New York Yankees. The rookie pitcher struck out eight batters and allowed only five hits, navigating a bases-loaded situation in the first inning.

He effectively used his fastball and improved his pitch sequence, contributing to his success on the mound and maintaining a 3.00 ERA, the best among Orioles starters.</p>

          <p>Four former Hong Kong lawmakers have been released from prison after serving sentences related to national security convictions. Claudia Mo, Gary Fan, Jeremy Tam, and Kwok Ka-ki were part of the "Hong Kong 47" group, charged under national security legislation that has significantly altered Hong Kong's political landscape. Their arrests stemmed from participation in an unofficial primary poll in 2020, which authorities deemed a plot to subvert the government. Critics argue that the lawsuit was part of a broader assault by Beijing on rights and democracy in the former British colony.</p>

          <p>Shenzhen, China's tech hub, experienced slower economic growth in the first quarter of the year compared to the national average. The city's GDP growth of 5.2% fell short of China's overall gain of 5.4%, and its exports declined by 8.7% in yuan terms, while China recorded a 6.9% increase. Analysts attribute this to a high baseline from the previous year and pressures from the tariff war and industrial transition. Challenges include high costs for enterprises, insufficient orders, pressure on foreign trade, and the need to stimulate domestic demand.</p>

          <p>Amazon launched its first batch of internet satellites into orbit, marking its entry into the mega constellation market dominated by SpaceX's Starlink. The United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket carried 27 of Amazon's Project Kuiper satellites, which aim to provide fast, affordable broadband service globally. Amazon plans to put over 3,200 satellites into orbit, competing with SpaceX's existing constellation of over 8,000 Starlink satellites. The launch represents a significant step in Amazon's efforts to provide internet access to underserved areas.</p>

          <p>A recent Reform U.K. rally in Birmingham highlighted the party's ability to channel outrage amid a sullen political climate in Britain. With Labour struggling and public services in decline, Reform U.K., a far-right anti-immigration party, is gaining traction by tapping into voter discontent. The party's leader, Nigel Farage, draws inspiration from Donald Trump and aims to implement similar policies in Britain. While the party's manifesto is chaotic and its answers are lacking, it effectively serves as a vessel for voter fury.</p>
