          <p>A large-scale federal operation involving multiple agencies, including ICE, resulted in the detention of approximately 475 workers at a Hyundai electric vehicle battery plant construction site in Georgia. The raid was part of an ongoing criminal investigation into alleged unlawful employment practices. The South Korean government has expressed concern, urging the U.S. to ensure the rights of its citizens are not unfairly infringed upon. Construction at the battery plant, part of a major economic project for the state, has been paused.</p>

The unemployment rate edged up to 4.3%. The Bureau of Labor Statistics also revised June's figures downward to a net loss of 13,000 jobs, the first monthly decline since 2020.

          <p>Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee are investigating the recent firings of at least 20 Justice Department employees, including prosecutors, paralegals, and support staff. Many of the terminated individuals had worked on investigations related to former President Trump, including Special Counsel Jack Smith's probes. In a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, the senators demand justification for the dismissals, calling them a "pernicious abuse of power" and potentially unlawful. The firings are seen as part of a broader purge within the department.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that he expected the August jobs report to be more accurate following President Trump's firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner. Speaking before the report's release, Lutnick claimed that "holdovers from the Biden administration" were "rooting against America" and creating noise. He suggested the agency would now be more aligned with the administration's goal of producing correct numbers. The report, released shortly after, showed a significant hiring slowdown with only 22,000 jobs added.</p>

          <p>Ten years after the landmark detention of the "Feminist Five," China's feminist movement is grappling with a paradox of growing public awareness and shrinking public space. While issues like sexual harassment have gained visibility, the state has intensified its crackdown, banning influential feminist social media accounts and censoring online discussions. Activists are often smeared as agents of foreign influence, and the movement is officially framed as a subversive Western ideology. Despite the harsh conditions, activists remain resilient, continuing their fight through decentralized, informal networks.</p>

          <p>Four Democratic senators have sent a letter to the Smithsonian Institution's secretary, urging the organization to resist White House pressure to alter its historical exhibits. The letter follows President Trump's criticism of the Smithsonian as "WOKE" and a subsequent White House memo targeting specific exhibitions for allegedly presenting a negative narrative of American history. The senators emphasized that Congress, not the executive branch, has oversight of the Smithsonian and that it must remain free from political interference. The institution has reportedly formed an internal team to review the White House's demands.</p>

          <p>Despite a massive military parade in Beijing designed to project strength, rare acts of public defiance are surfacing in China. An activist named Qi Hong projected anti-communist slogans onto a high-rise building in Chongqing, criticizing the government's "hate propaganda" before fleeing the country. This protest was inspired by other recent acts of dissent, such as the 2022 Sitong Bridge protest against zero-COVID policies.

The author contrasts this with the intense media scrutiny of Joe Biden's age and health during his presidency. The piece suggests that while rampant speculation is unhelpful, the media has a responsibility to persistently investigate and report on the president's health, particularly when the White House provides minimal or obfuscating information about visible health issues.</p>

          <p>Gun Owners of America (GOA) is leading an aggressive campaign to repeal the 1934 National Firearms Act (NFA), which regulates items like machine guns, silencers, and short-barreled rifles. The group successfully lobbied to have the $200 tax on suppressors and short-barreled firearms removed in a recent budget bill signed by President Trump. Immediately after this legislative victory, the GOA, later joined by the NRA and 15 states, filed lawsuits aiming to eliminate the NFA's remaining registration requirements for these items entirely.

The stories, written before his film career, are set against the backdrop of South Korea's repressive 1980s military dictatorship. The reviewer notes that Lee uses evocative imagery of light and darkness not just for aesthetic effect but to communicate the ineffable losses and political paranoia of the era. The book is praised for asking readers to feel their way into the stories rather than simply being told a plot.</p>

          <p>Broadcom's stock price jumped 15% after the company announced it had secured a new $10 billion order for custom artificial intelligence chips from a fourth major customer. While Broadcom did not name the client, analysts at multiple firms widely believe it to be the AI startup OpenAI. The chipmaker, which already supplies major tech companies like Google and Meta, raised its AI revenue forecast based on the new deal. This development further solidifies Broadcom's position as a key player alongside Nvidia in the booming AI hardware market. (not investment advice)</p>

This underperformance occurred despite market volatility from elections and tariffs, a period when active managers often claim an advantage.

The primary reason for the discrepancy is the higher fees associated with active funds, which create a significant hurdle for outperformance. (not investment advice)</p>
