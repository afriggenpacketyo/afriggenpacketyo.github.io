          <p>The article examines four Washington D.C. private clubs—Executive Branch (Trump-aligned), Ned’s Club (bipartisan), Metropolitan Club (traditional establishment), and Cosmos Club (intellectual elite)—highlighting how they reflect the city's increasing political polarization.  Each club caters to a specific segment of the establishment, with Executive Branch serving as a haven for wealthy Trump supporters, while Ned’s Club attempts to bridge the partisan divide.  The older clubs, Metropolitan and Cosmos, maintain their traditional memberships but are seeking younger members. The article discusses the dynamics and significance of these clubs in the current political climate.</p>
