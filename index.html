          <p>President Trump indicated he might deploy active-duty Marines to California in response to ongoing immigration enforcement protests in Los Angeles, following Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's suggestion. This comes as California National Guard troops have already arrived in the city, a move criticized by Democratic governors, including California's Gavin Newsom. Trump stated the bar for sending Marines is "what I think it is," emphasizing a strong stance on law and order if there's perceived danger to the country or its citizens. Trump also accused protestors of spitting at police officers, adding a new saying, "they spit, we hit."</p>

          <p>Israel's defense minister, Israel Katz, has stated that the country will prevent an aid boat carrying Greta Thunberg and other activists from reaching the Gaza Strip, citing concerns that it would violate the naval blockade aimed at preventing Hamas from importing arms. Katz instructed the IDF to prevent the "Madeleine" flotilla from reaching Gaza, accusing Thunberg and others of being Hamas propagandists. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, operating the Madleen, accuses Israel of jamming their communications as they approach Gaza. The situation is further complicated by warnings from humanitarian workers about famine in Gaza, despite Israel allowing some basic aid into the region after a three-month blockade.</p>

          <p>Following violent clashes between law enforcement and protesters over President Trump's immigration enforcement operations, National Guard troops have arrived in downtown Los Angeles. Protests erupted after ICE operations resulted in the arrest of 44 unauthorized immigrants at a single job site, with 77 additional arrests in the greater L.A. area. Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the military deployment as "purposefully inflammatory," while Mayor Karen Bass called it a "chaotic escalation." ICE claims the operations resulted in the arrest of a "domestic abuser" and a "child rapist," while Representative Nanette Barragán states that ICE enforcement is expected daily for the next 30 days in L.A. County.</p>

The plane, identified as a de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft, was carrying skydivers, and the cause of the crash is currently under investigation by the FAA.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has yet to agree to a funding deal with the Treasury just three days before the Spending Review, while other ministers have reached settlements. Police funding is reportedly one of the contentious issues, with Home Office ministers believing there isn't enough money to recruit the additional 13,000 new police and community support officers Labour promised. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said police need to "do their bit" towards reforming public services, while Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces pressure from all departments for additional funding. The Spending Review is expected to include extra money for the NHS, but other government departments will likely see budget squeezes.</p>

          <p>Mezhova, a Ukrainian town close to the Donetsk region, is bracing for a potential Russian advance as Russia claims to be moving into the surrounding Dnipropetrovsk region. The town's original residents have largely fled, replaced by displaced individuals, and an evacuation order for children has increased the sense of panic. Local teacher Olga Motuzenko, who fled fighting in Pokrovsk, expressed fear that the Russians could arrive within two days, while Lieutenant Colonel Oleksander acknowledged that fighting is occurring nearby and that Russian forces are advancing slowly. Despite the looming threat, Oleksander remains defiant, stating that Ukrainian resistance will not change, regardless of Russian claims.</p>

Ghalibaf criticized the U.S. plan as a sign of dishonesty and accused the Americans of seeking a "unilateral" agreement. Negotiations between the two countries have been ongoing, mediated by Oman, aimed at reviving a landmark agreement that restricted Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. The IAEA Board of Governors is scheduled to discuss Iran's nuclear activities in Vienna, and Iran has warned it may reduce cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog if a resolution is adopted against it.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plan to deploy troops to suppress protests in Los Angeles raises legal questions, as he has long considered using the military to quell demonstrations in blue-state cities. The move is based on Title 10 Authority, which allows the deployment of National Guard troops, but it also raises concerns about potential violations of the Posse Comitatus Act. This federal law restricts the use of the U.S. military for law enforcement within the country, except in cases explicitly authorized by the Constitution or an Act of Congress.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military reports that it has located and identified the body of Mohammed Sinwar, the military leader of Hamas in Gaza, discovered in a tunnel underneath the European Hospital in Khan Younis. The IDF claims to have verified the body's identity through DNA checks, though Hamas has not confirmed his death. Sinwar, 49, was allegedly killed in an air strike on May 13. The IDF says Sinwar's body was found alongside that of Mohammad Sabaneh, the commander of Hamas's Rafah Brigade, along with items belonging to them.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned California Governor Gavin Newsom that he would be guilty of “criminal tax evasion” if he withholds the state’s tax payments to the federal government. This warning follows Newsom's threat to cut tax payments in response to reports that President Trump was preparing federal funding cuts targeting California. Bessent criticized Newsom's comments as “extremely reckless” and advised him to pursue a tax-cutting plan for California instead. The dispute arises amid escalating tensions between California and the Trump administration over various policy issues.</p>

The deployment marks the first time since 1965 that a president has sent troops into a state without a state request.

Defense Minister Israel Katz stated the blockade is essential to prevent weapons from reaching Hamas and warned the crew, including Greta Thunberg, to turn back. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC) contends the vessel is carrying humanitarian aid and is prepared for a potential Israeli attack.

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously decided Ames v. Ohio, a case directly relevant to diversity, equity, and inclusion. The facts of the case are simple. In 2004 the Ohio Department of Youth Services hired a heterosexual woman named Marlean Ames to work as an executive secretary. By 2019, she’d worked her way up to program administrator and set her sights higher — applying for a management position in the agency’s Office of Quality and Improvement. The department interviewed Ames for the job but decided to hire someone else, a lesbian. The department then demoted Ames and replaced her with a gay man. Believing she’d been discriminated against on the basis of her sexual orientation, she filed suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>

While Jude operates as a number 10, Jobe can play as a defensive or box-to-box midfielder, even deputizing as a central forward.

These include tone of voice or attitude, family relations, household chores, communication styles, and money. Contempt, signaled by a sour tone or attitude, is a major predictor of divorce. Arguments about family often reflect unmet needs and misalignments, while chore disputes stem from uneven labor distribution. The psychologist offers strategies for navigating these conflicts, such as naming the effect, reassuring one another, and redistributing tasks.</p>
