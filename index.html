          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has strongly criticized Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, comparing his economic policies to those of former Prime Minister Liz Truss, whose mini-budget caused financial turmoil. Starmer argued that Farage's promises of unfunded tax cuts are a "fantasy" that would crash the economy and negatively impact family finances. He contrasted his own approach, emphasizing stable finances to improve the lives of working people. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has questioned the feasibility of Reform's tax plans, estimating they could cost between Â£50 billion and Â£80 billion annually. Optimism is relatively low as this article discusses potential economic instability.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Representative Michael Grimm, who represented Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, has received a full pardon from President Trump for his 2014 conviction on tax fraud and related charges. Grimm was found guilty of underreporting wages and revenue from his Manhattan restaurant, paying unauthorized workers in cash, and filing false tax documents. Despite his indictment, Grimm was reelected in 2014 but resigned after pleading guilty to one count of tax fraud, serving eight months in prison before being released in 2016. In 2024, Grimm was paralyzed from the chest down after being thrown from a horse during a polo tournament; this article relays the events.</p>

          <p>A South African court sentenced Racquel "Kelly" Smith to life in prison for kidnapping and selling her six-year-old daughter, Joshlin Smith, who went missing in February of last year. The court also sentenced Smith's boyfriend and a mutual friend to life imprisonment for human trafficking, as well as an additional 10 years for kidnapping. The judge emphasized the lack of remorse and manipulative nature of Smith, whose actions horrified the nation and sparked a massive search operation. The case drew national attention, particularly after prosecutors alleged Smith sold her daughter to a traditional healer for approximately $1,100.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is arranging a charter flight to return a Guatemalan man, known as O.C.G., to the U.S. after a judge ruled his deportation violated due process. O.C.G., who sought asylum due to violent attacks in Guatemala, was deported to Mexico despite an immigration judge's prior ruling that he could not be removed to any country other than Guatemala without additional proceedings. The Justice Department admitted that a sworn statement claiming O.C.G. had no fear of being sent to Mexico was made in error. This situation arose after O.C.G. reported being held for ransom and sexually assaulted in Mexico during his second attempt to reach the United States.</p>

Republicans recently bypassed the filibuster's 60-vote threshold to pass a bill striking down a California air pollution law. The article also examines the potential implications of these changes, including the possibility that the minority party will seek to eliminate the filibuster when it regains the majority.

          <p>This article examines the implications of a recent US court ruling against some of President Trump's tariffs on the UK's trade deal with the US. While the UK has secured a deal to reduce tariffs on cars to 10% and eliminate them on steel and aluminum, this agreement is not yet in effect. The court ruling does block Trump's imposition of blanket tariffs of 10% on other UK goods, but the White House intends to appeal the decision. The impact of the tariff deal remains uncertain, making it difficult for businesses to plan and invest confidently.</p>

          <p>Thailand is moving to restrict cannabis use to medicinal purposes only, reversing its 2022 decriminalization policy that led to a surge in cannabis dispensaries. Under the new medical bill, dispensaries can only sell cannabis to licensed shops or customers with medical prescriptions. Activists predict a 90% drop in cannabis shops, potentially impacting the tourism and agriculture sectors. This shift follows concerns about recreational use, illegal distribution, and smuggling, with officials also citing instances of tourists being arrested for taking cannabis products out of Thailand.</p>

          <p>Israeli ministers have announced the approval of 22 new Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, marking the biggest expansion in decades. The decision includes legalizing existing outposts and reinforcing the eastern axis of Israel. Palestinian officials have condemned the move as a dangerous escalation, while the Israeli anti-settlement watchdog Peace Now warned that it would dramatically reshape the West Bank and entrench the occupation further. This action is seen as a setback to renewed efforts to revive a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>Complaints about substandard living conditions in social housing in England have increased fivefold in the past five years, prompting the Housing Ombudsman to warn of "simmering anger" and potential social unrest. The report cites issues such as asbestos, electrical and fire safety hazards, pest control, and damp and mold as key drivers of complaints. The ombudsman calls for a transformative overhaul of the system, including an independent review of funding practices and a national tenant body to strengthen tenant voice and landlord accountability. Prime Minister Starmer says the right to safe housing is central to his government's work.</p>

          <p>Three large wildfires in northeastern Minnesota are nearing containment after burning for weeks, while crews also battle fires in neighboring Canadian provinces. All Minnesota evacuations have been lifted, with officials reporting that the fires now cover about 30,000 acres.

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Trump's sweeping global trade tariffs, dealing a blow to his economic policies, stating that the president did not have unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every one of the world's countries. The court said the US Constitution gave Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations, which the president cannot supersede. The Trump administration said it would appeal within minutes of the ruling. Stock markets in Asia rose on Thursday morning following the ruling, and US stock futures also jumped (not investment advice).</p>
