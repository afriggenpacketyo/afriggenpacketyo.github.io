          <p>AI specialists warn of the escalating nuclear risk from the military use of AI, particularly concerning nuclear weapons.  They emphasize the need for international cooperation and human control over AI in the military sector to mitigate the potential for catastrophic outcomes, highlighting the increased adoption of AI by numerous countries, including nuclear powers.
