          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lauded China's generative artificial intelligence models, highlighting their open-source nature as a key catalyst for global progress and AI safety. His praise came during a supply chain expo in Beijing, where he emphasized the significant number of Chinese developers building on Nvidia's platform. This context is crucial as Nvidia expects to soon resume shipments of its H20 AI chip to China, after new U.S. export restrictions had previously halted sales and impacted the company's revenue.

Murdoch never revealed the location of Falconio's body, denying his family the chance for closure for over two decades. He was also convicted of the attempted kidnapping and assault of Falconio's girlfriend, Joanne Lees, who managed to escape the attack.

          <p>A Seoul court has commenced the retrial of Kim Jae-gyu, the intelligence chief who assassinated authoritarian President Park Chung-hee in 1979 and was subsequently executed for insurrection. Kim remains a divisive historical figure, viewed by some as a patriot who ended a dictatorship and by others as a traitor motivated by ambition. His family successfully fought for the retrial, arguing the original military trial was unjust and involved torture, a claim the court accepted as a valid reason to re-examine the case.</p>

          <p>As Congress considers the "GENIUS Act," this article explains the function of stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar to reduce price volatility. The bipartisan bill would create federal rules and consumer protections for the $250 billion market, defining which digital currencies can legally be referred to as stablecoins. Supporters argue it will enable faster, lower-cost payments, while major financial institutions like Citigroup and JPMorgan are already exploring issuing their own tokens. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article in the People's Daily, a key Communist Party newspaper, has urged local governments across China to use their legislative powers as a "propeller" for economic and social development. The piece argues that creating stable, rule-of-law-based systems that are tailored to local realities can foster a better operating environment for all market entities. This reflects a strategic shift from relying solely on top-down administrative orders to using legal frameworks to manage economic issues and drive growth.</p>
