          <p>Intense Israeli bombardment in Gaza City's Zeitoun neighbourhood has forced thousands of Palestinians to flee what the local municipality calls a "catastrophic" situation. The Israeli military plans to move a million people to southern camps while also allowing aid tents back into the territory. Meanwhile, in Israel, a general strike is planned to protest the government's occupation strategy, which families of hostages argue endangers those held by Hamas. The ongoing conflict has led to severe humanitarian crises, including widespread displacement and malnutrition, as reported by the UN and other international bodies.</p>

          <p>British fighter Lerone Murphy has emerged as a top contender for the UFC featherweight title after a spectacular first-round knockout of Aaron Pico at UFC 319. Murphy, who accepted the fight on just three weeks' notice, used a spinning back elbow to secure his 17th career victory and called for a championship bout against Alexander Volkanovski. The event also featured a dominant title win for Khamzat Chimaev in the middleweight division, who set a new record for strikes landed in a single UFC fight. Murphy's performance earned him a $50,000 bonus and praise from commentators.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has mandated an end to the Air Canada flight attendants' strike, ordering both the airline and the union into binding arbitration less than 12 hours after the work stoppage began. The strike had already stranded over 100,000 travelers and was impacting about 700 flights per day during the peak summer season. Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu cited economic risks, including U.S. tariffs, as a reason for the swift intervention. The union criticized the move as a violation of their right to strike, while business groups welcomed the decision to restore air travel services.</p>

          <p>Phoenix cold case detectives successfully captured suspected "canal killer" Bryan Patrick Miller through an elaborate undercover sting at a Chili's restaurant in 2015. Posing as a security consultant, a detective arranged a meeting to covertly obtain Miller's DNA from a water glass. This was necessary to compare against evidence from the brutal murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas in the early 1990s. Despite the detective's initial skepticism that the mild-mannered Miller, known locally as the "Zombie Hunter," could be the killer, the DNA was a perfect match, leading to his immediate arrest.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its stance on exporting certain AI chips to China, proposing a novel "revenue-sharing" agreement with companies like Nvidia and AMD. Under the deal, the companies would be allowed to sell specific lower-end AI chips to Chinese firms in exchange for sharing 15% of the revenue with the U.S. government. This move, which critics have called a potential tax on exports, raises concerns among trade experts that it sets a dangerous precedent of making national security-based export controls appear transactional. The legality of the arrangement is reportedly still being examined by the Department of Commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Museum of China in Beijing is currently hosting an exhibition of works by the 19th-century realist painter Ilya Repin, who was born in what is now Ukraine. The exhibition, organized in collaboration with Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery, is designed to emphasize the artist's "Russianness" and his connection to the Russian Empire. This presentation contrasts with Ukraine's position, as its Ministry of Culture declared Repin's works part of its national cultural heritage earlier this year. The collection includes 48 oil paintings and 44 sketches from various periods of the artist's life.</p>

          <p>22-year-old fast bowler Sonny Baker has received his first call-up to the England cricket team after a series of standout performances, particularly in The Hundred tournament. Known for his inquisitive nature and dedication, Baker has overcome past stress fractures and caught the attention of selectors with his high-speed bowling. The Hampshire player, who once considered a teaching career, has been impressing in domestic and Lions tours, earning an England development contract earlier in the year. His call-up from coach Brendon McCullum marks a significant step in the young bowler's promising career.</p>

          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney has posted on social media for the first time since her controversial "Good Jeans" ad campaign for American Eagle was released three weeks ago. The campaign, which played on the double meaning of "genes" and "jeans," drew a mixed response, with some critics labeling it "tone-deaf" while others praised it for challenging "woke" advertising. Sweeney, who has not publicly addressed the debate, shared photos from a night out with friends. American Eagle previously released a statement clarifying the campaign was always intended to be about the jeans themselves.</p>

According to the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers were injured when a subject refused to exit his vehicle and drove at them. However, the driver contacted police claiming masked men shot at him, and video from a justice coalition appears to show agents breaking the car's windows before shots are fired.

          <p>A long-standing principle in U.S. traffic engineering, known as the "85th percentile rule," is coming under increased scrutiny amid rising road fatalities. The rule suggests that speed limits should be set based on the speed at or below which 85% of drivers travel, effectively letting drivers dictate the legal speed. Critics argue this creates a dangerous feedback loop where speeding leads to higher limits, especially in urban areas with pedestrians and cyclists. Spurred by federal guidance, some states are now modifying their approach to consider factors like road use and crash frequency, though others still adhere to the traditional method.</p>

The technique produces "ionic glassy tissue" that preserves the organ's original morphology while enhancing the brightness of fluorescent dyes used to highlight specific cells and molecules. This process allows for highly accurate and vivid 3D imaging of biological structures. The scientists also noted that the tissues form a stable, glassy solid at low temperatures, enabling long-term storage for future study.</p>

While increased public awareness may be leading more people to seek prompt medical care, the trend is a public health concern due to the risk of tick-borne illnesses like Lyme disease.

While the judge acknowledged the abuse was proven, she ultimately rejected the insanity defense.

          <p>Chinese scientists have unveiled a design for a hypersonic drone carrier that revives a concept once explored by NASA known as the "scissor wing." The innovative design features a single, centrally mounted wing that can rotate up to 90 degrees during flight. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, but as it approaches Mach 5, it pivots to become parallel, turning the entire aircraft into a "waverider" for high-speed efficiency. This variable geometry aims to solve the classic aerospace challenge of balancing low-speed lift with high-speed drag.</p>

          <p>A couples therapist and executive counselor outlines five common psychological triggers that can lead individuals to risk their careers and families by having an affair. These reasons often stem from deep-seated issues rather than simple malice, and include a history of always being "good" and repressing personal desires, perfectionism as a response to trauma, and having poor boundaries developed from a parentified childhood. Additionally, being in an emotionally withholding or abusive marriage can serve as a catalyst, as can the grief from a recent major loss, which prompts a re-evaluation of life priorities.</p>

          <p>A small private plane made a successful emergency landing on Interstate 805 in San Diego on Saturday afternoon, causing no injuries. The aircraft was reportedly experiencing mechanical issues shortly after taking off from Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport. The California Highway Patrol responded to the scene, and all southbound lanes of the highway near Carroll Canyon Road were temporarily closed to traffic while authorities investigated and removed the plane. The Federal Aviation Administration is also investigating the incident. The highway was fully reopened several hours later.</p>
