            <p>House Republicans narrowly advanced a budget plan crucial for extending President Trump's tax cuts, overcoming initial opposition within their party. The budget resolution, facing a final vote, outlines spending cuts and serves as a blueprint for Trump's priorities, including border security and defense. Trump urged GOP holdouts to support the bill, emphasizing party unity and promising electoral success. However, some Republicans criticized the spending cuts as insufficient, highlighting divisions within the party regarding fiscal policy and the Senate's role in the process.</p>

            <p>Former central banker Mark Carney, recently elected as Canada's new prime minister, called a snap election for April 28th. This decision follows calls for a vote after former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's resignation and escalating trade tensions with the US under President Trump. The election pits Carney's Liberal Party against the Conservatives, New Democrats, and Bloc Quebecois, with recent polls showing a tightening race as voters prioritize responding to Trump's economic policies. The outcome will determine Canada's leadership and its approach to navigating the ongoing trade conflict.</p>

            <p>A jury is deliberating in the case of Monica Sementilli, accused of orchestrating the murder of her celebrity hair stylist husband, Fabio Sementilli. Prosecutors allege that Monica conspired with her lover, Robert Baker, to kill her husband for financial gain. The prosecution presented evidence of text messages between Monica and Baker, as well as testimony from an accomplice who claims Baker told him Monica wanted her husband dead. The defense argues that Monica was duped by Baker and that her only crime was adultery.</p>

Critics argue that these are not true de-extinctions but rather designer dogs, and question the moral responsibility humans have for these novel animals. The nascent field of de-extinction faces challenges, including the risk of suffering and trauma for surrogate parents and newborn clones. The focus on spectacle overshadows the need for conservation efforts aimed at protecting existing endangered species.</p>

While the administration claims this pivot was part of a long-term strategy, others see it as a market-driven reaction to rising bond yields and economic concerns. The shift suggests a potential shift in influence within Trump's administration, with Wall Street-aligned advisors gaining the upper hand.

            <p>Billionaire supporters of President Trump, including Bill Ackman, have publicly called for a halt to tariffs. Ackman warned of potential bankruptcies for small businesses if the tariffs were not paused. Other billionaire moguls -- including investor and philanthropist Stanley Druckenmiller, Citdel owner Kenneth Griffin and even Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a senior adviser to the president -- have spoken out against Trump's tariffs after supporting the president's re-election campaign. Trump authorized a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for most countries that went into effect Wednesday morning.</p>
