          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) has announced that personal customer data, including contact details, dates of birth, and online order histories, was stolen in a recent cyberattack. While useable payment details and account passwords were not compromised, customers are advised to reset their passwords as a precaution. The company is working to restore normal services, which have been disrupted since the attack three weeks ago, and has emailed all website customers to alert them to the breach. M&S believes the hackers used the DragonForce cyber crime service, which employs a double extortion method, and is cooperating with authorities to investigate the incident.</p>

          <p>French actor GÃ©rard Depardieu was found guilty of sexual assault in a French court, stemming from incidents on a film set in 2021 involving two women. The court stated that both women provided consistent and credible accounts of the assaults, with witness testimony supporting their claims. Depardieu received an 18-month suspended prison term and was ordered to pay damages to the victims. His lawyer has indicated that he will appeal the verdict, which is considered a significant moment for France's #MeToo movement and the broader conversation around defining assault within the film industry. The case had been delayed multiple times due to scheduling and medical reasons before the trial commenced in March 2025.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst "heightened uncertainty," the US economy faces a growing risk of stagflation, characterized by higher unemployment, higher inflation, and slower economic growth. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged these rising risks, primarily fueled by swiftly shifting tariff policies. This uncertainty could lead businesses to delay hiring, expansion, and investment, hindering economic growth. Consumers can prepare by paying down high-interest debts and boosting emergency savings to mitigate the potential impact of stagflation on their finances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering implementing significant cuts to prescription drug prices in the United States, potentially aligning them with prices in other developed countries. This initiative aims to lower medication costs for Medicare, Medicaid, and treatments covered by private health insurance, and could include popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic. The proposal directs the US health secretary to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies, potentially enforcing a "most favored nation" pricing model. The pharmaceutical industry is expected to strongly resist these measures, warning of potential impacts on research and development investments. </p>

          <p>Japanese automaker Nissan plans to cut an additional 11,000 jobs globally and close seven factories due to weak sales and financial losses. Falling sales in China and heavy discounting in the US have negatively impacted earnings. This latest round of cutbacks brings the total number of layoffs announced by the company to approximately 20,000, representing about 15% of its workforce. The company also reported an annual loss of 670 billion yen ($4.5 billion; Â£3.4 billion), further strained by US President Donald Trump's tariffs.</p>

The newspaper argued that Trump's approach has damaged America's credibility and undermined efforts to rally international support against Beijing's mercantilism. The editorial board suggested that markets forced Trump to abandon his belief that high tariff walls would usher in a new "golden age," which the Journal characterized as "more leaden than golden."</p>
