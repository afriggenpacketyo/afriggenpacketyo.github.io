          <p>Several individuals have died and others are injured following a shooting at a school in Graz, Austria, according to local police. Austrian state police confirmed fatalities at the BORG DreierschÃ¼tzengasse school, which was subsequently evacuated. Emergency vehicles, including tactical units, were dispatched to the scene as authorities worked to secure the area and investigate the incident. The city of Graz, located in southern Austria, is the second-largest Austrian city with a population of approximately 300,000. Optimism here is low given the tragic nature of the event and the lack of survivors. </p>

The 26-year-old, now playing for Italian side Benetton Treviso, is eligible to represent Samoa due to a change in World Rugby's rules allowing players to switch nations after a three-year stand-down period. Umaga's father, Mike, represented Samoa internationally, and his uncle is the legendary New Zealand centre Tana Umaga.

          <p>Disorder erupted in Ballymena, County Antrim, with houses set on fire following a protest related to an alleged sexual assault.

The unrest followed a peaceful march earlier in the day, hours after two teenage boys appeared in court accused of the sexual assault of a teenage girl, with the accused denying the charges. The violence has been described as "unwanted and unwarranted" by the area's MP, with tensions reportedly exacerbated by demographic changes due to immigration. </p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are considering legislation that would cut billions in funding for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), potentially impacting millions of Americans, including a significant portion of their own constituents. A recent KFF poll reveals that 45% of adults enrolled in ACA marketplace health plans identify as Republicans, many of whom are self-employed and reside in states that did not expand Medicaid. Experts suggest that cutting ACA funding and failing to extend tax credits could leave approximately 15 million people without health insurance. This situation highlights a potential conflict between Republican policy goals and the healthcare needs of their constituents (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>American fund managers are lobbying Congress to amend Section 899 of President Trump's tax bill, fearing it could trigger a rapid withdrawal of foreign investments from the U.S. The Investment Company Institute (ICI) warns that the provision, intended to penalize foreign-owned firms from countries with "unfair foreign taxes," could inadvertently impact most foreign investments in U.S. stock markets. The ICI argues that the bill could depress U.S. equity markets and harm both U.S. companies and investors if foreign investors pull out to avoid the tax.

          <p>President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles without the consent of Governor Gavin Newsom has sparked debate about the extent of presidential powers during civil unrest. Legal experts are questioning the administration's reliance on a rarely used statute, arguing that it does not provide sufficient authority for the deployment. The move has been criticized as unprecedented, with concerns raised about the potential for overstepping legal boundaries and violating the Posse Comitatus Act. The situation highlights the ongoing tension between federal and state authority in managing civil unrest. </p>
