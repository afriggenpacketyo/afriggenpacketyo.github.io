          <h2>British MPs Denied Entry to Israel, Citing Censorship Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two British MPs, Abtisam Mohamed and Yuan Yang, were denied entry into Israel, sparking accusations of censorship and control by the Israeli government. The MPs, who were traveling as part of a parliamentary delegation, believe their denial was based on their political opinions and alignment with international law, particularly regarding criticism of Israeli policies. The Israeli embassy stated it would not allow entry to individuals acting against the state. This incident has caused diplomatic tensions, with some UK officials condemning Israel's actions while others defend its right to control its borders.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to discuss various issues, including the latest Israeli military operations in Gaza and newly imposed US tariffs. Trump praised Netanyahu as the best president Israel has ever seen, while Netanyahu hoped to mitigate the impact of the 17% tariffs set to affect imports from Israel. The meeting occurred amidst market volatility, with the Nasdaq, S&P 500, and Dow Jones experiencing fluctuations following significant losses. Before meeting Netanyahu, Trump held a phone call with leaders from France, Egypt, and Jordan to discuss regional matters.</p>

          <p>Several prominent business figures, including Bill Ackman and Elon Musk, have voiced concerns over President Trump's newly implemented tariffs, citing potential economic damage. Ackman warned of an "economic nuclear war," while Musk advocated for a zero-tariff situation between the US and Europe.

These criticisms come as markets experience a selloff following Trump's tariff announcement, with the Dow suffering its worst week since 2020 and the Nasdaq entering a bear market.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As healthcare costs rise, long-term care insurance can help cover expenses not typically covered by Medicare, such as nursing homes and in-home care. Several companies offer long-term care insurance, each with different strengths, including GoldenCare for comparing providers, Northwestern Mutual for discounts, New York Life for seniors, Mutual of Omaha for policy customization, and Nationwide as the best overall option. Long-term care insurance can be worth it for many between minimal and wealthy extremes, because it provides significant non-monetary benefits such as access to care coordination services. Alternatives to long-term care insurance include hybrid life insurance policies and self-funding.</p>

          <p>Auto stocks are experiencing a decline as President Trump's tariffs threaten to significantly impact sales, with domestic automakers like GM, Stellantis, Ford, and Tesla all slipping.

          <p>Amid concerns about a potential bear market triggered by President Trump's tariffs, historical data suggests that market downturns are often the best times to invest, assuming one has the resources. While it's psychologically challenging to buy when the market is struggling, history shows that markets tend to bounce back and reach new highs. The S&P 500 has experienced numerous corrections and bear markets throughout history, with an average recovery time of four months for corrections and 23 months for reaching a new peak after a bear market.

          <p>Southampton Football Club sacked manager Ivan Juric after their relegation from the Premier League, marking the sixth managerial change in their past two campaigns. The decision to dismiss Juric, who won only two of sixteen matches, has raised questions about the club's direction and whether sacking Russell Martin earlier in the season was a mistake. The club faces the challenge of finding a new manager to lead them back to the Premier League, with many questioning if they should have kept faith with Martin, who led them to promotion.</p>

          <p>Despite fears of an economic slowdown due to President Trump's tariffs, the 10-year Treasury yield rose back above 4%. This increase occurred even as traders raised expectations for lower Federal Reserve rates, anticipating a weaker economy. Investors are concerned that international investors may no longer view the U.S. as a safe haven, causing Treasury prices to fall and yields to rise. The tariffs have stoked fears of a global trade war, with major trading partners retaliating with their own tariffs.</p>

          <p>John Mulaney's new Netflix talk show, 'Everybody's Live With John Mulaney', is experimenting with a comedy-first approach, prioritizing humor over traditional late-night formats. The show embraces absurdity and randomness, harkening back to chattier, looser eras of talk shows like 'The Merv Griffin Show'. With a focus on a particular subject each episode and live calls, Mulaney's show is an attempt to remake the late-night genre. This approach allows for more creative freedom and a departure from the typical celebrity-driven format.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to block a lower court order requiring the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The administration argues that the Maryland judge lacked the authority to issue the order and that U.S. officials cannot compel El Salvador to return Garcia. Garcia, who had been granted protection from deportation in 2019, is being held at a maximum-security prison in El Salvador.</p>

          <p>Restaurant stocks experienced a decline due to investors' fears of a potential recession and a slowdown in sales, fueled by President Trump's tariffs. Analysts do not expect the tariffs to directly impact most restaurant companies but anticipate that the resulting inflation will pressure consumer spending. Starbucks' shares fell following a downgrade, citing near-term economic headwinds, while concerns about trade tensions also put international sales at risk. The tariffs could also impact coffee costs, as they have been imposed on key coffee exporters.</p>
