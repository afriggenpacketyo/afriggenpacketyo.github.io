          <p>Japan has urged China to prevent future near misses involving military aircraft after a Chinese warplane reportedly flew dangerously close to a Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force patrol plane over the Pacific. The Japanese Defense Ministry stated that the Chinese J-15 fighter made dangerous maneuvers, including passing in front of the MSDF aircraft at close range. Japan lodged a protest with China, demanding an end to such flights, emphasizing the need for safe and professional conduct in international airspace to avoid potential collisions.

          <p>U.S. officials have reportedly been informed that Israel is prepared to launch an operation into Iran, raising concerns about potential retaliation against American sites in neighboring Iraq. This development prompted the U.S. State Department to advise non-emergency government officials to leave Iraq due to heightened regional tensions. Despite the potential for conflict, President Trump's Middle East envoy is still planning to meet with Iran for a sixth round of talks on the country's nuclear program. The situation remains delicate, with ongoing negotiations aimed at limiting Iran's nuclear capabilities and preventing further escalation in the region.</p>

The astronomers, during the Ming dynasty, observed a new star and described its size, color, and brightness in a formal report to the emperor. This rediscovered account confirms that the phenomenon was a nova, a slow and temporary brightening caused by a dying star. The unprecedented details helped researchers narrow down the star's possible position, contributing to a better understanding of celestial events and historical astronomical observations.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing intense protests against President Trump's immigration policies, particularly those orchestrated by Stephen Miller, a top White House aide. Miller has ordered immigration officials to increase arrests and deportations, leading to a more aggressive phase of ICE raids across the city. The protests, drawing a diverse group of Angelenos, reflect deep-seated concerns about the right to belong and the impact of these policies on families and communities. Miller's actions are seen as a direct challenge to Los Angeles's long-standing acceptance of undocumented workers, escalating tensions and sparking a culture war with real troops. </p>

          <p>The government's Spending Review aims to mark a turning point, focusing on long-term capital spending to transform the public realm and boost economic potential. This approach requires patience, as the benefits of such investments may not be immediately apparent. Day-to-day spending is limited, even cut in some areas, at a time when many voters feel financially strained. The government is banking on the long-term benefits of strategic investments to outweigh short-term dissatisfaction, a gamble in an era of political volatility and public impatience. </p>

This discovery provides insights into how tyrannosaurs evolved from small hunters to formidable giants. The new species exhibits early evolutionary stages of key features, such as skull anatomy for a strong jaw, that contributed to the tyrannosaurs' dominance. </p>
