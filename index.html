        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. wholesale prices, measured by the Producer Price Index (PPI), increased by 0.9% in July, significantly surpassing the anticipated 0.2% gain. This surge, the largest monthly rise since June 2022, suggests that inflation remains a considerable threat to the American economy. The increase was largely driven by services inflation, particularly in trade services and machinery wholesaling, and portfolio management fees. This unexpected rise in pipeline prices has slightly reduced market optimism for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September, despite recent consumer price index data.

          <p>The Kremlin has provided specifics for the upcoming Trump-Putin summit in Alaska, scheduled to begin around 11:30 a.m. local time. The primary agenda will be the war in Ukraine, alongside economic cooperation discussions, with both leaders holding a joint press conference afterward. This meeting follows Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's talks with UK Prime Minister Starmer and a virtual meeting with Trump and European leaders, where Trump assured them of prioritizing a ceasefire. Ukraine, however, expresses apprehension about being sidelined and fears any decisions made without its input could be detrimental to its territorial integrity.</p>

          <p>China's ambassador, Xiao Qian, stated that China and Australia are prepared to move beyond stabilizing their relationship towards more productive economic cooperation. He highlighted the potential for closer alignment between Australia's mining sector and China's manufacturing, envisioning joint exploration, technology sharing, and enhanced capacity. Xiao emphasized the "highly compatible" development strategies of both nations, suggesting they can complement each other to build green, secure, and sustainable industrial chains. This marks a positive shift after a period of strained ties and export curbs that began in 2019-2020.</p>

          <p>China has introduced its first domestically developed e-beam lithography tool, named Xizhi, marking a significant milestone in its chipmaking capabilities. Developed by Zhejiang University, this machine uses a focused electron beam to create chip circuits on silicon wafers. This advancement is crucial for China's national push for technological self-reliance, especially in response to US export restrictions on high-tech equipment. The delivery of Xizhi is expected to help overcome current impasses in advanced chip manufacturing, bolstering China's research and development efforts in this critical sector.</p>

          <p>A school board in Kern County, California, has voted to ban transgender athletes from girls' sports, aligning with the federal definition of Title IX and defying state policy. This decision occurs amidst an ongoing lawsuit between California and President Trump's administration over the issue of male athletes competing in girls' sports. The vote makes Kern County the first public school board in California to side with Trump, who signed an executive order earlier this year to ban such participation nationally. The move reflects a broader public and institutional debate on fairness, religious freedom, and transgender inclusion in sports.</p>

          <p>Sky Sports is reportedly close to securing a new six-year deal for exclusive UK live broadcasting rights for golf's US Open, fending off competition from Netflix. This extension would solidify Sky's dominant position in UK televised golf, as it already holds rights for major men's and women's tournaments, the Ryder Cup, PGA Tour, and DP World Tour. Netflix, despite making a credible offer, appears to be focusing on standalone events that attract new subscribers, rather than year-round content. This reflects Netflix's growing interest in sports content, following successful ventures like the Mike Tyson-Jake Paul fight.</p>

          <p>The Taliban's takeover of Kabul in 2021 has significantly worsened Pakistan's internal security, emboldening extremist groups like the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and ISKP. These factions have intensified attacks, with violence levels returning to those seen in 2015, partly due to the Afghan Taliban's alleged logistical support for the TTP. Pakistan's initial optimism about the Taliban's return has shifted to concern, leading to cross-border airstrikes and mass deportations of Afghan refugees. Despite recent diplomatic overtures, meaningful improvement in bilateral ties remains elusive without effective action against the TTP.</p>

          <p>Four years after seizing power, the Taliban maintain a firm grip on Afghanistan, leading some governments like Russia and China to forge ties, with Russia formally recognizing them. This pragmatic engagement, driven by economic interests and a recognition of their control, contrasts with the West's cautious approach. Germany, for instance, engages on a technical level for deportations despite human rights concerns. However, the regime faces immense challenges from mass deportations by neighbors and ongoing human rights abuses, particularly against women, and a severe humanitarian crisis. International recognition remains limited for the Taliban.</p>

          <p>Olympic legend Michael Phelps has strongly criticized USA Swimming's leadership, labeling the organization "weak" and calling for comprehensive reforms. He expressed frustration over teammates' lack of support and the sport's declining membership post-pandemic, stating he wouldn't want his sons competing under the current system. Phelps, the most decorated Olympian, traced his concerns back through his career, feeling his voice was often unheard. He emphasized his respect for the athletes but asserted the system is failing. Phelps offered to help address issues, suggesting increased support for young swimmers and prioritizing elite athletes' needs.</p>

          <p>Israeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich announced plans to build over 3,000 homes in the controversial E1 area of the occupied West Bank, stating it would "bury the idea of a Palestinian state." This project, long frozen due to international opposition, would geographically separate the West Bank from East Jerusalem, obstructing Palestinian territorial contiguity. Smotrich asserted that the land was given by God, dismissing international recognition efforts for a Palestinian state. Peace Now and the Palestinian foreign ministry condemned the move, viewing it as an annexation and a step towards continued conflict, defying international law.</p>

          <p>The article explores the enduring appeal and various interpretations of the "Amelia Bedelia" children's book series. It delves into the character of Amelia, a maid who comically misinterprets instructions literally, leading to household chaos. Beyond the common explanation of literal interpretation, the article discusses theories of Amelia as an autistic character or even a "class warrior" subverting her wealthy employers' expectations. The author suggests children enjoy Amelia because she is an adult who acts silly and challenges authority, making commands look absurd. The series' continued popularity underscores its unique charm and relatable themes for young readers.</p>

Speakers, including former military chief Dan Halutz, challenged Prime Minister Netanyahu's claims about Hamas and argued the war had run its course, eroding Israeli morals. They stressed concerns for both Israeli hostages and Palestinian civilians, with one pilot stating he likely wouldn't fight if still serving.

Biden had claimed Epstein introduced Melania to Donald Trump, attributing the information to author Michael Wolff, a claim Donald Trump disputes.

Experts attribute this slowdown to a generational shift, as Baby Boomers downsize and younger collectors prefer newer, more affordable, and practical cars from the 1980s-2000s. This rotation is driving more sales to the private market to avoid public price discounts, while modern supercar auctions are skyrocketing. (not investment advice)</p>

They can also incentivize corporations, investors, and philanthropists to contribute, recognizing that university research, though risky for private firms, generates significant economic returns and underlies major innovations like the internet and AI.
