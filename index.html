          <p>Brazilian police arrested two suspects, both Lady Gaga fans, who were allegedly planning an attack on her free concert at Copacabana Beach. The suspects, part of an online group promoting hate speech and violence, were reportedly planning to use improvised explosives, but no explosives were found during the operation. The arrests were part of Operation Fake Monsters, a joint investigation aimed at preempting any threat ahead of the singer's performance, which drew over two million fans. Lady Gaga's team stated they were unaware of the operation until after the concert, which proceeded without incident, and had worked closely with law enforcement during planning and execution, feeling confident in the safety measures in place.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed a strong response after a Houthi missile struck near Ben Gurion Airport, injuring four people. The Houthis, backed by Iran, claimed responsibility and threatened further attacks, declaring a comprehensive aerial blockade on Israel in response to planned expansions of Israeli operations in Gaza. Defense Minister Israel Katz echoed the threat of retaliation, promising a response "seven times stronger". Netanyahu emphasized Iran's involvement, stating Israel would respond to both the Houthis and Iran at a time and place of its choosing, raising concerns about escalating regional tensions amidst ongoing conflicts.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has begun calling up tens of thousands of reservists to intensify and expand its operations in Gaza, aiming to return hostages and defeat Hamas. The IDF stated it would operate in new areas and "destroy all infrastructure" above and below ground, pending approval from the Israeli security cabinet. Critics question the effectiveness of the offensive in securing hostage releases and Prime Minister Netanyahu's objectives, as international negotiations for a ceasefire have failed. Aid agencies report severe shortages of food, water, and medicines, accusing Israel of using starvation as a war crime, a claim Israel denies.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 a year for home-schooled students. Supporters, including President Trump, hail the bill as a victory for students and parents, while Democrats argue it will siphon funds from underfunded public schools, benefiting wealthier students already in private education. Attorney General Ken Paxton stated that the bill ensures students have the freedom to seek the educational option that is right for them.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX facility in South Texas, known as Starbase, is on track to becoming an official city after a vote overwhelmingly approved its incorporation. The vote, primarily supported by SpaceX employees, solidifies Musk's influence over the area, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest regarding beach access and launch operations. The city, spanning 1.5 square miles, currently manages roads, utilities, schooling, and medical care for its residents. SpaceX seeks increased launch activity, requiring beach closures, which critics argue should remain under county government control to protect public access.</p>

Concerns were raised about increasing antisemitic hate crimes and the normalization of extremist ideologies, with some fearing that liberal democracy is under threat. The anniversary serves as a stark reminder of the need for vigilance and accountability in the face of rising populism and historical revisionism.</p>

          <p>George Simion, a hard-right nationalist leader critical of the EU, is leading in exit polls for the first round of Romania's presidential election. Simion, who opposes military aid to Ukraine and aligns with Trump's 'Make America Great Again' movement, is capitalizing on popular anger over high inflation and conspiracy theories related to the annulled original vote. The election was rerun due to concerns over Russian interference in favor of a far-right candidate, creating a politically charged atmosphere.</p>

          <p>Saúl Álvarez's recent fight with William Scull was criticized for being uneventful, raising concerns about his upcoming match against Terence Crawford. Crawford is a talented boxer, but will be moving up two weight divisions to challenge Álvarez, leading some to believe the fight will be one-sided. Despite Crawford's skills, experts suggest the weight difference may be too significant, potentially resulting in another uncompetitive bout for Canelo. Julio Cesar Chavez believes that Crawford has nothing to do in that weight and will get knocked out by Canelo. (not investment advice)</p>
