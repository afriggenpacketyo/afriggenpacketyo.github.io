          <p>Following the debut of Tesla's autonomous trips in Austin, videos surfaced showing robotaxis behaving erratically, including driving the wrong way and braking abruptly. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has contacted Tesla to gather more information about these incidents. While NHTSA doesn't pre-approve vehicle technologies, it investigates potential safety defects and takes action to ensure road safety. These incidents raise concerns about the safety and reliability of Tesla's autonomous driving system as it expands to public roads.</p>

          <p>President Trump is attending a NATO summit in The Hague following an announcement of a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel, which was quickly followed by accusations of violations from both sides. The summit aims to secure commitments from NATO allies to increase defense spending to at least 5% of their GDP, a goal that NATO had already agreed to before the summit. Russia's war on Ukraine remains a key concern for NATO members, and the summit statement is expected to directly address the alliance's threat assessment and defense needs. The United States is urging restraint from both Russia and Ukraine and supports direct talks between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Senators Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis are unveiling a framework for a bill to establish regulatory guidelines for digital assets. The proposed legislation seeks to define cryptocurrencies as commodities or securities, allowing crypto exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and reducing SEC oversight. The bill also aims to incorporate measures to prevent money laundering and sanctions evasion. Scott hopes to build on recent bipartisan momentum in the Senate regarding crypto regulation, and the Senate Banking Committee's subcommittee on digital assets will hold a hearing on the bill.

          <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte is encouraging European nations and Canada to concentrate on increasing their defense spending rather than worrying about the United States potentially withdrawing from the alliance. Rutte emphasized that the U.S. remains committed to NATO, but expects its allies to meet their defense spending commitments. The US President Donald Trump has been pushing for non-US partners to increase their defence spending from about 2 per cent of GDP to 5 per cent, a level that Rutte said would be agreed to during the two-day summit, which Trump is scheduled to attend. Rutte acknowledged that the current imbalance in defense spending is a significant source of tension.</p>

          <p>The Labour government in the UK is facing a significant rebellion from its own MPs over proposed welfare reforms aimed at saving £5 billion annually by 2030. Over 120 Labour MPs have signed an amendment to block the bill, potentially thwarting the government's plans to modify Personal Independence Payments (Pips) and Universal Credit. The rebellion highlights deep divisions within the party, with many MPs feeling that the reforms contradict Labour's core values regarding the welfare state. The government's handling of the parliamentary Labour Party has been criticized, and the outcome of the vote remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>A police watchdog report has revealed that West Mercia Police did not adequately train front-line officers to identify child abuse in cases involving Alfie Steele, a nine-year-old boy who was murdered by his mother and her partner in 2021. The report examined 20 cases where police had contact with Alfie and his family, finding no misconduct but identifying areas for improvement. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) recommended better training for officers and improved policies for referrals to children's services. Alfie's grandfather expressed disappointment, stating that the report did not bring about meaningful change.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to resume expedited deportations of certain immigrants without advance warning or the opportunity to challenge their removal. This decision overturns a lower court injunction and will remain in effect while the case is appealed. Assistant Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin praised the ruling, while Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, arguing that it strips away critical due process protections and could lead to individuals being deported to dangerous situations.</p>

          <p>Meta is notably absent from San Francisco Pride this year, marking a shift in the tech industry's public support for the LGBTQ+ community. This decision follows Meta's scaling back of DEI programs and easing of content moderation guidelines, leading SF Pride to formally cut ties with the company. Other major companies like Anheuser-Busch and Google-parent Alphabet have also reduced their sponsorship of SF Pride, contributing to a budget shortfall for the event. The lack of support from tech companies, particularly those based in San Francisco, has been met with disappointment by LGBTQ+ advocates.</p>

          <p>Oil prices declined after President Trump cautioned Israel against violating the newly announced ceasefire with Iran. Brent crude prices fell nearly $2 per barrel, reversing gains from the previous session, as concerns about supply disruptions in the Middle East eased. The initial hostilities between Iran and Israel had added roughly 10% to oil prices, but Trump's announcement of a ceasefire has alleviated some of those concerns. The potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz remains a risk factor, but analysts suggest that oil prices could surge past $100 per barrel in such a scenario. (not investment advice)</p>
