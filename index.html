          <p>Teenage darts sensation Luke Littler has won the World Matchplay final, becoming only the fifth player in history to complete the sport's prestigious Triple Crown. The 18-year-old defeated veteran James Wade 18-13 in a high-quality final in Blackpool, joining an elite group that includes Phil Taylor and Michael van Gerwen. After falling behind 5-0, Littler mounted a powerful comeback, showcasing his skill with 17 maximums and a three-dart average over 101. This victory adds the World Matchplay title to his previous wins at the Premier League and World Championship, solidifying his status at the top of the sport.</p>

          <p>A 34-year-old Wyandotte County sheriff's deputy was shot and killed while responding to a domestic violence call in Kansas City, Kansas. The deputy, a nine-year veteran, was ambushed by a gunman as he accompanied a woman to retrieve her belongings from a residence. The suspect, who also fired at other responding officers, was wounded in a subsequent gunfight and taken into custody after a brief standoff. The Kansas Bureau of Investigation is now leading the inquiry into the fatal shooting, which has been described as an act of senseless violence by local officials.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 17:19:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and the European Union have announced a new trade agreement, narrowly avoiding a looming tariff deadline. The deal establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods imported into the U.S., a rate lower than previously threatened but higher than the EU had hoped for. As part of the agreement, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and making $600 billion in new investments. While European leaders expressed relief at avoiding a trade war, some voiced caution about the economic impact of the new tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>White House Budget Director Russell Vought suggested President Trump's criticism of the Federal Reserve is driven by a desire for lower interest rates, not by the conservative Project 2025 policy blueprint. During an interview, Vought, a key author of the overall project, claimed he didn't know the specifics of the chapter calling for a Fed overhaul, stating the administration is simply implementing Trump's own agenda. This comes as Trump has intensified pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends in 2026, over interest rate policy and the cost of building renovations. (not investment advice)</p>

The article suggests that England's hopes for future success, including the upcoming Ashes series, are heavily dependent on a healthy Stokes.

Topuria, who considers Canelo an idol, expressed his desire for a match against the winner of the upcoming Canelo vs. Terence Crawford fight, specifying his preference for Canelo. The Spanish-Georgian fighter hopes UFC will grant him the opportunity, similar to Conor McGregor's 2017 bout with Floyd Mayweather.

          <p>Tom Lehrer, the Harvard-trained mathematician renowned for his darkly humorous and politically charged satirical songs from the 1950s and 1960s, has passed away at the age of 97. His work, which included fan favorites like "Poisoning Pigeons in the Park" and "The Elements," often faced censorship but gained a massive cult following and influenced generations of comedians. Despite his musical success, Lehrer dedicated most of his life to academia, teaching at institutions like MIT and the University of California. In 2020, he placed all of his work into the public domain.</p>

Slater, who protects quarterback Justin Herbert's blindside, has been a critical component of the offensive line since being drafted in the first round.

          <p>The decision by CBS to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in 2026 is fueling a debate about the viability of the traditional late-night television format. While some see it as a one-off financial decision, others view it as a signal of the genre's decline amid rising production costs and shrinking linear TV ad revenue. The article notes that while Colbert's show consistently led in viewership, it operated at a significant financial loss, a problem shared by other late-night programs. The future of the format may become clearer when Disney decides on the fate of "Jimmy Kimmel Live." (not investment advice)</p>
