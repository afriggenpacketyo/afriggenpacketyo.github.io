          <p>Following citywide Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations that led to numerous arrests, protests erupted across Los Angeles. President Trump responded by ordering the deployment of at least 2,000 National Guard troops to L.A. County, citing clashes between immigration authorities and demonstrators. The ICE operations targeted locations including a clothing warehouse in the Fashion District, with protests also occurring outside a federal building in downtown L.A. and in the city of Paramount, resulting in clashes between law enforcement and protesters, some of whom threw objects at vehicles. The Department of Homeland Security reported 118 arrests during the week, including individuals linked to criminal organizations, leading to demonstrations and graffiti at a federal detention center. The article states that the vast majority of the deployed soldiers are from the California National Guard. </p>

          <p>Japanese golfer Mao Saigo carded a rare albatross during the second round of the ShopRite LPGA Classic, propelling her into a tie for second place. Saigo holed out her second shot from 214 yards on the par-5 3rd hole, adding to her impressive performance which included five birdies. She finished the round with a 6-under-par 65, trailing leader Lee Il Hee by one stroke, and expressed satisfaction with her score despite some inaccuracies with her irons. The 23-year-old Saigo, already a major winner at April's Chevron Championship, is joined by compatriots Ayaka Furue, Jennifer Kupcho, and Elizabeth Szokol at 10 under par. Saigo has four top-10 finishes in her LPGA career.</p>

          <p>A referendum in Italy will allow voters to decide whether to loosen citizenship laws for immigrants. The referendum focuses on reducing the time required to apply for citizenship, aiming to integrate long-term residents who contribute to the country. However, it remains uncertain if enough voters will participate to validate the referendum, given potential apathy and opposition from conservative factions. The outcome could significantly impact the rights and integration of immigrants in Italy, reflecting broader debates about national identity and immigration policies across Europe.</p>

          <p>Efforts to honor Ernest Wilimowski, a soccer star from the Polish region of Silesia who played for both Poland and Nazi Germany, are sparking controversy. Wilimowski's dual allegiance raises complex questions about national loyalty and betrayal, given his involvement with the Nazi regime during World War II. The debate highlights the challenges of reconciling local pride with the historical context of war and occupation. Some view him as a local hero, while others condemn his association with Nazi Germany, reflecting the ongoing struggle to interpret his legacy in the context of Polish history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have developed an artificial retina using the rare mineral tellurium, restoring sight in blind animals and enabling them to see infrared light. The study, led by Wang Shuiyuan at Fudan University, demonstrated how tellurium nanowire implants in a biocompatible device restored vision in blind mice and a monkey. Tellurium, a byproduct of copper refining, converts visible light and infrared radiation into electrical energy, replacing damaged photoreceptor cells in the retina. This advancement holds promise for treating human blindness and potentially enhancing human vision capabilities.</p>

          <p>Colombian Senator Miguel Uribe Turbay, a potential presidential candidate, was shot and wounded at a campaign rally in Bogota. The attack, which the Democratic Center party called "an unacceptable act of violence," occurred in the Fontibon neighborhood, with authorities arresting a 15-year-old boy at the scene. President Gustavo Petro condemned the attack and canceled a trip to France, while U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio criticized the shooting as a threat to democracy, and called for a dial back on inflammatory rhetoric. Uribe Turbay, son of a journalist who was kidnapped and killed in 1991, announced his presidential bid in March, with the election scheduled for May 31, 2026.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to deploy National Guard troops to Los Angeles under Title 10 authority has sparked legal and political debate. Title 10 allows the activation of National Guard troops for federal service, but critics argue that using the military to quell protests without the governor's request is a misuse of power. Experts like Erwin Chemerinsky express concerns about the federal government using the military to suppress dissent, while others point to the Insurrection Act of 1807, which grants the president authority to federalize National Guard units in extreme circumstances. Governor Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory and unnecessary, highlighting the tension between federal and state authority.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The research, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, argues that subsidies for fathers yield greater long-term fertility gains than subsidizing mothers alone. This policy proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The study analyzed data from 23 countries and found that traditional expectations persist in China and other East Asian countries, clashing with rapid economic changes.</p>

          <p>A British woman has been charged in Australia after allegedly hitting and killing a man while riding an e-scooter under the influence of alcohol. Alicia Kemp, 24, is accused of hitting Thanh Phan, 51, in Perth, resulting in his death two days later, and faces charges of death by dangerous driving while intoxicated. The incident has prompted Perth's city council to suspend the use of hire e-scooters and led to a review of e-scooter regulations. Kemp's bail was denied due to flight risk concerns, and she also faces a charge for injuries to her passenger, and she faces a maximum of 20 years in prison.</p>

          <p>NTT Docomo, a Japanese telecom giant, will retire its original emoji set after 26 years, as the company's Android smartphones and feature phones marketed from June will no longer include the set. Docomo introduced the emoji in 1999 with its i-mode service, and the emoji became popular in Japan before gaining global traction. The company stated that the emojis have "fulfilled their role" and that Google's emojis have become more common globally. The mobile phones will now use Noto Color Emoji by Google or Samsung emoji instead, and the original set of 176 emoji was included in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2016.</p>

          <p>Following the Noto Peninsula earthquake, unsanitary toilet conditions highlighted Japan's need for improved disaster preparedness. The lack of functioning toilets in evacuation centers led to public health risks, echoing the "toilet panic" experienced during the 1995 Great Hanshin Earthquake. Experts emphasize the importance of maintaining sanitary toilets during disasters to prevent infectious diseases and ensure public health. Educational initiatives are underway to teach children how to use portable toilets, aiming to improve disaster response and prevent future crises. The government is also required to make efforts to prevent them from defecating in evacuation center toilets.</p>

They emphasize the need for more funding and resources to support innovation and growth without sacrificing employee well-being. Founders also point out that Europe's most successful companies achieved dominance through sustainable innovation cultures, not excessive work hours.</p>
