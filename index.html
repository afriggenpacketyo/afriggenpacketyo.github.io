          <p>Following the fatal shooting of Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, their Brooklyn Park home was burglarized. Police reported that the plywood covering a rear window was pried off, and the window was broken to gain entry. Although crime scene investigators searched the home again, family members stated that they did not believe anything was missing. The suspect in the Hortmans' murder, Vance Boelter, is in custody and facing federal and state murder charges after a manhunt; he is also accused of shooting and wounding another state senator and his wife. Vigil for the Hortmans was set for Wednesday evening at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul. </p>

The Trevor Project's CEO, Jaymes Black, criticized the decision as devastating, stating that this program has provided life-saving services to over 1.3 million LGBTQ+ young people and will no longer be available. Senator Tammy Baldwin also condemned the move as cruelly taking away a crucial resource for LGBTQ+ people in crisis.</p>

          <p>In Massachusetts, Karen Read was found not guilty of murdering her Boston police officer boyfriend in 2022 after a retrial, nearly a year after her first prosecution ended in a mistrial. She was acquitted of second-degree murder, manslaughter, and leaving the scene after an accident resulting in death, but the jury found her guilty of operating under the influence of liquor, resulting in a one-year probation sentence. The prosecution argued that Read hit her boyfriend with her car and left him to die in a blizzard, while the defense claimed he was attacked by a dog and beaten by others. Following the verdict, witnesses who testified against Read called the result a devastating miscarriage of justice.</p>

          <p>The possibility of the U.S. striking Iran's nuclear facilities is being considered, particularly the Fordo plant, which is deeply buried and requires specialized "bunker buster" bombs like the GBU-57, which only the U.S. possesses. Destroying these facilities is a complex task, potentially requiring multiple bombing rounds and ground personnel. Such a strike could trigger retaliatory actions from Iran, targeting U.S. assets in the region and escalating the conflict. While the GBU-57 would have a profound psychological effect, it may not completely eliminate Iran's nuclear capabilities, and regime change is also being urged by some.</p>

However, the cost of the drug, roughly $28,000 a year, could price out many, and the Trump administration's steep cuts to foreign aid could prevent people in countries with the highest HIV burden from benefiting.</p>

Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson has also called for the U.S. to stay out of the conflict, sparking a rebuke from Trump.

          <p>As the conflict between Israel and Iran escalates, the U.S. is considering direct military involvement, potentially using "bunker buster" bombs to target Iran's fortified nuclear facility at Fordo. Only the U.S. possesses the 30,000-pound GBU-57 MOP (Massive Ordnance Penetrator) and the B-2 stealth bombers needed to deliver them. These bombs are designed to penetrate deep below the surface before exploding, but experts caution that multiple hits may be necessary. While the GBU-57 could cause serious damage, it may not completely stop Iran's nuclear program.</p>

Critics argue that the screening for "antisemitic" activity is an effort to crack down on opposition to Israel's actions in Gaza.

          <p>If the U.S. were to drop a "bunker buster" bomb on Iran's Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, experts suggest that the risk of widespread contamination would be low. The site processes uranium isotopes, primarily in the form of uranium hexafluoride gas, which is heavy and unlikely to travel far. While there are concerns about the gas reacting with water to form hydrofluoric acid, the underground location and the collapse of the mountain above it would likely inhibit any significant environmental release. The International Atomic Energy Agency has been monitoring the effects of strikes on Iran's facilities.</p>
