          <p>Jimmy Kimmel returned to his late-night show with an emotional monologue, clarifying his controversial comments regarding the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. He asserted it was never his intention to make light of the tragedy and defended the importance of free speech, criticizing what he described as censorship efforts from the FCC chairman. Kimmel also expressed gratitude for the support he received and highlighted a message of forgiveness from Kirk's widow, contrasting it with the political division surrounding the event. The show's return came amid criticism from President Trump and the decision by some affiliate stations to continue preempting its broadcast.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large sinkhole abruptly formed on a busy road in Bangkok, Thailand, collapsing a 50-meter section of the street near major city hospitals. Authorities quickly cordoned off the area and evacuated nearby residents and businesses due to the ongoing risk of the hole expanding. Preliminary investigations suggest that heavy rainfall likely eroded a large underground water pipe, causing the ground to give way, with officials noting that sliding dirt from a nearby subway construction project may have worsened the situation. Fortunately, the incident resulted in no reported deaths or injuries, though it caused local utility disruptions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK energy regulator Ofgem has announced plans requiring all suppliers in England, Scotland, and Wales to offer a tariff with lower standing charges by the end of January. This move responds to consumer complaints about the fixed daily fees, which are charged regardless of energy consumption. However, these new tariffs will feature higher per-unit energy costs, meaning overall bills are unlikely to decrease for most households. While the change offers more choice, consumer advocates and charities have expressed disappointment, warning that it fails to address the core problem of high energy costs for struggling families.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 05:31:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Super Typhoon Ragasa impacts Asia, scientists are highlighting the clear link between climate change and the increasing frequency and strength of such storms. Experts explain that warmer ocean temperatures, a direct result of global warming, provide more energy for typhoons, allowing them to intensify more rapidly and grow larger. The Pacific Ocean's average temperature has risen by approximately 1.5 degrees Celsius over the last century, fueling these powerful weather events. This added energy also causes storms to stall over coastlines, leading to catastrophic rainfall and flooding in affected areas.</p>

A longtime local official, Grijalva defeated Republican Daniel Butierez in the heavily Democratic district, narrowing the Republican majority in the House of Representatives. Her victory makes her the first Latina to represent Arizona in Congress.

          <p>Retailer JD Sports has announced a 13.5% drop in adjusted profits for the first half of the year, attributing the decline to "strained consumer finances" affecting sales in key markets. The sportswear company saw comparable store sales fall across all regions, with North America and the UK experiencing the most significant downturns. Despite an overall increase in revenue due to recent acquisitions, the company is facing rising operating costs and has initiated a cost-saving plan. The CEO noted that while the impact of potential US tariffs is currently limited, uncertainty remains regarding future consumer sentiment.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the UN, Donald Trump announced a significant policy shift, stating that Ukraine is capable of winning back all of its territory from Russia. This marks a dramatic pivot from his previous suggestions that Kyiv might need to cede land for peace, with Trump now citing Russia's economic troubles and battlefield failures as reasons for his change in perspective. Zelenskyy praised the meeting as productive and called Trump's new stance a "big shift," expressing gratitude for the president's understanding of the situation. The Kremlin disputed Trump's assessment, rejecting the characterization of Russia as a "paper tiger."</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, one of the most powerful storms of the year, has caused severe destruction in Hong Kong and southern China after leaving a deadly trail in Taiwan. The storm brought hurricane-force winds and a massive storm surge to Hong Kong, flooding coastal areas and causing significant damage. Before reaching the city, the typhoon had already caused a dam breach in Taiwan, resulting in 14 fatalities. In response to the storm's approach, authorities in southern China evacuated hundreds of thousands of people from low-lying regions as the powerful typhoon made landfall.</p>

Critics also point to its outdated structure, which gives veto power to five permanent members, and financial struggles exacerbated by funding cuts.

Historically, spices like cinnamon and pepper were highly valued exotic goods, driving exploration and the creation of global trading companies. In medieval Europe, they were not just flavorings but also markers of social status and were believed to possess healing properties, often used in medicine to treat various ailments.</p>

This initiative is part of a national trend aimed at combating chronically low voter turnout in local elections. Proponents argue that consolidating elections boosts participation, particularly among younger and minority voters, and can save on administrative costs.

          <p>China has cautioned Japan against providing a platform for "Taiwan independence" following a private tourist visit by former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. Tsai, who led the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, visited Japan from September 9 to 12, though her office stated the trip involved no official business or meetings with Japanese politicians. During her tenure from 2016 to 2024, relations across the Taiwan Strait grew increasingly tense. Beijing's warning reflects its consistent diplomatic pressure to isolate Taiwan and discourage other nations from engaging with its current or former leaders, even in an unofficial capacity.</p>

          <p>Ismael Ayala-Uribe, a 39-year-old Mexican national and former DACA recipient, died on Sunday while in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at the Adelanto Processing Center. He was arrested in August and referred to a hospital for an abscess before being declared unresponsive. His family claims he was in good health upon detention and was denied proper medical care inside the facility, while ICE maintains that comprehensive medical care is provided to all detainees. His death is the 14th to occur in ICE custody since January and is currently under investigation by the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department.</p>

          <p>As the Ryder Cup approaches, Team Europe is aiming to win on American soil for the first time since their "Miracle at Medinah" in 2012, facing the challenge of a hostile crowd at Bethpage. European golf legends suggest that mental discipline and a fast start will be crucial to quiet the partisan fans. The team benefits from continuity, with Luke Donald returning as the first repeat captain since the 1990s and only one change to the victorious 2023 squad. This experienced European side, featuring major winners like Rory McIlroy and Jon Rahm, will face a relatively less seasoned US team led by world number one Scottie Scheffler.</p>

          <p>The UK government has successfully recovered almost £500 million in the past year by using a new artificial intelligence tool designed to detect fraud. A significant portion of the reclaimed funds, £186 million, was related to fraudulent activity during the Covid-19 pandemic, with the rest coming from areas like illegal council tax claims. The AI tool, which cross-references data across government departments to identify weaknesses, will now be licensed to other countries, including the US and Australia. The use of AI for fraud detection has previously drawn criticism from civil liberties groups over concerns about potential bias.</p>

After a successful spell at Burnley, the 22-year-old was initially expected to challenge for the number one spot at City and even started the first three league games. However, the surprise signing of Donnarumma has relegated Trafford to the bench, potentially impacting his first-team opportunities and international ambitions.

Raised in a working-class neighborhood and toughened by personal hardship, Yamal embraces the pressure of being a star with a fierce self-awareness.
