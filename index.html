          <p>Warren Buffett announced at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting that he will step down as CEO at the end of the year, recommending Greg Abel as his successor. Buffett, who has led the company for 60 years, emphasized his continued support and intention to retain his shares, citing Abel's more hands-on managerial style as beneficial for Berkshire's subsidiaries. Abel, currently the vice chairman of non-insurance operations, expressed humility and honor in assuming the role, affirming the continuation of Buffett's patient value investing philosophy and the deployment of Berkshire's substantial cash reserves.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against Colorado, Denver, and their leaders, challenging state and city laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The lawsuit targets policies such as restrictions on holding individuals based solely on civil immigration detainers and bans on sharing information with federal immigration agencies. While Colorado officials stated they are not a sanctuary state and cooperate with law enforcement, Denver's mayor emphasized the importance of keeping locations like hospitals and schools off-limits for immigration enforcement. The lawsuit argues that these policies provide a safe haven for criminals, while Democratic officials maintain they foster trust with immigrant communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several federal prosecutors in Los Angeles, including the chief of the Public Corruption and Civil Rights Section, have resigned following a plea deal offered to a sheriff’s deputy convicted of using excessive force. The plea deal, offered by the newly appointed U.S. attorney, would reduce the deputy's felony conviction to a misdemeanor, potentially allowing him to continue working in law enforcement. This decision has been criticized as unorthodox, with concerns raised about undermining the jury's verdict and the resources invested in the trial. The resignations highlight internal conflict within the prosecutor's office and raise questions about the handling of the case.</p>

The officers are charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault, and other offenses related to the incident, which led to nationwide protests and scrutiny of police practices. The trial follows a Justice Department investigation that found the Memphis police department uses excessive force and discriminates against Black people.</p>

          <p>Michael Tilson Thomas, the beloved conductor of the San Francisco Symphony, gave his final public performance after announcing his aggressive brain cancer had returned. The city of San Francisco declared it Michael Tilson Thomas Day, celebrating his influential 25-year tenure with the symphony. He led the orchestra in performances of Britten's "Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra" and Respighi's "Roman Festivals," concluding with an encore from Bernstein's "On the Town." Thomas's career has been marked by his eclecticism, his dedication to education, and his support for mavericks and outsiders in American music.</p>
