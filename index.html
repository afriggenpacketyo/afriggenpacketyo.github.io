This prestigious event will host world or national premieres for films starring a constellation of acclaimed actors, including Julia Roberts, Daniel Day-Lewis, George Clooney, and Jeremy Allen White, with screenings distributed across all five boroughs. Highlights include Luca Guadagnino's "After the Hunt," a compelling narrative exploring an adjunct professor's sexual assault accusation, and Jim Jarmusch's "Father Mother Sister Brother," a Venice Film Festival Golden Lion winner.

          <p>Assata Shakur, also known as Joanne Chesimard, a former Black Liberation Army member, has died in Havana, Cuba, at 78 due to health conditions. Convicted of murdering a New Jersey state trooper in 1973, Shakur escaped from prison in 1979 and was granted political asylum by the Castro government in 1984, living openly in Cuba for decades. She was the first woman placed on the FBI's Most Wanted terrorist list, with a $2 million reward for her capture. While New Jersey officials lamented her passing without facing full justice, Shakur was seen by activists as a powerful symbol of resistance to racial injustice and government repression.</p>

          <p>As China drafts its 15th five-year plan, a crucial blueprint for the nation's socio-economic development, attention is turning to Hong Kong's evolving role within this strategy. Analysts suggest that the city, often seen as a "superconnector" between mainland China and global markets, could strengthen its position. Despite previous doubts, a rising stock index and growing appeal to international businesses indicate renewed confidence. The article highlights that Beijing's plan will largely determine the policies and resources allocated to Hong Kong, underscoring its unique and integral function in China's economic future.

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah has brought renewed attention to political violence in the U.S., particularly a reported surge in left-wing extremism. A new study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) indicates that 2025 is on track to be the most violent year for left-wing attacks in over three decades, surpassing far-right incidents for the first time. While the lethality of these attacks remains low, the article notes high-profile cases like the ICE facility storming and threats against Republican officials. Researchers warn against ignoring this trend and urge leaders to condemn violence across the political spectrum.</p>

          <p>More than three decades after the brutal 1991 murders of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop, the case remains unsolved, deeply haunting families and investigators. Eliza Thomas, Sarah and Jennifer Harbison, and Amy Ayers were tied, shot, and the shop set ablaze, destroying crucial evidence. Despite arrests, confessions, and convictions, all were overturned, and DNA evidence later excluded the initial suspects. The article details the agonizing search for answers, the emotional toll on the victims' families, and the persistent hope that new DNA advancements could finally identify the perpetrators, offering a measure of closure.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request to withhold over $4 billion in foreign aid funding previously approved by Congress. In a 6-3 decision, the Court cited potential harm to the executive branch's ability to conduct foreign affairs, outweighing the harm to plaintiff organizations. The dispute centers on President Trump's use of a "pocket rescission" to claw back funds, a move the Government Accountability Office deemed illegal. Dissenting justices, including Elena Kagan, emphasized the high stakes for the separation of powers, noting the funds will now never reach their intended recipients, impacting critical overseas projects.</p>

Opposing groups, despite portraying themselves as underdogs, have raised $35.3 million. The article highlights the measure's potential major impact on 2026 congressional elections, which could influence President Trump's agenda.

          <p>An influx of federal agents from 13 U.S. agencies, including the FBI and DEA, along with 300 Tennessee Highway Patrol troopers, will deploy to Memphis starting next week. This initiative, part of President Trump's broader crime crackdown, has been described by Governor Bill Lee as a "generational opportunity" to combat crime. Memphis Mayor Paul Young acknowledged community questions but emphasized effective use of resources. The article notes that while Memphis has seen crime reductions, the Trump administration has faced accusations of unfairly targeting Democratic-led cities with similar federal deployments in the past.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats are intensifying demands for information regarding White House border czar Tom Homan and his involvement in federal contracts, following allegations he accepted $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents. The allegations suggest Homan promised government action if President Trump returned to office, with the investigation reportedly closed by Trump appointees. Democrats are seeking DHS contracts and communications, warning that homeland security should not be for sale and raising concerns about weaponization of justice. Homan denies wrongdoing, while the White House defends him, stating he hasn't been involved in contract decisions.</p>

          <p>Assata Shakur, a prominent activist with the Black Liberation Army, has died in Havana, Cuba, at the age of 78. Exiled for four decades, Shakur, also known as Joanne Chesimard, passed away due to unspecified health conditions and advanced age. She was convicted of murder in 1973 for the death of a New Jersey state trooper and escaped prison in 1979, later receiving asylum in Cuba. Shakur, the step-aunt of Tupac Shakur, maintained her innocence and became a symbol of resistance to racial injustice for many, while remaining on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists list.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice, representing President Trump, argued to the Supreme Court that firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook for alleged misconduct would not cause "financial market disaster." Solicitor General D. John Sauer contended that the President suffers irreparable harm from lower court rulings preventing Cook's removal. Cook's attorneys, however, assert that Trump's "manufactured charges" of mortgage fraud, predating her Fed service, do not meet the "for cause" removal requirement. They warn that a Supreme Court stay allowing her removal would undermine the Federal Reserve's independence, risking market chaos. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Slovakia has amended its constitution to legally enshrine only two biologically determined genders: male and female. This move, which also limits legal adoption to married couples, effectively preventing same-sex couples from adopting, has drawn harsh criticism from opposition parties and LGBTQ+ rights groups. Progressive leader Michal Simecka called the vote "shameful," while nationalist Prime Minister Robert Fico defended it as a response to "the collapse of Western societies." Critics argue the amendment threatens Slovakia's EU membership and aligns it closer to authoritarian Russia, raising concerns about human rights and European legal integration.</p>
