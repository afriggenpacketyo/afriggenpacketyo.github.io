          <p>A significant explosion and subsequent fire struck the Shahid Rajaee port in southern Iran, resulting in five fatalities and over 700 injuries. The incident occurred amidst ongoing nuclear negotiations between Iran and the United States in Oman, raising concerns about potential sabotage. While Iranian officials have denied any connection to the oil industry, reports suggest the port received a shipment of sodium perchlorate rocket fuel in March, potentially contributing to the blast. The explosion caused extensive damage, with social media footage depicting billowing smoke and shattered windows miles away from the port. This event highlights the volatile situation in the region and the potential risks associated with storing hazardous materials in port facilities.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly signaled his willingness to engage in peace talks with Ukraine, following claims that Russian forces have liberated the Kursk region with assistance from North Korean troops, a claim Ukraine denies.

          <p>David F. Sandberg's "Until Dawn," based on the PlayStation game, blends horror tropes with video game mechanics in a self-referential narrative. A group of friends on a weekend trip become trapped in a time loop, forced to relive and die in horrific scenarios until they can survive the night. The film combines familiar horror elements with unexpected twists, creating a schlocky yet entertaining experience. While the plot may not always make logical sense, the film's loop structure allows for character development and sardonic self-awareness, appealing to fans of both classic and postmodern horror.</p>

          <p>Analyst Craig Moffett questions the feasibility of Apple shifting iPhone assembly to India as a solution to mitigate tariffs imposed on products made in China. Moffett argues that the supply chain would still be anchored in China, and any cost reduction would be limited. He also points out that carriers are unwilling to absorb the additional costs of tariffs, which would likely lead to decreased consumer demand and longer upgrade cycles. Furthermore, Moffett suggests that Apple faces backlash in China due to U.S. tariffs, impacting iPhone sales.</p>

          <p>A conscious parenting coach argues that the phrase "You're okay" is the most dangerous and overused phrase in parenting. She says it teaches kids to doubt their own emotions, invalidates their experience, short-circuits emotional processing, teaches that love is conditional and can rewire a child’s stress response. Instead of saying "You're okay", the coach suggests that parents should validate their children's feelings and provide support.</p>

Her name will always be associated with the scandals and criminality surrounding the late billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his circle. The photo of her and Prince Andrew, taken in London in 2001, became emblematic of the royal's entanglement with Epstein and was central to his disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019. Ms Giuffre died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia aged 41, her family said on Friday.</p>

He scheduled a hearing for 19 May “in the interest of dispelling our strong suspicion that the government just deported a US citizen with no meaningful process”.</p>
