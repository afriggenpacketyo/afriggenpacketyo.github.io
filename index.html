            <h2>China Considers Settling Trade in Renminbi Amidst Trade War</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 08:30:08 EDT</div>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Amidst escalating trade tensions with the US, China is contemplating requiring bilateral trade settlements to be conducted in renminbi. This strategic move aims to bolster the renminbi's exchange rate and challenge the US dollar's dominance in international trade. By mandating the use of its currency, China seeks to increase demand for the renminbi, potentially attracting global investors and shifting capital flows away from the US. This countermeasure is viewed as a more proactive approach than simply retaliating with reciprocal tariff increases, giving China greater control over its economic future. (not investment advice)</p>

Zelenskyy reported numerous instances of Russian shelling and assaults along the front line, suggesting Putin may not have full control over his army or is merely seeking favorable PR. While some areas were reportedly quieter, Zelenskyy reiterated Ukraine's offer to extend the truce and emphasized the need for Russia to fully adhere to ceasefire conditions, highlighting the ongoing distrust and skepticism surrounding Russia's intentions.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump is registering the worst economic approval numbers of his presidential career amid broad discontent over his handling of tariffs, inflation and government spending, according to the latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey. The survey found that the boost in economic optimism that accompanied Trump's reelection has disappeared, with more Americans now believing the economy will get worse than at any time since 2023 and with a sharp turn toward pessimism about the stock market. The public also disapproves of the president's handling of federal government spending by a 45% to 51% and foreign policy by a 42% to 53% margin.</p>

            <p>President Vladimir Putin announced a unilateral Easter truce in Ukraine until midnight Sunday night in Moscow. On social media on Sunday morning, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky posted that "the Russian army is attempting to create the general impression of a ceasefire, while in some areas still continuing isolated attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine." The sceptical view is that a 30-hour truce is less about pushing for peace and has more to do with maintaining good relations with the Trump White House.</p>

            <p>Labour has taken a muscular approach to saving the steelworks in Scunthorpe, and Reeves has written of the need for a “strong, smart and agile state to support key industries”. Yet Labour’s stance on the UK’s highly globalised financial sector appears to remain the one set out in the chancellor’s Mansion House speech in November: that rules imposed after the 2008 crash have “gone too far”. The Bank of England has been working hard to track how players in this shadow banking sector might respond in the event of a crisis – including by carrying out a fearsomely complex choose-your-own-adventure exercise it calls the “system-wide exploratory scenario”, launched after the Liz Truss market scare.</p>

The fire brigade said it needed 12 fire engines and two height vehicles at the peak of the blaze in Crabble Road, which was still burning on Sunday. Upon arrival, crews began evacuating the 42 flats and Dover District Council was working to offer support and provide emergency accommodation to those affected, said the fire service.</p>

            <p>The author describes their experience visiting good friends in the Gulf Coast town of Bay Saint Louis, Miss. and leaving with a crush on a special tree — the southern live oak. The author saw a tree branch doing something they’d never seen before: to the right, a great oak’s school-bus-long branch dip downward — where it had not just touched the ground, but had kept growing and buried itself into the soil. The author argues it's good now and again to look out and see that our trees are remarkable, not just resources or obstacles or ornaments. They are life itself — a part of our lives, and we are part of theirs. They should give us hope.</p>

            <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass faces mounting challenges, including a financial crisis and criticism over the city's handling of the Palisades fire. Faced with a nearly $1-billion shortfall, Bass has been weighing whether to lay off more than 1,500 city workers — or almost 5% of the workforce — while also eliminating some vacant positions. Bass said she is still hoping to avoid employee layoffs, in part by securing financial relief from Gov. Gavin Newsom and the state Legislature.</p>
