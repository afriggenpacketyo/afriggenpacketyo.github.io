          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin commented that the Middle East situation is calming down, viewing the conflict between Israel and Iran as being "in the past" and suggesting this could foster economic development. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova echoed this, urging all parties, including the U.S., to return to negotiations to preserve the "fragile truce." Zakharova emphasized that diplomacy is the only viable path for resolving crises like the Iranian nuclear program, noting that Russia has already proposed specific initiatives to all involved nations.</p>

While not denying the report's authenticity, he insisted it was a preliminary, low-confidence assessment and that the sites sustained "severe damage."</p>

Over 200 firefighters, supported by 12 water-dropping planes and 12 helicopters, are battling the blaze, while the coast guard has vessels on standby for potential sea evacuations.

          <p>A protest outside the Manhattan offices of data-mining firm Palantir Technologies resulted in the arrest of six demonstrators on Thursday. Organized by climate and immigrant rights groups, the protest aimed to highlight Palantir's contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to build surveillance and deportation software, including a platform called ImmigrationOS. Protestors linked arms to block the building's entrance, chanting and holding signs before police intervened. This action comes amid growing scrutiny of the firm, which was co-founded by Trump backer Peter Thiel.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is reportedly considering changes to the government's proposed welfare cuts to prevent a significant rebellion from his own Labour MPs. With 126 backbenchers now supporting an amendment to block the bill, Starmer has been personally contacting rebels ahead of a key vote. The bill aims to save Â£5 billion annually by tightening eligibility for disability benefits, but has faced criticism for its potential impact on vulnerable individuals. The government argues the reforms are necessary to control spiraling welfare costs, which are projected to double by 2029 without intervention.</p>

The GHF is highly controversial, with the U.N. and traditional aid agencies refusing to work with it, citing the chaotic and dangerous distribution process where hundreds of Palestinians have reportedly been killed by Israeli troops. Despite the controversy and criticism that the initiative may be complicit in war crimes, the U.S. has authorized $30 million in funding for the group.</p>

          <p>In a significant strategic move, the defense team for Sean "Diddy" Combs rested its case without calling a single witness, including Combs himself, in his federal sex trafficking and racketeering trial. Legal experts suggest this is a calculated gamble, signaling that the defense believes prosecutors failed to meet the high burden of proof despite six weeks of graphic testimony from 34 witnesses. The defense's theory appears to be that while Combs engaged in deplorable behavior, his actions do not legally constitute the charged felonies, a point they aimed to establish solely through cross-examination.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate parliamentarian has dealt a significant blow to the Republican-led "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" by ruling that a key provision to cut Medicaid funding violates Senate rules. The measure, which would have cracked down on states' use of provider taxes to fund their share of Medicaid, cannot be passed through the special budget reconciliation process. This decision forces Republicans to either scrap the provision or find another way to offset costs, complicating their efforts to pass President Trump's agenda by their July 4 deadline.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that South Carolina can exclude Planned Parenthood from its state Medicaid program, a major victory for anti-abortion advocates. The court determined that Medicaid beneficiaries and providers cannot sue the state under federal civil rights law to enforce the "any-qualified-provider" provision of the Medicaid Act. In her dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson argued the decision will cause tangible harm by stripping recipients of their ability to choose their healthcare provider. The ruling is expected to encourage other Republican-led states to pursue similar defunding efforts.</p>

          <p>This article traces the American cultural tendency to value a lack of sleep as a symbol of hard work and moral superiority back for centuries. From early exhortations to emulate historical figures who slept little, the piece connects this mindset to the Protestant work ethic and the modern phenomenon of "workism," where professionals derive their identity from their jobs. While tools from coffee to energy drinks have been marketed to help people fight their body's need for rest, the essay notes a recent, albeit slow, shift in acknowledging the importance of sleep for well-being.</p>
