          <p>The Israeli military has initiated extensive ground operations in Gaza, targeting Hamas infrastructure and aiming to free hostages, while also issuing evacuation orders for several areas. Strikes have hit Khan Younis and northern towns, resulting in numerous casualties. Negotiators from Israel and Hamas are in Qatar, attempting to reach a ceasefire agreement. Hamas insists on a comprehensive ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal in exchange for releasing hostages, while Israel seeks a temporary truce for hostage retrieval. The expansion of military operations poses grave risks to hostages and has disrupted medical services, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. </p>

          <p>Portugal's ruling Democratic Alliance (AD) is projected to win the most votes in Sunday's election but is unlikely to secure an outright majority. Exit polls indicate the AD will take between 29% and 34% of the vote, falling short of the 42% needed for a majority. This election, the third in as many years, was triggered by the collapse of the previous minority government after a failed confidence vote. The far-right Chega party is expected to perform strongly, while issues like housing and immigration dominated the campaign amid long-term political instability and a housing crisis. </p>

          <p>The FBI has identified Guy Edward Bartkus as the suspect in the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing, stating he had nihilistic ideations. The bomb was a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device with a significant blast radius. Bartkus, who was not on the FBI's radar, is believed to be the subject found near the vehicle. The attack, considered an intentional act of terrorism, is the largest bombing ever investigated in Southern California. </p>

He claimed White South Africans are targeted due to their race, facing property confiscation and threats to their lives. Rubio cited evidence of murders and forced removals, while urging support for those seeking refuge in the U.S. His comments come amid tensions with the South African government, which denies claims of land confiscations and racially motivated discrimination, and as President Cyril Ramaphosa is set to visit the White House. </p>
