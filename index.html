          <p>A grand jury in Colorado indicted Barry Morphew for the murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, whose remains were found more than three years after she went missing on Mother's Day in May 2020. Barry Morphew had previously been charged with her murder in 2021, but those charges were dropped just before trial in April 2022 due to issues with evidence. The indictment reveals Suzanne Morphew was unhappy in her marriage and had discussed divorce plans, with investigators uncovering a text message indicating her desire to end the relationship. Her death was ruled a homicide caused by intoxication from a chemical mixture used for sedating animals, which Barry Morphew had access to.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump commented on the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran, stating that Israel has "very limited capacity" to continue fighting without U.S. assistance and that Europe would not be able to help. He reiterated that his decision regarding U.S. involvement would be made within two weeks, emphasizing the need for toughness to achieve peace. Trump also acknowledged the difficulty of asking Israel to halt attacks while they are perceived as winning, but expressed U.S. willingness to engage in discussions with Iran. The Iranian foreign minister insists that Israel must cease its actions before negotiations can occur, adding to the complexity of the situation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, which is part of an ongoing dispute between the president and the university. The judge's order prevents the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, a federal database for student visa applications. This ruling follows a previous temporary restraining order against a separate order barring most international students from studying at Harvard. The administration had accused Harvard of failing to address campus antisemitism, leading to the initial attempt to revoke its student visa system certification.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Jersey ordered the release of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention while his immigration proceedings continue. The judge determined that Khalil is not a threat or a flight risk, criticizing his detention as "highly unusual". Khalil, a green card holder, was detained in March, preventing him from attending the birth of his child; his attorneys argued that his detention was punishment for his anti-Israel speech. The White House plans to appeal the decision, while the Department of Homeland Security claims Khalil's detention is justified due to alleged omissions on his green card application.</p>

          <p>Meta approached Perplexity AI about a potential takeover before ultimately investing $14.3 billion into Scale AI, according to sources familiar with the matter. The negotiations between Meta and Perplexity did not result in a finalized deal, with one source indicating a mutual dissolution and another suggesting Perplexity opted to walk away. This move highlights Meta's aggressive strategy to strengthen its AI capabilities amid intense competition from OpenAI and Google parent Alphabet. Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly keen to enhance Meta's AI efforts to compete effectively in both underlying AI models and consumer-facing applications.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court sided with President Trump and congressional Republicans in a challenge to California's emission standards, reviving a lawsuit from the oil and gas industry. The justices ruled that fuel makers had standing to sue over California’s strict emissions standards, arguing that the state was abusing its power to combat climate change. The court did not rule on the suit itself but said the fuel makers had standing to sue because they would be injured by the state’s rule. This decision follows actions by Trump and Republicans to disapprove regulations that would have allowed California to enforce new "zero emissions" car and truck requirements.</p>

Despite the conflict, both sides expressed support for continued discussions, although the ultimate decision rests with Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

          <p>Republicans' proposed "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP) for federal student loans could lead to higher monthly payments for many borrowers, according to a new analysis. Under RAP, a borrower earning around $80,000 a year would face a monthly payment of $467, compared to $187 under the Biden administration's SAVE plan. The plan would offer just two repayment options: a standard plan or RAP, with payments ranging from 1% to 10% of a borrower's income and loan forgiveness after 30 years. Critics argue that RAP may push more borrowers into default and prolong the repayment timeline.</p>
