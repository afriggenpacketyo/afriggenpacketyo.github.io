            <p>In Guinea-Bissau, women protesters attacked a Chinese-run zircon mining site, setting equipment ablaze due to concerns over environmental damage and the lack of response from local authorities regarding their complaints. Several women and a village leader were arrested following the protest at Nhiquin, where Chinese companies have been operating since 2022. Interior Minister Botche Cande expressed irritation at the destruction of property, emphasizing the state's efforts to find partners. The protest highlights local frustration with the environmental impact of foreign mining operations in the region.</p>

            <p>At WrestleMania 41, John Cena defeated Cody Rhodes to win his record-breaking 17th WWE Championship, employing underhanded tactics that deviated from his traditional persona.

This victory marks a significant moment in Cena's career, potentially his last WrestleMania appearance before his announced retirement.

            <p>Patrick Crusius, the gunman responsible for the 2019 mass shooting at an El Paso Walmart that killed 23 people, is expected to plead guilty in state court to avoid the death penalty. Crusius, who targeted Hispanics in the racist attack, will receive life in prison without parole under the plea deal. This decision comes after Texas prosecutors declined to pursue the death penalty, influenced by the wishes of a majority of the victims' relatives who desire closure. Crusius has already been sentenced to 90 consecutive life terms at the federal level for hate crimes and weapons charges.</p>

            <p>President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador has proposed a prisoner swap with Venezuela, offering to exchange 252 Venezuelan deportees held in Salvadoran prisons for 252 political prisoners allegedly held by the Maduro regime.

The Venezuelan government responded critically, labeling Bukele a "neofascist" and demanding a list of the detained Venezuelans and their legal status. This proposal comes amidst international scrutiny of El Salvador's detention of deportees in its mega-prison.</p>

            <p>The United Kingdom is set to dramatically increase its production of explosives used by the military to reduce its dependence on the United States and France. Defence Secretary John Healey called it an "important step" to ensure the UK's security. This initiative comes amid rising global tensions and a desire for greater self-sufficiency in defense capabilities. The increased production will aim to meet the needs of the UK's armed forces and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers.</p>

            <p>JPMorgan has released new research outlining its expectations for President Donald Trump's trade policies, predicting that tariffs will lead to "some deals" but that tax rates will still increase significantly. The firm's base case scenario suggests an effective tariff rate between 10% and 20%, which would result in slower economic growth, increased unemployment, and inflation. JPMorgan recommends that investors consider structured notes and hedge funds in diversified portfolios to navigate the more volatile environment. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>An analysis of HBO's 'The Last of Us' Season 2 discusses the controversial death of protagonist Joel, highlighting differences from the video game adaptation. The show's extended and graphic depiction of Joel's torture and murder, combined with the destruction of Jackson, lacks the surprise and emotional impact of the game. The author argues that Season 2's focus on pain and fractured bonds, while thematically consistent, results in a punishing and less insightful viewing experience compared to Season 1's exploration of hope and connection amidst impossible circumstances.</p>
