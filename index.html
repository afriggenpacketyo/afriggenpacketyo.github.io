        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has suspended visas for foreign students at Harvard University for six months, citing national security concerns and accusing the institution of having "extensive entanglements" with foreign countries and failing to address civil rights issues. Harvard responded by filing court documents to block the order, arguing it is retaliatory and violates their First Amendment rights. The university is developing contingency plans for its international students, who comprise about a quarter of the student population. This action follows previous legal battles between Harvard and the administration over federal funding and accusations of antisemitism on campus, with the White House threatening to strip Columbia University of its accreditation over similar claims. The legal battle continues to unfold. Optimism surrounding the situation remains relatively low.</p>

          <p>The FBI and Department of Homeland Security issued a joint public service announcement warning of an "elevated threat" to Israeli and Jewish communities in the U.S., citing potential violence motivated by the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. The announcement references recent incidents, including a Molotov cocktail attack on pro-Israel demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado, and the killing of two Israeli embassy staff members in Washington, D.C. Authorities believe the conflict may inspire violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators, and foreign terrorist organizations may exploit the situation to incite attacks in the U.S. The public is urged to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to law enforcement, as these events may continue. The overall outlook remains cautious.</p>

          <p>Ispace's privately-built Japanese lander, Resilience, experienced a mission-ending "hard landing" on the moon after a failed touchdown attempt. Telemetry indicated a higher-than-expected descent velocity and loss of communication moments before the projected landing time. The lander was carrying cameras, science payloads, a tiny rover named Tenacious, and an art project. This marks the second unsuccessful lunar landing attempt by ispace, highlighting the challenges of low-cost lunar transportation. While the mission's primary goals were not achieved, the company is analyzing the data to identify the cause of the failure and restore trust.</p>

          <p>A former prison guard in Japan recounts his experiences with executions, detailing the procedures and the emotional impact on those involved. Despite Japan's high public support for the death penalty, the guard describes the weight of his role, particularly as the "noose handler," and the haunting faces of condemned inmates. He supports the death penalty but acknowledges the burden it places on those who carry it out. The article also touches on the case of Iwao Hakamata, who was acquitted after nearly 48 years of wrongful imprisonment, and ongoing discussions about Japan's capital punishment system.</p>

          <p>A growing trend focuses on consuming food products with fewer ingredients, driven by concerns about ultra-processed foods. This trend is particularly beneficial for individuals with food allergies, making shopping and cooking easier. However, some nutritionists argue that focusing solely on ingredient lists can lead to the exclusion of fortified nutrients essential for public health. Experts suggest that simplifying food formulas and utilizing new processing technologies can create less processed products without sacrificing nutritional value. The trend is expected to drive increased marketing efforts promoting the virtues of less processed foods and justifying their higher price points.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that young offenders in many states are often denied credit for "dead time" spent in juvenile detention, unlike adults who receive credit for time served awaiting trial. This practice extends the duration of confinement for juveniles, incurring significant costs and negatively impacting their well-being. The juvenile justice system, intended to be rehabilitative rather than punitive, often results in unequal application of rights and disparities in treatment across states. Policy experts argue this lack of time credit undermines the system's rehabilitative goals and perpetuates cycles of incarceration. Reform efforts are underway in some states to address this inequity.</p>

The White House claims Harvard is a "hotbed" of anti-American sentiment, while Harvard argues the administration is retaliating against it for refusing to cede control over its governance and curriculum.

Developers will be required to add panels unless the buildings fall under certain exemptions, such as being covered by shade.

          <h2>David Brooks: The Democrats' Problems Are Bigger Than You Think</h2>

          <p>Opinion columnist David Brooks argues that the Democratic Party's challenges are more profound than simply needing new leaders or messages. He asserts that the party must adapt to a new historical era characterized by social distrust and a sense that the system is rigged. Brooks suggests that the Republican Party, under Trump, has been more successful in adjusting to this shift by challenging traditional conservative orthodoxy. The Democrats, according to Brooks, need a more fundamental reimagining to address the current political climate. The future remains uncertain for the Democratic Party.</p>

          <p>Israel has conducted airstrikes on the southern outskirts of Beirut, targeting areas where Hezbollah holds sway. The strikes were reportedly some of the heaviest since a U.S.-brokered cease-fire came into effect in November. Israel cited Hezbollah drone workshops as the reason for the airstrikes. This action escalates tensions in the region. The situation remains volatile.</p>
