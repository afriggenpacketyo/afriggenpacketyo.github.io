        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a three-day delay, the UN reported that 90 lorry loads of humanitarian aid have been collected inside the Gaza Strip, following the easing of an 11-week blockade by Israel. The aid, including flour, baby food, and medical equipment, was distributed to bakeries and hot meal kitchens, but humanitarian organizations warn that it is "nowhere near enough" to address the severe hunger affecting Gaza's 2.1 million residents. The UN and its partners have over 140,000 tonnes of food ready to be brought into Gaza, but safe routes and a ceasefire are urgently needed to ensure the aid reaches those in need. Meanwhile, Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu stated he was allowing a limited amount of food into Gaza so that the Israeli military could continue its newly expanded ground offensive.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration escalated its conflict with Harvard University by halting its ability to enroll international students through the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem cited Harvard's alleged failure to comply with information requests and its purported hostile environment for Jewish students as reasons for the revocation. Harvard officials decried the action as unlawful and retaliatory, asserting their commitment to maintaining their international student body, which comprises approximately 27% of the university. The decision could significantly impact Harvard's finances, given that international students often contribute a larger share of education costs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans have proposed an amendment to President Trump's domestic policy bill to create "Trump accounts" for newborns, providing $1,000 to every eligible child's account, which would be invested in the stock market. Families could contribute up to $5,000 annually to the accounts, which could be used for expenses such as a down payment on a home, education, or starting a small business. While similar to existing state programs, experts note that the initial contribution may not be sufficient to cover significant expenses, and tax penalties could disproportionately affect lower-income families. Some experts question the tax benefits of the proposed accounts, suggesting they may function similarly to taxable brokerage accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has ceded sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, a move driven by legal challenges and security considerations. The government feared that without ceding sovereignty, the joint UK-US military base on Diego Garcia would become unworkable due to rulings from UN bodies asserting Mauritius's claim to the islands. Additionally, the agreement aims to prevent China from establishing a military presence in the islands, as the UK can now effectively veto any foreign power's presence. The deal has faced criticism from those who believe the UK is weakening its security and submitting to international lawyers.</p>

          <p>In an interview with Ezra Klein, Jake Tapper discusses his new book, "Original Sin," which investigates the reasons behind Joe Biden's decision to run for re-election despite concerns about his age and cognitive abilities. Tapper recounts special prosecutor Robert Hur's interviews with Biden, where the president appeared forgetful and meandering, leading to questions about his fitness for office. The article highlights the White House's alleged cover-up of Biden's cognitive decline, with close advisors downplaying concerns and shielding him from rigorous press engagements. Tapper suggests that loyalty and a desire to prevent Donald Trump's return to the White House blinded many Democrats to Biden's limitations.</p>

The collaboration aims to create a new family of devices optimized for artificial intelligence, as current devices like laptops and phones are considered outdated for this purpose. Ive and his design firm LoveFrom will oversee design and creative responsibilities across OpenAI and io. Analysts suggest this move positions OpenAI to shape the user experience for physical AI, which involves integrating AI into tangible objects like robots and wearable technologies.</p>

With HELOC rates increasing and other financing options like personal loans and credit cards carrying higher interest rates, securing a home equity loan now could be advantageous.

          <p>A small jet crashed into a residential neighborhood in San Diego, killing at least two people on board and injuring eight others on the ground. The Cessna Citation crashed in Murphy Canyon near the Tierrasanta neighborhood just before 4 a.m., igniting homes and cars and forcing the evacuation of about 100 people. The NTSB and FAA are investigating the crash, which occurred in dense fog as the pilot approached Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport. Remarkably, there were no serious injuries or deaths among those who live near the crash.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a nationwide injunction blocking the Trump administration from terminating the legal status of thousands of international students in the U.S. The judge found that the students were likely to succeed in their challenge to the administration's actions, which terminated their SEVIS records under the "Student Criminal Alien Initiative". The order prevents immigration authorities from arresting or deporting the students and bars the administration from reversing its reinstatement of certain students' legal status. The judge criticized the administration's shifting justifications for the terminations.</p>

          <p>The Senate voted to block California’s plan to phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles, a move that could impact the electric car market across the United States. The 51-44 vote, supported by Republicans and one Democrat, reverses California's authority to set stricter emissions standards than federal regulations. California leaders plan to challenge the Senate vote, while Republicans argue that the state is effectively setting national policy. The decision comes as the Trump administration seeks to weaken federal emissions limits and cut funding for climate programs.</p>

          <p>The Senate voted to revoke three vehicle emissions waivers in California, which set stricter standards than federal regulations. The vote, supported by Republicans and one Democrat, has been criticized as an illegal move that bypasses the filibuster and sets a dangerous precedent. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn the waivers, while Democrats maintain the vote is illegal and will result in California suing the federal government. The decision is expected to impact cities and states across the country that have adopted California's vehicle standards.</p>
