          <p>Eli Sharabi, a former Hamas hostage held for 491 days, is rebuilding his life after an unimaginable ordeal. In his new book, "Hostage," he details the brutal conditions in Gaza's tunnels, including torture and starvation, and the psychological strength he drew from believing his family was alive. Upon his release, he learned the devastating truth that his wife, Lianne, and their two daughters, Noiya and Yahel, were killed during the October 7th attack. Despite his profound loss, which also includes his brother killed in captivity, Sharabi is choosing to be optimistic and advocate for the remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>For those looking to buy a home or refinance, current mortgage rates remain a significant factor, though they are higher than in previous years. As of late September 2025, average rates for a 30-year mortgage are around 6.27%, while 30-year refinance rates are near 6.61%. Experts suggest that strengthening one's credit profile and shopping around with different lenders are key strategies to secure a better rate. While the market is challenging, potential pauses in Federal Reserve rate hikes could offer some relief for future borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

Kirby described running for his life, feeling shrapnel hit his leg, and the immense fear of not knowing if his family was safe.

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, a powerful Category 4 storm, is expected to generate dangerous swells and life-threatening surf and rip currents along most of the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda this week. While the storm's center is projected to pass west of Bermuda, its effects will be felt broadly across the western Atlantic. The National Hurricane Center has issued a tropical storm watch for Bermuda and warns that the swells will also impact the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Humberto is the eighth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House to discuss a comprehensive 21-point plan aimed at ending the war in Gaza. The White House expressed confidence that both sides would agree to the proposal. The meeting occurred as Trump also prepared to meet with bipartisan congressional leaders to negotiate a continuing resolution to avert a government shutdown. The administration is pushing for a "clean" resolution, stating there is "nothing to negotiate," while Democrats are focused on extending Affordable Care Act tax credits.</p>

          <p>Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old man charged with the aggravated murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, is expected to appear in a Utah court. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, citing evidence that includes text messages and a note left for his roommate indicating his intent. In the note, Robinson allegedly wrote he had an opportunity to kill one of the nation's leading conservative voices and was "going to take it." The assassination has become a galvanizing moment for Republicans, with President Trump declaring Kirk a "martyr" for freedom.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda is forecast to intensify into a hurricane as it moves through the western Atlantic, though its projected path shows it moving away from the southeastern United States. As of Monday morning, the storm was bringing heavy rain and tropical storm conditions to the northwestern Bahamas. While a tropical storm warning is in effect for parts of the Bahamas, watches for Florida's coast have been canceled. Swells from Imelda, along with Hurricane Humberto, are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along much of the U.S. East Coast this week.</p>

His withdrawal significantly alters the race, which now primarily features Democrat Zohran Mamdani, former governor Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa.

The move follows allegations that the Indian government has used Bishnoi members to carry out violent acts and target supporters of the pro-Khalistan movement in Canada. The action comes as Canada and India work to repair diplomatic relations strained by the 2023 assassination of a Sikh separatist leader in British Columbia.</p>

Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated the grants will be targeted at "tens of thousands" of students from lower-income households who are enrolled in priority courses aligned with the country's industrial strategy. The grants were abolished a decade ago, and their return is intended to alleviate the financial burden on students facing a rising cost of living.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the ideological divide within American Christianity, highlighted by the reactions to conservative activist Charlie Kirk's death. It contrasts the message of forgiveness from Kirk's widow, Erika, with President Trump's subsequent declaration that he "hates" his opponents, which was met with cheers. The author argues that for a significant segment of evangelicals, politics has filled a void left by faith, creating a "culture-war Christianity" that embraces conflict and views compassion as weakness. This movement sees Trump as a fighter for their cause, deforming traditional Christian teachings on love and mercy.</p>

          <p>For the first time in nearly two decades, enrollment in Medicare Advantage is expected to fall, with projections showing a drop from 35 million to 34 million members in 2026. Health insurers are cutting back on unprofitable plans and exiting some markets due to shrinking profits caused by rising medical costs and new regulations. As a result, seniors may face higher premiums and reduced benefits during the upcoming open enrollment period. Analysts note that insurers are also eliminating broker commissions on many plans to steer enrollment towards more profitable options. (not investment advice)</p>

The gathering has summoned hundreds of generals and admirals from around the world, fueling speculation about its purpose. While Trump described the meeting as a celebratory "esprit de corps" event, some defense officials and analysts believe it may foreshadow significant cuts to the general officer corps or changes in U.S. force posture, consistent with War Secretary Pete Hegseth's stated goals. Hegseth has already dismissed two dozen senior officers and pledged a 20% reduction in general officer ranks.</p>

          <p>Iran is once again facing a "full, suffocating embargo" as UN sanctions automatically snap back into place, a mechanism triggered by the UK, France, and Germany over Tehran's non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal. The reinstated sanctions will block banking channels, halt oil exports, and restrict trade, which is expected to cause Iran's currency to collapse and exacerbate daily hardships for its citizens. While Western powers express a willingness to pursue diplomacy, Iran's leadership has dismissed talks. The move places Iran under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, designating it a threat to international peace.</p>

          <p>The United States under President Trump is building closer ties with Pakistan, prompting concern and strategic recalculations in India. Recent White House meetings with Pakistan's prime minister and army chief have focused on economic cooperation, including a deal for lower tariffs. This warming U.S.-Pakistan relationship contrasts with cooling U.S.-India ties, which have been strained by issues like tariffs on India over its continued import of Russian oil. Indian policy experts are now questioning the reliability of the U.S. as a long-term strategic partner, which could reshape India's approach to the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

According to the article, the LY-1 is designed for close-range interception of missiles and drones, serving as the "last line of defence" for naval vessels. The journal claims the Chinese system is more robust and advanced than its American counterparts, such as the Helios laser, noting that the LY-1's lens aperture is nearly twice the diameter.

Many have raised their houses on stilts, but the relentless high tides are forcing some to consider abandoning the island they have called home for generations.
