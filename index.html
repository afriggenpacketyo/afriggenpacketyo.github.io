          <p>President Trump has ordered an investigation into President Biden and implemented a travel ban on citizens from 12 countries, citing national security concerns. The new travel ban affects individuals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, with restrictions varying for each country. This action echoes similar bans enacted during Trump's first term and could face legal challenges. Other news includes a U.N. resolution vetoed by the U.S. regarding a Gaza ceasefire, and concerns about testing babies for incurable diseases. The article also touches on the discovery of clever cockatoos drinking from water fountains.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has revived a lawsuit from an Ohio woman who claimed she experienced reverse discrimination when her employer denied her a promotion because she is straight. The unanimous decision in Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services rejects the requirement for majority group members to meet a higher bar in discrimination cases. Marlean Ames sued after allegedly being passed over for a promotion in favor of a gay woman and then demoted and replaced by a gay man, claiming sexual orientation discrimination. This ruling comes amid broader scrutiny of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs following the Supreme Court's decision ending affirmative action in college admissions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Proposed tariffs by President Trump could substantially increase the price of goods like shoes and sweaters, particularly those imported from China and Vietnam. According to pricing models created by AlixPartners, a 30% tariff could raise the price of a men's cotton sweater made in China by about 19%, while a 145% tariff could spike the price by roughly 90%. Similarly, a 10% tariff on goods from Vietnam could increase prices by about 8%, and a 46% levy could raise prices by roughly 35%. While retailers may try to offset these costs, the levies could still take a major toll on U.S. households. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have reportedly spoken by phone, marking their first known conversation since trade tensions escalated. This call comes after a series of escalating tariffs between the two countries, which had been temporarily eased following bilateral trade talks in Geneva. Both Washington and Beijing have recently accused each other of violating the Geneva agreement, leading to renewed uncertainty in trade relations. The two leaders previously met in June 2019, and a planned U.S. state visit to China in 2020 was canceled due to the pandemic.</p>

As the controversy escalates, some academics and commentators have begun to examine how it reflects the Chinese public‚Äôs growing disillusionment with elite education.

          <p>The Trump administration's immigration crackdown is leaving children terrified and isolated, with reports of children being used as "bait" to arrest and deport their caregivers. Advocates say the administration is enacting punitive policies to expedite the removal of unaccompanied minors and strip them of legal representation. Cases include a 10-year-old girl whose mother was detained during a routine check-in and a 14-year-old boy visited by plainclothes officers for a "wellness check." New policies make it difficult for relatives to take custody of children, leading to prolonged detention and emotional distress.</p>

          <p>Edgar Chagwa Lungu, the former President of Zambia, has died at the age of 68 after receiving medical treatment in South Africa. Lungu served as Zambia's sixth president from 2015 to 2021, during which he focused on improving Zambia's international standing and diversifying its economy. However, his presidency also faced economic challenges and political tensions, with critics accusing him of suppressing opposition. After being defeated in the 2021 election, Lungu initially retired but later returned to active politics.</p>

          <p>The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in China is expected to alleviate labor shortages in the long term, but its impact on deflationary pressures in the near term is debated. Some analysts believe that AI could exacerbate deflationary pressures by disrupting the labor market, while others argue that the main causes of deflation are overcapacity and sluggish domestic demand. It is suggested that China should continue to develop AI as a strategically important industry, while also addressing overinvestment and excessive competition.</p>
