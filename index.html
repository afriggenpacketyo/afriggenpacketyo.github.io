        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is deploying 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests, despite objections from California's governor. The deployment relies on a federal law allowing the president to federalize National Guard troops under specific circumstances, such as invasion or rebellion, but requires orders to be issued through state governors, raising questions about the legality of the move without Newsom's consent. These troops will support immigration officers, not engage in law enforcement, to avoid violating restrictions unless the Insurrection Act is invoked. This action follows Trump's previous attempts to use the military to quell protests and signals a willingness to use federal force on home soil. Optimism score is based on the potential for escalation and the disregard for local governance. The optimism score is 30.</p>

          <p>Primary school teacher Alice Cole discusses her experience returning to work part-time after having a child, highlighting the importance of flexible working arrangements for new parents in the teaching profession. Cole believes that offering such flexibility is crucial for addressing recruitment and retention issues, allowing teachers to balance their professional and personal lives. Government data indicates a slight improvement in teacher retention but ongoing challenges in recruiting new teachers, especially in specialist subjects. The article also touches on the broader issues of pay and working conditions as key factors influencing teachers' decisions to leave the profession. The stability of teachers is paramount to the wellbeing of children, and the fact that teachers are feeling more empowered is promising. The optimism score is 75.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece asserts that Donald Trump's actions, such as increasing personal wealth through foreign investments and real estate ventures, pose a fundamental danger to the U.S. political system. The author argues that Trump's behavior mirrors corrupt practices seen in countries like Russia and Hungary, where leaders prioritize personal gain over national interests. The piece highlights concerns about the erosion of checks and balances, the capture of the justice system by loyalists, and the rise of oligarchs. The author suggests that the U.S. risks becoming a country where power is personalized and used for profit, undermining democratic institutions. The potential for corruption is low, but still concerning. The optimism score is 25.</p>

          <p>President Trump has deployed 2,000 National Guard troops to California, escalating tensions with Governor Gavin Newsom, who accuses the White House of sowing chaos. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth indicated that active-duty Marines are on high alert for mobilization, further intensifying the situation. Trump justified the deployment by claiming the need to solve a problem the Mayor and Governor couldn't handle, despite reports from the Los Angeles Police Department indicating peaceful demonstrations. This action highlights the widening political divide between California's leaders and the federal government on immigration enforcement. The optics of this deployment are not great for either side of the political spectrum. The optimism score is 35.</p>

          <p>Russian authorities reported that a Ukrainian drone attack targeting Moscow led to the temporary closure of two key airports serving the capital.

          <p>Protests broke out in Los Angeles after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations led to arrests, prompting President Trump to order the deployment of National Guard troops. The protests were triggered by ICE officers executing search warrants at multiple locations, including a clothing warehouse in the Fashion District. Demonstrators gathered around federal buildings and other locations, alleging migration detentions, leading to clashes with law enforcement. The deployment of the National Guard, authorized under Title 10 authority, has been criticized by local officials, including Governor Newsom, who views it as inflammatory and eroding public trust. The escalation of protests could lead to more violence. The optimism score is 30.</p>
