          <p>President Trump announced that the United States military launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan, confirming that all planes had exited Iranian airspace after dropping a full payload of bombs on Fordow. He praised the American military for the successful operation and called for peace. The U.S. had alerted Israel before the strikes, with Prime Minister Netanyahu expressing his support. Iranian state media acknowledged the attacks, and House Speaker Mike Johnson was briefed beforehand, while Homeland Security officials are monitoring for potential retaliatory actions domestically. The U.S. reached out to Iran diplomatically to state that regime change efforts are not planned.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared that the United States struck three Iranian nuclear facilities on Saturday, escalating the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran. Trump announced the strikes on Truth Social, stating that all planes had left Iranian airspace and bombs were dropped on Fordo. The announcement followed a week of speculation about potential U.S. involvement, with Trump initially suggesting a two-week timeframe for negotiations. The strikes sparked mixed reactions from American leaders, with some Republicans praising the move and Democrats questioning the president's authority.</p>

          <p>Several Chinese ambassadors have recently concluded their tenures in West African nations, leading to speculation about the reasons behind these departures. While some analysts believe these are routine diplomatic rotations, others suggest it could be a subtle message to Sahelian regimes regarding resource nationalism and security concerns. The departing ambassadors played roles in strengthening Sino-African relations, particularly in countries with significant Chinese investments like Guinea, home to the Simandou iron ore mine. As ties with Western countries strained, Burkina Faso deepened relations with China, establishing a strategic partnership in 2024, highlighting the evolving dynamics between China and the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that U.S. warplanes bombed three nuclear sites in Iran, an attack he described as "very successful".

Iran had previously warned of reprisals if the U.S. joined Israel in attacking its territory, leading to concerns about potential escalation. The success of the strikes in destroying Iranian nuclear research facilities remains uncertain, which could increase pressure for further military action and create domestic political divisions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's surprise strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities were likely aided by misdirection, with the announcement coming shortly after the press secretary stated a decision on Iran would unfold within two weeks. Reports of B-2 stealth bombers heading to Guam were likely part of the deception, suggesting President Trump had delayed the decision. The strikes followed months of stalled nuclear negotiations and heightened concerns about Iran's nuclear program. Israel launched pre-emptive strikes on Iran on June 12, leading to heightened concern that Iran was advancing its nuclear program.</p>

He stated that all planes are now outside of Iranian airspace and that a full payload of bombs was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. The action puts the United States in direct armed conflict with Iran, a massive escalation in its involvement with Israel's effort to cripple Tehran's nuclear program. This marks a major shift from just 48 hours ago, when Trump said the United States would take "two weeks" to see if the conflict between Israel and Iran could be resolved diplomatically.</p>

          <p>President Trump contradicted his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, regarding Iran's nuclear program, stating that she was "wrong" in her assessment that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon. The White House asserted that Iran possesses the necessary components to develop a nuclear weapon within weeks. Gabbard defended her testimony, accusing media outlets of taking her comments out of context. The disagreement comes as the Trump administration considers joining Israel in its strikes on Iran.</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from making drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation. The policy change could have stripped universities of tens of millions of dollars in research funding, threatening critical work in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Judge Indira Talwani ruled the change was arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law. The University of California estimated the change would cost it just under $100 million a year.</p>

          <p>Israel's strikes against Iran have damaged its nuclear facilities, but the complete destruction of Iran's ability to make weapons-grade uranium is believed to be out of reach without U.S. assistance. The GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP), a 30,000-pound bomb, could be used to destroy the underground Fordo facility. The MOP is designed to penetrate deeply buried targets, and the B-2 Spirit bomber is the only aircraft equipped to carry and deploy it. The B-2's stealth capabilities allow it to evade air defenses and reach heavily defended targets.</p>

          <p>Iran's Fordo nuclear facility has long been a concern for international monitors due to its location deep within a mountain and its potential for clandestine nuclear weapons efforts. Despite U.S. intelligence assessments stating that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon, Israel asserted that Iran was racing towards a nuclear bomb. The IAEA has declared Iran non-compliant with its monitoring efforts, raising concerns about the lack of transparency at the facility. Experts believe that destroying Fordo would require the U.S.-produced GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, delivered by a B-2 bomber.</p>
