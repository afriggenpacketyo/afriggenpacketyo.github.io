          <p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff is set to travel to Europe to continue diplomatic efforts for a ceasefire and peace agreement in the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. Indirect negotiations, mediated by Qatar, Egypt, and the U.S., are reportedly at a critical stage, focusing on a 60-day truce in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian detainees. A key sticking point remains the positioning of Israeli Defense Forces within Gaza during the proposed ceasefire. The Trump administration is said to be cautiously optimistic about a potential breakthrough in the protracted talks.</p>

          <p>The Hershey Company is set to implement a "low double-digit" price increase across its candy portfolio, citing the unprecedented high cost of cocoa. The price of cocoa has skyrocketed due to a global shortage driven by poor weather conditions and disease affecting crops in West Africa, the world's primary growing region. Hershey stated the move is a direct reflection of these rising ingredient costs and not related to trade policies. The company also plans to focus more on products that are less reliant on cocoa to navigate the volatile market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated he is considering the elimination of the federal capital gains tax on profits from home sales, a move that would significantly alter real estate taxation. Currently, sellers can exclude up to $250,000 (or $500,000 for joint filers) in gains, a limit unchanged since 1997. Proponents argue that removing the tax would unlock housing inventory by incentivizing older homeowners to sell, while critics contend it would primarily benefit wealthy individuals and could further inflate home prices. The proposal is part of a broader discussion on how to stimulate the housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

Additionally, a set of moose antlers affixed to an external wing strut created significant drag and a weight imbalance.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to withdraw the United States from UNESCO, the U.N.'s cultural and scientific agency, for the second time. The State Department cited the organization's promotion of "divisive social and cultural causes" and a "globalist, ideological agenda" as contrary to U.S. national interests. The administration also reiterated objections to UNESCO's 2011 admission of Palestine as a member state. This decision reverses the Biden administration's move to rejoin the agency in 2023, highlighting fluctuating U.S. engagement with international bodies.</p>

          <p>Speaking at a Federal Reserve conference, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman delivered a stark prediction about the impact of artificial intelligence on the labor market, stating that some job categories, such as customer support, will be completely eliminated. He argued that AI can already perform these roles more effectively than humans and suggested its diagnostic capabilities are superior to most doctors. Altman's comments were made as the Trump administration unveiled its AI action plan, and he also warned of AI's potential use as a weapon and for sophisticated fraud, positioning his company as a key partner in navigating this future.</p>

          <p>U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has sparked a lighthearted controversy over his choice of attire for a strenuous hike in Arizona. Despite temperatures exceeding 90°F, the 71-year-old was photographed hiking Phoenix's Camelback Mountain while wearing dark blue jeans, a choice that baffled fellow hikers and social media users. This is not the first time Kennedy, known for his contrarian views, has been seen exercising in denim. The incident drew attention partly because his own department's CDC guidelines recommend wearing lightweight, light-colored clothing in extreme heat to prevent illness.</p>

          <p>A coalition of advocacy groups is calling for the immediate closure of a controversial immigrant detention facility in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," citing inhumane and dangerous conditions. Detainees are reportedly held in overcrowded, flood-prone tents with sewage backups, and Mexico's president confirmed 14 Mexican citizens are held there. The facility was established by Florida and the Trump administration to support a crackdown on undocumented immigrants, with officials touting its harsh, remote environment.

          <p>A new student loan repayment option, the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), has been established by recent federal legislation signed into law by President Trump.

It will offer loan forgiveness after 30 years. As other repayment plans are phased out, RAP may become one of the few affordable options for new borrowers after it becomes available by July 1, 2026.

          <p>An analysis of President Donald Trump's recent posting spree on his Truth Social platform suggests a shift in tone and strategy, possibly driven by a feeling of powerlessness. The article notes that his posts, which included bizarre viral videos and AI-generated images of political rivals in prison, seemed aimed at distracting from ongoing controversies and creating a fantasy world where he is triumphant. This behavior is contrasted with his earlier, more directive social media use, which often shaped global events. The current pattern is interpreted as a sign of a president who feels he is losing control of the narrative.</p>
