        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a years-long debate over racial sensitivity, the Berlin-Mitte district has officially renamed "Mohrenstrasse" to "Anton Wilhelm Amo Strasse." The original name used the word "Mohr," an outdated and derogatory German term for people of African descent. The new name honors Anton Wilhelm Amo, a Ghanian-born 18th-century scholar who is considered the first prominent Black philosopher at a German university. The change, celebrated by local politicians as a "clear sign in favor of respect and diversity," proceeded after a court initially halted and then approved the renaming, marking a significant moment for racial inclusion in the city.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's Vice Chancellor Lars Klingbeil has voiced his support for a potential ban on the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, stating that democracy cannot simply "stand by and watch" as an anti-constitutional party attempts to undermine it. Klingbeil, a member of the Social Democrats (SPD), emphasized that any such decision must follow careful investigation by Germany's domestic intelligence agency. However, the proposal has met with skepticism from senior coalition partners in the Christian Democrats (CDU), with Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressing doubts that a ban is the most effective course of action against the party's rising influence.</p>

          <p>Lieutenant General Alfons Mais, the chief of Germany's army, has warned that his forces might be called into conflict before they are fully prepared, despite making significant progress in combat readiness. As Germany invests billions to modernize its military, the Bundeswehr, Mais expressed concern that an attack could occur at a "suboptimal time." He stressed the need for soldiers to have the right mindset for defense, noting that new recruits are more serious, knowing there is a war in Europe. The German government aims to build the strongest military in Europe, which requires substantial increases in both equipment and personnel.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to introduce a new sentencing bill that would grant courts in England and Wales the power to impose broader restrictions, such as bans from pubs, sporting events, and driving, for a wider range of offenses. The legislation aims to create more robust community sentences and is part of a larger overhaul that includes measures to ease prison overcrowding, such as restricting short sentences and allowing early release for some well-behaved inmates. These reforms are based on recommendations from a recent independent review. Critics and industry groups have raised concerns about the practicalities of enforcing such bans.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump responded to an invitation from Maryland Governor Wes Moore for a public safety walk in Baltimore by suggesting he could deploy the National Guard to the city. In a social media post, Trump stated that if the governor needs assistance, he would send in "troops" to "quickly clean up the crime," comparing the potential action to federal interventions in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. He criticized Moore's record on crime and the tone of the invitation, asserting that Baltimore ranks among the most dangerous cities in the United States.</p>

          <p>UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell described the formal declaration of famine in Gaza City as a catastrophic, man-made crisis that her organization has been warning about for months. In an interview, she highlighted the devastating impact on children, estimating that 18,000 have already died since the conflict began, with many now wasting away from starvation. Russell refuted Israeli claims that the data is flawed, calling arguments over methodology "obscene" when children are visibly dying. She emphasized that the famine is not due to natural disasters but a direct result of the inability to get sufficient humanitarian aid into the territory.</p>

          <p>The British government intends to reform the asylum appeals system to address what Home Secretary Yvette Cooper called "unacceptable delays" and reduce the costly reliance on housing migrants in hotels. The plan involves establishing a new body staffed by independent adjudicators to hear appeals more swiftly, as the current process averages over a year per case. This initiative comes amid increasing public pressure and protests regarding the use of hotels for the 32,000 asylum seekers awaiting decisions. The Refugee Council responded by stating that the most effective way to reduce appeals is to ensure initial decisions are correct.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has extended its use of Napier Barracks in Kent to house asylum seekers until the end of the year, reversing a previous plan to close the site in September. The former military base has been a source of controversy since 2020 due to poor living conditions, which a High Court judge described as "squalid" and "inadequate" in 2021. Despite government claims of "significant" improvements, the decision to continue using the facility has faced criticism. This move follows a separate court ruling that blocked the use of a hotel in Epping for housing asylum seekers, complicating the government's accommodation strategy.</p>

Speaking about recent diplomatic efforts, Petraeus expressed skepticism about a potential meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, suggesting the dynamics on the ground must change first. He advocated for the U.S. to increase its support by lifting restrictions on long-range weapons for Ukraine and seizing $300 billion in frozen Russian assets to aid Kyiv.

          <p>Emine Erdogan, the wife of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has written a letter to U.S. First Lady Melania Trump, appealing for her to advocate for the children affected by the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Referencing Mrs. Trump's previous outreach to Vladimir Putin regarding children in Ukraine, Erdogan urged her to show the same compassion for Palestinian children and to ask Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to take measures to end the crisis. The letter describes the deep psychological trauma and suffering of Gaza's youth. This appeal comes as casualty figures from Gaza's Health Ministry continue to rise, with a significant portion being women and children.</p>

          <p>According to Al-Awda Hospital and eyewitnesses, Israeli forces opened fire and killed four Palestinians who were seeking food aid south of Gaza City on Sunday. The incident occurred as a crowd was heading towards a distribution point in the Netzarim corridor, an area frequently used by civilians to access humanitarian supplies. Witnesses described the gunfire as indiscriminate, stating it began when people near the front of the crowd pushed forward before the site's scheduled opening. This event adds to the growing number of casualties among aid seekers as a U.N.-backed initiative officially declared a famine in parts of the Gaza Strip.</p>

          <p>Medical research conducted during the Nazi era, which involved horrific human experiments on prisoners, continues to cast a long shadow over modern medicine. Data from these unethical studies, such as those on cold tolerance and chemical weapons, were published and cited for decades after the war, sometimes without acknowledging their origin. A new online database now provides detailed profiles of 16,000 victims, shedding more light on the atrocities. While the direct scientific value of this data is now limited, the legacy persists in general medical knowledge and serves as a crucial, extreme example for contemporary ethical debates about medical research.</p>

          <p>American universities are facing a profound crisis, caught between political pressures from both the left and right that threaten their core mission of academic freedom. With public trust plummeting, institutions are struggling to navigate controversies, often issuing bland statements that fail to defend the principle of open inquiry. The article argues that to save their souls, universities must reclaim a stance of "institutional neutrality," protecting the right of individuals to express diverse and even offensive views while the institution itself remains apolitical. Without a vigorous defense of free speech, universities risk becoming "sectarian" and losing their role as vital centers for knowledge production.</p>

          <p>SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk in 2002, has grown from a struggling startup to a dominant force upon which the U.S. space industry heavily relies. The company's survival and subsequent success were critically bolstered by pivotal multi-billion dollar NASA contracts to resupply the International Space Station and later, to transport astronauts. Today, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule are NASA's primary vehicles for human spaceflight, while its Starlink satellites provide vital internet services globally. The company's dominance in launch services and its development of the Starship rocket have made it an indispensable partner for both government and commercial space ambitions.</p>

The article argues that this resistance is not temporary but is anchored in foundational security priorities and centuries of shared cultural and strategic integration with Washington. While economic ties with China are substantial, allies instinctively prioritize their defense commitments and intelligence-sharing agreements with the U.S. As a result, their discontent with American policies leads to calls for restraint rather than any meaningful support for a China-led geopolitical bloc.</p>

Newsom has also engaged in a series of lawsuits and has adopted a more aggressive, Trump-like social media style to challenge the president directly on issues like federal troop deployments in Los Angeles and threats to the state's economy.
