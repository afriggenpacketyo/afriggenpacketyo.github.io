          <p>The White House has confirmed a halt on some weapons deliveries to Ukraine, following a Pentagon review that raised concerns about dwindling U.S. military stockpiles. This decision marks a shift in policy under the Trump administration, which stated the move was made to prioritize American interests. While the specific weapons and the scale of the pullback were not detailed, the administration has emphasized its goal of bringing the war to a negotiated end. This pause is a significant development for Ukraine, which relies heavily on U.S. military support in its ongoing conflict with Russia.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has experienced a significant political setback, being forced into a U-turn on planned changes to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) welfare benefit. A large-scale rebellion from within his own Labour party threatened to defeat the measure in the House of Commons, creating a scene of parliamentary chaos. The climbdown has weakened the Prime Minister's authority and led to questions about his control over his party and the future of his government's fiscal plans. The episode has been described as a "nightmare" by some MPs.</p>

          <p>The Miccosukee Tribe is raising strong objections to a new migrant detention facility being built in the Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz." Tribal leaders express serious environmental and safety concerns, as some of their villages are located just 900 feet from the site's entrance. The facility, which President Trump recently toured, is designed to hold up to 5,000 migrants in a remote area surrounded by swamplands. The tribe argues that no proper environmental impact study was conducted and that the facility represents a step backward for Everglades preservation efforts.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 521,000 Haitian immigrants before its scheduled expiration. The judge ruled that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem acted unlawfully by not following the congressionally mandated process for reviewing conditions in Haiti. The ruling provides a reprieve for Haitian TPS holders, who faced the termination of their legal status and work permits.

In response, Trump suggested Musk could lose more than just his EV mandate, alluding to the billions in government contracts his companies receive.

However, it also proposes cuts to social welfare programs like Medicaid and has drawn criticism, notably from Elon Musk, for potentially adding trillions to the national debt.

          <p>A significant medical innovation is saving lives on the front lines in Ukraine, where surgeons are using specially designed magnetic extractors to remove shrapnel from complex wounds. The tools, developed by a volunteer team, allow for minimally invasive procedures, including removing metal fragments from beating hearts without requiring large incisions. With shrapnel wounds accounting for up to 80% of battlefield trauma due to drone warfare, this modernized technique has become a game-changer for front-line medicine. Over 3,000 of these uncertified but life-saving devices have been distributed to hospitals and medics across the country.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet medical journal estimates that the Trump administration's decision to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) could have catastrophic global health consequences. Researchers found that USAID programs have saved an estimated 90 million lives over the past two decades. They project that if the current aid cuts remain in place through 2030, an additional 14 million people, including 4.5 million children, could die from preventable causes. The administration has argued the agency is inefficient, but the study quantifies its substantial life-saving impact.</p>
