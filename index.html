          <p>A 100-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran, Arnald Gabriel, recently honored a contract he signed over two decades ago to conduct the Wheaton Municipal Band on his 100th birthday. Gabriel, a former renowned conductor of the U.S. Air Force Band, was unable to travel due to his declining health but was determined to fulfill his promise. He led the Illinois-based band remotely, demonstrating his commitment to his word and keeping perfect time despite his age. The event celebrated a lifetime of service and integrity, connecting him with the band he had guest-conducted since 1992.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Afzal Khan has stepped down from his role as the UK's trade envoy to Turkey after facing criticism for a personal visit to the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The UK government does not officially recognize this territory, which has been occupied by Turkish troops since 1974. Khan stated the trip was paid for personally to visit family and was unrelated to his official duties, but he resigned to avoid distracting from the government's work on trade deals. The move was welcomed by opposition figures who had called for his dismissal.</p>

          <p>Recent clinical trials in India are challenging the conventional belief that people with diabetes must avoid mangoes, a fruit central to Indian summers. Two studies found that consuming mangoes in moderation, as a replacement for other carbohydrates like bread, may actually improve blood sugar control and other metabolic health markers. Researchers emphasize that portion control is crucial and the findings are not a license for unlimited consumption. The studies offer a hopeful perspective for the millions in India with type 2 diabetes, suggesting the "king of fruits" can be part of a managed diet.</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified into the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season and is expected to become a major hurricane over the weekend. Currently a Category 1 storm, it is moving west-northwest over the Atlantic with forecasters predicting it will pass near the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. While not currently projected to make landfall in the United States, authorities are urging Caribbean residents to monitor its progress due to risks of heavy rain, flash flooding, and dangerous surf conditions. The storm's formation aligns with forecasts for an above-normal hurricane season.</p>

Track and field runner Evelyn Parts is suing Swarthmore College, alleging a Title IX violation for being banned from the women's team. The lawsuit also claims Parts was later reinstated and allowed to compete until graduation, even after the new rules took effect. This case follows similar lawsuits by other transgender athletes and highlights the intensifying legal and political conflict over gender eligibility in collegiate athletics.</p>

          <p>A new mural in Redondo Beach, California, celebrating the Dodgers' 2024 World Series win features an iconic image of the late Kobe Bryant, but with a notable alteration. The painting depicts Bryant's famous celebratory pose, but his Lakers jersey has been changed to a Dodgers jersey, a creative choice by the artist and the restaurant owner who commissioned the piece. While the mural also features key Dodgers players, the Bryant modification has generated mixed reactions from the public. The artist explained the decision was intended to honor Bryant's "Mamba mentality" while staying on theme with the Dodgers celebration.</p>

The company initially advertised a starting price below $20,000 with federal tax credits, but that price point is now uncertain as those incentives are being rolled back.

          <p>The popular gaming platform Roblox is facing a new wave of lawsuits accusing the company of failing to protect children from sexual predators and inappropriate content. One complaint alleges a 10-year-old was sexually exploited by a predator who posed as a child on the platform. The lawsuits claim Roblox prioritizes profits over user safety and misrepresents its platform as a safe space for kids. In response, Roblox stated the allegations are "categorically untrue" and detailed its safety measures, including the use of AI to detect harmful communications and new age-verification tests.</p>

The author suggests that while the West promotes a rules-based order, it has failed to prevent multiple ongoing conflicts.

Bethell's previous captaincy experience is limited to junior levels, and he has had limited playing time this summer. The selection highlights England's belief in his leadership potential and provides him an opportunity to develop on the international stage.</p>
