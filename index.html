          <p>Northern Ireland's manager, Michael O'Neill, conveyed a "real sense of disappointment" following his team's 3-1 loss to Germany in a World Cup qualifying match. Despite an admirable effort that saw Isaac Price score an equalizer, Northern Ireland was ultimately overcome by two late goals from the German side. O'Neill highlighted the team's lack of depth as a key factor, noting their inability to make effective changes during a tough and short-turnaround fixture. The result marks a challenging start for Northern Ireland in their Group A campaign.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has cautioned that the U.S. government could face unprecedented financial disruption if the Supreme Court rules against President Trump's tariff plan. Bessent stated that if the tariffs are struck down, the Treasury would be forced to issue massive refunds, potentially totaling between $750 billion and $1 trillion, which would be "terrible" for the nation's finances. The administration has requested an expedited ruling from the court to overturn a lower court's decision that deemed most of the tariffs illegal. The administration is also reportedly preparing backup plans using other legal authorities should the court rule against them. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actress Drew Barrymore revealed that her daughter demonstrated remarkable presence of mind following a serious e-bike accident while on a family trip in France. The incident left her daughter with a severely injured elbow, but she quickly fashioned a tourniquet from her own bra to control the bleeding before help could arrive. Barrymore, speaking on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," expressed her amazement at her daughter's calm and resourceful actions, which she credited with saving her life. The actress confirmed that her daughter is now fine after receiving medical care for the injury.</p>

          <p>California's Republican party members are showing rare unity and energy in their opposition to Proposition 50, a ballot measure championed by Governor Gavin Newsom to redraw the state's congressional districts. At their recent convention, party leaders and gubernatorial candidates emphasized that defeating the measure is their top priority, framing it as a Democratic power grab. Republicans fear the proposition, if passed in the November special election, could cost them up to five seats in the U.S. House and influence control of Congress. The issue has galvanized the state's minority party, which has historically had more success fighting ballot measures than electing statewide candidates.</p>

          <p>Ian Goldin, a professor of globalisation and development at the University of Oxford, asserts that globalisation is not dead but is instead becoming more regional and centered in Asia. In a recent interview, Goldin stated that Asia's economic success, including its rapid growth and poverty reduction, is a direct result of its integration into the global economy. He noted that while the process is becoming more fragmented, with the U.S. partially withdrawing, Asia continues to demonstrate its benefits.

          <p>President Donald Trump attended the US Open men's final, marking his first appearance at the event in a decade. His presence at Arthur Ashe Stadium prompted heightened security measures, which led to long lines for spectators and a half-hour delay to the start of the match between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. The crowd's reaction to Trump was mixed, with reports of both cheers and boos when he was shown on the stadium's screens. The U.S. Tennis Association reportedly asked broadcasters to avoid showing any disruptions related to the president's attendance.</p>

With this win, Alcaraz reclaims the world No. 1 ranking and becomes the second-youngest man in the Open era to win six Grand Slam titles. The final was notably delayed due to extensive security measures for President Trump's attendance.</p>

          <p>The Kansas Bureau of Investigation has announced that the death of Charles Adair, a 50-year-old inmate at the Wyandotte County Detention Center, has been ruled a homicide. An autopsy determined the cause of death to be complications from "mechanical asphyxia" following a physical struggle with sheriff's deputies who were attempting to return him to his cell. Adair, who was arrested on misdemeanor warrants, became unresponsive shortly after being restrained by staff. The case has now been referred to the Wyandotte County prosecutor's office to determine if criminal charges will be filed against the staff involved.</p>

The bill intended to provide safe parking areas and access to facilities for the significant number of students living in their vehicles due to high housing costs.

The forecast includes thick fog, chilly breezes, and the possibility of scattered showers, a notable departure from the typical heat seen in September. While the cooler temperatures may be a relief for Los Angeles residents after recent heat waves, they will likely be a disappointment in the Bay Area, which has already endured its coldest summer in decades. The unusual weather pattern is attributed to an upper-level low-pressure system moving in from the Pacific Ocean.</p>

The concert review describes fans openly weeping and singing along with cathartic energy to classic hits like "Wonderwall" and "Champagne Supernova." After more than a decade apart, brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher have put aside their famous feud to deliver powerful performances that prioritize a communal fan experience.

          <p>The Formula 1 title fight between McLaren teammates Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri remained professional despite a team-made controversy at the Italian Grand Prix. A strategic pit stop decision, compounded by a slow stop for Norris, inadvertently swapped their positions on the track. The team quickly ordered Piastri to let Norris back through to restore the original order, a move based on team principles of fairness. While Piastri initially questioned the call, he complied, and both drivers later publicly supported the decision, showcasing a level of sportsmanship that has been rare in previous intra-team championship battles.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian officials have reported that Russia struck the main government cabinet building in Kyiv for the first time, part of a record-breaking wave of over 800 drones and missiles launched across the country.

At least four people were killed in other strikes, including a baby and a young woman in a residential building in Kyiv. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the barrage as a "ruthless attack" and a deliberate crime intended to prolong the war, urging international partners to help stop the attacks.</p>

          <p>In a television interview, Senator Roger Marshall, a Republican from Kansas, defended HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s role as a "disrupter" at the CDC, stating his goal is to increase transparency and trust. Marshall, a former OB-GYN, argued that not every person, particularly children, needs every recommended vaccine and that parents and doctors should be empowered to make individual decisions. He expressed specific doubts about the necessity of the Hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns. While stating that some vaccines have been highly beneficial, he suggested that a one-size-fits-all government approach is wrong and creates distrust among the public.</p>

          <p>Major UK trade unions are warning the government against any attempt to weaken its proposed Employment Rights Bill following a recent cabinet reshuffle. Leaders from Unison and other unions have voiced concerns that the departure of key supporters of the bill, including Angela Rayner, signals a wavering commitment to the legislation. The bill is set to introduce a major overhaul of workers' rights, including a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts and enhanced protections against unfair dismissal. Union leaders are demanding a clear timetable for implementation and have vowed to campaign "furiously" against any dilution of the proposed protections.</p>

          <p>John L. Burton, a formidable and proudly liberal force in California politics for over six decades, has passed away at the age of 92. Known for his rumpled appearance, profane language, and unwavering advocacy for the underprivileged, Burton served in the Assembly, Congress, and as the powerful leader of the state Senate. Alongside his brother, Rep. Phillip Burton, and former Mayor Willie Brown, he was a key figure in a political machine that dominated San Francisco and state politics for decades. After overcoming addiction, he returned to public service and later founded a nonprofit to support foster youth, leaving a lasting legacy on California policy.</p>

Zelenskyy expressed regret that Ukraine was not involved and reiterated that ending the war requires more pressure on Russia from the U.S. and European allies.

          <p>The Universal Postal Union (UPU), a UN agency, has reported that postal traffic to the United States dropped by over 80% after the Trump administration ended the "de minimis" trade exemption rule. This rule had previously allowed packages valued at under $800 to enter the country without tariffs. The sudden policy change, which took effect in late August, caused the global postal network's traffic to the U.S. to come to a "near halt." The administration defended the move as a necessary measure to combat counterfeit goods and illegal drugs, while the UPU is now working on a technical solution to restore the flow of mail.
