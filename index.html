        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia has reportedly instructed suppliers to stop producing its H20 AI chip, which was specifically designed for the Chinese market. This move follows the Chinese government's directive for local tech companies to cease purchasing the chips due to national security concerns, including fears of potential "backdoors" for remote operation. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang has addressed these concerns, stating no such backdoors exist, but the halt casts doubt on the chip's future in the lucrative Chinese market. The situation highlights the growing difficulty for tech companies navigating U.S.-China trade tensions and Beijing's push for chip self-sufficiency. (not investment advice)</p>

The cautious sentiment comes ahead of Powell's address at the Jackson Hole symposium, which is expected to provide signals about the future path of U.S. interest rates. In Japan, data showed core inflation for July cooled slightly to 3.1%, though it remained above economists' expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, has begun moving northeastward away from the North Carolina coast after bringing tropical storm conditions to the Outer Banks. While the hurricane is not expected to make landfall in the United States, officials are warning of life-threatening surf and rip currents along most of the East Coast. North Carolina's governor declared a state of emergency, and evacuation orders were issued for parts of the Outer Banks due to the risk of significant storm surge. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that Erin will gradually weaken and become a post-tropical storm over the weekend.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent meeting of European leaders at the White House is viewed as a demonstration of continued support for Ukraine, though it does little to alter the reality that a just peace remains distant. The author notes that while Ukrainians are satisfied with the visual unity, there is concern over President Trump's desire for a quick end to the war, which may not align with Ukraine's goal of restoring its territorial integrity. The prospect of a direct meeting between President Zelenskyy and Putin is considered unlikely and unproductive. The visit is seen more as a symbolic counterpoint to the recent unproductive Trump-Putin summit in Alaska.</p>

          <h2>New Study Finds Corn Plants Communicate Using Gas to Alter Soil and Defend Against Pests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 00:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered that corn plants can communicate with each other by releasing a gas called linalool, which prompts neighboring plants to modify their soil environment. This mechanism was observed in densely planted fields, where inner-row plants suffered less damage from herbivores but also exhibited reduced growth. The international team of scientists suggests that understanding this plant-to-plant interaction could lead to new strategies for optimizing crop yields and pest control.

          <p>A California parole board has denied parole for Erik Menendez, who has been imprisoned for over three decades for the 1989 murders of his parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez. The panel concluded that Menendez still poses an unreasonable risk to public safety, citing numerous prison rule violations as a primary factor in their decision. While Menendez and his brother Lyle have long claimed they acted in self-defense after years of abuse, the board found this did not justify the killings.

          <p>A court filing from a legal dispute between Elon Musk and OpenAI has revealed that Musk asked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to help finance a potential $97.4 billion takeover of the AI company in early 2025.

According to the filing, Zuckerberg and Meta were approached with a letter of intent but did not sign or agree to any investment.

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, eased to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% in the previous month. While this marks a slight cooling, the figure was higher than economists' expectations and remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for the 40th consecutive month. A significant factor in the moderation was the easing of rice price inflation, which had previously surged. Despite the dip, some analysts believe the central bank is still behind in addressing inflation and may need to consider raising its policy rates to stabilize purchasing power.

          <p>In a 5-4 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to proceed with cutting $783 million in research grants from the National Institutes of Health. The cuts are part of a broader administration effort to eliminate federal funding for initiatives related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). While lifting an injunction that blocked the cancellations, the court kept in place a block on the administration's anti-DEI guidance for future funding. Plaintiffs, including public health groups, have argued that defunding ongoing studies will cause incalculable harm to scientific progress and public health.</p>

          <p>Zack Fox, known for his work in "Abbott Elementary" and his music career, describes his perfect Sunday in Los Angeles, which balances activity, relaxation, and social time. His day includes a calisthenics workout, a walk with his dogs, and a long visit to Jalsah, a Yemeni cafe downtown. The itinerary also features a stop at the clothing store Nepenthes, dinner with friends at a plant-based Thai restaurant in Thai Town, and potentially a movie at a classic theater. He often concludes his day by working on music with friends, finding beat-making to be a low-pressure way to wrap up the weekend.</p>

          <p>Families who have been campaigning for an inquiry into maternity care at University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust say they feel "ignored and dismissed" after a meeting with Baroness Amos, the chair of a new national review. The group, who all lost babies under the trust's care, claims the chair was unprepared for the meeting and that no progress was made on their specific demands, including the appointment of midwife Donna Ockenden to lead their local inquiry. Their frustration was compounded by the appointment of a former regulator to the review team, which they believe compromises the investigation's independence.</p>

          <p>French streamer Raphaël Graven, 46, known as Jean Pormanove, died during a live broadcast that was part of a nearly 12-day extreme challenge. Police have opened an investigation into his death, which occurred while he was participating in a stream that allegedly involved humiliating and abusive treatment from other streamers. Videos from past streams show Graven being subjected to physical assaults and degrading stunts, though it is unclear to what extent his participation was voluntary. The incident has sparked outrage in France and raised serious questions about the responsibility of streaming platforms and the ethics of extreme online content.</p>

          <p>A lawyer for the online message board 4chan has stated that the company will refuse to pay a proposed £20,000 fine and subsequent daily penalties from Ofcom, the UK's media regulator. Ofcom is investigating 4chan's compliance with the new Online Safety Act, which requires platforms to protect UK users from illegal content. The lawyer argues that as a U.S.-based company, 4chan is protected by the First Amendment and that Ofcom's actions constitute an "illegal campaign of harassment." This defiance sets up a significant international clash over the extraterritorial reach of national internet regulations.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a legislative package that will allow voters to decide on a new congressional map in a special November election. The proposed map is designed to favor Democrats and could flip up to five Republican-held seats in the U.S. House. This move is a direct response to a Republican-led gerrymandering effort in Texas, with Newsom stating that California is "neutralizing" the attempt to rig elections. The plan has faced opposition from Republicans, who call it a "Gavinmander," but has gained support from prominent Democrats as a necessary countermeasure in a national political battle.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released new voluntary guidelines for baby food manufacturers, advising them to reduce sugar and salt levels in their products. The guidance also calls for an end to the promotion of snack foods for babies under one year old and restricts marketing claims that are not backed by scientific evidence. This move follows a BBC investigation that found many popular baby food pouches were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients. Companies have been given 18 months to comply with the new recommendations, with the government suggesting alternative measures may be considered if the industry fails to make changes.</p>

In his wide-ranging remarks, Trump also promised to upgrade the city's parks with new grass and sprinkler systems, comparing the future quality to his own golf courses. The visit was intended to highlight the administration's law enforcement surge, which has involved deploying National Guard troops and federal agents across the capital.</p>

          <p>Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart U.S., expressed bewilderment at the company's stock declining 4.5% despite what he described as an exceptionally strong quarterly performance. The retailer raised its full-year sales and earnings forecast, demonstrating robust top-line growth and expanding margins even while absorbing the impact of tariffs. Simon believes investors may have overreacted to a one-time expense that caused a rare earnings miss, rather than focusing on the company's fundamental strengths. He argued that Walmart's ability to attract and retain shoppers with low prices makes its current business position formidable. (not investment advice)</p>
