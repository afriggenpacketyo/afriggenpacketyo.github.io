          <p>Voters in Ivory Coast are heading to the polls with 83-year-old President Alassane Ouattara seeking a controversial fourth term. The election follows a tense period where key opposition figures, including former Credit Suisse executive Tidjane Thiam and ex-president Laurent Gbagbo, were barred from running, leading to protests and arrests. With Ouattara campaigning on a record of economic growth and stability, concerns remain about potential unrest, echoing the violent election fallouts of 2010 and 2020. The government has deployed over 40,000 security personnel to maintain order as citizens cast their ballots.</p>

          <p>Georgia's State Security Service has arrested three Chinese citizens in the capital, Tbilisi, for attempting to illegally purchase two kilograms of uranium for $400,000. The authorities stated that the suspects intended to transport the nuclear material to China via Russia. The operation was reportedly coordinated by other group members from China, with one individual already in Georgia recruiting experts to locate uranium within the country. The security service released video footage of the detention but did not disclose the identities of the suspects or the exact date of the arrests.</p>

          <p>A recent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has sparked controversy by suggesting that far-left terrorist plots outnumbered far-right ones in the first half of 2025. This finding contrasts with long-standing data from federal authorities identifying the far right as the more persistent threat. However, critics and even the report's co-author caution against drawing firm conclusions from the small number of incidents analyzed. The debate highlights the complexities and subjective nature of collecting and categorizing data on domestic terrorism, with experts disagreeing on methodologies and interpretations.</p>

          <p>Senior administration officials indicate that President Donald Trump is likely to name the new, privately funded $300 million White House ballroom after himself, with staff already referring to it as "The President Donald J. Trump Ballroom." The 90,000-square-foot addition, which required the demolition of the entire East Wing, has reportedly raised $350 million in donations, $50 million more than its current construction cost. When asked, the president has remained noncommittal about the name publicly but is known for branding his construction projects with his own name.</p>

          <p>China's overwhelming dominance in the rare earth mineral supply chain, controlling nearly 70% of mining and 90% of processing, poses a significant strategic vulnerability for the West. These elements are crucial for high-tech goods, from smartphones to defense systems, and recent export controls from Beijing have heightened concerns about supply disruptions. Despite efforts by the U.S. and EU to diversify, they face immense challenges, including the high environmental costs, technical complexity, and massive investment required to build new processing facilities. Experts believe China's stranglehold on the market is unlikely to be broken in the near future.</p>

          <p>A recent Charles Schwab survey found that 45% of investors are interested in alternative investments such as private equity and real estate, reflecting a growing desire to supplement traditional stock and bond portfolios. Financial advisors suggest that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can offer a more accessible and liquid way for everyday investors to gain exposure to these typically complex assets. While younger investors in particular are showing disillusionment with conventional holdings, experts still recommend limiting alternatives to a small portion of a portfolio, emphasizing that a long-term strategy with traditional assets remains a reliable path to wealth.

          <p>Authorities have released new surveillance photos in the search for missing 9-year-old Melodee Buzzard of Santa Barbara County, who may have been on a road trip with her mother as far as Nebraska before she vanished.

Investigators are focusing on a critical three-day period in early October when her mother, Ashlee Buzzard, was seen returning to her residence in the rental car without her daughter.

          <p>A new report from the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC) suggests that Russian mercenaries, formerly part of the Wagner Group, have been systematically using military equipment intended for Mali's armed forces.

          <p>President Trump reversed his decision to deploy federal agents to San Francisco following a direct phone call with Mayor Daniel Lurie. The sudden reversal was reportedly influenced by lobbying from prominent tech billionaires, including Jensen Huang of Nvidia and Marc Benioff of Salesforce. While the de-escalation was welcomed, the incident has raised concerns about the president's capricious decision-making process, where a major domestic deployment appears to be based on personal appeals from wealthy friends rather than established policy. The president stated he would give the city a "shot" to handle its issues before reconsidering.</p>

          <p>California will allow the year-round hunting of non-native mute swans starting January 1, after Governor Gavin Newsom signed a new bill into law. Wildlife officials argue the measure is necessary to protect the state's fragile wetlands, as the large, aggressive birds consume vast amounts of vegetation and displace native waterfowl. The bill, sponsored by the California Waterfowl Association, classifies mute swans as an invasive species alongside starlings and English sparrows. However, the move has been condemned as inhumane by animal advocacy groups who see it as a ploy to expand hunting opportunities.</p>

Officials stated the wolves had become dangerously reliant on cattle, a behavior being passed to their young, which undermines long-term conservation efforts.

          <p>Low-income residents in the rural South, particularly in Louisiana and Mississippi, are bracing for the severe impact of nearly $1 trillion in federal Medicaid cuts over the next decade. Louisiana, which expanded Medicaid in 2016 and saw its uninsured rate drop, could lose up to $34 billion in federal funding, potentially reversing significant healthcare gains. The new law imposes stricter work reporting requirements and more frequent eligibility checks, which advocates fear will cause many, including those already working, to lose coverage due to bureaucratic hurdles.

          <h2>Chinese Exporters Shift Focus from U.S. to Developing Markets, Report Finds</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a Goldman Sachs report, major Chinese companies are strategically shifting their export focus away from the United States and toward less-developed markets, particularly in Southeast Asia. Since 2018, Chinese exports to non-U.S. markets have grown at a compound annual rate of 7.5%, while exports to the U.S. have slightly declined. This trend allows Chinese firms to leverage their low-cost advantages while simultaneously moving up the value-added chain with higher-end products. The diversification helps build new supply chains and boosts profit margins in response to ongoing trade tensions with Washington.</p>

          <p>This commentary argues that Prince Andrew should be formally deprived of his "prince" title by the British Parliament due to the ongoing fallout from his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The author contends that simply agreeing not to use his titles is insufficient punishment, citing leaked emails that show Andrew leveraging his royal status in communications with Epstein. The piece frames Andrew as a long-term liability to the monarchy whose actions, along with those of his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, represent an abuse of privilege that warrants formal, legislative consequences.</p>

          <p>The candidacy of Maine Democrat Graham Platner has been plagued by revelations of past controversial behavior, including calling himself a Communist and sporting a tattoo associated with the Nazi SS. Despite this, many progressives continue to support him, viewing his working-class, oyster-farmer persona as an ideal way to connect with voters without compromising on left-wing social policies. This article analyzes the progressive theory that recruiting authentic, blue-collar-coded candidates can overcome voter reluctance on social issues by focusing on an economic populist message, a strategy for which Platner has become a prominent test case.</p>

          <p>A new, large-scale artificial surf park is set to be developed in the coastal city of El Segundo, California, an unconventional location compared to existing inland wave pools. The $175 million project, led by an owner of the Palm Springs Surf Club, will feature a 2.2-acre lagoon on a former aerospace campus. This development is part of a growing trend to make surfing more accessible in controlled environments, appealing to both beginners and experienced surfers. The park will join a burgeoning sports and entertainment hub in the area that already includes a Topgolf complex.</p>

The author argues that for over two centuries, the U.S. has used military intervention in Latin America as a tool to rally domestic support and distract from internal problems. These actions, framed as part of a war on drugs, are criticized as a violation of international law that destabilizes the region while treating its people as perpetual scapegoats for American issues.</p>

          <p>October marks the peak of tarantula mating season in California, a time when male spiders embark on a perilous journey from their burrows in search of a mate. This annual migration, often triggered by the first autumn rains, provides the best opportunity for hikers and nature enthusiasts to spot the large, hairy arachnids. The quest is fraught with danger for the males, as female tarantulas are known to be aggressive and may eat their suitors before or after mating. Despite their intimidating appearance and venomous fangs, local experts say the spiders are not a threat to humans.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles officials have approved a conceptual plan for a $2.3 million fence around MacArthur Park to combat ongoing issues with crime, open-air drug markets, and homelessness. Proponents, including local councilmember Eunisses Hernandez, argue the fence is a necessary step to improve safety and allow families in the low-income, immigrant community to enjoy the green space. However, the proposal has drawn strong opposition from homeless advocates and outreach groups. They contend that a fence will only displace vulnerable individuals, make it harder to provide essential services, and fail to address the root causes of the park's problems.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced an immediate termination of all trade negotiations with Canada, a move he attributed to a recent television advertisement from the province of Ontario that he deemed egregious. The ad featured excerpts from a 1987 Ronald Reagan speech cautioning against protectionism. This halt in talks could leave steep U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum in place indefinitely, potentially raising prices for American consumers on goods like cars, auto parts, and home appliances. The decision introduces new uncertainty into the trade relationship ahead of a scheduled review of the USMCA next year.</p>

The game is also set to be the first El Clásico to feature two English players on opposing sides, with Barcelona's in-form forward Marcus Rashford expected to play.
