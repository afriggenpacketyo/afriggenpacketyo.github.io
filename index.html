          <p>A BBC analysis suggests that the upcoming meeting in Washington between Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, his European allies, and President Trump could be more pivotal for Ukraine's future than the recent U.S.-Russia summit. European leaders are determined to present a united front to Trump, emphasizing that any peace deal must directly involve Ukraine and include robust security guarantees. The goal is to prevent the U.S. President from making concessions to Vladimir Putin based on their personal rapport. The article highlights the complex diplomatic challenge of balancing territorial integrity with the possibility of securing a lasting peace through new defense arrangements.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accompanied by several key European and NATO leaders, is set to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington. This high-stakes meeting follows a recent summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, where the U.S. shifted its stance away from demanding an immediate ceasefire. European officials are reportedly concerned about the potential for Trump to pressure Zelenskyy into a peace deal without their input, prompting this joint visit to present a united front. The discussions will focus on establishing a permanent peace agreement and potential security guarantees for Ukraine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed in principle to allow the U.S. and European nations to offer Ukraine security protections similar to NATO's Article 5. This potential concession, made during a summit with President Trump, could be a significant breakthrough in negotiations to end the war, as it addresses Ukraine's security needs without formal NATO membership. The proposed arrangement would create a "Coalition of the willing" to defend Ukraine against future aggression. However, details remain unclear, and Ukrainian officials are seeking clarification on how such guarantees would function in practice.</p>

          <p>Protesters across Israel engaged in a nationwide strike, blocking roads and closing businesses to demand a ceasefire deal with Hamas and the release of remaining hostages in Gaza. Organized by families of hostages, the demonstrations reflect growing public frustration with the government's handling of the 22-month-long conflict. Participants fear that a planned military offensive in Gaza City could further endanger the approximately 50 hostages still held, only a fraction of whom are believed to be alive. The protests were met with a strong police response, including water cannons and dozens of arrests.</p>

          <h2>Hurricane Erin Weakens Slightly but Expected to Regain Strength in the Atlantic</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 19:59:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm after briefly reaching Category 5 intensity. Despite the weakening, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expect it to strengthen again and remain a dangerous major hurricane through the middle of the week. The storm is currently churning north of the Caribbean, and while not expected to make direct landfall on the U.S. East Coast, it is causing dangerous surf and rip currents along the Southeast. Tropical storm warnings have been issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands and parts of the Bahamas.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler clinched the BMW Championship title after Scotland's Robert MacIntyre, who held a four-shot overnight lead, struggled in the final round. MacIntyre's hopes for a third PGA Tour victory faded after a difficult start, ultimately finishing with a three-over-par 73. Scheffler demonstrated his top form, securing the win with a remarkable chip-in on the 17th hole to finish two strokes clear. A visibly frustrated MacIntyre expressed disappointment with his performance, citing unexpected issues with his ball distance throughout the challenging final day of the tournament.</p>

          <p>Iraqi authorities have started excavating a large sinkhole south of Mosul, believed to be one of the largest mass graves left by the Islamic State group. The site, known as al-Khasfa, is estimated to contain the remains of thousands of victims, primarily Iraqi army and police personnel, executed by the extremist group a decade ago. The initial phase of the operation involves collecting surface remains and gathering DNA samples from families of the missing to build a database for identification.

          <p>A court-ordered ban on feeding pigeons in public spaces in Mumbai has sparked significant controversy, pitting public health advocates against animal lovers and those with religious ties to the practice. Authorities imposed the ban due to health risks associated with pigeon droppings, which can cause respiratory illnesses. However, the move has led to protests, particularly from the Jain community, which considers feeding birds a pious act, and from those who see the city's pigeon feeding spots as cultural heritage sites. The debate highlights the challenge of balancing urban hygiene with long-standing cultural traditions and ecological concerns about pigeon overpopulation.</p>

          <p>Two of China's largest drug manufacturers, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals and Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group, are projected to report substantial profit increases for the first half of the year. This growth is attributed to the successful rollout of new innovative drugs and increased revenue from technology licensing deals. Analysts predict Hengrui's net profit could rise by as much as 40 percent, reflecting a strategic shift away from generic drugs towards more profitable novel treatments. This transition is expected to continue, with generics projected to constitute a much smaller portion of the company's revenue in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

His opponents, current co-leader Adrian Ramsay and new MP Ellie Chowns, favor continuing the current strategy of building broad appeal, which led to a record four parliamentary seats in the last election.

          <p>President Trump's recent diplomatic moves following his summit with Vladimir Putin have reportedly left Ukrainian officials feeling betrayed and have threatened the unity of the Western alliance against Russia. By abandoning the call for an immediate ceasefire and appearing open to Ukraine ceding territory, Trump has diverged from the position of his European allies. This shift creates a perilous situation for Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, who faces the challenge of steering Trump back to a unified stance without causing a rift.

          <p>The U.S. birth rate has fallen to a historic low, mirroring demographic trends seen in countries like Japan and raising concerns about future societal challenges. Data from the CDC shows the total fertility rate is now 1.6 children per woman, well below the 2.1 needed for natural population replacement. Experts attribute the decline to factors such as increased contraceptive use among teenagers and a broader societal shift where younger women delay or forgo having children. This trend could lead to a "demographic cliff," creating future strains on the economy, universities, and social support systems like Social Security.</p>

          <p>The D.C. National Guard has stated that its members deployed on the streets of Washington, D.C. as part of a federal crime crackdown "may be armed consistent with their mission and training." This appears to be a shift from an earlier Army statement that Guard members would not carry weapons or make arrests, but would serve as a "visible crime deterrent." The move is part of President Trump's plan to increase law enforcement presence in the capital, which has drawn significant criticism from local officials and residents who view it as a federal overreach. The Posse Comitatus Act generally restricts military involvement in civilian law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Despite stagnating balances in traditional checking and savings accounts, Americans' total cash reserves are growing, according to a JPMorgan Chase analysis. The study reveals a significant shift of funds into higher-yield options like money market funds, brokerage accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs). This trend, particularly pronounced among lower-income households, helps explain continued strong consumer spending amid persistent inflation. The article details the various types of accounts attracting savers and advises considering factors like financial goals, risk tolerance, and liquidity needs before moving funds.

          <p>A Texas judge has issued an expanded restraining order preventing Beto O’Rourke’s political organization, Powered by People, from transferring funds raised for Democratic state lawmakers out of Texas. The order is part of a lawsuit filed by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton against the group for supporting legislators who left the state to block a GOP-led redistricting session. The judge found that the state would be "irreparably injured" by the fundraising, which she deemed potentially deceptive. O'Rourke's group has raised over $1 million for the lawmakers who have been in Chicago to deny Republicans a legislative quorum.</p>

          <p>Manchester United suffered a 1-0 defeat to Arsenal in their season opener, with a critical error from goalkeeper Altay Bayindir leading to the decisive goal.

Despite a more threatening attacking performance from United compared to last season, they were unable to find an equalizer.

The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) stated its members would not return to work, calling the order unconstitutional and demanding the airline return to the negotiating table for a fair deal. The strike, which began Saturday, has grounded hundreds of daily flights and stranded over 100,000 passengers.

The 37-year-old veteran has yet to participate in a team practice during training camp, raising serious questions about his availability for the season opener. Coach Sean McVay and the team have provided few details on Stafford's condition or a timeline for his return. In his absence, backups Jimmy Garoppolo and Stetson Bennett have been taking first-team snaps, but the team's Super Bowl aspirations are widely seen as dependent on a healthy Stafford.</p>

Their departure denied the state legislature the quorum needed to pass a controversial plan that could add five new Republican-leaning congressional seats. The Democrats' return follows the conclusion of the initial special legislative session and the start of a new one. Their strategic exit drew national attention and prompted a counter-move from California's governor, who announced a plan to redraw his state's maps to favor Democrats in response to the Texas GOP's actions.</p>
