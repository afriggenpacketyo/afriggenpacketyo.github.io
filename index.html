            <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that Japan will not include security discussions in its trade talks with the United States, despite President Trump's call to reduce the U.S.'s defense burden. Ishiba emphasized that security issues should be addressed separately from tariffs. Additionally, train services in central Tokyo resumed after a suspension affecting 550,000 people due to track-switching work for improved Haneda airport access. A giant Evangelion statue appeared in Hamamatsu city hall as part of a tourism campaign, and baseball star Shohei Ohtani announced the birth of his daughter.</p>

            <p>China's ambassador to the United States, Xie Feng, cautioned the U.S. against repeating the protectionist policies of the Great Depression era amid escalating trade tensions. He specifically referenced the Smoot-Hawley Act, which is believed to have worsened the depression. Xie emphasized the importance of addressing the root causes of economic issues and fostering global economic growth through collaboration rather than protectionist measures. He drew on ancient Chinese philosophy to illustrate the need for comprehensive solutions.</p>

            <p>A new report indicates that over 1 million abortions were performed in the U.S. in 2024, with approximately 155,000 people crossing state lines to obtain the procedure, double the number from 2020. The Guttmacher Institute highlights a geographical divide, with states like Illinois, North Carolina, Kansas, and New Mexico becoming major hubs for abortion access. This comes as the Trump administration effectively dismantled the CDC team responsible for abortion surveillance reports, raising concerns about tracking public health outcomes related to abortion access. The report also does not track self-managed abortions, which appear to be on the rise post-Roe.</p>

            <p>President Trump's economic approval rating has hit its lowest point amid concerns about tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a CNBC survey. The survey indicates a decline in economic optimism, with more Americans believing the economy will worsen. While Trump's Republican base remains supportive, disapproval has increased among Democrats, independents, and blue-collar workers. The public largely disapproves of tariffs and sees them as detrimental to the economy. The survey also reveals growing concerns about a potential recession. (not investment advice)</p>

The move has been met with skepticism, with Ukraine alleging continued Russian attacks. Russia, in turn, accuses Ukraine of violating the ceasefire.

            <p>The article suggests that anti-Trump protesters in the U.S. can draw inspiration from the Czech Republic's successful movement against its former prime minister, Andrej Babiš, who was likened to Trump. The Czech Republic offers a possible blueprint for how street protest can bloom into a unified electoral strategy that eventually unseats a leader with autocratic aspirations. The author argues that mass rallies can weaken a government, shape public opinion, and embolden opposition politicians, ultimately contributing to an electoral outcome.</p>

            <p>China's domestically developed C909 passenger jet is expanding its regional presence, with VietJet beginning commercial operations with two of the aircraft. This makes Vietnam the third Southeast Asian country to adopt the C909, following Indonesia and Laos. The jets, leased from Chengdu Airlines, will operate on domestic routes within Vietnam. This move comes after Vietnam reformed its regulations to allow airlines to import aircraft certified by Brazil, Canada, Russia, Britain, and China.</p>

            <p>This article examines how Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has dismantled democratic institutions and consolidated power over his four consecutive terms. It details his strategies for controlling the media, civil society, and universities, drawing parallels to tactics used by Vladimir Putin. The article suggests that Orbán's actions serve as a cautionary tale for other nations, including the United States.

            <p>China is taking a more active role in addressing the conflict between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, particularly due to its significant mining interests in the region. Beijing, through its UN ambassador, has directly called on Kigali to cease its support for the M23 rebel group and withdraw Rwandan troops from the DRC. China also supported a UN Security Council resolution condemning Rwanda's role in the conflict, signaling a departure from its usual non-interference policy. This shift is driven by Beijing's need to protect its mining interests and maintain relationships with both countries.</p>

            <p>DHL Express is temporarily suspending deliveries to American consumers of packages worth more than $800 due to increased customs red tape following the implementation of Trump's new tariff regime. This change has led to a surge in formal customs clearances and multi-day delays for shipments. Previously, packages worth up to $2,500 could enter the US with minimal paperwork. The White House is also set to clamp down on low-value packages from China and Hong Kong, impacting fast-fashion firms like Shein and Temu.</p>
