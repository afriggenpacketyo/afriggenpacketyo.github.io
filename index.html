          <p>House GOP leaders have introduced a plan to fund the federal government until November 21, aiming to prevent a shutdown before the September 30 deadline. The short-term continuing resolution maintains current funding levels and includes an additional $88 million for the security of lawmakers and other government officials, a measure added following Charlie Kirk's assassination. Speaker Mike Johnson is pushing for a vote this week, but the bill faces opposition from some conservative members and requires Democratic support to pass the Senate, where a 60-vote threshold is necessary.</p>

          <p>The UK Foreign Office has admitted that Peter Mandelson was not subjected to in-depth security vetting before being publicly named as the ambassador to Washington. This disclosure has intensified criticism over his appointment, which ended abruptly after emails revealed his supportive relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. According to officials, the Cabinet Office conducted a due diligence process but did not involve the Foreign Office, and full security clearance was only completed after the appointment was announced. The situation has raised serious questions about the rigor of the government's appointment process for top diplomatic posts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's second state visit to the United Kingdom is occurring under awkward circumstances for his host, Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The recent firing of UK Ambassador Peter Mandelson, due to newly revealed details about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, has cast a shadow over the event. The dismissal brings renewed focus to Epstein's network, a sensitive topic for Trump as well, who has denied allegations related to his own past association with the financier. This diplomatic scandal adds a layer of tension to a visit intended to celebrate the strong UK-US relationship.</p>

          <p>A detailed analysis examining the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) has determined that renewable sources are the most affordable for energy production. According to investment bank Lazard, onshore wind and utility-scale solar are more cost-competitive than coal, natural gas, or nuclear power, even before accounting for government subsidies like those in the Inflation Reduction Act. Experts note that while renewables have high upfront capital costs, their operational expenses are significantly lower. The report also considers the impact of President Trump's tariffs, which are projected to increase costs for projects reliant on imported components, particularly battery storage.

          <p>A proposed deal to remove the 25% tariff on UK steel exports to the United States has been put on hold indefinitely, dashing industry hopes for a swift resolution. While government sources insist the UK remains in a competitive position compared to other nations facing 50% tariffs, the news is a setback. The delay is partly attributed to US questions regarding Tata Steel's production methods, as the company has temporarily shut down its blast furnaces. This development adds to the financial distress of the UK steel industry, which has seen several plants fall into government control recently.</p>

          <p>A key regulation for reverse mortgages, known as the 6-month rule, dictates the timeline for heirs after a borrower passes away or permanently leaves the home. Lenders must issue a "Due and Payable" letter, giving the family six months to either repay the loan balance in full or sell the property to cover the debt. This rule primarily applies to federally insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs). While up to two three-month extensions can be requested from HUD, the deadline underscores the need for borrowers to engage in thorough estate planning with their families.</p>

          <p>Robert Redford, an iconic actor, Oscar-winning director, and champion of independent film, has passed away at the age of 89 at his home in Utah. Redford became a Hollywood superstar with classic films like "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" and "The Sting." He later transitioned to directing, winning an Academy Award for "Ordinary People." His most enduring legacy may be the Sundance Institute and its film festival, which he founded to nurture emerging filmmakers and has since become a vital launchpad for independent cinema, fundamentally shaping the industry for generations.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have commenced an intensified ground operation in Gaza City, which an IDF spokesperson estimated could take several months to complete. The offensive follows the evacuation of approximately 300,000 people from the city to southern Gaza. The Palestinian Authority has condemned the operation, calling it an attempt to turn the city into a "mass grave" and has urged for international intervention to protect civilians. President Trump commented on the situation, warning that Hamas would be in "big trouble" if it used hostages as human shields during the conflict.</p>

          <p>An Eritrean man who arrived in the UK via a small boat has launched the first legal challenge against the new "one in, one out" migrant return deal with France. His lawyers argue at the High Court that he faces a "real risk of destitution" if deported, and that the Home Office has not properly assessed if he is a victim of trafficking. The pilot scheme allows the UK to return certain migrants to France in exchange for accepting vetted refugees who have not attempted to cross the Channel. The case represents a significant test for the new policy.</p>

          <p>New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell, who is facing federal indictment, has requested court permission to travel to Iceland for a family vacation in October. Cantrell pleaded not guilty to charges including conspiracy, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice on September 10. As a condition of her release, she surrendered her passport and her travel was restricted to the Federal Eastern District of Louisiana. The motion represents an unusual request for an official under active federal indictment who is required to adhere to strict pre-trial release conditions.</p>

          <p>Two years after the lengthy 2023 actors' strike, SAG-AFTRA has formally established a new fund to distribute bonus payments from successful streaming shows. Dubbed the "Robin Hood" fund, it will collect 25% of the bonuses generated when a large-budget streaming project meets a specific viewership threshold. This money will then be distributed to a wider pool of performers, including stunt and background actors who work a minimum number of days. The fund was a key negotiation point designed to create a new secondary income stream for actors in the streaming era.</p>

Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo increased his price target for Goldman Sachs, pointing to strong performance in capital markets and M&A activity. Additionally, Morgan Stanley noted that Microsoft's recent 10% dividend increase, combined with its earnings growth, points to a strong total return profile for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time since it sank in 1916, divers have recovered artifacts from the wreck of the Britannic, the sister ship of the Titanic. An 11-member deep-sea diving team retrieved items including the ship's bell, a navigation light, and silver-plated trays from the vessel, which lies nearly 400 feet deep in the Aegean Sea. Originally a luxury liner, the Britannic was serving as a hospital ship in World War I when it struck a mine. The recovered artifacts will undergo conservation and become part of a new Museum of Underwater Antiquities in Greece.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, numerous individuals across various professions have been fired or disciplined for their public comments about his death. A sports reporter, a university employee, and an MSNBC analyst are among those who have faced professional repercussions for remarks that were deemed insensitive or inappropriate by their employers. Legal experts note that private companies generally have the right to terminate employees for public statements that could harm the company's reputation. The incidents highlight the intense debate over political violence and free speech in the current climate.</p>

          <p>A public inquiry into the deadly 2024 Southport dance studio attack has heard evidence of systemic failures by multiple agencies to address the killer's escalating violent behavior. The perpetrator, Axel Rudakubana, had a history of assaults and carrying knives, yet referrals to counter-extremism programs and social services were repeatedly closed. A teacher's email from 2023, read at the inquiry, expressed frustration over the "frightening red tape" preventing police or mental health intervention. The inquiry will focus on why no single agency took responsibility for managing the clear risk he posed before he murdered three young girls.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that President Donald Trump's credible threat to allow TikTok to be banned in the U.S. was the crucial factor that prompted China to move forward with a deal. According to Bessent, the commercial terms of a deal had been largely in place for months, but progress stalled until the administration made it clear it prioritized national security over ensuring the app's continued operation. This hardline negotiating tactic is credited with breaking the deadlock and leading to the current framework agreement to secure TikTok's future under new ownership in the United States.</p>
