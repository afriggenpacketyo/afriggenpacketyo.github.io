          <p>President Donald Trump has pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who previously pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering and violating the Bank Secrecy Act. The White House defended the decision, framing it as a reversal of the Biden administration's "war on cryptocurrency" and noting the judge's unusually short sentence for Zhao. However, Senator Elizabeth Warren condemned the pardon as an act of "corruption," pointing to Zhao's alleged involvement with Trump's crypto ventures and subsequent lobbying for clemency. Zhao, known as CZ, expressed deep gratitude and committed to advancing the web3 industry in the U.S. This article details the controversial pardon and its immediate political and industry reactions.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has endorsed former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the mayoral race, just days before early voting begins. The endorsement marks a significant mending of fences between the two, despite previous harsh exchanges. Adams strongly criticized Democratic nominee Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, particularly his rent freeze proposal, calling him a "snake oil salesman" and an "existential threat" to the city. Cuomo echoed Adams' sentiments, emphasizing Mamdani's socialist leanings and questioning his experience. This article details the unexpected alliance and its potential impact on the election.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland has informed the Department of Justice that she believes there is insufficient evidence to indict Senator Adam Schiff of California on mortgage fraud charges, as reported by MSNBC. President Donald Trump had publicly called for Schiff's criminal prosecution, given Schiff's role as a staunch critic and prosecutor in Trump's first impeachment trial. Despite the Maryland U.S. Attorney's assessment, a controversial senior DOJ official is reportedly pushing to keep the investigation active. This article highlights the ongoing political pressure surrounding the case and internal DOJ disagreements.</p>
