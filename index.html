          <p>New injectable weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy are becoming increasingly popular, but their high cost and limited NHS availability in the UK are creating a two-tier system. While celebrities and the wealthy can afford private prescriptions, many eligible NHS patients face a "postcode lottery" with restrictive criteria, potentially worsening existing health inequalities. The article explores how these revolutionary treatments, intended to combat the obesity epidemic, may inadvertently be turning obesity into an issue of wealth, where access to better health becomes a luxury. This situation highlights broader societal challenges regarding healthcare access and regulation of the food industry.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is set to announce new proposals requiring migrants to demonstrate societal contribution to earn indefinite leave to remain. Under the plan, legal migrants would need to learn English to a high standard, maintain a clean criminal record, and volunteer in their community to qualify for permanent settlement. This policy aims to differentiate Labour from Reform UK, which has proposed abolishing the status altogether. The announcement is part of Labour's strategy to address immigration concerns while promoting a vision of "fair migration" and integration, framing it as essential for an open and tolerant society.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD is introducing significant discounts in Japan in an effort to boost its sluggish sales in a market dominated by domestic brands. Despite expanding its sales locations, the company has struggled to gain traction, selling only 5,300 vehicles over an 18-month period. BYD is now offering discounts up to $6,700, which, combined with government subsidies, could cut sticker prices by half. This strategy is a significant departure from the Japanese auto market's norms, where price cuts are rare, and risks alienating early adopters and harming resale values.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government is working to reassure the business community after its post-election budget appeared to contradict its pre-election pro-business stance. Business leaders who initially supported Labour have expressed concern over measures like a £25 billion rise in employers' National Insurance, which they feel has damaged trust. While the government highlights major inward investment from tech giants, smaller businesses report feeling forgotten amid rising costs and new employment regulations.

          <p>China has announced that a key Communist Party meeting, the fourth plenary session, will be held in October to discuss and endorse the nation's 15th five-year plan. President Xi Jinping and over 370 Central Committee members will attend the session to review the draft proposal for the 2026-2030 plan. A preceding Politburo meeting emphasized principles such as upholding the party's unified leadership and developing "new quality productive forces," which focuses on high-tech innovation. The plan will be formally submitted for final endorsement at the annual legislative session in March, setting the course for China's economic and social development.</p>

          <p>China is launching a new "K visa" program this week aimed at attracting young foreign graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The initiative is designed to bolster the country's tech sector amid its geopolitical rivalry with the United States. A key feature of the K visa is that it does not require a sponsoring employer, removing a significant hurdle present in U.S. visa programs like the H-1B. This move is part of a broader Chinese effort to appear more welcoming to foreign investment and talent, though potential hurdles like language barriers and vague eligibility requirements remain.</p>

          <p>Following England's Women's Rugby World Cup victory, efforts are underway to translate the triumph into a lasting legacy for the sport. The Rugby Football Union has implemented plans including player appearances at local clubs and expanded media coverage for the domestic league to capitalize on the momentum. However, history shows that major sporting wins don't always lead to increased grassroots participation, as seen after the London 2012 Olympics. The RFU aims to avoid past mistakes through its 'Impact 25' program, which invests in facilities and training to support a growing number of female players and officials.</p>

          <p>The foreign ministers of China and North Korea met in Beijing and agreed to strengthen their bilateral relationship to jointly resist "all forms of hegemonism," a statement widely interpreted as a stand against the United States.

The meeting follows a high-profile military parade in Beijing attended by leaders from China, North Korea, and Russia, signaling a closer alignment between the three nations. Experts suggest North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is reinforcing ties with China as he prepares for a post-war landscape in Ukraine.</p>

The victory gives PAS a new majority in parliament, allowing it to form a government without coalition partners and continue its westward-looking policy agenda, despite opposition from pro-Russian factions.</p>

          <p>A review of Kamala Harris's new memoir, "107 Days," portrays her presidential campaign as one that prioritized spectacle and celebrity endorsements over substantive policy and coalition-building. The book reveals a candidate who, according to the reviewer, lacks self-awareness and focuses more on the machinery of politics than on a distinct vision, failing to meaningfully differentiate herself from Joe Biden. The reviewer argues that the memoir shows how the Democratic establishment became captured by its own narrative, fatally unable to connect with voters outside its bubble. This highlights a perceived delusion that may hinder the party's ability to challenge Trumpism effectively.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs analysts suggest that China's central bank is likely to implement monetary easing measures in the fourth quarter due to slowing economic momentum and pressure to support growth. The forecast includes a potential 10-basis-point policy rate cut and a 50-basis-point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for banks. This prediction follows a recent central bank meeting where officials maintained a dovish stance, with a subtle shift in language indicating a more cautious economic outlook. However, the action remains data-dependent, contingent on whether the full-year growth stays on track for the "around 5 percent" target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has deployed a new mobile air defense system, the Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC), to one of its bases in South Korea for the first time. This move is viewed as a strategic response to potential threats from both North Korea and China. The IFPC system, which functions similarly to Israel's Iron Dome, is designed to intercept and defeat cruise missiles, drones, rockets, and mortars. The deployment signals an enhancement of U.S. and South Korean defensive capabilities in the region and follows reports of plans to send prototype missile defense systems to global hotspots for evaluation.</p>

          <h2>Decline of American Malls Creates Real Estate Opportunities for Small Businesses</h2>

          <p>The ongoing decline of traditional American shopping malls is creating new opportunities for small and local businesses to secure prime retail space at more affordable rates. As national chains close stores, rising vacancy rates are pressuring landlords to offer more flexible lease terms, such as shorter commitments and lower rents, to tenants they previously would have priced out. This trend is allowing a diverse range of businesses, including wellness practitioners, gourmet food shops, and fitness operators, to move into once-exclusive locations. While the opportunity varies by geography, it represents a significant shift in the commercial real estate landscape.</p>

          <p>China's stock market has experienced a significant rally this year, driven by optimism in sectors like artificial intelligence and semiconductors, as well as by a surge in participation from retail investors. The mainland's CSI 300 index has climbed approximately 16%, adding over $3 trillion in market capitalization across Chinese and Hong Kong equities. However, some experts are questioning the rally's sustainability, warning of a potential bubble as the market's performance appears disconnected from weakening macroeconomic fundamentals, such as slowing industrial output and retail sales. The momentum is currently supported by expectations of structural improvements and policy tailwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Sony Financial Group soared 36% in their trading debut on Monday after being spun off from parent company Sony Group. The move, which values the financial arm at over $6.7 billion, is intended to allow the unit—comprising insurance and banking services—to raise its own capital for growth independently. Sony stated that the separation was driven by competing investment demands in its entertainment and semiconductor divisions. The successful IPO provided a bright spot in Asian markets, with Japan's broader Nikkei 225 and Topix indices declining after reaching recent highs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block the deployment of 200 National Guard troops to Portland. The legal action came after the president authorized the troops to protect federal property, a move Oregon's Attorney General argues is an unlawful federalization of the Guard. State and local officials, including the governor and Portland's mayor, have strongly opposed the deployment, stating that local law enforcement is capable of managing public safety without federal interference. They contend the action is not about safety but is a political maneuver by the president under the guise of law and order.</p>
