          <p>A 400-page report by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) questions the current approach to health care for transgender children, which is endorsed by major medical associations in the U.S. The report, commissioned under an executive order titled "Protecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation," concludes that gender-affirming care has "fallen short of their duty to prioritize the health interests of young patients." White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller described gender-affirming medical interventions as "barbaric" and "child torture." The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is deeply alarmed by the report, stating that it misrepresents the current medical consensus and fails to reflect the realities of pediatric care.</p>

          <p>Apple anticipates a $900 million hit to its costs this quarter due to tariffs, despite exemptions on key electronics. The company is responding by shifting production of iPhones destined for the American market away from China, with the majority now being made in India. Apple CEO Tim Cook highlighted the company's investments in the U.S., but noted that India and Vietnam are poised to benefit most from the shift. While sales remain strong, the company is closely monitoring the situation, as are investors, with concerns about decreasing iPhone sales in China.</p>

          <p>Defense attorneys for Luigi Mangione, accused of murder, are seeking to dismiss the state indictment against him, arguing that the concurrent state and federal prosecutions violate the Double Jeopardy Clause and other constitutional rights. The defense claims that "prosecutorial one-upmanship" has resulted in Mangione facing charges in multiple jurisdictions, including New York and Pennsylvania. The attorneys assert that these overlapping charges infringe upon Mangione's rights against self-incrimination and his ability to mount a fair defense. The case is ongoing, and further updates are expected as the legal proceedings continue.</p>

The company's stock dropped in after-hours trading due to the tariff news and lower-than-expected revenue from its services division. Cook noted that China will continue to be a major manufacturer, but India will produce more iPhones and Vietnam more iPads and Macs for the June quarter.</p>

They urge a strategic opposition to Trump, building a coalition of Americans across the political spectrum who believe in democratic debate and constitutional processes.

          <p>Two children and one adult were struck by a car outside a preschool at a South Carolina church, in what authorities suspect may have been an intentional act. The suspect, Justin Collin Adams, was taken into custody after an hours-long manhunt. One child and one adult were hospitalized, while the third victim was treated at the scene and released. The suspect ditched his car after the incident and was believed to be armed with a knife, leading to a comprehensive search involving multiple law enforcement agencies.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported mixed results, with slower growth in its North American retail business and overall sales growth at its slowest pace since the pandemic's onset. The company attributed some of the uncertainty to President Trump's tariffs, projecting sales of $159 billion to $164 billion for the current quarter. CEO Andy Jassy stated that the company is "pretty maniacally focused" on keeping prices down and will help sellers on Amazon's marketplace do the same.

          <p>Leaders overseeing California's high-speed rail project are expressing concerns about its financial viability, particularly regarding potential loss of federal funding from the Trump administration. Board members raised concerns over payment commitments and the risk of moving forward on contracts if federal money does not come through. The Department of Transportation initiated a compliance review of the project in February, focusing on a $4 billion promise made under the Biden administration. The project is already significantly over budget and behind schedule, with officials noting the need for private sector investment.</p>

The film is noted for its punk-rock snark and willingness to curse and murder more than expected in a PG-13 movie. Pugh's performance is highlighted as one of the better ones in a super suit.</p>
