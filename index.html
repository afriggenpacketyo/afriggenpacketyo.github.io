          <p>China has released a paper blaming the United States for the origin of COVID-19, accusing Washington of evading responsibility and ignoring questions about its conduct. The paper asserts that the virus was present in the U.S. earlier than officially determined. This follows the White House's revamp of its COVID.gov website to highlight the lab leak theory, which the article mentions was previously dismissed by media outlets. The Chinese paper references a joint study with the WHO that suggests the virus likely transmitted from bats to humans via another animal, further criticizing the U.S. response to the pandemic.</p>

          <p>A Maryland judge has denied the Trump administration's request for another extension to provide information on Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador. Judge Xinis has accused the administration of "bad faith refusal" to answer questions and ordered expedited discovery. Senator Van Hollen visited Abrego Garcia in El Salvador and spoke on the Senate floor, emphasizing the importance of due process. The Trump administration defends its actions, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stating Abrego Garcia is not under their control and President Trump alleging he is a member of MS-13, which his lawyers deny.</p>

          <p>China is reportedly holding off on serious trade talks with the US due to uncertainty over which of President Trump's advisors will have the most influence on trade policy. The Trump administration is described as "too divided," with conflicting views among top trade advisors regarding how to handle trade relations with China. This internal division makes Beijing reluctant to engage in negotiations, as it risks revealing their strategy before knowing their opponent's true position.

          <p>The White House is reportedly moving quickly to negotiate a trade deal with India, according to President Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro, who described the pace as "Trump time."

The article notes that U.S. gross domestic product fell in the first quarter of the year, fueled by policy uncertainty around Trump's trade wars.

          <p>President Donald Trump has acknowledged that Americans may have to do with less as a result of the trade war with China. While answering questions at the end of a Cabinet meeting, Trump stated that Americans might have to reduce their consumption of non-essential goods imported from China. He argued that the trade war's impact will be more severe for China, which relies on the U.S. as a market, and insisted that Americans don't need many of the goods imported from China. He also stated that the result of the trade war will be worse for the Chinese, who rely on the U.S. as a market to sell their goods.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's board members reportedly reached out to executive search firms to find a successor for CEO Elon Musk. The decision was allegedly driven by Musk's extensive involvement with the Trump administration. Musk has stated he would cut back on time spent with the administration, following criticism for his work at the Department of Government Efficiency and declining sales of Tesla's EV lineup. The board members met with Musk and asked him to acknowledge publicly that he would spend more time at Tesla, though it is unclear if Musk is aware of the succession planning.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court appeared divided over an effort in Oklahoma to create an online Catholic charter school, which could open the door to public dollars flowing directly to religious schools. A ruling in favor of St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School could upend laws in at least 45 states and the District of Columbia. Justices Alito and Kavanaugh appeared sympathetic to the school's argument, while liberal justices expressed concerns about weakening the separation between church and state. The outcome hinges on Chief Justice John Roberts, who focused on the level of state involvement in charter schools.</p>

          <p>A cybersecurity expert has cautioned against excessive reliance on artificial intelligence for decision-making, citing potential security risks such as hackers manipulating AI models. Qi Xiangdong, chairman of Qi An Xin, stated that large AI models pose security challenges and users may become overly dependent on AI-assisted decision-making. The warning comes amid growing enthusiasm for China’s DeepSeek chatbot, with authorities backing the widespread use of AI. Hackers can exploit vulnerabilities or engage in data 'poisoning' to manipulate the model’s decisions, committing malicious acts under the guise of a large model.</p>

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) indicated that certification for the narrowbody C919 will not be granted this year, with a timeline of three to six years. The C919 has been in regular use on domestic flight paths since its first commercial flight in May 2023, transporting over 1 million passengers as of January 2025. Despite the delay, analysts expect Comac to continue its efforts to enter major overseas markets.</p>

The judge also referred the case to federal prosecutors to investigate whether Apple committed criminal contempt of court.

          <p>The New York City Rent Guidelines Board voted in favor of higher rents for nearly one million rent-stabilized apartments, citing rising costs for landlords. The preliminary vote supports increases of 1.75 to 4.75 percent on one-year leases and 4.75 to 7.75 percent for two-year leases. Tenant advocates argue the increases will worsen the housing crisis, while landlords claim the increases are insufficient to cover rising expenses. The decision reflects a balance between protecting rent-stabilized homes and avoiding overburdening tenants, mirroring the approach taken in the past few years.</p>
