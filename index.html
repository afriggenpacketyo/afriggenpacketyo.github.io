          <p>Serious disorder broke out in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, for a second consecutive night, with fireworks, bottles, and petrol bombs thrown at police. The unrest began after a peaceful protest concerning an alleged sexual assault in the town, with two teenage boys charged in connection with the incident. Democratic Unionist Party assembly member Paul Frew expressed fears that someone could be killed and stated that the violence was overshadowing sympathies for victims of sexual violence, as well as raising tensions related to immigration. Riot officers used baton rounds and water cannons to disperse crowds, while some residents displayed signs indicating their nationality on their homes amidst the chaos. </p>

          <p>Asian economies are increasingly reducing their reliance on the U.S. dollar due to geopolitical uncertainties, monetary shifts, and currency hedging. ASEAN nations are promoting the use of local currencies for trade and investment to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations and strengthen regional payment connectivity. This trend reflects a broader global movement away from the dollar, with its share in global foreign exchange reserves declining over the past two decades. Investors and officials recognize the dollar's potential weaponization in trade negotiations, leading to a reevaluation of U.S. dollar-dominated portfolios. (not investment advice)</p>

The attack occurred at DreierschÃ¼tzengasse secondary school, leaving an additional 12 people injured, with most of the fatalities being pupils.

Kita described how the surgery derailed his life, keeping it a secret from his wife until her death. The eugenics law, in effect from 1948 to 1996, allowed authorities to sterilize people with intellectual disabilities, mental illnesses, or hereditary disorders without consent. Despite winning compensation, Kita emphasized that the tragedy of eugenics-motivated surgery cannot be undone and advocated for reducing the number of people who suffer similarly.</p>

          <h2>AI Upskilling Becomes Crucial as College Degrees Risk Obsolescence, Expert Says</h2>

          <p>According to PwC's 2025 Global AI Jobs Barometer report, employer demand for formal degrees is declining, particularly in jobs exposed to artificial intelligence. The report suggests that AI's ability to rapidly build expert knowledge may diminish the relevance of formal qualifications. Skills are changing 66% faster in AI-exposed occupations compared to those less exposed, emphasizing the need for continuous upskilling. PwC's Global Chief AI Officer Joe Atkinson recommends upskilling on AI to adapt to the evolving work landscape, noting that AI tools and large language models offer new avenues for learning outside traditional institutions.</p>

          <p>Two adaptations of Johann Sebastian Bach's St. John Passion explore themes of violence and displacement through queer and Arabian lenses. Thomas HÃ¶ft's "QueerPassion" references the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, highlighting stories of LGBTQ+ discrimination and violence. Vladimir Ivanoff's "Arabian Passion" addresses the suffering of people in the Middle East, incorporating Arabic instruments and language into Bach's original work. Both versions are touring as part of the Bachfest in Leipzig, exploring the theme of "Transformation" and reflecting Bach's own practice of rewriting and adapting his compositions.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' ex-girlfriend, identified as "Jane," testified in his federal trial for sex crimes, providing insights into the rapper's behavior outside his music career. Legal experts suggest that Jane's testimony, while compelling, may not directly aid the prosecution's case, as it highlights Diddy's controlling behavior but does not necessarily prove the charges he faces. Former prosecutor Neahma Rahmani noted that the case hinges on the distinction between coercion and consent, with Combs' lawyers suggesting Jane willingly participated in the alleged events. The trial is expected to conclude by July 4.</p>
