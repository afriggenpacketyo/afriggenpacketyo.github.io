          <p>Meta's Chief Product Officer, Chris Cox, has declared that smart glasses represent the future of computing, envisioning a shift toward more natural, interactive interfaces. His comments followed the reveal of the new $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which feature an in-lens display and a neural wristband for gesture control, allowing users to send messages and record videos. This launch comes as Meta faces growing competition from Google, Snap, and Apple, all of whom are developing their own smart glasses. The success of Meta's previous audio-only models suggests a potentially strong market for this emerging technology.</p>

          <p>A major internal conflict has emerged within 'Your Party,' the new UK left-wing political group, with co-founder Zarah Sultana accusing Jeremy Corbyn of overseeing a "sexist boys' club." Sultana claims she was sidelined from key decisions and that an unauthorized email offering party memberships was sent without her consent, a charge Corbyn's allies dispute. The public disagreement, which includes conflicting statements and concerns over financial control, has cast a shadow over the party's formation just as it was gaining momentum.

          <p>Hyundai Motor outlined its ambitious U.S. growth plans during an investor day in New York, even as it lowered its annual profit outlook due to tariffs. CEO José Muñoz emphasized the U.S. as the company's "engine of growth," reaffirming a $26 billion investment to expand American operations and produce over 80% of its U.S. vehicles locally by 2030. The event took place weeks after a major immigration raid at a jointly-owned Georgia battery plant, where hundreds of workers were arrested.

          <p>During a state visit to the United Kingdom, U.S. President Donald Trump advised Prime Minister Keir Starmer to "call out the military" to control the country's borders and stop illegal migration. The comment was one of the few points of tension during a carefully managed visit, where both leaders emphasized their strong partnership on defense and trade. Trump also described the UK's plan to recognize a Palestinian state as a disagreement but largely avoided other potential conflicts. The visit concluded with a new technology agreement and a promise of £150 billion in U.S. investment in the UK.</p>

          <p>Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film, "One Battle After Another," is being lauded as a politically charged and electrifying thriller that directly engages with contemporary American anxieties.

The review praises the film's urgent tone, thrilling action sequences, and powerful performances, particularly from DiCaprio and Sean Penn as the villainous government operative.

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel's career has traced a significant arc from an apolitical, 'regular guy' persona on "The Man Show" to becoming a prominent and emotional critic of the Trump administration. His political turn began in earnest in 2017 with heartfelt monologues about his son's health condition and the Las Vegas mass shooting, which resonated widely. This evolution mirrored a broader shift in American pop culture and positioned him as a nemesis to Donald Trump, who repeatedly pressured Disney executives to silence him. The recent FCC-pressured suspension of his show is the culmination of this long-standing conflict, making Kimmel a symbol of the current illiberal moment.</p>

          <p>Tensions in the Middle East have escalated following two separate deadly incidents. At the Allenby Bridge crossing into the West Bank, a Jordanian driver delivering humanitarian aid fatally attacked two Israeli soldiers before being shot and killed by security forces. In response, Israel has temporarily halted aid from Jordan pending an investigation. Concurrently, the Israeli military has launched a series of airstrikes against Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon, citing the militant group's attempts to rebuild its activities in the area, while also reporting the deaths of four soldiers in southern Gaza.</p>

The move is part of a broader Trump administration effort to reform the nation's organ transplant system and restore public trust, which has eroded following reports of organs nearly being procured from patients who were not deceased. Kennedy stated the action serves as a clear warning to other organizations, emphasizing a new standard where patient safety is paramount, in contrast to what he called inaction by the previous administration.</p>

          <p>Southern California is experiencing its first significant rainfall in months as moisture from a former tropical storm moves through the region, prompting flood watches in several areas. While the rain provides temporary relief from a long dry spell, officials say it is unlikely to be enough to end severe drought conditions or substantially mitigate the upcoming wildfire season. Fire authorities typically require two to four inches of precipitation to consider the fire threat diminished, a total this storm system is not expected to deliver. However, the moisture may temporarily slow the start of the dangerous Santa Ana wind season.</p>

          <p>New York will begin sending one-time "inflation refund" checks to over 8 million eligible taxpayers starting at the end of September. The payments, ranging from $150 to $400, are designed to provide relief from higher sales taxes resulting from inflation, which boosted state revenue. Eligibility is based on income thresholds and filing status from the 2023 tax year, with no application necessary. Experts note that such rebates are a way for states to return surplus revenue to taxpayers during periods of high inflation, though New York is currently one of the few states implementing such a program.</p>

          <p>The suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show under government pressure is a dangerous development that threatens the vital role of comedy in a free society, this opinion article argues. Historically, political satire has been a cornerstone of American culture, from Benjamin Franklin to "Saturday Night Live," allowing society to mock power and speak uncomfortable truths. Autocrats worldwide have always recognized the threat humor poses, from Nazi Germany to the Soviet Union, by censoring comedians who undermine their authority. The author contends that ABC's capitulation to the Trump administration is a chilling sign that independent institutions are weakening, imperiling a crucial form of public discourse.</p>

Huang emphasized that Nvidia will become a major customer for Intel's CPUs while supplying its GPU technology, creating a symbiotic relationship.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from deporting a group of unaccompanied Guatemalan children, stating the government's justification for the action "crumbled like a house of cards." The administration had attempted to expel over 70 minors over Labor Day weekend, claiming it was reuniting them with their families at the request of the Guatemalan government. However, Judge Timothy Kelly found no evidence that any parents had sought their children's return. The ruling affirms legal protections for unaccompanied minors, who cannot be subjected to expedited removal and have the right to pursue immigration cases in the U.S.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals with substantial credit card debt, such as a $75,000 balance, debt forgiveness through settlement can offer significant relief. This process involves negotiating with creditors to pay a lump sum that is less than the total amount owed, potentially reducing the debt by 30% to 50%. For a $75,000 debt, this could mean saving between $22,500 and $37,500. The article contrasts this with the high cost of making traditional payments at current interest rates, which could take over a decade and cost more than the original balance in interest.

The move came after FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, threatened regulatory action against the network over Kimmel's monologue about the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Critics, including former President Barack Obama, argue the Trump administration is abusing its power to silence dissenting voices and called on media companies to resist such pressure.
