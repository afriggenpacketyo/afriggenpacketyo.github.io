According to the article, whole families are being wiped out, leading to what one agency called the "largest orphan crisis in modern history."

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein who died by suicide in April, is publicly calling for a full investigation into Prince Andrew over her allegations of sexual abuse. Her brother, Sky Roberts, stated that the Prince has not faced sufficient consequences and that every person involved, regardless of status, should be held to the fullest extent of the law. The family emphasized that Prince Andrew being stripped of titles and publicly shamed is not enough, demanding genuine legal accountability for his alleged actions.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Democratic Senator Chris Coons and Republican Senator James Lankford made a joint appeal for bipartisanship and civility. Both senators identified the internet and social media algorithms as a key 'accelerant' driving extremism and political violence in the United States. They argued that online platforms push the angriest and most extreme voices to the forefront, and urged Congress to pass legislation like the Kids Online Safety Act to mitigate some of these harms.</p>

          <p>Initial projections from municipal elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, show a victory for the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU). However, the results also reveal a significant surge for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which more than tripled its vote share from 16.5% in 2020. The election is viewed as a major test for Chancellor Friedrich Merz's government, with the AfD's strong performance highlighting a growing rightward shift in the country's political climate.</p>

          <p>Romania's defense ministry has reported that a Russian drone violated its airspace, making it the second NATO country, after Poland, to confirm such an incursion. The drone was tracked near the Ukrainian border while Romanian fighter jets were monitoring Russian attacks on Ukraine's Danube infrastructure. The incident has heightened concerns about the war expanding beyond Ukraine's borders, prompting calls for vigilance and a heightened state of readiness along NATO's eastern flank to deter further escalations from Moscow.</p>

          <p>Jon Green, a Democratic county supervisor in Johnson County, Iowa, announced he will defy Republican Governor Kim Reynolds's order to fly flags at half-staff in honor of the assassinated activist Charlie Kirk. While condemning the killing, Green stated he would not grant county honors to a man whose life's mission was to denigrate marginalized communities and degrade the nation's political fabric. The decision has drawn criticism from the governor and some state Democrats, highlighting the deep political divisions surrounding Kirk's legacy.</p>

          <p>Swiss banking giant UBS is reportedly considering moving its headquarters to the United States to avoid proposed new capital requirements from the Swiss government. Following its takeover of Credit Suisse, regulators have suggested stricter rules that could force UBS to hold an additional $26 billion in capital. According to reports, senior executives have met with U.S. officials to discuss a potential strategy shift, which could even include acquiring a U.S. bank, as the institution weighs its options to protect shareholder interests.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) reveals that the 16-year-old who opened fire at Evergreen High School in Colorado was an active user of a 'violent gore' website. The site is known for hosting white supremacist content and graphic violence, and the ADL has linked it to several other recent school shooters, including those in Wisconsin and Nashville. This connection highlights a disturbing trend of young attackers being radicalized in nihilistic online spaces that glorify mass violence.</p>

          <p>In a commentary for The Guardian, Moira Donegan argues that while Charlie Kirk's assassination was a horrific tragedy, we must not rewrite his life's work in an attempt to eulogize him. The author condemns political violence but pushes back against portrayals of Kirk as a practitioner of good-faith debate, pointing to his history of promoting hateful rhetoric against marginalized groups. The piece asserts that a commitment to nonviolence should not require dishonesty about the divisive and harmful nature of Kirk's political project.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Guardian argues that after two years of war, Israeli society has become dangerously insulated from the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza, adapting to conflict as the 'new normal.' The author suggests this is sustained by a media bubble and a political discourse that has shifted from practical debate to a mythical, zero-sum narrative of biblical retribution. This disconnect allows for widespread public acceptance of the military's devastating actions while inhibiting any meaningful imagination of a peaceful future.</p>

          <p>Fear and apprehension are growing in Los Angeles' immigrant communities after a Supreme Court ruling allowed federal agents to conduct warrantless raids and target people based on appearance. The decision overturns a temporary restraining order, and the Department of Homeland Security has vowed to 'flood the zone.'

          <p>The Trump administration's new report, "Make Our Children Healthy Again," is facing criticism from health advocates and parents for its complete omission of the words 'smoking' and 'nicotine.' The 20-page document, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., focuses on chronic diseases but fails to address what many consider a primary health threat to young people: tobacco use and vaping. This omission is seen as particularly glaring given the ongoing youth vaping epidemic and recent administration cuts to successful tobacco control programs.</p>
