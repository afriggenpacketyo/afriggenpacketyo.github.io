          <p>Gold prices surged to over $3,500 an ounce as President Trump's escalating attacks on the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Jerome Powell, triggered investor unease and diminished confidence in the U.S. economy. Trump's demands for immediate interest rate cuts and exploration of options to remove Powell from his position led to a sell-off in equity markets, boosting gold's appeal as a safe-haven asset. Central banks' increasing gold reserves also contributed to the precious metal's rally, which analysts believe has further upside potential. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bath & Body Works is positioned to benefit from tariffs due to its predominantly US-based production, with 80% of its products manufactured domestically. This domestic focus gives the retailer a competitive advantage over competitors who rely more on imports, as it avoids import tariffs and can maintain prices without sacrificing profitability. The company's primary U.S. manufacturing facility, Beauty Park, allows for quick consumer response and minimizes the need for discounts. Analysts project sales growth for the company after a period of decline since the pandemic.</p>

The removal of that clause “is a big relief for Chinese shipbuilders, as it significantly alleviates clients’ concerns about placing orders”.</p>
