          <p>Author Philip Pullman is calling on the UK government to update copyright laws regarding AI "scraping," where AI software uses writers' books to train language models without compensation or recognition. Pullman argues that writers should be paid if their work is used, deeming the current system "wicked" and immoral. He emphasizes the need for the government to act swiftly to protect writers' rights against the unauthorized use of their creative work by AI developers. Pullman's call to action comes amid growing concerns about the impact of AI on creative industries and the need for fair compensation for artists. It's a critical issue that demands immediate attention. </p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced a general decline as investors analyzed Japan's latest trade data and the country's new political leadership. Japan's exports saw a slight increase, but fell short of expectations, while imports also rose. Sanae Takaichi was sworn in as Prime Minister, leading to market fluctuations, including a significant drop in SoftBank shares before recovering slightly. South Korea's markets showed resilience, bucking the regional trend with gains in the Kospi and Kosdaq indices. This reflects investor reaction to economic indicators and political developments in the region. </p>

          <p>National Guard troops are expected to deploy to New Orleans by late November, according to Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick, to support security efforts during major events. The deployment, requested by Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry, will cover the Bayou Classic, New Year's Eve, and Mardi Gras. This decision follows a previous deployment after a terror attack on Bourbon Street earlier in the year and aims to enhance public safety during large gatherings. While acknowledging the police department's understaffing, Kirkpatrick clarified that the National Guard's role is to support law enforcement, not to engage in enemy combat. The city is also expecting 20 new police officers to graduate from the academy soon. </p>

          <p>Los Angeles is grappling with a surge in copper wire thefts, leaving communities without streetlights and impacting public safety. A new statewide metal theft law aims to curb the problem by targeting recyclers who purchase stolen metal, requiring them to verify the seller's identity and lawful ownership. The thefts have caused significant financial losses and safety concerns, exemplified by the darkened Sixth Street Bridge and ongoing streetlight outages. City leaders are seeking funding to address the issue, while residents are taking measures into their own hands by installing private lighting. The new law is intended to reduce theft and improve public safety. </p>

          <p>The Ukrainian military announced that it has successfully struck a Russian chemical plant using UK-made Storm Shadow missiles. The strike, described as penetrating the Russian air defense system, targeted the Bryansk Chemical Plant, a key facility in Russia's military-industrial complex. The plant produces gunpowder, explosives, and rocket fuel components used in ammunition and missiles. The attack coincided with European leaders vowing to increase pressure on Russia's economy and defense industry. Russia launched an overnight air attack on Kyiv on Wednesday morning. </p>

          <p>Angels outfielder Mike Trout testified in a civil trial that he never witnessed signs of drug use from his late teammate Tyler Skaggs before his overdose death in 2019. Trout described his friendship with Skaggs and his observations of former communications director Eric Kay, who was convicted of providing Skaggs with a fentanyl-laced pill. Trout stated that he saw Kay acting "wired" and sweating, leading him to believe Kay was using drugs, but he was unaware of Skaggs's drug use. The trial is part of a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Skaggs's family against the Angels. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump's efforts to broker an end to the war in Ukraine face significant hurdles, contrasting with his successful ceasefire agreement in Gaza. The key to the Gaza breakthrough was Israel's decision to attack Hamas negotiators in Qatar, which gave Trump leverage to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump lacks similar leverage in the Ukraine war, and his attempts to strong-arm both Putin and Zelensky have yielded little effect. Putin may be using Trump's desire for a deal to influence him. Trump has swung between threatening sanctions and providing Ukraine with weapons, and is now calling for a ceasefire along current battle lines. </p>

          <p>A new study has ranked the side effects of different antidepressants, revealing significant variations between drugs. The research, analyzing 151 studies involving over 58,500 patients, found that some antidepressants caused weight gain or changes in heart rate. The study highlights the importance of matching antidepressants to individual needs and health conditions. Researchers suggest that the findings could lead to more personalized treatment plans and a reduction in the reliance on generic, cheap medications. The team is developing a free online tool to assist doctors and patients in choosing the right drug. </p>
