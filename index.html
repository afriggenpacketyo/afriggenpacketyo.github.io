          <p>The deployment of the National Guard to Democratic-led cities by President Trump is facing significant legal tests in Portland and Chicago, where local officials have filed lawsuits arguing the action is unconstitutional. A federal judge in Illinois has already partially blocked the deployment, citing the administration's assessments as "unreliable." The cases center on the fundamental question of executive power and whether the president can deploy military forces on domestic soil against the will of state and local governments.</p>

          <p>Spending time outdoors can yield significant physiological health benefits, including lower stress hormone levels, reduced blood pressure, and improved gut health. Research indicates that the maximum positive impact occurs after just 20 minutes in a natural environment, making it an accessible wellness practice. The article explains that unconscious relaxation is triggered by natural sights and sounds, while organic compounds from plants and soil can boost the immune system and mood. These findings support initiatives like "green social prescribing" to improve public health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. District Judge has granted a temporary restraining order to block the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois for 14 days. The judge ruled that there was no credible evidence of a rebellion and found the Department of Homeland Security's assessment of events to be unreliable. The decision highlighted concerns that deploying troops would escalate civil unrest rather than quell it, a sentiment echoed by state and local leaders who called the deployment illegal and dangerous.</p>

          <h2>England Manager Thomas Tuchel Criticizes 'Silent' Wembley Atmosphere During Win</h2>

          <p>Despite his team's dominant 3-0 victory over Wales, England manager Thomas Tuchel expressed disappointment with the atmosphere at Wembley Stadium, describing the crowd as "silent." He argued that the team's energetic performance, which included three goals in the opening 20 minutes, deserved more vocal energy and support from the home fans. Tuchel's unusual public criticism of the supporters has sparked a debate about the fan experience at England's national stadium and whether it matches the team's on-field efforts.</p>

          <h2>Texas Court Halts Execution of Robert Roberson Amid Doubts Over 'Shaken Baby Syndrome' Conviction</h2>

          <p>The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has issued a stay of execution for Robert Roberson, who was convicted of murdering his two-year-old daughter in 2002 based on a diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome. The execution was halted just one week before its scheduled date to allow for a review of new scientific evidence that challenges the validity of the diagnosis. Roberson's defense team argues that the child died from severe pneumonia and that his conviction was based on now-discredited "junk science."</p>

          <h2>National Palace Museum Anniversary Highlights Taiwan's Cultural Identity Conflict</h2>

          <p>The anniversary celebrations for Taiwan's National Palace Museum are underscoring the island's complex struggle with its cultural identity. The museum, which houses a vast collection of imperial Chinese treasures brought from Beijing, serves as a powerful link to Chinese civilization. However, this connection is a point of contention within Taiwan's current political climate, as the ruling party promotes a distinct Taiwanese identity separate from mainland China, making the museum a battleground for cultural and political narratives.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Proposes Barring Chinese Airlines from Flying Over Russia on U.S. Routes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-09 17:58:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Transportation Department, under the Trump administration, has proposed a rule to ban Chinese airlines from flying over Russian airspace on routes to and from the United States. The proposal argues that the ability to use Russian airspace gives Chinese carriers an unfair competitive advantage, as U.S. airlines are barred from doing so. This creates shorter, more fuel-efficient routes for Chinese carriers, and the proposed ban aims to "level this competitive disparity" amid broader economic tensions.</p>
