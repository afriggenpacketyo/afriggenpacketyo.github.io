        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece discusses a possible connection between the rise of therapy culture and the declining birth rates among millennials and Gen Z. The author suggests that an increased focus on individual trauma and the redefinition of harm have led to impossibly high standards for parenting, making younger generations hesitant to have children. The piece also touches on other plausible explanations, such as financial concerns, career aspirations, and climate change anxieties, but emphasizes the impact of redefined standards for parenting. This shift has contributed to a new, nearly impossible standard for parenting, which may cause younger generations to dread parenthood because they feel they cannot meet the high standards that they hold their own parents to.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has announced a new 50% tariff rate for steel imports, set to take effect on Wednesday. The announcement was made during a rally in Pennsylvania, where Trump also celebrated a "blockbuster" agreement for Nippon Steel's investment in US Steel. This move aims to further secure the steel industry in the United States, according to Trump, who stated that no one would be able to circumvent the tariff. The announcement comes after a federal appeals court temporarily allowed Trump's tariffs to remain in effect, staying a decision by a US trade court that blocked the president from imposing the duties.

The photos, commissioned by Harvard professor Louis Agassiz for discredited research, will now be placed in a museum where the people depicted were enslaved.

Senator Cynthia Lummis announced a Senate bill establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers is nearing a vote, and Representative Bryan Steil is working on companion legislation in the House.

Peirce advises investors to proceed at their own risk, highlighting the lack of SEC oversight in this area. This shift aligns with the SEC's more industry-friendly approach to crypto since President Trump took office, although concerns about potential conflicts of interest due to the Trump family's involvement in crypto remain.

Dugan was arrested by FBI agents on allegations that she prevented the arrest of a man by immigration authorities at her courthouse. The judges argue that Dugan is entitled to absolute immunity for her official acts, similar to members of the legislative and executive branches. They call the prosecution an egregious overreach by the executive branch that threatens public trust in the judicial system.</p>

Soldiers will identify fellow service members suspected of having gender dysphoria, and commanders are expected to initiate medical record reviews. Critics argue the policies are worse than "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," and transgender troops will receive an honorable discharge with a code indicating they are not eligible to rejoin the Army.</p>

          <p>The last hospital providing health services in the North Gaza governorate, al-Awda, has been evacuated after the Israeli military ordered its immediate evacuation. Dr. Mohammed Salha told the BBC that patients were evacuated after "two weeks of siege", and there was now "no health facility working in the north". The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said there was terrorist activity in the region, which warranted the IDF to "expand its offensive activity". The closure of al-Awda means there is no remaining functioning hospital in the North Gaza governorate, severing a critical lifeline for the people there.</p>

          <p>Gerry Adams, former Sinn FÃ©in leader, has been awarded â‚¬100,000 in damages over a BBC story about the murder of a British agent.

Adams denies any involvement, stating the case "was about putting manners on the British Broadcasting Corporation". The legal bill for the case is believed to be between â‚¬3-5 million.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration could pursue alternative pathways for imposing tariffs after a federal court this week struck down its use of emergency powers to enact broad levies on U.S. trading partners, according to experts. At risk is much of Trump's trade agenda, which relies on tariffs as a way to secure better terms of trade, boost the U.S. manufacturing sector and generate what he claims could be trillions in new federal revenue. For now, Mr. Trump's tariffs remain in place after a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted the decision, reinstating the levies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) has sued President Donald Trump to block his attempt to cut off its federal funding, accusing the president of retaliating against the public broadcaster over "perceived political slights in news coverage." PBS argues that Trump's executive order targeting its funding would upend public television. The lawsuit comes three days after National Public Radio (NPR) filed a similar suit against Trump and his administration. The White House said the CPB was "creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers' dime."</p>
