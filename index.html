          <p>Scientists in China have developed a more affordable and simpler method for CAR-T cell therapy, a treatment for blood cancers and other diseases. By using gene therapy tools, they can generate anti-cancer cells directly within a patient's body, significantly reducing the high costs associated with conventional methods. This innovative approach has already been used to treat four patients with multiple myeloma. The breakthrough aims to make this highly effective but expensive therapy more accessible to the public.</p>

          <p>The UK is preparing for severe weather, with an amber warning for thunderstorms and torrential rain issued for parts of the country, including London and the south coast. Meteorologists predict that over a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours, leading to a high risk of dangerous flash floods. The recent heatwave has left the ground dry and unable to absorb water effectively, exacerbating the flood threat. Authorities warn of likely disruptions to transport, power cuts, and potential danger to life.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility in East L.A. has resulted in the deaths of three deputies. The deputies, identified as members of the elite Arson Explosives Detail, were reportedly working to render safe a grenade that had been recovered the previous day. Sheriff Robert Luna described the incident as the department's largest loss of life since 1857. Federal agencies, including the ATF and FBI, are assisting in the ongoing investigation into the cause of the tragic blast.</p>

          <p>Jemima Goldsmith, ex-wife of imprisoned former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, has accused the government of threatening their two sons with arrest if they visit Pakistan. The warning comes as Khan's PTI party plans nationwide protests demanding his release, with speculation that his sons might participate. A government adviser stated that while the sons are welcome as visitors, they will be dealt with according to the law if they engage in illegal activities.

          <p>Italy is facing a severe demographic crisis, with its population shrinking and the national birth rate hitting a record low of 1.18 babies per woman. Small towns like Fregona are experiencing a sharp decline, risking the closure of essential services like primary schools and leading to fears of community collapse. Despite government initiatives such as cash bonuses and tax breaks, many Italians find the support insufficient due to the high cost of living and lack of affordable childcare.

The findings help explain why some breast cancer patients experience a spread of the disease despite successful initial treatment. The research team also identified specific drugs that, when used with chemotherapy in mice, could inhibit this process. A clinical trial based on these findings is now underway with breast cancer patients, offering potential new strategies for improving cancer treatment outcomes.</p>

          <p>Scientists from the People's Liberation Army are proposing a new "X-railgun" design that could nearly double the power of the navy's existing electromagnetic weapon. The current naval railgun, a world-first, is limited by its power, capping projectile weight and reducing its effectiveness for naval warfare. The army's proposed solution involves cross-stacking two railguns into a single unit. According to the project team, this would allow for much heavier projectiles to be fired at hypersonic speeds, potentially overcoming the limitations that have hampered the technology's military application.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died after being violently pulled into an MRI machine at a medical facility in Westbury, New York. According to Nassau County police, the man was wearing a large metallic chain and entered the MRI room while a scan was in progress. He reportedly entered after hearing his relative, the patient, screaming, defying orders to stay out. The powerful magnetic force of the machine pulled the chain, causing fatal injuries. Medical experts stress that such incidents are rare but underscore the critical importance of strict safety protocols around MRI equipment.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that ten more hostages held in Gaza are expected to be released "very shortly." The statement was made as his administration continues to push for a 60-day ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. The current proposal reportedly includes the return of these 10 living hostages and the remains of 18 others, in exchange for Israel releasing an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement comes after recent visits by Israeli officials to Washington and ongoing indirect talks mediated by Qatar to finalize the truce.</p>

          <p>Retired Marine Scott Harrison, who endured the horrors of the Vietnam War, found solace in a small music box that inspired a vision of a peaceful carousel. After battling PTSD for years, he decided to make that vision a reality to help himself heal. In 1986, he brought a broken-down carousel to Nederland, Colorado, and spent 26 years hand-carving new animals for it. Now a nonprofit, the "Carousel of Happiness" has brought joy to over a million people and has become a source of profound healing for Harrison, turning his personal therapy into a gift for others.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that he believes up to five jets were shot down during the recent military hostilities between India and Pakistan. The conflict was sparked by an April attack in India-administered Kashmir and escalated before a ceasefire was reached in May. Trump did not specify which country's jets were downed, though both sides made conflicting claims about their losses and successes during the aerial combat. The president has previously claimed credit for brokering the ceasefire, a position that India has disputed, maintaining that such issues must be resolved bilaterally.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act, a landmark bill creating the first major regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The legislation, which received bipartisan support, establishes consumer protections and clear legal definitions for these dollar-pegged digital currencies. It allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins, a move hailed by the administration as a way to strengthen the dollar and upgrade the financial system. The law is seen as a major victory for the crypto industry, which has long advocated for clearer regulations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An adviser for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has stated that the global financial system needs to rewrite its rules to adapt to a future dominated by tokenization.

This call for new regulations comes as the stablecoin market experiences rapid growth, spurred by the Trump administration's embrace of digital currencies.

He also stated that while he is not a proponent of agents wearing masks during arrests, he will permit the practice due to a more than 800% increase in attacks on ICE personnel. Lyons attributed the rise in tension and attacks to the agency's increased visibility as it carries out the administration's large-scale deportation operations, particularly in "sanctuary" jurisdictions that limit local law enforcement cooperation.</p>

This, combined with Trump's subsequent order to seek the release of Epstein-related grand jury testimony, has unified his base against a common media target.
