          <p>Berkshire Hathaway reported a 14% drop in operating earnings for the first quarter, largely due to a significant decrease in insurance-underwriting profit. The company also experienced a loss related to foreign exchange as the dollar weakened. Warren Buffett cautioned that tariffs and geopolitical risks, particularly those enacted by President Donald Trump, create an uncertain environment for the conglomerate, making it difficult to predict the potential impact on their diverse businesses, including BNSF railway and Geico insurance. The article highlights the conglomerate's struggle to reliably forecast future financial performance amid accelerating changes in international trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a week of intense violence in Ashrafieh Sahnaya, Syria, Druse leaders have agreed to integrate their militia fighters into government forces in exchange for government concessions, including investigations into abuses committed during the clashes. This decision comes after the government retook control of the town from armed groups amidst rising sectarian tensions. The violence was incited by a debunked audio clip allegedly of a Druse cleric insulting the Prophet Muhammad, leading to attacks by Sunni extremists and intervention from Israel, who launched airstrikes in the name of protecting Syrian Druse. While some residents express skepticism, the agreement marks a significant step towards unity, though many Syrians from minority groups remain wary of the new Islamist government.</p>

          <p>A new lawsuit seeks to compel the New Jersey state police to allow mitochondrial DNA testing on envelopes used in the Lindbergh baby kidnapping case, which remains a subject of fascination 93 years later. The case, involving the kidnapping and murder of Charles Lindbergh's son, led to the conviction of Bruno Hauptmann, but questions about co-conspirators persist. Researchers seek access to a quarter-million documents and evidence items, arguing that modern forensic testing could clarify lingering questions and contribute to a more accurate historical account.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly in discussions with Rwanda to establish an agreement for Kigali to accept deportees from the U.S., including non-Rwandan nationals. Decisions on financial compensation and other details are under discussion. This follows Secretary of State Marco Rubio's search for countries to take migrants expelled from the U.S. The article notes Rwanda's past experience with handling deportees, citing a previous deal with the United Kingdom.

          <p>Japan's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that Japan will not agree to a trade deal with the U.S. unless all of President Trump's tariffs are reviewed, highlighting a disagreement over which tariffs are negotiable. Japan is particularly concerned about duties on its auto industry, which accounts for a significant portion of exports to the U.S. The Trump administration is believed to be focused on negotiating the reciprocal tariff rate. A new tariff on auto parts has also taken effect, further complicating negotiations. The article underscores the ongoing trade tensions between the two countries.</p>

          <h2>New Tariffs on Imported Auto Parts Could Raise Car Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 07:35:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially increasing the cost of new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. The tariffs, intended to promote domestic manufacturing, come after similar levies on imported cars. The administration said the tariffs aim to reduce reliance on foreign automobiles and parts, but they will not apply to components from Canada or Mexico meeting North American trade agreement requirements. Rising car prices are expected to contribute to overall inflation, despite the President's promises to lower it. Automakers and suppliers say it will take years to relocate assembly lines.</p>

        </div>

          <p>A new training program called CHAT (Changing Talk) teaches aides to avoid "elderspeak," which is communication that sounds like baby talk, when addressing older people. The program aims to reduce ageist assumptions of frailty and incompetence by promoting respectful and adult-like communication. Studies show that elderspeak is commonplace in nursing homes and can lead to resistance to care and increased use of antipsychotic drugs. The CHAT training has been shown to reduce elderspeak and resistant behaviors, improving the quality of care for older adults.</p>

          <p>A helicopter from a China Coast Guard ship briefly violated Japanese airspace near the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, prompting the Air Self-Defense Force to scramble jet fighters. The incident occurred as four Chinese coast guard ships entered Japan's territorial waters around the disputed islets, which are controlled by Japan but claimed by China. Japanese patrol vessels issued warnings to the Chinese ships, which later moved to the contiguous zone. This marks the first intrusion by Chinese vessels into the area since April 7 and highlights ongoing tensions in the region.</p>
