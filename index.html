          <h2>Fed Chair Powell Warns of Challenges Posed by Supply Shocks and Higher Long-Term Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 08:55:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher due to changes in the economy and policy. Speaking at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference, Powell noted that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon, even with long-term inflation expectations around the Fed's 2% target. He also highlighted the potential for more frequent and persistent supply shocks, creating a difficult balancing act for the Fed between supporting employment and controlling inflation. Powell has recently mentioned the likelihood that tariffs will slow growth and boost inflation, adding to the complexity of policy decisions.</p>

          <p>Walmart CFO John David Rainey warned that consumers could start seeing higher prices later this month due to tariffs, even with recently announced reductions on Chinese imports. Despite Walmart's commitment to everyday low prices, Rainey stated that the magnitude of the tariff increases is too large for retailers and suppliers to absorb. Walmart reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and maintained its full-year forecast, while also achieving its first profitable quarter for e-commerce. The retailer expects net sales to increase, but declined to provide specific earnings guidance due to fluctuating tariff policies.</p>

          <p>House Republicans, particularly those from New York, are in conflict with party leadership over the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. Some representatives from suburban districts are pushing for the cap to be abolished or significantly raised, while others, like Nicole Malliotakis, support a more modest increase to $30,000. The issue is causing a major stumbling block for Republicans trying to pass a $3.8 trillion tax proposal, as those from high-tax states face pressure from constituents who feel penalized by the current cap. Polling indicates strong voter support for candidates who advocate for restoring the ability to deduct state and local taxes.</p>

The proposal includes adding warehouse management, waste disposal, and linen supply to the existing 16 eligible industries.

As of the end of 2024, there were over 280,000 holders of the Specified Skilled Worker visa.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's shares experienced a drop after the Chinese e-commerce giant reported lower-than-expected earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter. While revenue increased by 7% year-on-year, it still fell short of analyst expectations due to macroeconomic volatility and consumer sentiment in China. The company is facing challenges from Washington's trade war with Beijing and intense price competition in China with rivals including PDD and JD.com. Despite these challenges, Alibaba plans to invest aggressively in its "instant commerce" model and has extended its partnership with Rednote to boost purchases on its platforms.</p>

          <p>Walmart cautioned that President Trump's tariffs may soon force the company to raise prices, despite reporting solid sales growth in its most recent quarter.

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on whether federal judges can block Trump administration policies across the country, a practice that has significantly hindered President Trump's agenda. The case stems from an executive order ending birthright citizenship, which was quickly blocked by federal judges.

A decision limiting these injunctions could reshape how federal courts handle challenges to Trump's policies, potentially boosting executive power.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to remove Endangered Species Act protections for the lesser prairie-chicken, a groundbird living in the southern Great Plains. The administration argues that federal officials made an error when listing the prairie-chicken under the Act, claiming there was insufficient information to show that the two bird populations are distinct. Environmental advocates argue that the move is an effort to prioritize oil and gas drilling over wildlife protections, as the prairie-chicken's habitat overlaps with these industries.

          <p>Wildlife officials in North Carolina are offering a $20,000 reward for information regarding the decapitation of a dolphin found on Lea-Hutaff Island. The 8-foot-long dolphin was discovered intact initially, but its head was later removed, violating the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The remote location of the island complicates the investigation. An initial health assessment showed the dolphin likely carried Brucella, a bacteria that can be transmitted to humans. Conviction for mutilating the dolphin could result in significant fines and jail time.</p>

          <p>The Golden State Warriors experienced a glimpse into their future without Stephen Curry, and the results were underwhelming as they were eliminated by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the Western Conference semi-finals. After Curry sustained a hamstring strain in Game 1, the Warriors struggled significantly, highlighting their dependence on his scoring and creativity. Despite the midseason acquisition of Jimmy Butler, the Warriors lacked the offensive firepower to compensate for Curry's absence, underscoring the team's reliance on their star player.

          <p>Teenagers have coined the term "dry texting" to describe subtle shifts in texting behavior that signal a change in the vibe of a conversation. This includes reverting to lowercase, sending short replies, or using conversation-ending comments. Dry texting is a common way for teens to realize someone is upset with them. The phenomenon highlights how technology can create subtle fault lines in communication, leading to uncertainty and anxiety. While not unique to teens, ambiguous signals can be more painful than direct confrontation, especially during adolescence.</p>

          <p>China is expanding visa-free travel to five South American countries, including Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru, and Uruguay, starting June 1. Citizens of these countries will be allowed to enter China without a visa for up to 30 days for tourism, family visits, or business purposes. The announcement follows a meeting between China and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, where President Xi Jinping pledged to expand visa-free access in the region. Beijing aims to increase economic and political cooperation with the bloc and challenge Washington's influence.</p>
