          <p>Derrick Groves, the last of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in May, has been captured in Atlanta following a brief standoff. His arrest concludes a multi-agency manhunt that began after the May 16 jailbreak, which officials attributed to significant design flaws and staffing issues at the facility. Groves, who was serving a life sentence for murder and manslaughter, was found in a crawl space after a SWAT team deployed gas canisters. This capture brings a long-awaited sense of justice to victims and the New Orleans community, though questions about the jail's security persist.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has warned that a shortage of air traffic controllers is causing flight delays across the U.S., exacerbating concerns related to the ongoing government shutdown. Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport experienced half-hour delays due to staffing issues, and similar disruptions occurred in Burbank and Nashville. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy noted a "slight uptick" in sick calls among controllers, many of whom are working without pay as essential employees. The situation highlights long-standing staffing challenges within the FAA, intensified by the current shutdown, which has furloughed many federal workers.</p>

          <p>Virginia's Democratic attorney general nominee, Jay Jones, is under fire after a resurfaced social media post from 2021 shows him calling for a Republican candidate to drop out over a controversial comment. This comes after an explosive report revealed Jones's 2022 text messages fantasizing about shooting a former Republican House Speaker and harming his children. Despite widespread calls for his withdrawal, including from the Republican Attorneys General Association, Democrats who endorsed Jones are standing by him, citing his apology and the context of his character. Jones has denied other allegations of suggesting more police officers should be killed.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, has been arrested in Florida on suspicion of arson in connection with the devastating Palisades Fire that killed twelve people and destroyed thousands of structures in Los Angeles earlier this year. Officials allege Rinderknecht started the Lachman Fire on January 1, which later rekindled due to Santa Ana winds, leading to the larger Palisades Fire. He faces a felony charge of Destruction of Property by Means of Fire, with potential for additional charges. The investigation involved extensive digital evidence, including a ChatGPT prompt Rinderknecht used to generate images of a burning city, though a motive has not been disclosed.</p>

          <p>The Palace Museum, established on October 10, 1925, in Beijing's Forbidden City, marks its centenary, evolving into four distinct museums across Beijing, Taipei, Chiayi, and Hong Kong. A significant aspect of its history involves the extraordinary wartime trek from 1933 to 1950, where 20,000 crates of priceless relics traveled over 10,000 miles through war-torn regions to safeguard national heritage.

          <p>Arizona's Democratic senators, Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego, confronted House Speaker Mike Johnson regarding his refusal to swear in Adelita Grijalva, the state's newly elected Democratic representative. Johnson maintained that Grijalva's swearing-in is contingent on the government reopening, dismissing claims that the delay is linked to a petition to release Jeffrey Epstein files as "totally absurd." The exchange occurred amidst the ongoing government shutdown, which has halted legislative activity and furloughed federal workers. Democrats and Republicans remain deadlocked over funding, with each side blaming the other for the impasse.</p>

          <p>President Trump declared on Truth Social that Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker "should be in jail" for failing to protect ICE officers. Both Johnson and Pritzker vehemently condemned Trump's remarks, with Pritzker calling him a "coward" and Johnson labeling him "unstable" and a "threat to our democracy." The president's comments follow weeks of sparring over his deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago, a move opposed by state and city leaders who have filed a federal lawsuit to block it. This escalation underscores ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and Democratic-led cities.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve officials remain divided and cautious regarding future interest rate cuts, as revealed in the minutes from their September meeting. While most members supported further rate reductions this year due to growing risks to the job market, some expressed concern about persistent inflation exceeding the 2% target. The central bank implemented a quarter-point rate cut, its first since December 2024, but Chair Jerome Powell noted the absence of "risk-free paths." Disagreements highlight the complex balance between stimulating the economy and controlling inflation, with some advocating for a slower approach to further easing.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats are moving to force a vote under the War Powers Act to block President Trump's continued U.S. military strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats off Venezuela's coast. Led by Senators Adam Schiff and Tim Kaine, the resolution argues that these strikes, which have killed at least 21 people, lack congressional authorization and risk escalating into a broader conflict. The Trump administration claims authority, designating drug cartels as terrorist organizations and viewing drug smuggling as an "armed attack." However, critics, including some Republicans, question the legality and potential precedent of using military force without explicit congressional approval.</p>

This statement follows President Trump's executive order designating antifa as a "domestic terrorist organization" in September.

Assemblyman Jesse Gabriel, the bill's author, emphasized the scientific consensus linking ultra-processed foods to health issues like obesity and asthma in children. The law aims to ensure students have access to healthier, more nutritious meals, with vendors prohibited from selling banned items to districts by 2032.</p>

This decision came after the administration attempted to circumvent an earlier order by mobilizing National Guard troops from California and Texas. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals later issued an administrative stay on Immergut's initial order concerning Oregon's own Guard, but the broader prohibition on all National Guard deployments to Oregon remains in effect.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to nominate a new prime minister within 48 hours, aiming to resolve a persistent political stalemate. Outgoing Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu indicated that the possibility of fresh elections is fading, with a parliamentary majority keen to avoid them and pass a budget. This marks the third French PM to leave office in less than a year, driven by a deeply divided hung parliament. The new government faces the challenge of tackling France's crippling national debt and revisiting Macron's contested pension reforms, with political factions remaining deeply entrenched in their positions.</p>

          <h2>Questions Arise Over LAFD's Response to Palisades Fire Rekindling</h2>

          <p>Federal investigators have determined the devastating Palisades Fire was a "holdover" from an intentionally set New Year's Day blaze, raising questions about the Los Angeles Fire Department's (LAFD) role in preventing its rekindling. The initial Lachman fire smoldered underground for days, unseen, before heavy winds caused it to resurface and spread. Critics, including former arson unit head Ed Nordskog, argue the LAFD should have proactively patrolled the area given expected windstorms. While investigators blame the arsonist, the LAFD's decision not to pre-deploy engines despite extreme weather warnings is under scrutiny, highlighting potential lapses in post-suppression monitoring.</p>

          <p>Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor is facing criticism after her team's underwhelming 1-1 draw with Twente in their Women's Champions League opener. Former England forward Lianne Sanderson suggested Bompastor "took Twente lightly" and made the "wrong team selection" by making seven changes to the starting XI. Despite outperforming Twente in shots and possession, Chelsea converted only one of their six attempts on target, a performance Bompastor acknowledged as "not good enough." The result puts pressure on Bompastor as Chelsea aims for a maiden European trophy, especially after tournament heavyweights Barcelona secured a dominant 7-1 victory.</p>

          <p>Simon Case, former Cabinet Secretary, has publicly questioned the official explanation for the collapse of a high-profile prosecution against alleged Chinese spies. The Prime Minister and Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) attributed the case's failure to the government's inability to provide evidence that China was a national security threat in 2023. However, Case highlighted that intelligence agencies have long publicly described China as a threat. This intervention, supported by other former officials and politicians, fuels accusations that the trial was scuppered to protect Britain's trading relationship with China, raising serious concerns about national security and governmental transparency.</p>

          <p>After more than six decades, authorities in Albany, New York, have identified Joseph Nowakowski as the man responsible for the sexual assault, stabbing, and bludgeoning death of 50-year-old Catherine Blackburn in September 1964. Nowakowski, who died in 1998, was linked to the crime through DNA evidence, a breakthrough achieved through a joint effort by the Criminal Investigation Resource Center at Russell Sage College and other agencies. Blackburn's niece, Sandy Carmichael, expressed gratitude for the long-awaited resolution, emphasizing that "there's no such thing as a cold case" with advancements in DNA technology. Nowakowski had a lengthy criminal record, though he was not a suspect at the time of Blackburn's murder.</p>

          <p>The NHS is reportedly preparing to increase payments to pharmaceutical firms for medicines by up to 25% to resolve a dispute over drug pricing with the industry and the Trump administration. The proposed plan, which includes raising the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) cost-effectiveness threshold, aims to address concerns that current pricing policies deter investment in the UK. This comes after major companies paused or cancelled UK investments, redirecting funds to the U.S. While ministers are prepared to spend more on innovative medicines, funding mechanisms are still being debated between the Department of Health and Social Care, the Treasury, and No 10.
