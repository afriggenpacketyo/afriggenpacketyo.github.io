          <p>Attorneys for James Comey have filed motions to dismiss the two-count federal indictment against him, arguing it stems from a "vindictive and unlawful prosecution" ordered by former President Trump. The defense challenges the appointment of the interim U.S. Attorney and alleges the charges are a result of "personal spite." Meanwhile, prosecutors have raised the possibility of disqualifying Comey's lead attorney due to his alleged role in a 2017 memo leak. A hearing on the motions is scheduled for November 19.</p>

          <p>Steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs announced it is investigating the commercial viability of mining rare earths at two of its sites in Michigan and Minnesota, causing its shares to jump more than 20%. The move aligns with the U.S. government's strategy to reduce dependency on China, which currently dominates the global supply chain for these critical minerals. CEO Lourenco Goncalves stated the company aims to be part of the solution for American mineral independence, especially as rare earths are vital for defense, electric vehicles, and other high-tech applications.

Companies like Disney+, Reddit, and United Airlines, along with Amazon's own internal systems, were affected by what AWS described as a DNS issue with its DynamoDB database service. While the company reported signs of recovery within hours, the incident highlighted the internet's heavy reliance on a few major cloud providers and the cascading effect of a single point of failure.</p>

A Met spokesperson stated the move will reduce ambiguity and prevent officers from policing "toxic culture war debates," a decision that follows public backlash and a call for clearer legal boundaries.</p>

Average monthly payments have surged, and with the average new car costing over $50,000, many consumers are taking on longer loan terms, increasing their financial risk.

          <p>A scientific debate is underway regarding the creation of "mirror life," synthetic organisms built from molecules that are mirror images of those found in nature. Proponents argue it could lead to revolutionary therapeutics that last longer in the body, but opponents warn of catastrophic risks, as mirror bacteria might evade immune systems and natural predators, potentially outcompeting all existing life. While the technology to create a complete mirror cell is still decades away, some experts are calling for a global moratorium on such research, citing the immense and unpredictable dangers of introducing a second, independent tree of life.</p>

          <p>A recent CNBC|SurveyMonkey survey reveals that Gen X small business owners are the most pessimistic about the economy, despite being in their peak career years. This group expresses the lowest confidence in current business conditions and the broader U.S. economic outlook, citing jobs and the economy as their top concern. In contrast, while younger Gen Z and millennial entrepreneurs are more worried about a future recession, they remain more optimistic about near-term growth. The findings highlight a generational divide in economic anxiety, with Gen X feeling immediate pressure while younger generations fear long-term uncertainty.</p>

          <h2>Financial Advisors Explain Why Year-End is an Optimal Time for Roth IRA Conversions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-20 15:04:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The end of the year is a popular time for investors to execute Roth IRA conversions, a strategy that involves moving pre-tax retirement funds into a post-tax Roth account to allow for future tax-free growth. Financial experts note that waiting until the fourth quarter allows for a more accurate estimate of one's annual income, which is crucial for managing the immediate tax liability of the conversion. While some argue for earlier conversions to start tax-free growth sooner, the risk of miscalculating income and unintentionally moving into a higher tax bracket makes year-end planning a safer approach for many.
