          <p>According to an SBU source, Ukraine launched a drone attack on four Russian military airfields, reportedly hitting over 40 aircraft used in bombings. The attack, planned for over a year and a half, utilized drones concealed in mobile houses with retractable roofs. Simultaneously, in Russia's Bryansk region, a railway bridge collapsed, derailing a passenger train and resulting in seven deaths and 66 injuries, with a second railway bridge collapsing in the Kursk region. The Ukrainian intelligence services have claimed responsibility for attacks on Russia's railway networks intended to hamper Moscow's military logistics. The Ukrainian air force reported that Russia launched 479 drones and missiles into the country overnight, marking one of the largest aerial attacks of the war.</p>

The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), the aid provider, denied the claims, while the IDF stated its forces did not fire at Gazans near aid points. Doctors at Nasser hospital reported treating around 200 people with bullet or shrapnel wounds, with British charity Medical Aid for Palestinians reporting that many victims sustained direct shots to the head or chest.

An observer said that those views were unlikely to be fully endorsed by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, as they still faced economic uncertainties from steep US tariffs and sought to diversify trade ties.</p>

The United States’ unpredictable approach to international students makes them ponder the returns on investment in their children’s overseas education.
