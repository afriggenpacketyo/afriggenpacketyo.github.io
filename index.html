          <p>Chinese ambassador Xie Feng addressed trade tensions with the United States, stating that China seeks dialogue based on equality, respect, and reciprocity. Speaking at the embassy's annual open day in Washington, Xie criticized US tariffs on Chinese goods, asserting that they harm businesses, increase costs, and destabilize global markets. He emphasized that China did not initiate the trade war and called for the US to engage in negotiations with mutual respect. While President Trump claimed trade talks were underway, Beijing has denied any active negotiations, underscoring the existing friction between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Mali's military junta is planning to extend its rule for at least five more years, seeking to remain in power until 2030 without holding democratic elections. The junta's proposal includes dissolving the 2005 Political Parties Charter and limiting the number of permitted parties to five, a move condemned by Amnesty International as an attack on freedom of expression. Opposition parties have boycotted the junta-organized "national conference" and denounce the repressive measures, arguing that the proposed changes violate the Malian constitution. Mali's political landscape has been unstable since the 2020 coup, with the junta postponing elections and banning political activities.</p>

          <p>Two commercial jetliners were forced to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) due to an Army Black Hawk helicopter violating safety standards. The incident occurred three months after a fatal mid-air collision involving a Black Hawk near the airport, prompting U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to call the event "unacceptable". The FAA and NTSB are investigating the incident, which involved a Delta Air Lines flight and a Republic Airways flight. Restrictions on helicopter flights near DCA were implemented after the January collision, and Duffy plans to discuss the rule violation with Defense Department officials.</p>

          <p>At least seven people were killed and 20 others injured in an attack on a hospital and market in South Sudan, according to Doctors Without Borders (MSF). The medical charity reported that helicopter gunships bombed the pharmacy of its hospital in Old Fangak, Jonglei state, before firing on the town, followed by a drone bombing a local market. The hospital, which serves over 110,000 people, had all its medical supplies destroyed, leading MSF to condemn the attack as a violation of international humanitarian law. The strikes come amid growing fears of a return to civil war, fueled by escalating tensions between President Salva Kiir and Vice-President Riek Machar.</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, a move expected to significantly increase prices for new and used vehicles, as well as repairs and insurance. These tariffs, ordered by President Trump to promote domestic manufacturing, follow earlier levies on imported cars. The new duties will affect even domestically made cars, which often rely on foreign-made engines, transmissions, and batteries. While some exemptions exist for parts from Canada and Mexico, the tariffs are expected to shrink the supply of less expensive vehicles and contribute to overall inflation, creating headaches for carmakers.</p>

          <p>The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has laid off most of its remaining staff, significantly impacting programs related to worker safety and health. The layoffs, ordered by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have halted new investigations of firefighter injuries and workplace health hazards, as well as a CDC plan to curb measles infections in Texas schools. The cuts have also stopped work at the agency's National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, responsible for vetting safety equipment like N95 masks. An executive order issued by President Trump ended collective bargaining with unions representing the CDC and some other agencies, which is now being challenged in court.</p>

          <p>Erika Roberts, a 27-year-old American, moved to Germany for medical school, attracted by its low tuition fees of $97 a semester and the opportunity to experience a different culture. Unlike the United States, Germany does not require a Bachelor's degree to attend medical school, offering a six-year program divided into three stages. Roberts has found that living in Germany has led to healthier habits and a different approach to life, with a focus on community and personal growth. She plans to become a dermatologist and does not foresee moving back to the U.S. permanently.</p>

The center-left government will significantly increase its majority, with the conservative Liberal-National coalition suffering a major defeat. The election was dominated by cost-of-living concerns, particularly healthcare and housing affordability, but international relations, particularly how to deal with Donald Trump, also played a role. Albanese promised to make healthcare more affordable, put buying a house within reach for more Australians, and do more to address climate change.</p>

          <p>Capital One aims to maximize its acquisition of Discover Financial by expanding Discover's payment network internationally. The acquisition, valued at $35 billion, will allow Capital One to become both a credit card issuer and a payment network operator, similar to American Express. CEO Richard Fairbank believes that increasing Discover's international presence will enable Capital One to shift more of its branded credit cards away from Visa and Mastercard, exceeding initial synergy estimates. While global expansion may take time, it could create a "flywheel effect" for the combined business.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's ambition to become prime minister is gaining traction following Reform UK's recent successes in local elections. The party's significant gains have shaken the political landscape, prompting both Labour and the Conservatives to reassess their strategies. Reform UK's success is attributed to Farage's ability to seize on issues that other politicians are reluctant to address, creating rows and garnering media coverage. While Reform's ability to govern effectively remains to be seen, their recent victories have sparked debate about the depth of public disillusionment with the traditional political system.</p>

Vopson argues that gravity may be the result of the universe trying to minimize clutter, behaving like a computer algorithm. This interpretation is based on his "second law of information dynamics," which suggests that the universe is optimizing data compression. Vopson's theory aligns with the idea that information stored in elementary cells informs the coordinates of matter, similar to pixelation in a digital computer game.</p>
