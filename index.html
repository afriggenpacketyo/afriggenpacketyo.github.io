          <p>Novak Djokovic, at 38, is set to compete against Jannik Sinner in the French Open semi-finals, marking a generational clash in tennis. Despite being the oldest man to reach this stage since 1968, Djokovic is considered by some to be underrated, having secured victories against top players like Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev this year. Zverev emphasized that Djokovic's age should be disregarded due to his impressive recent performances, making him a formidable opponent. Meanwhile, defending champion Alcaraz is preparing to face Lorenzo Musetti in the other semi-final match. Optimism is present that Djokovic can secure yet another title despite his age. </p>

          <p>Overcapacity in China has led to producer prices remaining in deflationary territory, causing anxiety in Asia about a flood of cheap imports squeezing local industries. However, economists suggest this influx of low-cost Chinese goods could provide relief for inflation-worn economies. Emerging growth risks and subdued inflation may pave the way for more rate cuts across Asia, with central banks decoupling from the Fed. The investment bank Nomura expects central banks in the region to further decouple from the Fed and deliver additional easing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thomas Mann, a Nobel laureate and literary exile, is remembered as a cultural icon 150 years after his birth. Mann's works reflected his life in exile after escaping Nazi Germany, often incorporating political essays and speeches against the regime. His early success with "Buddenbrooks" allowed him to pursue writing, while his opposition to the Nazi party led to the revocation of his German citizenship. After emigrating to the US, Mann continued to call on Germans to resist, leaving a lasting legacy of courage and intellectual resistance. </p>

The report indicates that jobs and wages are growing in AI-exposed occupations, and productivity growth has nearly quadrupled in industries positioned to adopt AI. Wages for workers with AI skills are 56% higher than those without, and employer demand for formal degrees is declining in AI-exposed jobs.
