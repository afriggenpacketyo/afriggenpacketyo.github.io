        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the latest "framework consensus" regarding TikTok's operations in the United States, despite initial appearances, still leaves China with significant leverage. The author suggests that what seems like a victory for the US, including an increase in American ownership to 80% and a multibillion-dollar payment, could ultimately be a strategic triumph for President Xi Jinping. This is because ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, remains the single largest shareholder with just under 20%, maintaining its influence over crucial elements like servers and algorithms. The article implies that Americans' data and the platform's core technology are not entirely under US control, challenging the perceived success of the deal.</p>

          <p>This opinion article sharply criticizes Donald Trump's contentious claims about autism, including linking it to Tylenol and advocating for a "cure," highlighting the deep distress these comments cause the autistic community. The author celebrates the incredible strengths of autistic individuals, such as their capacity for deep focus, unwavering adherence to facts and logic, profound empathy, and exceptional memory, suggesting these traits offer valuable lessons for leaders. The article passionately refutes Trump's framing of autism as a tragedy, instead emphasizing the pure joy and unique contributions autistic people bring to society, challenging harmful stereotypes.</p>

          <p>This brief article introduces an engaging interactive online tool developed by the BBC, titled "Cooler Than Me?", designed to allow users to compare their local weather forecasts with those of various cities across the world. The tool playfully taps into Britain's traditional inclination to complain about the weather, inviting individuals to discover whether other locations genuinely experience sunnier or more favorable conditions. This feature serves as an entertaining and informative addition to the BBC Weather website, offering a fun way to explore global climate data and become a "star meteorologist."</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are facing significant challenges regarding player health and playoff roster construction as they prepare for their best-of-three wild-card series. Key position players like Max Muncy, Tommy Edman, and Will Smith are battling injuries, casting uncertainty over their availability for the postseason opener. Manager Dave Roberts indicated that the pitching staff, particularly the bullpen, presents the most critical decisions, with numerous relief candidates being evaluated for strategic matchups. The team is also weighing Shohei Ohtani's role, considering whether to deploy him as a pitcher early or save him for a potential Game 3, alongside other difficult choices for the final roster spots.</p>

          <p>Rock Springs, Wyoming, is taking a significant step to acknowledge its violent past by dedicating a new, prominent monument to the 1885 anti-Chinese massacre, where a mob killed 28 Chinese people. This initiative, supported by the mayor and local institutions, represents a turning point in the town's historical narrative, despite the county's simultaneous crackdown on immigration. Grinnell College researchers are actively excavating the former Chinatown site, uncovering artifacts from the "burn layer" to further illuminate the tragic events. Descendants of the massacre victims are actively participating in the commemoration, fostering a deeper understanding and reconciliation of the town's complex migrant history.</p>

          <p>Hairy crab prices in China are experiencing a notable decline ahead of the "super golden week" holiday, with industry insiders predicting further drops due to increased production and weakened consumer demand. Retail prices are down by approximately 20 yuan per kilogram compared to last year, influenced by shrinking gift-giving and cautious household spending. This year's extended holiday, combining National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival, is seen as a crucial litmus test for domestic demand across various sectors, from retail to travel and dining. The early maturation of crabs due to warmer conditions has also contributed to the market situation. (not investment advice)</p>

This evolving dynamic, the article suggests, is not about the US losing soft power but rather an alignment in practical governance approaches, fundamentally reshaping the long-standing ideological divide between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>The UK, France, and Germany have issued a stern warning to Iran, urging it to de-escalate tensions and pursue negotiations after sweeping UN sanctions were reimposed on its nuclear program. The three European nations, known as the E3, stated they had no choice but to trigger the "snapback" procedure due to Iran's "continued nuclear escalation" and lack of cooperation with the IAEA. This diplomatic action comes despite Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian insisting the country has no intention of developing nuclear weapons. In response, Iran has recalled its ambassadors from the E3 countries for consultations, highlighting the deepening diplomatic rift.</p>

European captain Luke Donald acknowledged the challenging atmosphere but lauded his team's ability to remain composed and let their golf performance speak volumes.

This ambitious trial, led by ecologist Nadine Mitschunas and the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, aims to explore future food production strategies and climate change mitigation. Growing rice on re-wetted peat soils could effectively lock away greenhouse gases, offering a potential model for sustainable agriculture and protecting farmer livelihoods in a changing climate. While commercial cultivation is still some time away, the project signals a very real possibility for UK-grown rice to reach dinner plates within the next decade.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with top congressional leaders on Monday, just one day before a critical deadline to fund the federal government and avert a potential shutdown. The high-stakes meeting, involving House Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, and Democratic leaders Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, comes after days of political standoff. Democrats are insisting on key healthcare provisions, including extending Affordable Care Act subsidies and reversing Medicaid cuts, which Republicans have deemed non-starters. This impasse has created significant uncertainty as time rapidly runs out for a bipartisan spending agreement.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve has been suspended for one WNBA playoff game and fined for her aggressive behavior and critical comments towards officials during and after a loss to the Phoenix Mercury. Reeve's actions included verbally abusing an official, delaying her departure after ejection, and making inappropriate remarks to fans and in a post-game press conference. Assistant coaches Eric Thibault and Rebekkah Brunson also received fines for their conduct. Reeve specifically criticized the officiating crew as "fucking malpractice," highlighting ongoing league-wide concerns about referee consistency and the physicality of playoff games, calling for changes at the league level.</p>

          <h2>Venezuela Raises Tensions with US, Maduro Orders Civilian Militia Training for "Undeclared War"</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 19:30:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tensions between Venezuela and the US have significantly escalated, prompting President Nicolás Maduro to order the training of civilian militias for a perceived "undeclared war" following US navy strikes in the South Caribbean. These US operations, described as counter-narcotics, have destroyed boats and resulted in at least 17 fatalities, which Venezuela's defense minister denounced as an act of aggression. The US, which does not recognize Maduro's re-election, has also designated a Venezuelan criminal gang as a terrorist group. Maduro's government is training volunteers, primarily older citizens, to defend against a potential US invasion, though experts question the true scale and intent of any US military action.</p>
