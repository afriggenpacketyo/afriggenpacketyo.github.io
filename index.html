          <p>Missouri Governor Mike Kehoe signed the 'Missouri First' congressional redistricting map into law, a move strongly endorsed by former President Donald Trump, which is expected to secure an additional U.S. House seat for Republicans. This map targets a Democratic-held district, aiming for a 7-1 GOP advantage in the state's House delegation, sparking immediate partisan conflict. Democrats, including Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, have vehemently opposed the plan, accusing Republicans of attempting to rig the maps and vowing legal challenges. This article highlights the intense national battle over redistricting, with similar actions by Republicans in Texas and counter-efforts by Democrats in California, underscoring the high stakes in shaping the political landscape for upcoming midterm elections.</p>

          <p>At least four people died and eight others were injured after a gunman opened fire and set fire to a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan. The suspect, identified as 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, a U.S. Marine and Iraq war veteran, was subsequently shot and killed by police at the scene. Initial reports indicated two fatalities, but two more bodies were later discovered in the charred remains of the church, with authorities suggesting the possibility of additional victims.

          <p>Global oil prices experienced a notable decline amid two significant developments: the resumption of crude exports from Kurdistan and reports indicating that OPEC+ plans to increase its oil output. The return of Kurdistan's oil to the international market adds substantial supply, while a potential hike in production from OPEC+ members signals a broader boost in global oil availability. This dual development suggests a notable shift in market dynamics, potentially leading to lower prices for consumers and impacting energy-dependent economies worldwide. The article indicates a move towards increased supply, which could ease inflationary pressures but poses challenges for oil-producing nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Navigating Challenging Friendships: Strategies for Dealing with 'Energy Vampires'</h2>

          <p>This article offers practical advice on identifying and managing friendships with "energy vampires," individuals who consistently drain emotional energy through excessive complaining, self-absorption, or a constant need for attention. Psychologists and journalists suggest that recognizing how one feels after interactions—often drained or unheard—is a key indicator. Effective strategies include engaging in honest conversations about unmet needs, establishing clear boundaries regarding time spent and topics discussed, and proposing alternative activities that reduce their ability to dominate.

          <p>The Trump administration is seeking an expedited Supreme Court review of an executive order that attempts to unilaterally end birthright citizenship, despite two federal courts having previously blocked its enforcement on different grounds. Solicitor General John Sauer argues that the government possesses a compelling interest in ensuring American citizenship is granted only to those lawfully entitled, and that lower court decisions undermine border security. The order reinterprets the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause to exclude children born in the U.S. to parents without permanent legal status.

Joshua Jahn, identified as the suspect, legally purchased the 8mm bolt-action rifle used in the attack and planned the assault due to a strong animus towards ICE personnel. He fired rounds from a rooftop, injuring three detainees, one fatally, who were inside vans he targeted. The article notes that Jahn utilized apps designed to track ICE agents as part of his planning, and officials attributed a significant increase in assaults on ICE officers to "wild rhetoric."</p>

          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a federal lawsuit to block the deployment of 200 National Guard troops to Portland, asserting that President Trump's description of the city as "war ravaged" is "pure fiction" and his executive action "unlawful." Governor Tina Kotek stated unequivocally that there is no insurrection or public safety threat warranting military intervention, as local law enforcement is capable of managing protests near a federal ICE facility.

          <p>Dana White, CEO of UFC, masterfully transformed the mixed martial arts league from an unprofitable, largely unsanctioned sport into a global phenomenon now valued at over $15 billion. Starting with a $2 million acquisition with friends, White's risk-taking and strong, unapologetic personality were pivotal to its immense growth, including securing early support from Donald Trump. The UFC's reality series "The Ultimate Fighter" and engaging matchups were crucial in building its massive fanbase. This article chronicles White's entrepreneurial journey, the league's significant success, and its navigation of free speech debates within its distinctly masculine brand.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Weight-loss injections, such as Ozempic and Wegovy, are increasingly popular but are inadvertently creating a two-tier health system that disproportionately benefits the wealthy. Despite some NHS prescriptions, stringent restrictions and a "postcode lottery" for eligibility mean thousands of patients are excluded, forcing many to pay privately at significant monthly costs. Recent pharmaceutical price hikes further exacerbate this issue, raising fears that access to effective health solutions could become a luxury. This article explores how these drugs, despite their medical benefits, risk widening existing health inequalities, particularly in deprived areas with higher obesity rates, and examines the broader societal implications of this trend.</p>
