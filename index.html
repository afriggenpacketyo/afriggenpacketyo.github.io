With no clear resolution in sight between Republicans and Democrats, the stalemate continues to affect federal agencies and workers. The core of the disagreement remains over funding for various domestic programs, and recent votes in the Senate have failed to advance any stopgap measures to reopen the government.</p>

          <p>Former Alabama running back Damien Harris commented on the Crimson Tide's recent resurgence after an early-season loss, stating the team has thrived by focusing on its own high standards rather than whether opponents fear them. Harris explained that the team's mentality is to welcome opponents who believe they can win, as it doesn't change Alabama's determination to dominate. He praised the team's five-game winning streak and highlighted quarterback Ty Simpson's performance as a key factor in their success this season.</p>

The initiative aims to improve access for uninsured or underinsured patients by offering the treatment for a $50 cash price, a 70% reduction from its list price. This move comes as the Trump administration continues to pressure pharmaceutical companies to lower drug costs and follows similar direct-to-consumer models launched by other drugmakers.</p>

          <p>At least two survivors from a deadly U.S. military strike in the Caribbean are in American custody after their semi-submersible vessel was attacked. This incident is the sixth such strike against suspected drug smugglers as part of a broader campaign to pressure Venezuela's government. The operation has involved a significant U.S. military buildup in the region, including warships and bombers, drawing condemnation from Venezuelan officials who label the actions as aggressive and threatening.</p>

          <p>President Trump is moving forward with the construction of a new $250 million ballroom at the White House, a project financed entirely by private donors. The administration recently hosted a dinner to thank major contributors from the tech and business sectors for their support. The project has drawn criticism from Democrats, who are introducing legislation to prevent donor names from being displayed on White House structures and to prohibit federally funded construction during government shutdowns.</p>

          <p>California State Senator Scott Wiener, a prominent San Francisco Democrat, has announced his intention to run for the congressional seat currently held by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. While Wiener had previously indicated he would wait for Pelosi to retire, his decision to enter the race was reportedly accelerated by the entry of another progressive candidate. Pelosi, who is 85, has not yet announced if she will seek another term, and her age could be a factor in the upcoming election.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has criticized a decision by local authorities in Birmingham to ban fans of the Israeli soccer team Maccabi Tel Aviv from attending an upcoming match against Aston Villa. Starmer called the move "the wrong decision" and emphasized that antisemitism will not be tolerated. The ban was recommended by a safety advisory group and supported by police, who cited safety concerns and previous incidents of violence involving the team's supporters during a match in Amsterdam.</p>

          <p>Even when a consumer is actively making payments on a delinquent debt, a debt collector may still have the legal right to file a lawsuit. Unless a formal written agreement explicitly prohibits legal action, many repayment plans are considered informal and do not offer protection from being sued. Collectors might pursue a lawsuit to secure a legal judgment, which provides stronger enforcement tools like wage garnishment, especially if the debt is approaching its statute of limitations for collection.</p>

          <p>Small businesses across the U.S. are struggling to absorb the costs of President Trump's tariffs, forcing many to take out high-interest loans, raise prices, and halt hiring. Unlike larger corporations, smaller companies have less leverage to negotiate with suppliers and slimmer margins, making them more vulnerable to the sudden increase in duties. Economists suggest that the difficulties faced by these businesses could be an early warning sign of broader economic challenges to come for larger companies as well.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown continues, Democrats cite a fundamental lack of trust in President Trump as a primary obstacle to forming bipartisan negotiating groups, or "gangs," that have resolved past stalemates. Lawmakers express concern that Trump could undermine or reject any agreement reached, a pattern they have observed in previous legislative battles. This dynamic has prevented the formation of a coalition to find a compromise, particularly on the key Democratic demand of extending Affordable Care Act subsidies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The bodybuilding community is increasingly abandoning the traditional "dirty bulking" method of consuming massive amounts of processed, high-calorie foods in favor of a more moderate "lean bulking" approach. This newer trend involves a smaller caloric surplus from healthier food sources, aligning with modern nutritional science that shows excessive calories are stored as fat and can hinder muscle growth. The shift is driven by both health concerns and a cultural desire to maintain a lean, muscular physique year-round.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released proposals aimed at making in vitro fertilization (IVF) more affordable, but the plan falls far short of the president's campaign pledge to make it free. The new measures include voluntary guidance for employers to offer fertility benefits and discounts on some IVF medications, but they lack any new funding or mandates. The modest proposals have managed to disappoint both fertility advocates, who see little real impact on costs, and some religious conservatives who remain opposed to the procedure itself.</p>

A key piece of advice is to limit total precious metal holdings to no more than 10% of an overall investment portfolio to maintain proper diversification. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A contributor argues that Senate Democrats are pursuing a self-defeating political strategy by prolonging the federal government shutdown over issues like Obamacare subsidies. The article asserts that as a minority party out of power, Democrats have a weak negotiating position and are unlikely to achieve their goals, while risking public blame for the shutdown's consequences. The author suggests the party's focus on unpopular issues like illegal immigration and gender ideology alienates mainstream voters and makes President Trump's political positioning easier.</p>
