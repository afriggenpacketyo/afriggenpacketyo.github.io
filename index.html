          <p>Japan has returned the remains of ten Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to Australia, marking the first such repatriation from Japan. The remains, taken during the 19th and 20th centuries for research, were held by three Japanese institutions. The handover ceremony occurred at the Australian Embassy in Tokyo, and the remains were subsequently flown to Australia. This repatriation is part of a broader global movement to return indigenous remains, addressing past injustices and facilitating healing for affected communities. The return of these remains signifies a shift in international attitudes towards recognizing and rectifying historical wrongs against First Nations people. The return of the remains to country means pathways to healing can start for all generations.</p>

          <p>Sunday's front pages feature diverse stories, including the arrest of a British man in Cyprus suspected of spying for Iran on an RAF base, as reported by the Sunday Telegraph. The Observer leads with the escalating conflict in Iran, noting the US has deployed B-2 stealth bombers to Guam. The Sunday Express focuses on the UK's asylum hotels, reporting the Home Office has not collected Â£50m from firms profiting from housing asylum seekers. The Sunday Times continues to cover the assisted dying bill, highlighting concerns about its impact on the NHS, while the Prince of Wales is celebrated on his birthday by the Sunday Mirror for his environmental efforts. The Daily Star Sunday humorously reports Danny Dyer's belief in extraterrestrial life.</p>

          <p>A powerful storm system, including a tornado, swept through the upper Midwest, resulting in three fatalities in North Dakota. The storm caused widespread damage, including to the Bemidji regional airport, with wind gusts reaching up to 106 mph. Thousands of households lost power, and localized torrential rain led to flooding. Simultaneously, much of the US is under a heat advisory or warning, with nearly 150 million Americans affected. The storm system is expected to move towards upstate New York, posing continued wind and hail threats, and warm, dry conditions have also led to numerous fires in Alaska, prompting evacuations.</p>

          <p>Multiple B-2 stealth bombers were dispatched to Guam as tensions escalate between Iran and the West over Iran's nuclear program. The bombers, currently without further orders, could remain at Andersen Air Force Base for an extended period, but the duration is uncertain. The Trump administration is weighing options regarding Iran, with the president indicating a decision would be made within two weeks. In addition to the bombers, refueling tankers were deployed, fueling speculation about potential military action. Moving these aircraft does not mean that a final decision has been made.</p>

          <p>A member of Palestine Action has denounced the government's plan to proscribe the group as "absurd," arguing it undermines British democracy. The statement follows an incident where activists broke into RAF Brize Norton and sprayed planes with red paint, leading to a security review at military bases. The group defends its actions as necessary to disrupt the supply chain to what they term "genocide," referring to Israel's actions in Gaza, which Israel denies. The government's move has sparked debate, with some condemning the group's actions and others expressing concern over the use of counter-terrorism powers to target protests. The home secretary has the power under UK law to proscribe an organisation under the Terrorism Act 2000 if they believe it is concerned with terrorism.</p>

Sakeik, who has lived in the U.S. since she was eight and is married to a U.S. citizen, has been under an "order of supervision" due to a deportation order issued over a decade ago. Despite being permitted to stay and work in the U.S. under this order, she was detained and faced an attempted deportation to the Israeli border, which was later halted. Her husband and lawyer are working to secure her release, emphasizing her lack of citizenship in any country and the procedural challenges she faces.

Major General Wu Chia-hsing, head of the Taiwanese air force's flight training division, observed the Red Flag Alaska 25-2 exercise, which involved 1,500 personnel and 70 aircraft from the U.S., Japan, South Korea, and other countries. Analysts suggest this move indicates the U.S. commitment to its security obligations in the region, despite potential shifts in U.S. foreign policy.

          <p>The Republican National Committee (RNC) has nearly five times more cash on hand than the Democratic National Committee (DNC), marking the widest disparity between the two parties since at least July 2020. The RNC reported having $72 million at the end of May, compared to the DNC's $15 million. This financial advantage could provide the GOP with an early boost as it prepares for the upcoming midterm elections. Some Democrats express concern that the fundraising gap reflects deeper issues within the party, while the DNC highlights a surge in grassroots support and record individual donations since February. The Republicans' financial advantage comes after a 2024 election cycle during which Tesla founder Elon Musk poured nearly $300 million into helping elect Republicans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Russian government is showing signs of nervousness as the country faces economic challenges, despite official claims of stability. At the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, discussions revealed concerns about the economy teetering "on the brink of recession." While the economy has grown due to state spending on defense, this war-related growth is now slowing. The Kremlin's priority remains winning the war against Ukraine, even if it undermines economic goals. The St Petersburg International Economic Forum was conceived as a shiny showcase for the Russian economy.</p>

Tikhanovskaya expressed joy at her husband's release, while emphasizing that over 1,150 political prisoners remain incarcerated.

President Trump is considering whether the U.S. will militarily intervene in the conflict, as he faces pressure from some world leaders to find a diplomatic solution. The war between Israel and Iran erupted on June 13, with Israeli airstrikes targeting nuclear and military sites, top generals and nuclear scientists.</p>

Boelter is charged with killing Democratic House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, and seriously wounding a state senator and his wife. Authorities found evidence he planned to target others. Police captured Boelter after a two-day manhunt, and his wife told authorities he warned her to flee, indicating preparations for a conflict. The suspect disguised himself as a police officer to gain access to the homes of the two US lawmakers he shot.</p>
