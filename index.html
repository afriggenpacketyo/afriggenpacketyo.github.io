          <p>House Republicans are struggling to secure enough votes for President Trump's extensive domestic policy bill, which includes significant tax cuts and spending on border security and defense, offset by cuts to health care. Despite Trump's strong urging, several GOP members, including moderates and Freedom Caucus conservatives, are holding out due to concerns over Senate changes, particularly deeper Medicaid cuts and the bill's impact on the national debt. Speaker Mike Johnson aims to keep the procedural vote open until he can secure passage by the July 4 deadline. The bill's future remains uncertain as internal party divisions persist.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has strongly criticized President Trump's proposed "One Big Beautiful Bill," warning that its Medicaid cuts and potential work requirements could cause up to 3.4 million Californians to lose Medi-Cal coverage.

Newsom highlighted that such federal funding losses, estimated at over $28 billion, would severely impact California's budget and rural hospitals.

          <p>President Donald Trump's significant tax-cut and spending bill has stalled in the House of Representatives, failing to pass a key procedural vote despite Trump's public pressure. Republican holdouts, including fiscal conservatives and those wary of Medicaid cuts, have prevented the bill from advancing to a final vote. The legislation, which narrowly passed the Senate, proposes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, increased defense and border security spending, and $1.2 trillion in Medicaid cuts, which the CBO estimates could lead to 12 million people losing health insurance.

          <p>Senior UN officials warn that criminal gangs have gained "near-total control" of Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, now controlling an estimated 90% of the city. The gangs are expanding their attacks into previously peaceful areas, exploiting trade routes and establishing parallel governance structures due to the state's shrinking authority. This has paralyzed legal commerce, causing soaring prices for essential goods. The UN highlights a sharp increase in sexual violence and extrajudicial killings by both gangs and vigilante groups. Without increased international support, the total collapse of state presence in the capital is a very real scenario.</p>

          <p>This article argues that Clayton Kershaw, after reaching 3,000 career strikeouts, is the greatest pitcher in Dodgers history, surpassing even Sandy Koufax. The argument centers on Kershaw's remarkable longevity and consistent performance over 18 seasons, outlasting Koufax in various impact categories. While acknowledging Koufax's dominant peak and superior postseason ERA, the article highlights Kershaw's far greater number of playoff appearances, increasing his opportunities for both success and failure. Ultimately, Kershaw's enduring presence, professionalism, and impact on the team's culture solidify his claim as the franchise's greatest.</p>

          <p>A report by His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) found that Manchester City Council's heavy redactions of evidence significantly delayed investigations into historical child sexual exploitation cases. Some provided material was so obscured that its evidential value was impossible to assess, impacting operations like Green Jacket and Bernese. The council stated complex data sharing rules aimed to prevent jeopardizing prosecutions, and a new, more efficient protocol has since been agreed upon with police. This article highlights challenges in inter-agency cooperation for sensitive cases and improvements being made.</p>
