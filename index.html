          <p>Colombian presidential hopeful Miguel Uribe Turbay was shot in the head at a rally in BogotÃ¡, leaving him in critical condition. The attack has been widely condemned as a threat to democracy, with calls for prayers and a swift investigation. A 15-year-old suspect was arrested at the scene with a 9mm Glock-type firearm, and the government has offered a reward for information about those behind the attack. Uribe, a right-wing critic of President Gustavo Petro, had announced his candidacy for the next presidential election and comes from a prominent political family. </p>

          <p>Experts weigh in on the benefits and potential risks of chiropractic care, noting that while it can be helpful for musculoskeletal issues, it's important to consult with a spine specialist for more serious problems. Chiropractors focus on spinal adjustments and musculoskeletal issues, while spine doctors have specialized medical training. Potential benefits of chiropractic care include reduced tension, inflammation, and stress, but caution is advised as treatments for underlying conditions could lead to complications. Choosing a transparent chiropractor with a clear treatment plan and a strong relationship with a spine surgery practice is advised.</p>

          <p>An NPR and PBS Frontline investigation examines why communities struggle to rebuild effectively after disasters, focusing on the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in North Carolina and comparing it to recovery efforts in Houston, New York, and New Jersey. The report highlights the lack of preparedness, inadequate building codes, and conflicting priorities between economic recovery and long-term resilience. It also reveals how powerful forces, including developers and lobbying groups, undermine efforts to build safer communities, often prioritizing profit over safety. The investigation concludes that a lack of comprehensive planning and the influence of special interests contribute to a cycle of vulnerability, leaving communities ill-prepared for future storms.</p>

          <p>Mauricio Pochettino dismissed rumors linking him to the vacant Tottenham Hotspur managerial position, asserting his commitment to his role as the US men's national team manager. Pochettino, who previously managed Spurs from 2014 to 2019, stated that leaving his current position is "not realistic" after the USMNT's 2-1 loss to Turkey. He emphasized his focus on developing the US national team, despite a mixed bag of performances in his first nine months, and downplayed speculation about his potential return to Tottenham.</p>
