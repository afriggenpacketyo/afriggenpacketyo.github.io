          <p>In the second Test at Edgbaston, India is poised for victory over England, leaving the hosts struggling at 72-3 by the end of day four. Indian captain Shubman Gill delivered a masterful performance, scoring 161 runs to follow his first-innings 269, allowing India to declare at 427-6. Facing a near-impossible target of 608, England lost key wickets, including Joe Root, and now must likely play for a draw to maintain their series lead. The outcome on day five will be pivotal for the series, which could be leveled at 1-1 with an Indian win.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts confirm that the distinct, musty scent sometimes associated with older adults is a real biological phenomenon, not just a stigma. The odor is largely caused by the compound 2-nonenal, which is produced as lipids on the skin oxidize and break down over time. This compound is not easily removed by standard hygiene practices due to its fatty composition. While basic health, diet, and certain skincare can help manage the scent, a sudden and significant change in body odor could also be a warning sign of underlying health issues like dementia or cancer.</p>

          <p>The Madre Fire in rural San Luis Obispo County has become California's largest wildfire of 2025, scorching nearly 80,000 acres. The blaze, which is only 10% contained, has prompted mandatory evacuation orders for over 200 people and threatens about 50 structures. More than 600 firefighters are battling the fire, which is fueled by high heat and wind, with its cause currently under investigation. The fire poses a significant threat to the Carrizo Plain National Monument, an area home to several endangered species, as Southern California braces for an upcoming heat wave.</p>

          <p>Two American aid workers with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) were injured in a grenade attack at a food distribution site in Khan Younis. The GHF claimed Hamas was responsible but did not provide evidence for the assertion. The incident occurred as Israeli airstrikes reportedly killed 14 people in the Gaza Strip, including a doctor and his three children. These events unfold as ceasefire negotiations appear to be advancing, with Hamas giving a positive response to a U.S.-backed proposal for a 60-day truce, though further talks are required.</p>

          <p>Local officials in Texas's Kerr County admitted they were caught off guard by deadly flash floods that struck overnight, causing the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes. Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly stated there was no warning system on the river and officials had no reason to believe the rainfall would be so catastrophic. The National Weather Service did issue a flash flood warning around 1:14 a.m., but the rapid and historic rise of the river occurred while many residents were asleep.

The article explains that the system primarily taxes wages and realized income, not the appreciation of assets like stocks, which constitutes the bulk of billionaires' wealth. Strategies such as "buy-borrow-die" allow the ultra-wealthy to live off tax-free loans against their assets. Taxing wealth growth at rates similar to middle-class income could generate hundreds of billions in additional annual revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

While some showed sympathy for the pressures of governing, many were worried by the party's frequent U-turns on policy, viewing them as a sign of weakness and lack of direction.

          <h2>The Rise of 'Tipflation': Digital Payments Fuel Customer Confusion and Pressure</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing prevalence of digital payment systems with pre-set tipping options is causing confusion and frustration for consumers, a phenomenon dubbed 'tipflation.' While tipping was once reserved for specific service roles, customers are now prompted to tip in a wide range of situations, including at self-service kiosks and fast-food counters. Marketing professors note that this trend, accelerated during the pandemic, pressures customers to tip out of social obligation or guilt. Experts advise consumers to understand local norms and not feel pressured by technology designed to encourage higher and more frequent tipping.</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. military strikes against Iran could reinforce North Korea's belief that a strong nuclear arsenal is essential for regime survival, according to security analysts. Experts suggest that Pyongyang may view the U.S. action as evidence that President Trump is an unpredictable and untrustworthy negotiating partner. This perception is likely to push North Korea to further develop and disperse its nuclear capabilities, prioritizing a second-strike ability. Consequently, any remaining possibility of North Korean denuclearization is expected to diminish, as the regime sees nuclear weapons as its ultimate security guarantee.</p>

          <p>England and Wales have been drawn into what is being called the toughest group of the Women's Euro 2025 tournament, alongside top-ranked teams France and the Netherlands. This grouping means three of the four teams are ranked in the top 11 globally, presenting a significant challenge for both home nations. Defending champions England will need to be sharp from the start, while debutants Wales, the lowest-ranked team, will embrace their underdog status. Analysts suggest there is a real possibility that both England and Wales could be eliminated before they even face each other in their final group stage match.</p>

          <p>A so-called 'cortisol cocktail' has gone viral on social media, with proponents claiming the non-alcoholic drink can lower the body's primary stress hormone. The beverage typically includes ingredients like coconut water, orange juice, magnesium powder, and sea salt. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence that this combination can meaningfully reduce cortisol levels. While the drink is likely harmless for most and can aid hydration, doctors emphasize that proven stress-reduction techniques like quality sleep, exercise, and social connection are far more effective for managing stress.</p>

          <p>A long-lost prototype of a Chinese typewriter from the 1940s, invented by linguist Lin Yutang, has been rediscovered, exciting scholars in the U.S. and Asia. The machine, called the MingKwai, is considered a crucial part of the origin story of modern Chinese computing. Its ingenious design broke down complex Chinese characters by their shapes rather than sounds, a concept that underlies how Chinese, Japanese, and Korean are typed today. The typewriter's discovery highlights a pivotal moment in preserving the Chinese language for the digital age, representing a globalist vision that married Eastern culture with Western technology.</p>

The reopening follows a massive $1.5 billion cleanup project, tied to last year's Olympics, which has successfully brought the river's water quality up to European standards on most days. On Saturday, Parisians eagerly lined up to take a plunge in designated swimming areas near the Eiffel Tower, a move celebrated by Mayor Anne Hidalgo as the fulfillment of a 'childhood dream.'

The billionaire, who previously supported Trump's 2024 campaign, has become a vocal critic of the administration's spending, threatening to challenge incumbents who supported the bill.</p>

The Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Area features hundreds of buildings, including high-rise hotels and a water park, designed to accommodate 20,000 guests. Despite leader Kim Jong Un's ambition to create a 'world destination,' it remains unclear if the resort will be open to most foreign tourists. For now, access appears limited to domestic visitors and small, curated groups from Russia, reflecting the nation's ongoing isolation.</p>

Some analysts suggest the absence signals domestic power struggles or growing friction with fellow BRICS members like India. Others contend it shows confidence in China's dominance, allowing Xi to delegate his attendance while still advancing his agenda within the expanding, yet fragmented, alliance.</p>

          <p>An Arizona couple was fined $4,000 by their property management company after posting negative online reviews about their rental experience, which included issues like black mold. A clause in their lease prohibited reviews rated less than three stars, a practice that is illegal under the 2016 Consumer Review Fairness Act (CRFA). The federal law protects consumers from retaliation for honest feedback, making such 'gag clauses' in contracts unenforceable. After a local news station investigated, the real estate company said it would remove the clause, but the case highlights a widespread issue of companies attempting to silence customer criticism.</p>

This 'time tax' is projected to cause nearly 12 million Americans to lose their health insurance, even if they are technically eligible for it.

          <p>Former Google X executive and happiness researcher Mo Gawdat advocates for a '90-second rule' to better manage anger and stress. The concept is based on neuroscientific findings that the physiological response to anger, involving hormones like cortisol, lasts only about 90 seconds. After this initial period, any continued feeling of anger is a conscious or unconscious choice to rerun the triggering thought. By allowing oneself this brief window to feel the emotion and then consciously choosing to move on, individuals can prevent rumination and recover more quickly from life's daily upsets.</p>

The offender simply had to pay for the stolen goods and was banned from the shop, a result Mr. Board feels sends the wrong signal and fails to deter future crime.
