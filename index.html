          <p>President Trump has received briefings regarding the potential benefits and risks associated with bombing Iran's Fordo nuclear facility, a site considered highly secure, as a means to prevent weapon production. Sources indicate that Trump believes decisive action is necessary and that destroying Fordo is the only viable option, although he has not made a final decision. He is reportedly open to U.S. involvement in a strike if necessary, while also considering the possibility of Iran disabling the facility independently. Diplomatic efforts are underway, with U.K. officials engaging with Secretary of State Rubio to explore de-escalation strategies, while EU officials plan to meet with the Iranian foreign minister. Optimism about the situation is relatively low due to the potential for escalation and the complex geopolitical dynamics at play.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erick, the Eastern Pacific season's fifth named storm, made landfall in Oaxaca, Mexico, as a Category 3 hurricane, later downgraded to Category 1. Despite the downgrade, authorities warn of life-threatening flooding and mudslides due to the storm's strong winds and heavy rain. The storm is expected to produce 8 to 12 inches of rain, with some areas seeing up to 16 inches, especially in steep terrain, and dangerous storm surge could cause coastal flooding. Acapulco, previously devastated by Hurricane Otis in 2023, is among the areas facing potential impacts, and residents are urged to take precautions. The hurricane's rapid weakening is expected to continue, with dissipation likely by tonight.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is addressing the fallout from federal immigration raids in the city, which have sparked protests and economic concerns. Bass, a former community organizer, has denounced the Trump administration's actions as chaotic and has emphasized the importance of immigrants to Los Angeles' identity. She is working to ensure the safety of immigrant residents and has criticized the portrayal of Los Angeles as a war zone. The mayor is also grappling with the economic impact of the raids, as many immigrants are afraid to go to work, and is urging residents to support local businesses. Bass's leadership is being tested as she navigates this crisis, while also addressing ongoing issues such as homelessness and economic challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's renewed focus on workplace immigration enforcement could significantly impact industries that heavily rely on undocumented workers, including farming, hospitality, construction, and manufacturing. While the White House argues that these workers drive down wages, industry leaders warn that large-scale deportations could disrupt operations and increase food prices. Undocumented workers comprise a substantial portion of the workforce in several states, including California, Texas, and Nevada, and some restaurants are already experiencing staffing issues due to workers' fear of deportation. Research suggests that deportation can lead to fewer jobs for native-born workers and could negatively impact U.S. GDP. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 12-year-old girl sustained injuries after encountering an alligator while swimming in Lake Waccamaw, North Carolina. The girl yelled, "Something bit me!" and the other children were immediately rushed out of the water, at which point an alligator surfaced. The injuries were serious but not life-threatening, and the alligator, a 12-foot male, was subsequently euthanized according to NCWRC protocol. Officials remind residents and visitors to remain vigilant and aware of their surroundings, respecting the water and understanding that these animals are not tame or pets, and to maintain a safe distance if one is sighted.</p>

The slide and flood occurred near mile marker 450 in Tennessee, west of the North Carolina state line, and crews are working to clear the highway. The affected section is part of a 12-mile stretch that was heavily damaged during Hurricane Helene in September, and while temporary repairs had allowed for one lane in each direction, the area remains vulnerable. A permanent fix, involving steel rods and concrete, is expected to take years, and the closure creates significant detours for travelers.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released new guidance for evaluating oil and gas project applications, requiring operators to assess emissions from burning oil and gas, not just production emissions. This move follows a Supreme Court ruling and will impact decisions on controversial Scottish fields like Rosebank and Jackdaw. Climate campaigners argue that new developments will barely affect the UK's reliance on imported fossil fuels, and the climate watchdog and regulator had paused decisions on licenses until the government clarified its position. The Energy Secretary will reconsider whether to grant consent, taking downstream emissions into account, with decisions expected by the end of the summer.</p>

Reports indicate that the Attorney General has raised concerns about the legality of Israel's actions, potentially restricting the government's ability to support any US intervention, and the Liberal Democrat leader is calling for any legal advice to be published.

The IMCP, excluding the United States, officially launched at a forum in Chengdu, with several international organizations and research institutes joining the initiative.

          <p>New research indicates that offsetting emissions from the world's 200 largest oil and gas companies would require planting a forest the size of North America. The study analyzes the economic and ecological challenges of afforestation as a means of balancing carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuel reserves. Researchers found that the land use and financial requirements for such a project are unrealistic, costing trillions of dollars and displacing infrastructure and agriculture. The findings suggest that relying solely on offsetting is not a viable solution and that reducing fossil fuel extraction is essential for meeting climate goals.</p>

          <p>Honda is recalling nearly 260,000 vehicles in the U.S. due to a potential brake pedal defect where the pivot pin was not properly staked during production. The recall affects Acura TLX (2021-2025), Acura MDX (2023-2025), and Honda Pilot (2023-2025) models. The defect could cause the brake pedal to move side to side, potentially preventing motorists from safely stopping, and affected vehicles will display a warning light and an abnormal pedal feeling. Owners of the recalled vehicles will be contacted and instructed to take their vehicles to a dealer for brake pedal replacement, if necessary.</p>

The Kremlin has warned that U.S. intervention would trigger a terrible spiral of escalation, while Germany's Chancellor Merz said Israel was doing the dirty work for other countries by striking Iran's nuclear sites. Foreign ministers from Germany, France, and the U.K. are scheduled to meet with their Iranian counterpart, but chances at diplomacy appear increasingly bleak.</p>

The report found that almost Â£40 million of ringfenced money had been spent elsewhere, and there was a lack of action to address a fall in international student recruitment.

          <p>Juneteenth, a federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the United States, derives its name from a portmanteau of June and nineteenth, the date in 1865 when enslaved people in Texas were informed of their freedom. President Abraham Lincoln had signed the Emancipation Proclamation more than two years earlier, but its implementation in Confederate territory was delayed until the Union Army's arrival. The holiday's recognition reflects a growing acknowledgment of emancipation as a critical turning point in U.S. history, and communities celebrate with parades, parties, and cultural events.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid forward Kylian Mbappe has been hospitalized with gastroenteritis, causing him to miss the Club World Cup opener against Al-Hilal. The France captain had been experiencing a fever and missed training before being admitted to the hospital for tests. Gastroenteritis is an infection in the gut that can cause vomiting and diarrhea, and Mbappe's condition has sidelined him for the team's upcoming game against Pachuca. The team is hoping for a speedy recovery for the athlete.</p>
