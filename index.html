          <p>In the second Test at Edgbaston, England's Jamie Smith scored a remarkable 184 not out, leading a significant fightback with a 303-run partnership with Harry Brook. Despite their efforts, India's bowlers, led by Mohammed Siraj, dismantled England's lower order, securing a substantial first-innings lead of 180. As the match heads into its final days, India has extended its overall advantage to 244, remaining in a dominant position. The stage is set for a potentially memorable conclusion, testing England's renowned chasing abilities.</p>

          <p>A multi-story building collapse in Karachi's impoverished Lyari neighborhood has resulted in at least seven deaths, with rescue workers searching for more survivors believed to be trapped in the rubble. Authorities suspect dozens more may be inside the building, which reportedly housed up to 100 people. Rescue operations are severely hampered by the area's narrow streets, which prevent heavy machinery from accessing the site. This tragedy highlights the ongoing issue of lax construction laws and oversight in Pakistan, where such incidents are tragically frequent.</p>

          <p>Members of the UK's House of Lords have strongly criticized the government's refusal to resentence prisoners held under the abolished Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP) scheme. Peers labeled the situation, where over 2,500 individuals remain incarcerated indefinitely, a major "miscarriage of justice" comparable to other national scandals. Despite impassioned pleas and a bill aimed at reform, the prisons minister maintained the government's stance, prioritizing public protection over resentencing and offering little hope to those trapped in the system.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton expressed confidence for the British Grand Prix weekend after a competitive Friday practice session where his Ferrari challenged the leading McLaren cars. McLaren's Lando Norris set the fastest time at Silverstone, but Hamilton was close behind, suggesting a tight battle is ahead. Despite upgrades from rivals, Hamilton feels he is progressing well with the car and can "dream of a strong weekend." The potential for rain on race day could introduce an additional layer of unpredictability to the competition.</p>

          <p>UK Member of Parliament Zarah Sultana announced she is leaving the Labour Party to launch a new political party with former leader Jeremy Corbyn, a move that appeared to catch Corbyn by surprise. While Corbyn welcomed her decision, his statement indicated that discussions for a new party are still in early stages and its foundations are not yet established. The potential new left-wing party aims to capture a segment of the electorate to the left of Keir Starmer's Labour, which polling suggests could significantly impact the Green Party's support base.</p>

          <p>The UK Attorney General's Office has referred the seven-year sentence of a 15-year-old boy who killed an 80-year-old man to the Court of Appeal, citing concerns that it may be unduly lenient. The teenager was convicted of manslaughter for the racially-aggravated attack on Bhim Kohli in a park in 2023. The victim's family and local politicians have expressed outrage over the sentence's length, arguing it fails to deliver justice and prompting the official review.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched its most extensive aerial assault on Kyiv since the war began, killing at least one person and causing widespread damage across the Ukrainian capital. The attack occurred shortly after President Trump held separate, high-stakes phone calls with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump reported making "no progress" with Putin, while Zelenskyy described his own call as "very important" for bolstering Ukraine's air defenses amid Russia's escalating bombardment.</p>

          <p>The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a class-action lawsuit alleging that U.S. immigration agents in Southern California are conducting unconstitutional raids based on racial profiling. The lawsuit claims that agents are targeting people based on their Latino appearance and their presence in certain locations, arresting them without the required reasonable suspicion of an immigration violation. While the Department of Homeland Security denies the claims, advocates argue that aggressive arrest quotas are pressuring agents to violate constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is poised to sign his administration's landmark policy package into law after it narrowly passed through Congress. The comprehensive bill extends many of his first-term tax cuts, significantly boosts defense spending, allocates over $100 billion to immigration enforcement, and implements deep cuts to Medicaid. The White House promotes the bill as a driver of economic growth, but it has faced staunch opposition from Democrats and criticism from some Republicans over its impact on the national debt and its benefits for the wealthy.</p>

          <p>Two brothers are currently on trial, accused of using a "high level of violence" in an assault on police officers at Manchester Airport in July 2024. The altercation reportedly began when the brothers confronted and attacked another man inside a Starbucks cafe. When police later attempted to arrest one of the brothers in a car park, they allegedly resisted and assaulted three officers, leaving one with a broken nose. The defendants have denied the charges, asserting that they were acting in self-defense.</p>

          <p>In a promising effort to combat the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems, scientists are transplanting crossbred coral fragments onto a reef in Miami. The project uses a hybrid of Florida and Honduran Elkhorn corals, with the Honduran specimens chosen from a naturally warmer environment. The goal is to cultivate a more thermally tolerant coral population that can better withstand the rising ocean temperatures that have caused devastating bleaching events. This innovative international collaboration offers a new strategy for reef restoration.</p>

          <p>A senior Chinese diplomat reportedly told an EU official in a private meeting that Beijing cannot accept a Russian defeat in Ukraine, fearing it would allow the United States to focus its full attention on its rivalry with China. This private admission, as reported by an official briefed on the discussion, contrasts sharply with China's public position of neutrality in the conflict. When questioned, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson reiterated the country's official stance, calling for a peaceful political settlement and stating that a prolonged crisis serves no one's interests.</p>

While this spending spree is causing a boom for arms manufacturers like Rheinmetall, economists are skeptical about its broader economic benefits.
