          <p>President Trump's renewed criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell led to a slide in US stocks and a weakening dollar. Trump called Powell a "major loser" for not preemptively cutting interest rates to boost the economy, adding to market turmoil already fueled by tariff concerns. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all experienced significant drops, while gold prices surged as investors sought safe-haven assets. This situation raises concerns about the Fed's independence and potential economic slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>
