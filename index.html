          <p>The United Kingdom is beginning talks to establish overseas "return hubs" for asylum seekers whose claims have been rejected in the UK, according to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. This announcement was made during Starmer's first official visit to Albania, where he also outlined additional measures to combat organized crime and illegal immigration. The proposed hubs would house individuals who have exhausted the UK's asylum system and have no further avenues for appeal, though the specific countries involved in these discussions have not been disclosed. Starmer emphasized that these return hubs are not a singular solution but a component of a broader strategy to address people smuggling and Channel crossings.</p>

          <p>Representatives from Ukraine and Russia convened in Istanbul for their first direct meeting since the early stages of the conflict in 2022, although Russian President Vladimir Putin did not attend despite an invitation from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The return to Istanbul is notable because the city hosted peace negotiations in March 2022, which resulted in the Istanbul Communiqué, outlining a potential peace agreement. While President Trump has expressed optimism about the talks and hinted at a possible visit to Istanbul, analysts remain cautious about the prospects for an immediate breakthrough. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized the need for a diplomatic solution to end the conflict and the importance of building rather than destroying.</p>

          <p>China has launched the initial satellites for its space computing constellation, a project by Zhejiang Lab that aims to create a system rivaling ground-based supercomputers. The Three-Body Computing Constellation will support real-time, in-orbit data processing with a computing capacity of 1,000 peta operations per second. Experts suggest that orbital data centers could leverage solar power and radiate heat into space, reducing energy consumption and environmental impact. This initiative positions China alongside the United States and Europe in the future deployment of space-based computing infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's shares experienced a 5% drop after the Chinese e-commerce giant reported lower-than-expected earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter, with revenue at 236.5 billion yuan versus an expected 237.2 billion yuan and net income at 12.4 billion yuan compared to an expected 24.7 billion yuan. Despite the earnings miss, revenue increased by 7% year-on-year, and net income rose by 279% from a low base. The company is navigating macroeconomic volatility and trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, while also facing intense competition in China's e-commerce market.

          <p>Following the end of the civil war in December 2024, Syrians are beginning to return to their native cities, such as Homs, facing the challenge of rebuilding their lives and homes after years of displacement. The lifting of US sanctions on Syria has brought new hope for economic revival and international banking access, although the task of resettling millions of displaced people remains significant. Many returning families find their homes destroyed and essential services lacking, highlighting the need for comprehensive resettlement plans and job creation initiatives. While some, like carpenter Yasir al-Nagdali, have managed to restore their homes, others face insurmountable obstacles, underscoring the long road to recovery for the war-torn nation.</p>

          <p>Germany is supporting U.S. President Donald Trump's push to increase the defense spending target of NATO members to 5% of their gross domestic product, according to German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul.

          <p>Shares of Ubisoft experienced an 18% decline after the French video game firm reported full-year earnings that fell short of investor expectations. Net bookings for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025, decreased by 20.5%, despite the release of the latest "Assassin's Creed" game, "Assassin's Creed: Shadows". The company cited lower-than-expected partnerships as a reason for the decline, with net bookings totaling 1.85 billion euros. Ubisoft's outlook for the fiscal year 2025-26 also failed to impress, as the firm anticipates stable net bookings year-on-year and expects to break even on a non-IFRS operating income basis.</p>

The proposed cuts to the University of California dropped from $397 million to $130 million, and for California State University, the cut went from $375 million to $144 million. Despite the reduced cuts, both systems still face budget challenges exacerbated by potential federal disinvestment in higher education.
