        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in was indicted on bribery charges related to his former son-in-law's employment at a Thai airline. Prosecutors allege the employment was a quid pro quo, with the airline CEO receiving a position in a state-funded agency in return.  The indictment follows a pattern of South Korean ex-leaders facing criminal investigations, highlighting the country's complex political landscape and the often-politicized nature of its prosecution service. The former son-in-law received substantial salary and housing allowances, which prosecutors consider a bribe.</p>

          <p>Concerns are growing about a potential US recession, fueled by Trump's tariffs and economic indicators.  An inverted yield curve, declining consumer and business confidence, and prediction markets all point to increased recession probabilities.

          <p>Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the state's Republican congressional delegation are urging President Trump to reconsider FEMA's denial of disaster relief following severe storms.  The denial follows similar denials to other states, but this marks the first time Republicans have publicly opposed FEMA's decision.  The request for relief was made following significant damage and loss of life. The letter highlights the need for federal assistance in the rebuilding process.</p>
