          <p>Doctors are expressing growing concern that the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in hospitals is deterring immigrants from seeking necessary medical care. Health professionals report that some patients delay critical treatment for conditions like heart attacks and strokes due to fear of raids. The article highlights alleged ethics violations by agents, such as failing to show identification and infringing on patient privacy, creating a climate of fear that impacts community health. Hospitals are now providing staff with guidance on how to handle encounters with federal law enforcement to protect patient rights.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in Central Texas have led to a confirmed death toll of over 100, with more than 160 people still reported missing in Kerr County alone. The disaster, caused by the rapid swelling of the Guadalupe River, prompted a federal disaster declaration to support ongoing rescue and recovery operations. The area around Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp, was hit particularly hard, accounting for a significant number of the fatalities. Scrutiny has fallen on the adequacy of weather warnings and emergency alert systems in the flood-prone region.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered the severed bow of the USS New Orleans, a famed U.S. warship, on the seafloor of the Solomon Islands' Iron Bottom Sound. The bow was torn off by a Japanese torpedo during the 1942 Battle of Tassafaronga, an event that killed over 180 crew members. Despite the catastrophic damage, the crew's heroic efforts kept the ship afloat, allowing it to sail to Australia for repairs and eventually be fitted with a new bow. The discovery offers a poignant reminder of the crew's sacrifice and resilience during one of the U.S. Navy's most challenging nights in WWII.</p>

          <p>Officials in Yolo County, California, have confirmed that the remains of all seven workers missing after a massive explosion at a fireworks warehouse have been found. The fatal blast occurred at a facility that was reportedly not permitted to store fireworks, destroying several structures and sparking a large grass fire. The investigation, involving state and federal agencies like the ATF, is now transitioning to a law enforcement-based incident. The families of the victims, some of whom lost multiple relatives, have hired an attorney and are calling for justice.</p>

          <p>Mandonna Kashanian, an Iranian woman who has lived in the U.S. for 47 years without legal status, has been released from ICE detention following a sudden arrest at her New Orleans home.

Although she had previously been denied asylum and permanent residency, a judge had allowed her to remain in the country under supervision. Her release marks a positive turn in a case that highlighted fears amid a nationwide immigration crackdown.</p>

          <p>According to this review, director James Gunn's 'Superman' reboot presents a hero who, while earnest and good-hearted, comes across as obtuse and overwhelmed rather than simply naive. The film pivots away from cynicism with a pop-punk energy, but the main character, played by David Corenswet, can feel personality-deficient and dazed. While the plot is described as impatient but entertaining, the movie's tone is seen as recklessly shape-shifting. The critic notes that the script is more confident with its side characters and silly gags than with moments of sincere emotion.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the progressive debate over social welfare policy, prompted by recent cuts to means-tested programs like Medicaid. It challenges the common argument that universal programs such as Social Security are inherently more politically durable than those targeted by income. The author points to the historical record, which shows significant growth in means-tested benefits over the past 50 years, alongside cuts to some universal programs like unemployment insurance. The piece suggests a program's resilience may have more to do with benefiting the elderly than its universal nature.</p>

          <p>Consumers and restaurants are facing searingly high beef prices, which reached a record $5.98 per pound in May, the highest since tracking began in the 1980s. The price surge is attributed to basic economics: strong, robust consumer demand is clashing with a shrinking supply of cattle. The U.S. cattle herd is at its smallest size since the 1960s, a decline largely driven by severe drought conditions in recent years that forced ranchers to sell off their stock. Experts predict prices will remain elevated for the next several years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Disneyland has announced the annual temporary closure of its popular Haunted Mansion attraction, beginning August 11. This brief, expected downtime allows the park to transform the ride into its "Haunted Mansion Holiday" overlay, a popular seasonal makeover inspired by Tim Burton's "The Nightmare Before Christmas." The attraction is scheduled to reopen on August 22, just in time for the start of the Halloween season at the resort. Officials noted this is a standard procedure that guests anticipate each year.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled against several non-profit organizations that sued the Trump administration for rescinding hundreds of millions of dollars in grant funding for crime prevention programs. In his opinion, Judge Amit P. Mehta described the administration's decision to cut funding for groups tackling gun violence and hate crimes as "shameful" and likely to harm vulnerable communities. However, the judge concluded that he did not have the legal authority to issue an injunction to block the administration's action and restore the funds.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This review argues that the new 'Superman' film is a brilliant and consciously sincere take on the character, successfully defining his uniqueness by placing him in a world already populated with other superheroes. Director James Gunn's approach moves away from grim origin stories to a lighthearted, whimsical tone reminiscent of Saturday-morning cartoons. The film cleverly incorporates modern skepticism about pure altruism into its narrative, as other characters constantly question Superman's motives. This makes his inherent goodness stand out in a world that struggles to accept it.</p>

          <p>The British Parliament has voted to pass the Football Governance Bill, a landmark piece of legislation that will establish an independent regulator to oversee the top five divisions of men's football in England. Reintroduced by the new Labour government, the bill is designed to protect clubs by ensuring their financial sustainability and to place the interests of fans at the heart of the game. The move was praised by football campaign groups as a historic step toward a fairer and more sustainable future for the sport.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis of where a $20,000 deposit can earn more interest: a certificate of deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account. Based on current rates, short-term CDs with terms of three to twelve months offer a slightly higher return than a typical high-yield savings account. However, for longer terms like 18 or 24 months, the high-yield savings account could potentially earn more, assuming its variable rate remains static. The choice ultimately depends on the saver's preference for a fixed return versus liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The discourse surrounding artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly radicalized, creating two opposing camps with little middle ground. On one side, AI zealots and tech executives evangelize the technology's inevitable and revolutionary potential, while on the other, skeptics dismiss it as an overhyped and useless "con." This article argues that the polarization into these parallel universes of belief and atheism obscures the necessary, nuanced discussions about AI's immediate, real-world effects on jobs, education, and society. The extreme rhetoric distracts from a more grounded analysis of the technology's actual capabilities and limitations.</p>

The administration's shifting plans and deadlines have created confusion, with Trump vowing no extensions for a separate wave of tariffs beyond August 1, just a day after his administration had changed the date.
