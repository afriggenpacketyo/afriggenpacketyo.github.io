          <p>Chris Eubank Jr. defeated Conor Benn in a closely contested boxing match at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, marking the culmination of a rivalry steeped in history and drama. The fight gained additional emotional weight with the unexpected arrival of Chris Eubank Sr., who had been estranged from his son for years, his presence seemingly providing his son with a psychological advantage. Benn, gracious in defeat, acknowledged the significance of family relationships, stating that the reconciliation between Eubank Jr. and his father was more valuable than any boxing victory. The fight's aftermath raises questions about a potential rematch or moving on from this family-fueled saga.</p>

          <p>The European pharmaceutical industry is bracing for potential disruptions as President Trump threatens to impose higher tariffs on pharmaceuticals. This move could significantly impact the flow of drugs, including insulin, heart treatments, and cancer medications, from the EU to the US. Pharmaceutical products are the bloc's top export to America, and tariffs could lead to higher prices and uncertain consequences for both manufacturers and consumers.</p>

          <p>Australia is considering imposing caps on the number of international students as a measure to address its housing affordability crisis. Politicians argue that limiting international student intake will reduce demand for rentals and ease pressure on housing prices. This shift represents a significant change for Australia, which has historically viewed international education as a major economic driver. Critics worry that such measures could negatively impact the country's economy and reputation as a welcoming destination for overseas students.</p>
