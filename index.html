        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Slate Automotive, a company supported by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a new electric pickup truck designed for affordability and customization. The vehicle's base model is intentionally spare to keep the starting price low, with the company planning to sell over 100 accessories and allow for "open source" third-party add-ons. This strategy targets a key barrier to EV adoption, which is high sticker prices, especially as federal incentives are being rolled back. However, analysts question its competitiveness as the price without tax credits nears $30,000, a bracket with many established models.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration and Washington D.C. officials have reached an agreement to curtail the federal government's recent takeover of the city's police force. The deal ensures that the Metropolitan Police Department remains under the command of its current chief, Pamela Smith, rather than a federally appointed administrator. This resolution followed a lawsuit filed by the D.C. attorney general, who called the move a "hostile takeover" and argued it exceeded the president's authority under the Home Rule Act. A federal judge had indicated she would likely grant a restraining order against the administration if no agreement was reached.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to the Trump administration's move to federalize Washington D.C.'s police force, leading House Democrats have introduced a joint resolution to end the takeover. Citing the Home Rule Act of 1973, the lawmakers argue that the president has not demonstrated the "special emergency conditions" required for such an action. The resolution's sponsors accuse the administration of fabricating a crisis and pushing a misleading narrative about crime rates in the city to justify its actions. This legislative effort aims to restore local control and challenge what they describe as an unprecedented and lawless overreach of executive power.</p>

          <p>Popular gaming platform Roblox is confronting a series of new lawsuits claiming it has failed to protect children from sexual predators and inappropriate content. One recent complaint details an incident where a 10-year-old was allegedly exploited by an adult posing as a child on the platform. The lawsuits argue that Roblox prioritizes profits over user safety and misrepresents its platform as a safe environment for kids. In response, Roblox has stated that it has implemented rigorous safeguards and is using AI to detect child endangerment, while critics, including a Louisiana Attorney General, continue to apply legal and political pressure.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence leader OpenAI is reportedly in early-stage discussions to sell approximately $6 billion in stock, a move that would value the company at around $500 billion. The secondary sale would allow current and former employees to sell shares to investors, including existing backers like SoftBank and Thrive Capital. This potential valuation marks a significant increase from its $300 billion valuation earlier in the year, reflecting immense investor confidence following the launch of ChatGPT and its new GPT-5 model. The rapid growth underscores the intense demand and high stakes within the generative AI industry. (not investment advice)</p>

This follows a separate, larger data breach disclosed last month, raising further concerns about the security of sensitive data for individuals who fled the Taliban. The government has stated that there is no evidence the data has been released publicly and that the incident posed no immediate threat to individuals' safety.</p>

The investment from the highly respected Buffett, along with new positions from other notable investors, is being interpreted as a major vote of confidence.

          <p>A new working paper from the U.S. Census Bureau reveals a significant decline in young adults aged 25 to 34 achieving key life milestones traditionally associated with adulthood. Compared to previous generations, fewer are moving out of their parents' homes, securing jobs, getting married, and having children. The report attributes this shift to increased economic barriers, such as the rising cost of living, and changing societal attitudes toward family formation. Economic stability is now often seen as a prerequisite for marriage, which is increasingly viewed as a "capstone of adulthood" rather than a foundational step.</p>

          <p>After a six-month pause and a legal challenge from over a dozen states, the Trump administration is resuming a federal program to fund high-speed electric vehicle chargers along highways. The Department of Transportation has released new guidance to unfreeze the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program funds, which President Trump had previously criticized as wasteful. However, the new rules strip several Biden-era requirements, such as considerations for rural and underserved communities and labor standards. While EV advocates and states welcome the restart, they express frustration over the lengthy and disruptive delay in deploying the congressionally approved funding.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes a recent social media trend where TikTok videos of sorority recruitment dances are being reposted on X with captions claiming they enrage liberals. Commentators suggest these posts, which frame the videos as displays of "patriotism" or traditional values, are part of a manufactured culture war designed to generate engagement. The author finds no evidence of the purported liberal outrage, arguing that engagement-farming accounts are simply using the videos to pander to a right-leaning audience on X. The phenomenon is presented as a story about social media mechanics rather than a genuine political divide.</p>

          <p>The market for technology initial public offerings (IPOs) is showing strong signs of revival after a three-year slowdown caused by inflation and high interest rates. Recent successful debuts, such as the cryptocurrency exchange Bullish and design software firm Figma, have seen their stock prices surge on their first day of trading. This renewed investor appetite is clearing a backlog of high-value private companies preparing to go public. While the enthusiasm is palpable, some analysts caution that the market could be overheating, drawing comparisons to the dot-com era. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a government intervention in the struggling chipmaker Intel, potentially by taking a direct ownership stake in the company. The news comes as President Trump advocates for increasing domestic manufacturing of high-end technology to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers like TSMC and Samsung. Technology analysts argue that such a move, while unusual, may be essential for national security, ensuring the U.S. maintains a competitive edge in critical semiconductor technology. The administration has reportedly discussed using funds from the CHIPS Act to structure the potential investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials dropped 14% after the company issued a weak financial forecast, citing growing uncertainty and reduced demand from its business in China. The company's revenue and earnings projections for the upcoming quarter fell significantly short of analyst expectations. CEO Gary Dickerson attributed the downturn to macroeconomic pressures and trade issues, noting that Chinese clients are scaling back spending after a period of rapid expansion. Despite the poor outlook, the company's results for the previous quarter exceeded estimates, but the guidance has prompted downgrades from market analysts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has lifted a lower court's block on the Trump administration's plan to conduct mass firings at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). In a split decision, the court ruled that the district court lacked jurisdiction to prevent the layoffs of 1,500 of the agency's 1,700 employees. The ruling is temporarily stayed to allow for an appeal, but it marks a significant development in the administration's effort to overhaul the consumer watchdog agency. Critics have condemned the move as a lawless attempt to dismantle an agency that has returned billions of dollars to consumers.</p>

          <p>The cost of packing a school lunch is rising, according to a new report from Deloitte, which finds the average homemade lunch now costs $6.15, up nearly 3% from last year. This increase is driven by broader food inflation, with grocery staples like milk and bananas seeing significant price hikes over the past year. The price of cafeteria lunches has also risen. In response, many parents plan to switch to store brands and choose cheaper meal options. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has increased funding for school meal programs to help offset these rising costs for families.</p>
