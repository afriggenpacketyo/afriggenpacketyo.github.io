          <p>China's industrial profits experienced accelerated growth in April, marking the second consecutive month of increase, despite facing U.S. tariffs and deflationary pressures. This growth is attributed to the stimulus measures implemented by Beijing, which have helped cushion the impact of the trade barriers. Profits in the high-tech manufacturing sector saw a significant rise, particularly in biopharmaceutical products and aircraft manufacturing, while household appliance manufacturers benefited from consumer subsidies. However, certain industries, such as automobiles and apparel, faced challenges due to price competition and demand shifts, respectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Volvo Cars, owned by Chinese group Geely Holding, plans to cut approximately 3,000 office-based jobs, primarily in Sweden, as part of a cost-cutting initiative.

This move follows Volvo's announcement of an 18 billion Swedish kronor "action plan" to restructure the business. Other car manufacturers, like Nissan, have also announced job cuts and factory closures due to weak sales and market pressures.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is conducting a wide-reaching investigation into public servants who hold mainland Chinese identification and residency. The first phase screened over 370,000 personnel in sensitive and high-ranking positions. A second phase, launched on Monday, will include local government officials and public-school teachers at all levels. This investigation was ordered in response to a directive from Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te during a national security meeting in March, focusing on personnel with access to sensitive information.</p>

The conflict in May led to increased use of UAVs due to their ability to strike targets without risking personnel or provoking escalation. India plans to invest heavily in its local drone industry, while Pakistan is collaborating with China and Turkey to advance its drone capabilities.
