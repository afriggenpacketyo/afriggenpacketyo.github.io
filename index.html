          <p>President Trump announced plans to double tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum to 50% at a U.S. Steel factory in Pittsburgh. This move is intended to boost the local steel industry and decrease reliance on China. The announcement comes amid ongoing legal battles over the legality of some of Trump's global tariffs, which an appeals court has allowed to continue. Trump emphasized the importance of steel for national security, stating that a country without steel cannot maintain a military.</p>

          <p>PBS has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging an executive order that seeks to dismantle federal support for public broadcasting. The lawsuit accuses the administration of unlawfully interfering in the Corporation for Public Broadcasting's operations and violating the First Amendment through viewpoint discrimination and illegal retaliation. The White House claims PBS and NPR have fueled partisanship and left-wing propaganda with taxpayer dollars, a charge the networks vehemently deny. The lawsuit argues that the executive order would profoundly impact PBS's ability to provide diverse programming to Americans.</p>

          <p>Rugby league authorities are expressing anger over the sport's 130-year history without a knighthood or damehood for its players. Officials argue that rugby league players have been poorly treated by the honors system compared to other sports like rugby union. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has also voiced his support, noting that other sports have received such honors regularly. Critics suggest that class prejudice may be a factor, as rugby league is often associated with working-class backgrounds.</p>

          <p>A former LAPD reserve officer and his brother have been charged with insurance fraud over a Bentley crash. Prosecutors allege they misrepresented details in a $200,000 insurance claim. The investigation revealed that the Bentley had been rented by a Drive LA client who crashed the vehicle before the brothers claimed the crash occurred. Authorities allege the brothers submitted staged photographs and a false statement to the insurance company, which ultimately did not pay out on the claim.</p>

The gallery had included text about Trump's impeachments and the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol in its collection of portraits. Legal experts suggest Trump may not have the authority to fire the director, as the gallery is part of the Smithsonian, which is not run by the executive branch.</p>

          <p>A wildfire ignited in the Covington Flats area of Joshua Tree National Park, burning 165 acres and several Joshua trees. The Covington Flats region is considered a critical “climate refugia” for the species. These areas are considered a last refuge as these areas are more likely to survive and reproduce even under a hotter, drier climate that is expected in the coming decades. The iconic trees are not adapted to wildfire, meaning any fire damage can be devastating to the population.</p>
