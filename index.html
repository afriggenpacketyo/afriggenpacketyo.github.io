        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is deliberating on a challenge to Colorado's law banning "conversion therapy" for minors, a case that pits free speech against professional conduct regulation. A Christian counselor argues the law unconstitutionally censors her conversations with young patients about sexual orientation and gender identity. The state contends it is regulating a harmful and ineffective medical practice, not speech. During arguments, several justices appeared skeptical of the state's position, questioning whether the law unfairly discriminates based on viewpoint by allowing therapy that supports gender transition but not therapy that explores other outcomes.</p>

          <p>Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio has advised investors to consider allocating up to 15% of their portfolios to gold, citing the current economic environment's similarity to the early 1970s. He argues that gold serves as an excellent diversifier and a reliable store of wealth during periods of high government debt and potential currency debasement. Dalio's recommendation comes as the precious metal's price has surged, reflecting growing investor concern over fiscal deficits and geopolitical instability, positioning gold as a key hedge against the declining value of traditional paper assets.

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has commented on an incident where he was seen making an obscene gesture to fans, calling the moment "unfortunate." A video on social media showed Jones flipping his middle finger from a suite during a game against the New York Jets. Jones explained that the gesture was unintentional and that he had meant to give a thumbs-up to a group of Cowboys supporters following a touchdown. The incident occurred during a dominant 37-22 victory for the team, which improved their season record.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Russia of utilizing its "shadow fleet" of oil tankers for intelligence gathering and sabotage operations in Europe. According to Zelenskyy, Kyiv is actively collaborating with international partners to neutralize this threat by sharing intelligence and strengthening opposition to Russian interference. This development is part of the ongoing conflict, which also saw recent drone attacks on Russia's oil-rich Tyumen region and continued diplomatic maneuvering over the potential U.S. supply of Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, a move the Kremlin warns would be a serious escalation.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown is causing significant disruptions to air travel, with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) facilities experiencing air traffic controller staffing shortages. The shortages, attributed to a rise in sick calls from controllers concerned about working without pay, have led to ground delays and cancellations at major airports across the country. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that the situation could deteriorate further, as the FAA may need to reduce flight rates to ensure safety, placing additional strain on an already fragile aviation system.</p>

          <p>During a public parole hearing, David Norris, one of the men convicted for the 1993 racist murder of Stephen Lawrence, has for the first time admitted his involvement in the attack. However, Norris refused to identify the other individuals responsible, claiming that doing so would put him and his family at risk. Stephen's mother, Baroness Doreen Lawrence, strongly opposed his release, stating that he remains a danger to the public because he has not shown full contrition or taken complete responsibility by naming his accomplices in the brutal killing.</p>

          <p>As the government shutdown continues, some Republican senators are facing increased pressure to negotiate with Democrats over extending Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies. Most Democrats have refused to support any government funding bill unless it includes an extension of the health care tax credits, which are set to expire. Moderate Republicans like Senator Susan Collins are reportedly circulating proposals to address the issue after the government reopens, but the Democratic caucus insists on resolving the matter beforehand, creating a significant impasse that is prolonging the shutdown.</p>

          <p>The World Trade Organization (WTO) has increased its forecast for global trade growth in 2025 to 2.4%, a significant rise from its previous 0.9% estimate. This upward revision is attributed to strong demand for AI-related goods, front-loading of imports ahead of tariff implementations, and favorable macroeconomic conditions. However, the WTO issued a stark warning for the following year, slashing its 2026 trade growth projection to just 0.5%, citing an expected global economic slowdown and the delayed but full impact of higher tariffs.

          <p>The high price of prescription drugs in the U.S. remains a major political issue, with the Trump administration advocating for a "most favored nation" policy to align American prices with the lower costs seen in other developed countries. A key reason for the price disparity is the lack of a centralized negotiating body in the U.S., unlike in many European nations where a single national health system negotiates for the entire country. This fragmented system, combined with a desire for unrestricted access to all available drugs, limits the U.S.'s ability to effectively control pharmaceutical costs.</p>

          <p>Borrowers facing debt collectors have significant protections under the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) that can help prevent harassment and unfair treatment. Key rights include the ability to be free from abusive tactics, the right to receive a validation notice and dispute the debt's accuracy, and the power to control communication by telling a collector to stop contact in writing. Understanding and exercising these rights allows consumers to navigate the collection process with more confidence and avoid paying debts that are incorrect or do not belong to them.</p>

          <p>Two women from Graz, Austria, who were accidentally switched at birth in a hospital 35 years ago, have finally met. Doris Grünwald and Jessica Baumgartner were both born prematurely in October 1990 and were inadvertently given to the wrong parents. The mistake came to light years later after routine blood tests revealed discrepancies, eventually leading the two women to connect on social media. The families have since met, describing an emotional reunion that has brought both relief and a sense of an expanded family.</p>

          <p>The European Union has proposed doubling its tariffs on steel imports to 50% and cutting duty-free quotas in a bid to protect its market from a flood of cheaper foreign steel, particularly from China. This move has been labeled an "existential threat" by the UK steel industry, which sends 80% of its exports to the EU and now faces a potential crisis. UK industry leaders are urgently calling on their government to implement its own defensive measures to prevent a devastating flood of diverted steel into the British market.</p>

          <p>Candy manufacturers appear to be responding to a global cocoa shortage and soaring prices by introducing new Halloween treats with less chocolate. Recent product launches include cinnamon-coated Kit Kats and pumpkin-spice-latte-filled Hershey's Nuggets, suggesting a strategic shift toward non-chocolate flavors. This trend of "cocoa cutting" allows companies to innovate and manage costs amid the volatile cocoa market, while also capitalizing on the growing popularity of non-chocolate alternatives like fruit-flavored gummies, which offer a more stable and predictable supply chain.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced plans to double its tariffs on foreign steel imports to 50% while also halving the volume of duty-free imports allowed. This protectionist measure is a direct response to the struggles of Europe's steel industry, which is facing intense pressure from a glut of cheaper steel produced by China. The proposal, which mirrors recent U.S. tariffs, aims to shield the European sector, allowing it to invest in decarbonization and regain a competitive footing in the global market.</p>
