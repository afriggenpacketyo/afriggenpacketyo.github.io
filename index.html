          <p>The Japanese government has initiated a new gasoline subsidy aimed at reducing prices by 10 yen per liter to alleviate cost-of-living pressures on consumers. This measure is being introduced ahead of an upcoming parliamentary election. The subsidy program, allocated around 1 trillion yen, could potentially last until the end of March 2026. It targets a wholesale gasoline price reduction of 7.40 yen per liter in the first week, with further weekly reductions planned to reach the 10-yen target by mid-June. The price reductions are expected to reflect at gas stations in two to three weeks.</p>

Students also protested against Columbia's ties to Israel.

Outside the ceremony, former students burned their diplomas, and demonstrators chanted slogans. The Trump administration has pulled more than $400 million in federal grant funding from Columbia because of what the White House has called the university’s failure to crack down on antisemitism.</p>

          <p>The Senate is set to vote on revoking three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move Democrats call "the nuclear option." These waivers allow California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows Congress to overturn the waivers, but nonpartisan watchdogs disagree. Democrats claim the vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. California officials are prepared for a legal fight, arguing the Clean Air Act permits the state to set its own standards.</p>
