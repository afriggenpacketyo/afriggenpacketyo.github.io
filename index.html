          <p>In a significant move toward de-escalation, North Korea has started to dismantle propaganda loudspeakers along its border with South Korea. This action follows a similar step taken by Seoul in June, signaling a potential thaw in inter-Korean relations under South Korea's new presidential administration. The loudspeakers have historically been a tool of psychological warfare, broadcasting K-pop and news into the North, while Pyongyang's speakers emitted disruptive noises. This reciprocal measure is seen as a positive step after a period of heightened tensions on the peninsula.</p>

          <p>A tragic bus accident in western Kenya has resulted in the deaths of 25 people who were returning from a funeral. The driver reportedly lost control of the vehicle, causing it to overturn in a ditch on a highway known for deadly incidents. The victims, believed to be from a single family, included ten men, ten women, and one child who died at the scene, with four others succumbing to injuries in the hospital. This event has intensified calls for improved road safety measures in Kenya, a country grappling with a rising number of fatal traffic accidents.</p>

The 22-year-old Slovenia international has agreed to a five-year contract, becoming the club's third major attacking acquisition of the summer. Sesko, known for his pace and physical presence, chose Manchester United over other interested clubs like Newcastle. In his two seasons with Leipzig, he demonstrated significant goal-scoring ability, and he is considered one of the top young attacking talents in European football.</p>

          <p>Amid severe hunger crises in Gaza and Sudan, health experts are highlighting the dangers of "refeeding syndrome," a potentially fatal condition that can occur when severely malnourished individuals resume normal eating too quickly.

Aid organizations use specially formulated, low-nutrient therapeutic foods to safely stabilize patients. Experts stress that preventing this syndrome requires safe and consistent access for aid agencies, which is currently being denied in conflict zones like Gaza and Sudan.</p>

          <p>A Kenyan immigrant and father of three, Samuel Kangethe, has decided to self-deport after living in Michigan for 16 years. Despite having two university degrees and a stable job, his unresolved immigration case, stemming from a marriage deemed fraudulent by officials in 2014, makes him deportable under the current administration's policies. Fearing detention and forced removal, Kangethe opted to leave on his own terms to ensure his family knows his whereabouts and can maintain contact. His decision highlights the personal toll of shifting immigration enforcement on long-term residents and their families.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reportedly informed Pfizer that it may not renew the emergency use authorization for its pediatric COVID-19 vaccine for children aged six months to four years. This potential move could leave a significant gap in vaccine availability, as it is the only shot currently approved for all children in this age group. In response, the CDC is in discussions with Moderna to potentially increase its supply for young children, though Moderna's vaccine is only approved for those with underlying health conditions. Public health experts have expressed concern over the timing and potential impact on protecting vulnerable children.</p>

          <p>Etiquette expert Elaine Swann provides advice on how to be a considerate houseguest, emphasizing that respecting the host's space is paramount. Key recommendations include keeping visits to a manageable length, ideally around four days, and communicating plans in advance to align expectations. Swann advises against relying on hosts for transportation and suggests that while a host's invitation to "make yourself at home" allows for self-sufficiency, guests should still be tidy and offer to help. A thoughtful thank-you gift, given by the end of the stay, is also recommended to show appreciation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the implementation of new U.S. tariffs, economists anticipate a tangible impact on the American economy, though the full effects remain uncertain. Higher prices for consumer goods are considered inevitable as companies will likely pass on increased costs, with some estimates suggesting an average household cost of $2,400 this year. While overall inflation is expected to rise, it is not projected to reach the highs seen in 2022. The tariffs could also lead to a slowdown in the job market as businesses become more cautious, potentially dampening economic growth without necessarily causing a recession.

          <p>The term "grifter" has seen a dramatic rise in usage as a political insult, reflecting a growing public suspicion about the motivations of public figures. The word, which refers to a swindler who makes money through dishonest means, is now frequently used to attack political opponents from all sides, suggesting they are motivated by personal gain rather than genuine belief. This article suggests the trend is fueled by the rise of influencer culture, high-profile scam stories, and a general decline in trust in politicians.

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing of Nagasaki, Mayor Shiro Suzuki delivered a powerful peace declaration, warning that escalating global conflicts could lead to nuclear war. The solemn ceremony commemorated the estimated 74,000 people killed in the 1945 attack and honored the survivors who suffered from its aftereffects. Suzuki appealed for an end to the cycle of confrontation seen in current wars, urging the world to avoid repeating the catastrophic events of the past. The event included symbolic water offerings for victims who begged for water after the blast.</p>

          <p>A fast-moving wildfire, dubbed the Canyon Fire, has forced thousands of residents in Southern California to evacuate as it burns across Ventura and Los Angeles counties. Igniting on Thursday, the blaze quickly grew to over 5,400 acres, fueled by extreme heat and dry conditions. While firefighters have achieved partial containment, one firefighter suffered major injuries when their truck overturned. The incident is one of several active wildfires in California, where hotter and drier conditions attributed to climate change have led to longer and more destructive fire seasons.</p>

          <p>A year after a catastrophic landfill avalanche in Kampala, Uganda, killed 34 people and left over 200 homeless, victims are still awaiting compensation and living in fear. The disaster highlighted the city's urgent waste management problems. The old landfill is now officially closed, but the city's solution—a new dumpsite in Buyala—is mired in controversy, with the National Forestry Authority claiming the land is part of a protected forest reserve. While the city has plans for modern recycling and composting, it currently lacks the funding and investment to implement them effectively.</p>

          <p>Recent European Union sanctions targeting India's refining of Russian oil are seen as less impactful to EU-India relations than the threat of high U.S. tariffs on Indian goods. Analysts suggest that pressure from Washington could paradoxically benefit the EU by increasing India's desire to diversify its economic partnerships and finalize a long-delayed free trade agreement with the bloc. The EU's more measured approach to sensitive sectors like agriculture, which employs a large portion of India's population, is also seen as a factor that could strengthen its negotiating position relative to the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Civil Service Internship Reform Sparks Debate Among Students</h2>

          <p>A UK government reform restricting a civil service summer internship program to applicants from lower socio-economic backgrounds has divided students. Proponents argue the change will make the civil service more representative of society and give a fair chance to those without existing advantages. However, other students from state schools and working-class families, whose parents' jobs fall just outside the new criteria, feel they are being unfairly excluded from a key pathway into a public service career. The debate highlights the complexities of defining social class and implementing policies aimed at improving social mobility.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully created high-purity hexagonal diamonds in a laboratory, a significant breakthrough in materials science. This rare form of diamond, with a distinct atomic structure, was first discovered in an Arizona meteorite in 1967 and was believed to form only under the extreme conditions of a meteor impact. Previous attempts by researchers worldwide had only produced mixed-phase or impure samples. The Chinese team's ability to create macroscopic crystals of the material provides definitive proof of its existence and opens new possibilities for research and application.</p>
