          <p>A significant security operation is underway in Scotland for Donald Trump's private four-day visit, centered around his Trump Turnberry golf resort. The US president played a round of golf amid road closures, a heavy police presence, and overhead drones, with costs and staffing impacts raising concerns among police representatives. While Trump is scheduled to meet with UK and Scottish leaders to discuss trade and international issues, several hundred demonstrators have gathered in Aberdeen and Edinburgh to protest his visit. The president praised the leadership of both governments upon his arrival.</p>

          <p>Overnight drone and missile strikes between Russia and Ukraine have resulted in five deaths. Ukrainian officials reported that Russian attacks, primarily targeting the Dnipropetrovsk region, killed three people, while Russia stated that two people died in its Rostov region from a Ukrainian drone strike. The attacks occurred as both nations provided military updates, with Russia claiming the capture of two eastern Ukrainian villages. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asserted that his forces were gradually pushing Russian troops out of the Sumy region and emphasized that such strikes would not go unanswered.</p>

          <p>Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's newly appointed prime minister, is facing significant skepticism and overtly sexist criticism from some political observers. At 39, she is one of the few women to lead a former Soviet state, and critics have dismissed her as a mere "loyalist" to President Zelensky, questioning her ability to act independently. However, Svyrydenko has an extensive resume, including negotiating major international trade and investment deals, which will be crucial as she navigates the ongoing war and economic recovery. Her appointment is seen as a test of Ukraine's progress in overcoming ingrained biases against female leadership.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the cultural impact of Sean Combs, also known as Puff Daddy, and the sense of betrayal felt by those who once admired him following revelations of his abusive behavior. During the 1990s, Combs was a formidable ambassador of Black cool, inspiring a generation with his ambition, style, and success in breaking into mainstream spaces. He projected an image of a self-made entrepreneur who balanced luxury with hard work, representing a new kind of unrestricted success. The author laments that the aspirational figure of his youth has now become a symbol of profound cruelty.</p>

          <p>As climate change leads to hotter summers, more Americans are experiencing mental health issues, sometimes referred to as summer seasonal affective disorder (SAD). The choice between enduring extreme heat outdoors or isolating indoors with air conditioning is creating a difficult situation, as both can negatively impact well-being. Experts suggest that symptoms like low energy, insomnia, and restlessness, often associated with summer SAD, are exacerbated by heat's direct physiological effects and the indirect consequences of reduced socializing and outdoor activity. This trend raises significant concerns about the long-term mental health impacts of a warming planet.</p>

The "Great Recall" was initiated by a civic movement following months of political deadlock between the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the opposition-controlled legislature. Pro-recall activists believe the opposition is pushing Beijing's agenda, a claim the Kuomintang denies. The failure of the recall maintains the opposition's legislative majority and is expected to intensify political polarization on the island.</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, an American comedian living in Scotland expresses her frustration with Donald Trump's visit, noting that his presence disrupts the peace she sought by moving abroad. She observes Trump's apparent desire for Scottish acceptance, rooted in his mother's heritage, and compares it to the common genealogical claims of American tourists. The author contrasts Trump's persona with the legacy of the late Scottish comedian Janey Godley, whose defiant and humorous protest against a previous visit captured a sentiment of rebellion. She concludes that Trump will never be truly Scottish because he doesn't understand the nation's spirit.</p>

Even with good intentions, private owners cannot provide the complex social environment these animals need, leading to a life of suffering. The bill aims to curb this trade and protect primates from the trauma of being kept as pets.</p>

          <p>Despite earning six-figure incomes, a significant number of Americans, dubbed "HENRYs" (high earners, not rich yet), report feeling financially insecure and living paycheck to paycheck. Experts attribute this phenomenon to a combination of rising costs, significant debt, and lifestyle creep, where spending increases to match income. Psychologists note that the process of accumulating wealth, which requires saving rather than spending, can paradoxically make people feel less rich. This sentiment is widespread, with one survey finding that Americans believe they need to earn an average of $520,000 annually to truly feel wealthy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A gun and grenade attack on a courthouse in Zahedan, the capital of Iran's Sistan-Baluchistan province, has killed at least nine people, including six civilians and three assailants. The attackers, disguised as visitors, attempted to storm the building before being killed in clashes with security forces. The Sunni militant group Jaish al-Adl (Army of Justice) has claimed responsibility for the assault. The province, home to Iran's ethnic Baloch minority, is one of the country's least developed regions and frequently experiences violence between security forces and armed groups demanding greater rights.</p>

The meeting aims to prevent a looming 30% U.S. tariff on EU imports, which is scheduled to take effect on August 1. There is growing optimism for a breakthrough, with sources suggesting a potential deal could involve a 15% baseline tariff, similar to a recent agreement between the U.S. and Japan. A deal would be crucial for the transatlantic relationship, which represents nearly 30% of global trade.</p>

          <p>House Democrats are formally requesting that the estate of Jeffrey Epstein provide a copy of a "birthday book" reportedly compiled for the disgraced financier's 50th birthday. The request follows a Wall Street Journal report that the book contains a letter from Donald Trump, a claim Trump has denied and is suing over. Lawmakers state the book is relevant to their oversight of the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein investigation and the Trump administration's selective release of related documents.

          <p>A Mexican family who chose to "self-deport" from Arizona due to fears over the Trump administration's immigration policies lost their entire life savings upon re-entering Mexico. After building a modest life in the U.S., the family decided to leave, but Mexican customs officials confiscated their truck and the $5,000 they had saved, citing a lack of proper vehicle title. This personal story highlights a consequence of the administration's hardline stance, which has prompted some migrants to leave voluntarily.

While the bill includes some relief for rural hospitals, local administrators and healthcare advocates fear the deep Medicaid cuts will be devastating.

The author explains that Theo, along with other key TV characters, provided a relatable and positive representation at a time when Black narratives were often centered on trauma. By simply existing as part of a successful, supportive Black family, Theo's character challenged narrow stereotypes and offered a blueprint for being. Warner's passing is felt not just as nostalgia but as gratitude for the burden he carried with grace.</p>

She calls on her generation to move from taking the ADA for granted to actively fighting for its preservation.

This trend suggests that the administration's focus on public safety threats is secondary to meeting aggressive arrest quotas.
