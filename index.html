          <p>Texas Republicans, including the Attorney General, are seeking to enforce civil arrest warrants nationwide for Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to prevent a quorum on a controversial redistricting bill. They are attempting to "domesticate" the warrants in states like Illinois and California, citing the U.S. Constitution's Full Faith and Credit Clause. This move represents a major escalation in the partisan battle over voting rights and redistricting. Democratic governors in the host states have voiced support for the absent lawmakers, setting up a potential state-versus-state legal showdown.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index for July remained steady at a 2.7% annual rate, as falling gas and grocery prices offset other increases. However, "core" inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy, rose to 3.1%, its fastest pace since February, signaling underlying price pressures. Economists suggest that the effects of the Trump administration's tariff and immigration policies are becoming more apparent in the data, particularly for consumer goods like apparel and furnishings. While the full impact has not yet been felt, these policies are expected to contribute to higher inflation later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 11:00:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's military deployment in Washington D.C. as a move to assert authoritarian control rather than address any real emergency. It argues that the pretext of rising crime is demonstrably false, and the action serves to undermine democratically elected local officials and erode the taboo against using the military for domestic policing. The author suggests this is a feature of authoritarian-style politics, where the ability to enforce a false reality through power becomes a core political tool. This represents a significant challenge to democratic norms and institutions.</p>

          <p>Following a recent tariff truce between the United States and China, economic experts remain cautious about the likelihood of significant long-term breakthroughs. While it is in the interest of both nations to avoid re-escalating tariffs, deep-seated issues make a comprehensive deal difficult to achieve. Analysts predict a future of continued negotiations, extensions, and adjustments rather than a definitive resolution to the trade conflict. President Trump has suggested a potential meeting with President Xi Jinping by year's end if a deal can be reached, but the path forward is expected to be challenging.</p>

          <p>Glendora Continental, a 45-year-old family-run restaurant and a cultural cornerstone for the Basque community in Southern California, is being sold. The establishment is one of the last remaining Basque-owned restaurants in the region, a community whose presence has dwindled over the decades as immigration patterns changed and younger generations pursued other careers. For nearly half a century, the restaurant has served as a vibrant social hub, offering traditional Basque-French cuisine. Its impending closure is felt deeply by its owners, loyal staff, and multigenerational customers.</p>

          <p>The number of migrants who have crossed the English Channel in small boats has exceeded 50,000 since the Labour party took office in the UK last summer. This milestone has intensified political debate, with the Conservative opposition claiming Labour's plan to stop the crossings has failed. The government acknowledged the "unacceptable number" but stated it is implementing new measures, including a returns deal with France, to address the issue. The report also noted a recent tragedy where a woman died while attempting to make the crossing from a beach in Dunkirk.</p>

          <p>President Trump has intensified his public attacks on the Federal Reserve, now threatening a "major lawsuit" against Chairman Jerome Powell. The threat is ostensibly related to the rising costs of renovations at the Fed's headquarters, a project Trump has frequently criticized. In a social media post, Trump called Powell a "loser" and blamed him for not lowering interest rates more aggressively, a move the president claims is necessary for the economy. This represents a dramatic escalation of political pressure on the independent central bank, which has so far held rates steady in 2025.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve having cut rates in late 2024 and more cuts anticipated, savers are evaluating the best place for their cash. Experts compare money market accounts and high-yield savings accounts, noting both offer competitive, variable rates that are much higher than traditional savings. The primary difference is that money market accounts often provide check-writing and debit card access, but may require higher minimum balances to earn the top yields. High-yield savings accounts are often simpler and ideal for building emergency funds or saving for short-term goals. (not investment advice)</p>

Another popular option for those aged 70½ or older is a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which allows a direct, tax-free transfer to a nonprofit, satisfying the RMD requirement without increasing taxable income. For those focused on legacy planning, using the RMD to contribute to a 529 college savings plan can also be a tax-advantaged move. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dangerous and record-breaking heat is impacting multiple regions across the United States, with advisories in place for the Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest. Daily record highs in the mid-to-high 90s are possible in New England, while parts of Oregon are expected to reach 105 degrees. In the Southwest, Las Vegas could see temperatures of 110 degrees, and Phoenix is forecast to hit 112. This widespread excessive heat is expected to persist in the West before shifting eastward, bringing scorching temperatures back to the central and northeastern states over the weekend.</p>

          <p>During a trial over California's lawsuit against the Trump administration, a top general involved in the military deployment to Los Angeles testified he did not hear the protests described as a "rebellion." This testimony is significant as the administration has cited the "rebellion" clause of a federal law to justify its actions. The trial examines whether the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the military's role in domestic law enforcement. This case has gained new relevance following a similar deployment of troops to Washington, D.C.</p>

          <p>A former Maryland youth pastor, Thomas Pinkerton, has been arrested and faces multiple felony charges for allegedly sexually abusing at least six teenage boys between 2006 and 2010. The abuse allegedly occurred at Central Christian Church and his home, where he reportedly told victims that kissing on the lips was a "heavenly kiss" like Jesus and his disciples. Pinkerton, who later worked as a traveling evangelist, was extradited from Georgia and has pleaded not guilty. Authorities believe there may be more victims and are asking for information.</p>

          <p>China Evergrande Group, the world's most indebted property developer, will have its shares delisted from the Hong Kong stock exchange. The company was notified that its listing would be canceled after failing to resume trading for 18 consecutive months, a period that began when a court ordered its liquidation. This marks a symbolic end for a company that was once a poster child for China's real estate boom. Evergrande's 2021 default on over $300 billion in liabilities triggered a severe property crisis in China with global economic repercussions.</p>

          <p>A US-brokered peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which includes a new transit corridor named the "Trump Route," is posing a significant challenge to Iran. The route, connecting Azerbaijan to its exclave through Armenian territory, offers a more direct trade link to Turkey and Europe, bypassing and potentially isolating Iran. While Tehran officially welcomed peace, hardliners have vowed to block the corridor, viewing the increased US influence in the region as a threat. This development comes as Iran is weakened by internal crises and shifting regional alliances.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is forecast to strengthen, potentially becoming the first hurricane of the Atlantic season later this week. As of Tuesday morning, the storm was moving west from the Cabo Verde islands, where it has already caused deadly flooding. While there is no immediate threat to the United States, long-term models show uncertainty in its path, with a potential turn toward the northwest as it nears the Caribbean. This marks the fifth named storm of what is predicted to be an above-normal hurricane season.</p>

          <p>Foreign policy experts are warning that an upcoming one-on-one summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin could be a strategic trap set by the Russian leader. With his war in Ukraine stalling, Putin may be using the summit to manipulate Trump, who is eager for a peace deal, into accepting terms unfavorable to Ukraine. The fear is that Trump might agree to let Russia keep conquered territory, and if Ukrainian President Zelensky rejects such a deal, Trump could turn his anger on Kyiv. This could jeopardize Ukraine's defense and hand Putin a strategic victory.</p>

Musk's AI startup, xAI, developed the Grok chatbot, which he claims is being unfairly suppressed in sections like "Must-Have Apps." The threat marks an escalation in the feud between Musk and OpenAI, which he co-founded, and adds to Apple's existing antitrust challenges, including a major lawsuit from the Department of Justice over its iPhone ecosystem.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent trade actions, including steep tariffs on India and threats against Japan, are causing significant strain within the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad). This alliance, which also includes Australia, is seen as a key coalition to counter China's influence in the Indo-Pacific. The aggressive tariff policies and rhetoric have pushed relations with India to their lowest point in decades, undermining a key foreign policy achievement of Trump's first term. Analysts suggest these moves, likely driven by domestic politics, risk unraveling the fragile coalition and benefiting Beijing's strategic interests.</p>

The legislation expands work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to new groups, including parents of older children and adults up to age 64. The CBO projects that while middle and upper-income households will see their overall resources increase from the broader bill, households at the bottom of the income distribution will see a decrease.

This stability is seen as a major advantage against a U.S. team facing more uncertainty, including questions around its captaincy.
