          <p>A recent Federal Reserve report indicates that businesses are already attempting to pass the costs of President Trump's tariffs onto consumers. Companies have reported receiving notices from suppliers about rising costs and are looking for ways to avoid absorbing these increases. The report notes uncertainty about the ability to fully pass these costs to customers, especially for consumer-facing firms. The Fed's "Beige Book" characterizes economic growth as "little changed" but notes that uncertainty around international trade policy is pervasive across the Fed's 12 districts.

        </div>

          <p>President Trump's suggestion that automakers move production to the U.S. in response to tariffs is more complicated than it seems. The implementation of an additional 25% auto parts tariff by May 3 would increase vehicle costs, even for those assembled in the U.S. Relocating production lines requires years of planning, construction, and building infrastructure, making it a costly and time-consuming process. Industry experts emphasize that localization of new models doesn't happen overnight, requiring significant investment and time. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent two-day stock market rally is largely attributed to a "short squeeze," where hedge fund short sellers frantically covered their losses. Increased short positions in both single stocks and macro-related securities created an environment prone to dramatic upswings. When securities rally, short sellers are forced to rapidly buy back borrowed stocks to limit their losses, driving prices even higher. This phenomenon explains the market's relief rally, despite a lack of tangible news beyond some softened comments on China and the Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harvey Weinstein's retrial has commenced in New York, with prosecutors accusing him of using his power to sexually harass and abuse three women. The retrial focuses on allegations from actress Jessica Mann, former TV production assistant Miriam Haley, and former model Kaja Sokola, who accuses Weinstein of assaulting her when she was 16. Weinstein's attorney argues that the women had mutually beneficial relationships with him and are motivated by fame and money. Weinstein's previous conviction was overturned due to the inclusion of testimony from women regarding uncharged conduct.</p>

          <p>The Jones Road Wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, has burned through 12,000 acres and is approximately 35% contained. The state of emergency has been declared for Ocean County. While one business was destroyed, no single-family homes were damaged, and no injuries or loss of life have been reported. Mandatory and voluntary evacuations were lifted, and major roads reopened. The New Jersey Forest Fire Service expects the acreage to grow as they work toward containment, potentially making it the largest wildfire in New Jersey in 20 years.</p>
