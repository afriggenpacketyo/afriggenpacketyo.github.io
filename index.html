          <p>Automotive giant Stellantis has reinstated its financial guidance, anticipating a gradual recovery in the latter half of the year despite reporting a significant first-half net loss of €2.3 billion. CEO Antonio Filosa acknowledged 2025 as a "tough year" but expressed confidence in the company's new leadership to make difficult decisions for profitable growth. The revised outlook, which includes expectations for increased revenue and improved cash flow, is contingent on current trade rules remaining stable, particularly following a new US-EU tariff framework that has raised concerns across the auto industry.

          <p>Fans of the late heavy metal icon Ozzy Osbourne will have an opportunity to pay their final respects as his funeral cortege travels through his home city of Birmingham. The procession will pass along Broad Street to the Black Sabbath Bridge, a site that has become a memorial with numerous fan tributes. The public event, funded by Osbourne's family, precedes a private funeral and allows the family to witness the outpouring of support from his global fanbase. The city's Lord Mayor described Osbourne, who died at 76, as a "son of Birmingham" who put the city on the world map.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire intended to end deadly border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia is already under strain, with Thailand accusing Cambodian forces of violating the agreement shortly after it began. The Thai military reported receiving gunfire from the Cambodian side at multiple locations, a claim Cambodia's defense ministry has denied. The clashes, which have killed at least 33 people and displaced thousands, escalated last week following a landmine explosion. The ceasefire was brokered by Malaysia with pressure from the US, and local commanders from both nations had met to agree on halting troop movements and gunfire.</p>

          <p>On the final day of his visit to Scotland, U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with First Minister John Swinney to discuss key economic issues, including U.S. tariffs on Scotch whisky. Swinney aims to secure an exemption for the crucial Scottish export, which is a significant part of the UK's food and drink exports. The meeting follows discussions with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and a dinner where the leaders reportedly spoke at length. After the political discussions, Trump will officially open a new course at his golf resort in Aberdeenshire, concluding a visit that blended business with diplomatic engagements.</p>

          <p>The recent viral popularity of collectible Labubu toys, fueled by celebrity collectors, has revived interest in their perceived ancestor, the Monchhichi doll. Originally created in Japan in 1974, the monkey-like doll became a global sensation in the 1980s. While popular in West Germany, it was unavailable in the communist East, which led to the creation of a local version called the Tiemi. Produced in the toy-making town of Sonneberg, the Tiemi became a beloved item throughout the Eastern Bloc but ceased production after German reunification, making original models sought-after collector's items today.</p>

          <p>British bank Barclays reported a second-quarter pre-tax profit of £2.5 billion, surpassing analyst expectations, and announced a £1 billion share buyback. The strong performance was largely driven by a 10% year-on-year income increase in its investment banking division, which capitalized on market volatility. Like other major banks, Barclays benefited from increased trading activity related to recent global economic shifts, including new tariff policies. The results come as the bank continues its three-year strategic plan focused on cost savings and achieving higher, more stable returns for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

Securing either player presents challenges, as Aston Villa is reluctant to sell the 29-year-old Watkins, and Newcastle is also reportedly interested in the 22-year-old Sesko. United reportedly considers Villa's suggested £60m price for Watkins to be excessively high given his age and contract status.</p>

          <p>Experts in China are urging Beijing to actively shape its global image and strengthen its influence by controlling its own narrative and engaging more with other Asian nations.

This call for a more proactive approach to soft power comes as global dynamics shift, with emerging economies seeking a greater role in global governance. The experts suggest that China should lead in shaping an Asian discourse with an open mindset, rather than imposing a pre-made narrative.</p>

This surge is primarily attributed to Apple's accelerated manufacturing shift to India amid ongoing U.S.-China trade uncertainties.

          <p>The European Union is launching a multi-billion-euro initiative to build AI "gigafactories" in an effort to close the gap with the U.S. and China in the artificial intelligence sector. These facilities are envisioned as comprehensive ecosystems that combine computing power, data, and talent to develop advanced AI models and applications. The EU has committed an initial €20 billion and has received significant interest from member states for what it calls the largest public investment in AI globally. The goal is to enhance Europe's technological sovereignty and competitiveness, though challenges like high energy costs and the need for massive private investment remain.</p>

          <h2>Singapore Airlines' Stock Declines After Reporting a 59% Drop in Quarterly Profit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 00:35:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Singapore Airlines (SIA) fell over 8% after the carrier announced a 59% plunge in net profit for the first quarter of its financial year. The company attributed the sharp decline primarily to losses from its 25.1% stake in Air India, which is undergoing a complex restructuring. While SIA's operating profit also fell, the airline noted that underlying demand for air travel and cargo remains strong despite geopolitical uncertainties. However, analysts suggest that Air India will likely continue to be a near-term drag on SIA's bottom line and that rising competition is normalizing the airline's operating margins from pandemic-era highs.

          <p>In a landmark verdict, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has been found guilty of bribery and witness tampering, a decision that could tarnish the legacy of the once-powerful conservative leader. The case centered on accusations that Uribe conspired to influence imprisoned former paramilitary members to change their testimony linking him to a paramilitary group. Uribe, who governed from 2002 to 2010 and was a key U.S. ally, faces up to 12 years in prison and is expected to appeal. The ruling has polarized the nation, with supporters seeing it as political persecution and opponents hailing it as a victory for justice.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called on his new South Korean counterpart, Cho Hyun, to pursue an independent foreign policy and resist "decoupling" from China. In their first official phone call, Wang emphasized the need for a stable and predictable relationship, urging deeper pragmatic cooperation between the two nations. The conversation reflects Beijing's efforts to reset relations with Seoul's new leadership under President Lee Jae-myung, who is generally seen as more open to China than his predecessor.

          <p>The Chinese government has launched its first nationwide subsidy program to encourage more births, offering parents 3,600 yuan ($500) annually for each child under three years old. This policy aims to alleviate the financial burden on approximately 20 million families and address the country's looming demographic crisis. The move follows various local incentives and comes as official data shows China's population shrinking for a third consecutive year in 2024. High child-rearing costs are a major factor in the declining birth rate, and Beijing is also exploring measures like free preschool education to reverse the trend.</p>

          <p>A class-action lawsuit has been filed to challenge a new Trump administration policy that mandates detention without bail for immigrants in the U.S. illegally while they await deportation hearings. This policy reverses the long-standing practice of granting bond to individuals not considered a flight or public safety risk. Advocacy groups argue the change is a misinterpretation of the law, violates due process, and inflicts "catastrophic" harm on families by separating them for potentially years. The lawsuit highlights cases of individuals with deep community ties and no criminal past who are now being indefinitely detained.</p>
