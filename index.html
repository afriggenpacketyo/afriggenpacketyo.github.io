          <p>President Trump announced significant tariffs on numerous countries, imposing a 10% baseline tariff on all imports and additional 'reciprocal' tariffs based on the tariffs imposed by other nations on US goods.  This action, dubbed "Liberation Day" by Trump, has triggered concerns about escalating trade wars and potential negative impacts on the global economy.  The move is intended to protect American industries and jobs, but economists warn of higher prices for consumers and potential economic slowdown.</p>

          <p>The US State Department revoked the visas of members of the Mexican band Los Alegres del Barranco after they displayed images of El Mencho, the leader of the Jalisco New Generation cartel, during a concert.  The action is justified as a consequence for glorifying a designated foreign terrorist organization leader. The band was about to embark on a US tour, which is now cancelled. The move underscores the US government's stance against the glorification of drug cartels.</p>
