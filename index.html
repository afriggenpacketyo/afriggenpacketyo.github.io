          <p>A recent Quinnipiac University poll indicates a 16-point drop in Elon Musk's favorability among Republicans since March, falling to 62% despite his contributions to President Donald Trump's re-election. The decline follows a public falling out between Musk and Trump over the president's spending bill, which escalated into a social media war of words. Despite the decrease, Musk remains popular among Republicans for his role in running the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), with 80% rating his work as either excellent or good. The poll highlights the deep division between Republican and Democratic voters regarding Musk, with only 3% of Democrats surveyed holding a favorable view of the Tesla CEO. The article underscores Musk's controversial tenure in the Trump administration and his fluctuating public image.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested that the United States may extend a 90-day pause on implementing steep tariffs on goods from major trading partners if negotiations continue "in good faith." Bessent's remarks, made during a congressional hearing, marked the first public hint from a high-ranking official about potentially pushing the deadline beyond early July. Japan is one of the key partners actively negotiating with the Trump administration, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba scheduled to meet with Trump at the upcoming G7 summit. The administration's priority remains clinching trade deals with Japan, South Korea, India, and the European Union, though it's uncertain if these remarks will alter the pace of ongoing talks.

          <p>Multiple sources have informed CBS News that Israel is prepared to initiate an operation in Iran, leading the U.S. to anticipate potential Iranian retaliation against American sites in neighboring Iraq. This concern prompted the State Department to advise non-emergency government officials to leave Iraq due to "heightened regional tensions." Despite these developments, President Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, plans to proceed with a sixth round of talks with Iran regarding the country's nuclear program. The Trump administration seeks a deal with Iran to limit its nuclear program, but the talks are delicate, given Prime Minister Netanyahu's skepticism and the long-standing animosity between the two countries. The situation remains tense as the U.S. navigates diplomatic efforts amidst potential military action.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. is set to partially evacuate its embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, due to increased security risks, according to U.S. government sources. This decision follows weeks of stalled talks between the U.S. and Iran regarding Tehran's nuclear program, with President Trump expressing diminishing confidence that Iran will cease uranium enrichment. The move also comes after a tense phone call between Trump and Israel's prime minister, who advocates for a military approach rather than diplomacy. Trump stated that U.S. personnel are being moved out of the Middle East because it could be a dangerous place, and the situation is being closely monitored. The partial evacuation reflects growing concerns about regional stability and the potential for escalating conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eight female college athletes are appealing the House v. NCAA antitrust settlement, arguing it unfairly distributes $2.7 billion in back pay, disadvantaging women. They claim the settlement violates Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex-based discrimination in education, by undercalculating past damages for female athletes by $1.1 billion. The athletes' attorney, Ashlyn Hare, asserts the settlement disproportionately benefits football and basketball stars at larger schools, potentially leading to scholarship reductions or roster cuts for athletes in non-revenue sports. The appeal, filed by Hutchinson Black and Cook, argues that the settlement is essentially a football and basketball damages settlement with minimal benefit to female athletes. The legal challenge raises concerns about equity in college sports and the enforcement of anti-discrimination laws.</p>

This strategy reflects a willingness to prioritize patience in an era often characterized by impatience, with limited day-to-day spending and cuts in certain areas. The government hopes that these long-term investments will ultimately lead to national renewal, although immediate impacts may not be apparent. However, many people in England and Wales will likely face higher council taxes to support the police, a detail not explicitly highlighted by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves.

          <p>The United States has initiated a review of the multi-billion dollar Aukus submarine deal with the UK and Australia to ensure it aligns with President Trump's "America First" agenda. This review comes as Australia faces pressure from the White House to increase its military spending from 2% to 3.5% of GDP. Both Australia and the UK have downplayed the significance of the US probe, characterizing it as a routine reassessment by a new administration. The Aukus pact, signed in 2021, aims to provide Australia with its first nuclear-powered submarines from the US, followed by the creation of a new fleet through shared technology. The review raises questions about the future of the trilateral alliance and its strategic goals in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman announced that at least five criminal cases have been filed stemming from ongoing immigration protests in Los Angeles. Charges include assault upon a peace officer, resisting arrest, advocating violence against an officer, commercial burglary, grand theft, and vandalism. Hochman emphasized that violence and criminal behavior will not be tolerated, while also acknowledging that peaceful protests have largely outweighed instances of violence. The DA noted that thousands of people have engaged in legitimate protests, but those who commit crimes will be prosecuted.

          <p>The House is nearing a final vote on President Donald Trump's $9.4 billion spending cut package, which includes cuts originally proposed by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The package would allow the White House to claw back billions of dollars already approved by Congress from agencies like USAID and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS. While the procedural vote passed largely along party lines, the final vote could face resistance from Republicans concerned about targeting popular programs. With a narrow Republican majority, House Speaker Mike Johnson can only afford to lose a few votes to pass the package.

Judge Michael Farbiarz stated there was no compelling interest to keep Khalil in custody, as he is a lawful permanent resident. Khalil was arrested as part of President Trump's crackdown on international students protesting the Israel-Gaza war. The judge questioned using Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination to hold or deport Khalil, adding that Khalil's "career and reputation are being damaged and his speech is being chilled."
