            <h2>Harvard University Files Lawsuit Against Trump Administration Over Funding Threats</h2>

            <p>Harvard University is suing the Trump administration for threatening to withhold federal funding if the school doesn't comply with its demands, which include changes to diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. The lawsuit, filed in Massachusetts federal court, seeks to block the funding freeze, arguing it's unlawful and exceeds the government's authority. Harvard President Alan Garber stated the administration's demands seek "unprecedented and improper control" over the university, with real-life consequences for patients, students, faculty, and researchers. The administration's Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism had previously announced a multi-billion-dollar freeze on funding to the university, leading to this legal challenge.</p>

            <p>The article discusses the evolving dynamics of the Ukraine war and suggests that Russia is close to regaining control over key regions, potentially leading to a practical acceptance of Russian occupation by Ukraine. With the US possibly retreating from its role as a global security guarantor, the article explores the potential for China to play a more significant role in European security. It argues that while Russia's gains are a Pyrrhic victory, Ukraine is a major loser, and its NATO ambitions may be unattainable, even if it joins the EU.</p>

            <p>The US military stationed in the New Mexico National Defense Area has been granted authority to temporarily detain and search illegal migrants, marking a more active law enforcement role than in previous years. Service members with the Joint Task Force-Southern Border (JTF-SB) can now conduct security measures, provide medical care, and implement crowd control until law enforcement takes custody. The military can also assist with installing temporary barriers and signage upon request. This move is part of the Trump administration's efforts to curb illegal immigration and trafficking along the southern border.</p>

            <p>Nadine Menendez, the wife of former Senator Bob Menendez, has been found guilty in her federal bribery trial, mirroring her husband's conviction on similar charges.

She was found guilty of accepting bribes in exchange for the Senator's corrupt official acts. Bob Menendez was previously sentenced to 11 years in prison for accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from New Jersey businessmen.</p>

            <p>President Trump is considering invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807, a rarely used law that allows the use of active-duty military personnel for law-enforcement duties within the US, in response to immigration concerns at the southern border. The law grants presidents broad latitude in mobilizing troops for domestic operations, including quelling civil unrest and enforcing court orders. The Trump administration has already rolled out measures targeting the border, and this move could further expand the president's powers, despite border crossings reaching a quarter-century low.</p>

            <p>A controversy erupted between Governor Gavin Newsom and Senator Chris Van Hollen over the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident wrongfully deported to El Salvador. Newsom called the controversy a "distraction," while Van Hollen criticized Newsom's stance, emphasizing the importance of due process. The disagreement highlights a broader divide within the Democratic Party: whether to prioritize constitutional rights or focus on pocketbook issues that affect voters' economic anxieties.

            <p>A federal court in Denver is hearing a case challenging the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants. Immigrants' rights groups argue that the 24-hour notice given to those facing deportation is not "reasonable," as ordered by the U.S. Supreme Court. The ACLU argues that alleged Nazis were afforded more rights after World War II than Venezuelans facing deportation under the Trump administration. The Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportations, and the legal battle centers on the rights migrants have to challenge the government's allegations before removal from the U.S.</p>

            <p>With credit card debt at record highs and interest rates hovering near 22%, consolidating debt into a lower-rate loan can be an effective way to get ahead. For those with good to excellent credit, consolidation options like personal loans or balance transfer cards could result in significant savings. The effectiveness of debt consolidation depends on your credit profile, as those with poor credit may not qualify for favorable loan terms. It is crucial to address any underlying spending issues to avoid accumulating new debt.</p>
