          <h2>Japan Weighs Alliance with China Against US Tariffs Amid Trade Tensions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 05:46:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid escalating trade tensions, China has proposed an alliance with Japan to counter President Trump's tariffs, but analysts suggest this is unlikely due to Japan's prioritization of its security alliance with the United States. Chinese Premier Li Qiang reportedly suggested a united front to Prime Minister Ishiba to combat protectionism, as Japan faces tariffs on auto exports to the US and potential levies on other goods. Despite the economic risks, Japan is wary of undermining its relationship with Washington, making Beijing's overture potentially designed to strain US-Japan relations. The situation highlights the complex geopolitical landscape amidst ongoing trade disputes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government aims to eliminate the driving test backlog by next summer by providing at least 10,000 extra tests monthly. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander acknowledged current wait times are unacceptable and revealed plans to double training capacity for examiners and reintroduce overtime pay. The government also plans to crack down on test booking bots exploiting learners, with the goal of reducing wait times to no more than seven weeks by summer 2026. A record 1.95 million tests were booked last year, prompting the government to consult on changes to the booking system.</p>

          <p>A rapidly spreading wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, has forced thousands to evacuate their homes as it burns through the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area. The fire, which started Tuesday morning, has consumed over 8,500 acres and is only 10% contained, threatening approximately 1,320 structures. Mandatory evacuation orders are in effect for residents in Ocean Township, Lakewood, and Lacey Township, with the Red Cross opening shelters to assist those displaced. The blaze has also caused road closures and power outages, affecting over 25,000 customers, as officials urge the public to avoid flying drones in the fire zone.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk plans to reduce his involvement in the Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) following a significant drop in Tesla's profits and sales.

Tesla reported a 20% drop in car sales and a 70% profit decline, attributing the challenges to "changing political sentiment" and tariffs on Chinese parts.

          <p>BP shares experienced a 5% jump after activist investor Elliott Management revealed a stake of over 5% in the company. This development comes as BP shifts its strategy back towards oil investments to regain investor confidence. Elliott's involvement is expected to pressure BP to move away from its green strategy and focus on its core oil and gas businesses. BP recently announced plans to increase fossil fuel investments to $10 billion through 2027, marking a significant departure from its earlier commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050.</p>

          <p>The UK government is facing increased financial pressure due to higher-than-expected borrowing, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves seeking a trade deal with the US to avoid import taxes. Borrowing reached £151.9bn in the year to March, adding to expectations of potential spending cuts or tax increases to meet borrowing rules. The IMF forecasts lower UK growth for 2025, citing tariffs and rising inflation, while the government aims to boost growth amidst these challenges. The Office for National Statistics reported that increased spending on pay and benefits contributed to the higher borrowing figures.</p>

Trump indicated that tariffs on Chinese imports would decrease but not to zero, aiming to encourage the return of factories and jobs to the US.

The potential benefits of his versatility must be weighed against concerns about injury risk, practice time allocation, and overall value to the team.

Prosecutors will argue Weinstein exploited his influence to coerce women into sexual situations, while the defense is expected to highlight inconsistencies in the accusers' accounts.

          <p>President Trump's review of US-funded international organizations has raised concerns about the future of US support for the IMF and World Bank. Project 2025 proposes a US withdrawal from both institutions, labeling them as "expensive middlemen." Trump's tariff policies and inward-looking agenda could unravel the post-Bretton Woods global financial system. A US withdrawal may create a liquidity crisis for the IMF and World Bank, potentially benefiting China's global influence. Some analysts believe Trump may use the threat of withdrawal to negotiate better terms for the US.</p>
