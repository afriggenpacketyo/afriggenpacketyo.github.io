          <p>The federal government has released a second tranche of over 60,000 pages of records related to the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, as ordered by President Trump. These documents, which have been stored in federal facilities for decades, include details about the FBI's investigation, recordings of police interviews with Sirhan Sirhan, and witness testimonies. According to Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, the release is an important step toward transparency and uncovering the truth. While some records reference conspiracy theories, many details were already publicly known, and the documents have been digitized and made accessible on the National Archives website.</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group is being sued by investors who allege the company misled them by withholding information about the impact of a backlash following the killing of executive Brian Thompson. The lawsuit claims UnitedHealth artificially inflated stock prices by forecasting earnings per share of $29.50 to $30, despite a Senate report criticizing the company's claim denials and the public outrage after Thompson's death. After UnitedHealth cut its adjusted profit per share forecast to $26 to $26.50, its stock price plummeted, causing a significant drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The investors are seeking unspecified damages for the period between December 3, 2024, and April 16, 2025, also naming CEO Andrew Witty and CFO John Rex as co-defendants.</p>

          <p>Columbia University requested the New York City Police Department's assistance to clear pro-Palestinian demonstrators from the campus library after protesters occupied Butler Library, vandalizing property and clashing with public safety officers. Acting University President Claire Shipman stated the decision was necessary to ensure the safety of the community due to the number of participants, attempts to force entry into the library, and the presence of non-affiliated individuals. Gov. Kathy Hochul condemned the violence and vandalism, while Mayor Eric Adams emphasized the city's support for peaceful protest but intolerance for lawlessness. The incident occurred during the school's pre-final exams reading week, disrupting academic activities and prompting disciplinary action against violators of university rules.</p>

Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar specifically mentioned that J-10C jets were responsible for shooting down the Indian warplanes, including three Rafale fighter jets.

          <p>Tensions have escalated between India and Pakistan following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, with India launching attacks against Pakistan in retaliation.

The New York Times has been unable to independently verify these claims, but experts suggest the aircraft could have been downed by surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to keep its key interest rate steady for the third consecutive policy meeting, citing increased inflation risks. This decision comes as President Trump has pressured the central bank to lower borrowing costs, while officials worldwide brace for economic uncertainty stemming from Trump's tariff policy. The Fed's unanimous decision maintains the target range for the federal funds rate at 4.25-4.50 percent, as they adopt a wait-and-see approach due to the uncertainty surrounding the economy under the Trump administration's trade policies.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are working to pass a "big, beautiful bill" aimed at renewing tax cuts and slashing spending, but face significant hurdles in securing enough votes. The bill requires navigating disagreements among moderate and conservative Republicans, as well as addressing demands from President Trump, including no taxes on tips or overtime. Key sticking points include the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) and changes to entitlement programs, with Democrats accusing Republicans of manipulating figures to cover the cost of tax breaks. The legislation also involves a major hike in the debt ceiling, with Treasury Secretary warning of the approaching "X date" when the government exhausts its ability to cover obligations.</p>

          <p>West Virginia coal miners are losing access to free black lung screenings due to budget cuts mandated by President Trump at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).

          <p>President Trump criticized California Governor Gavin Newsom after Newsom requested collaboration on a federal film tax credit to "Make America Film Again." Newsom's request followed Trump's announcement of 100% tariffs on films produced outside the U.S. Trump stated the American film industry has been "decimated" by other countries and Newsom's "gross incompetence." He also criticized California's High-Speed Rail project and claimed he provided water to California during the January wildfires. Despite the criticism, Trump expressed a fondness for Newsom and challenged him to run for president.</p>

          <p>The 2024-25 influenza season has resulted in 216 pediatric deaths nationwide amid declining vaccination rates. In New York State, 25 children died from the flu, the highest number in recent years. Health officials attribute the heavy toll to decreased vaccination rates and particularly intense circulating strains. Only one of the 25 children who died in New York was vaccinated, highlighting the impact of vaccine hesitancy. The decline in vaccinations is linked to rising distrust of the scientific establishment, with statewide vaccination rates outside New York City significantly lower than within the city.</p>

          <p>Mainstream economic measures have been slow to reflect the impact of President Trump's tariffs and trade policy uncertainty, prompting economists to seek alternative data sources such as earnings calls and private-sector data. Evidence of the tariffs' impact includes decreased spending at McDonald's, fewer container ships at the Port of Los Angeles, and price increases by Procter & Gamble. The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady, partly due to the uncertainty caused by the shifting tariff policies. Economists are divided on whether the tariffs will primarily lead to higher prices, product shortages, or layoffs, with the situation reminiscent of the early days of the coronavirus pandemic when alternative measures were used to assess economic damage.</p>

          <p>Dozens of pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupied the main library at Columbia University, attempting to revive the protest movement from the previous spring. The protesters, wearing masks and kaffiyehs, renamed the space "the Basel Al-Araj Popular University" and hung banners, prompting the university to request assistance from the NYPD. The demonstration occurred amid ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and Columbia over the university's handling of antisemitism accusations, leading to the cutting of federal research funding. Acting President Claire Shipman stated that the NYPD's presence was necessary to ensure the safety of the community, as the protesters refused to identify themselves and a crowd outside created a safety hazard.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering eliminating the EPA's Energy Star offices, potentially ending the decades-old program that helps consumers choose energy-efficient appliances and save money. The proposed changes are part of a broader reorganization at the EPA, focusing on reducing air pollution efforts. The EPA launched Energy Star in 1992 to promote environmental protection and economic growth by boosting the market for energy-efficient products. Critics argue that cutting the program will make it harder for consumers to access trustworthy information about energy use and undermines efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
