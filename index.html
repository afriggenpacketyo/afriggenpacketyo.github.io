          <p>Authorities have found human remains at the location of a major explosion and fire at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The incident at Devastating Pyrotechnics left seven people unaccounted for, and officials have not yet identified the remains. The investigation revealed the property is owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant and the business lacked local permits to store fireworks. The explosion caused significant damage, leading to evacuations and a large-scale investigation involving federal agencies.</p>

          <p>Major LA Galaxy supporter groups, including the Angel City Brigade, organized a protest during a match to condemn the club's silence regarding recent ICE immigration raids affecting the community. The fans, a majority of whom are Latino, displayed banners with messages like "Fight Ignorance, Not Immigrants" before walking out of the stadium at the 12th minute. This action expresses deep disappointment with the team's lack of public support for its community, contrasting with other local sports franchises, and the groups also raised funds for pro-immigrant organizations.</p>

A survey by the UK Pride Organisers Network revealed that over 85 organizations have seen reduced corporate sponsorships, partly attributed to a shift away from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion policies in global corporations. Consequently, some Prides have been canceled or forced to charge for previously free events to cover rising operational and safety costs.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have successfully restored damaged ear tissue in mice by activating a "genetic switch," offering new insights into organ regeneration. The study, published in the journal *Science*, found that the inability to regenerate was linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a vitamin A derivative. By reactivating this disabled genetic pathway, the scientists achieved complete restoration of the lost ear tissue, including cartilage. This breakthrough provides hope that similar regenerative capabilities might one day be unlocked in humans.</p>

Critics argue that by emphasizing Taiwan's separate identity, the government is honoring the Republic of China's (ROC) wartime victory without acknowledging its pre-1949 mainland Chinese roots. The Kuomintang (KMT) government, which fought Japan as an Allied power, retreated to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the civil war. Lai's approach continues his party's policy of downplaying the historical connection to mainland China, creating a revisionist controversy.</p>

          <h2>President Trump Signs Sweeping Tax and Spending Bill into Law on Independence Day</h2>

          <p>On the Fourth of July, President Donald Trump signed his signature "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" into law, enacting a major overhaul of U.S. fiscal policy. The legislation makes his 2017 tax cuts permanent, boosts defense and border security funding, and implements significant cuts to federal safety-net programs like food assistance and Medicaid. While the president celebrated the bill as a victory, Democrats criticized it for benefiting the wealthy and projected it will add over $3 trillion to the national debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Clarifies New Bill Does Not Eliminate Social Security Taxes as Claimed</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 20:17:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to claims from the Social Security Administration, President Trump's new tax and spending bill does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits. Instead, the legislation introduces a new, temporary "bonus" tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors over 65 with incomes below a certain threshold. Policy experts clarify that this provides some relief but falls short of a full repeal of the tax, and it will not benefit low-income seniors who already pay no income tax.

          <h2>Supreme Court Allows Trump Administration to Proceed with Deportations to South Sudan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 20:12:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to deport a group of eight migrants with criminal records to South Sudan. The migrants, who are not from South Sudan, have been held at a U.S. naval base in Djibouti. The court's ruling clarified that a lower court judge's order blocking the removals was no longer in effect. This decision is a key development in the administration's policy of deporting individuals to third-party countries, a practice that is legally contested due to safety concerns for the deportees.</p>

          <p>The Madre Fire has rapidly grown to over 70,800 acres in Central California, officially becoming the largest wildfire in the state this year. The blaze, which started in the Los Padres National Forest, is only 10% contained and has prompted evacuation orders in San Luis Obispo County. Hot and windy conditions have fueled its exponential growth, threatening dozens of structures and spreading smoke across the region. A multi-agency response is underway, involving state, federal, and local partners to combat the fire.</p>
