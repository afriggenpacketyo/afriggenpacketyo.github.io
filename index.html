          <p>Russia has conducted its largest aerial assault on Ukraine since the war began, launching over 800 drones and missiles. The attack resulted in at least two fatalities, including a one-year-old child, and injured fifteen others in various locations across the country. For the first time, a key government building in Kyiv sustained damage, prompting Ukrainian officials to call for stronger international sanctions against Russia. Ukrainian air defense successfully neutralized a significant number of the incoming drones and missiles.</p>

          <p>The US Open has evolved from a traditional tennis tournament into a major cultural and commercial spectacle, mirroring festivals like Coachella. This transformation is characterized by high-priced luxury items, a heavy presence of celebrities and social media influencers, and a focus on creating a branded, aspirational experience. The event's economy now heavily relies on the attention generated by these elements, with organizers actively curating celebrity appearances to maximize social media engagement. This shift has created a festival-like atmosphere where being seen is as important as watching the sport.</p>

          <p>London's public transportation is experiencing significant disruption as Underground staff, represented by the RMT union, have initiated a five-day strike. The industrial action, which is the first to close the entire network since March 2023, stems from disputes over pay and working conditions, including a demand for a 32-hour work week. Transport for London has offered a 3.4% pay increase but stated that reducing the work week is not feasible. Commuters can expect little to no service on the Tube until Friday morning.</p>

          <p>Global financial markets are anticipating a volatile week, with a primary focus on European bond markets and an upcoming European Central Bank (ECB) policy meeting. Significant yield movements in French government bonds are being driven by political instability in France, raising concerns about investor confidence. The ECB is expected to keep interest rates on hold, but President Christine Lagarde will likely face questions regarding the economic uncertainty stemming from the French political situation. Investors are also watching for a key sovereign debt rating review for France by Fitch. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan is accelerating the development of a new fleet of low-cost, long-range attack drones as part of its strategy to counter mainland China's military arsenal. In collaboration with the US company Kratos, Taiwan's National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology is creating a suicide drone with a reported range of at least 1,000 kilometers. This positions the new UAVs as a cost-effective alternative to cruise missiles, capable of striking deep within mainland China. The development reflects a deepening of US-Taiwan cooperation on military technology.</p>

          <p>Sky-watchers in the UK have the opportunity to witness a total lunar eclipse, which will cause the full Moon to take on a reddish hue known as a "Blood Moon." The spectacle occurs when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow on the lunar surface. Visibility in the UK will begin at moonrise, with eastern parts of the country getting the best and longest view. Unlike a solar eclipse, this event is safe to view directly without special eye protection.</p>

The process, known as cavitation, is triggered by using a laser to rapidly heat a light-absorbing material, which boils surrounding water droplets. The subsequent collapse of the resulting vapor bubbles releases a powerful burst of energy capable of propelling the tiny jumpers high into the air. This technique offers a new mechanism for controlling movement in micro-robotics.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has expanded its operations in the Gaza Strip, ordering residents of Gaza City to evacuate to a designated humanitarian area in the southern region of Muwasi. The army stated the safe zone would be equipped with field hospitals, food, and water, but aid groups warn that a mass evacuation will worsen the severe humanitarian crisis. This development comes as the war, which began after the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, continues with a death toll in Gaza exceeding 64,000, according to local health officials.</p>
