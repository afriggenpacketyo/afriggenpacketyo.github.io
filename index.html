          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.1 billion, marking the fifth-largest prize in the game's history, following a Saturday drawing without a grand prize winner. The winning numbers were 3, 18, 22, 27, and 33, with a Powerball of 17. While nine tickets matched all five white balls, winning $1 million each, no ticket matched all six numbers. The jackpot for Monday night's drawing has an estimated cash value of $498.4 million. The drawing will take place in Tallahassee, Florida, and tickets cost $2 each and are sold in 45 states, as well as in other US territories. (not investment advice)</p>

LSU's Garrett Nussmeier connected with Trey-Dez Green for a touchdown in the fourth quarter, sealing the win. Nussmeier completed 28 of 38 passes for 230 yards, while Clemson's Cade Klubnik struggled with 19-for-38 passing and a non-existent rushing game.

Eduardo Rodriguez of the Diamondbacks pitched effectively, limiting the Dodgers' offense. The Dodgers struggled with runners in scoring position, going 1-for-8 and leaving eight runners on base.</p>

          <p>Justin Sun envisions a "Swift" system for the virtual asset sector, projecting that Tron's facilitated transactions will surpass Swift's within five years. Sun estimates Tron's transaction volume will reach US$8 trillion this year, with potential to increase to US$300-400 trillion. He emphasizes Tron's transaction speed compared to Swift's slower processing times. This confidence reflects Tron's growing influence in stablecoin transactions globally. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the US dollar.</p>

          <p>Thousands protested across Mexico, highlighting the country's enforced disappearances and demanding government action. Relatives, friends, and activists marched in cities like Mexico City and Guadalajara, urging President Claudia Sheinbaum to find the 130,000+ missing individuals. Most disappearances occurred since 2007 due to drug cartels and security forces. Many families have formed search teams, known as "buscadores", who face great personal risk. The UN has described the situation as "a human tragedy of enormous proportions."</p>

          <p>This commentary examines the case of Alix Tichelman, who pleaded guilty to prostitution and involuntary manslaughter in the heroin overdose death of Google executive Forrest Hayes. The author questions whether Hayes bears responsibility for creating the situation, as he arranged the meeting and invited Tichelman to inject him with heroin. The author also notes the surveillance video shows Tichelman stepping over Hayes' body, though it doesn't fully show her attempts to revive him. The author concludes that the issue of blame is ethical, not forensic, and leaves the question to the reader.</p>

          <p>Konami has released a remake of Metal Gear Solid 3, titled Metal Gear Solid Delta, a decade after the departure of series creator Hideo Kojima. Kojima left Konami in 2015 after an acrimonious split, leaving the popular game series directionless. Gaming has pivoted towards remakes in recent years, with successful remakes of games like Resident Evil 4 and Final Fantasy VII. Fans of the series say that Metal Gear Solid 3 was chosen for good reason, as it is a prequel set at the beginning of the series timeline.</p>

          <p>Learner drivers in the UK are increasingly facing abuse and intimidation from other road users, with instructors reporting daily instances of aggressive behavior. Examples include tailgating, flashing headlights, and shouting. Some instructors are installing dashcams to capture evidence of abuse. Police forces have received over 170,000 dashcam clips in the last five years, leading to action in around 70% of cases. Police urge people to have more empathy and be kinder on the roads.</p>

          <p>Scientists are using drones and sniffer dogs to combat the spread of the spruce bark beetle in UK forests. The beetle has been destroying trees across Europe. UK scientists have been fighting back, with an unusual arsenal including sniffer dogs, drones and nuclear waste models. They claim the UK has eradicated the beetle from at risk areas in the east and south east. The team is also deploying cameras on their bug traps, which are now able to scan daily for the beetles and identify them in real time.</p>

          <p>A California state bill that would have required Southern California Edison and other investor-owned utilities to remove decommissioned power lines to avoid wildfire risks failed to pass. Sen. Sasha Renée Pérez introduced SB 256 following concerns that a decommissioned power transmission line may have caused the Eaton fire. The bill would have also boosted wildfire resilience by improving mitigation planning and undergrounding power lines. Pérez expressed frustration, noting that utilities withdrew their opposition but the bill still failed to move forward.</p>

          <p>The temporary immigration detention center in Florida's Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," is closing down after a judge's order. The facility was built to house about 3,000 people but was never at capacity. Families of detainees describe harsh conditions, including inadequate medical care and limited access to legal counsel. Some Republican officials praised the facility, while Democrats described it as vile and unsanitary. The DHS said it will obey the judge's order, but is appealing the decision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The legal trade in US body parts raises exploitation concerns, as private companies acquire, dissect, and sell corpses for profit. While some see it as grave-robbing, others argue it's essential for medical research. The industry operates in a regulatory gray area, with the US's Uniform Anatomical Gift Act banning the sale of human tissue but allowing charges for "processing." The US has become a global exporter of cadavers. Horror stories include mishandling of bodies and exploitation of vulnerable families. A better system is needed to ethically and safely handle the donation of body parts.</p>

          <p>Figures suggest that pupils in England who missed school during the first week back in September 2024 were more likely to miss large parts during the rest of the year. More than half of pupils partially absent in week one became "persistently absent" – missing at least 10% of school. By contrast, of pupils who fully attended the first week, 14% became persistently absent. The Education Secretary urged schools and parents to ensure children attend at the start of the 2025 term.</p>
