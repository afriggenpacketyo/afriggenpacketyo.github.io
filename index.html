          <p>Catastrophic flooding in Texas has resulted in at least 80 fatalities, with Kerr County being the most severely affected, reporting 68 deaths including 28 children. Search and rescue operations are ongoing for at least 41 missing people statewide. A summer camp, Camp Mystic, confirmed the deaths of at least 27 campers and counselors. A flood watch remains in effect for parts of the Texas Hill Country, though forecasters do not anticipate a repeat of the initial deadly deluge.</p>

          <p>This article provides a harrowing account of the flash flood that engulfed Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' camp in Texas, leading to the deaths of at least 27 campers and counselors. The Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in about 45 minutes, destroying low-lying cabins and leaving a scene of devastation. Survivors describe terrifying moments and heroic efforts by counselors, while questions arise about the safety of locating camps so close to the river. The community is grappling with immense grief as recovery efforts continue.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 08:21:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In contrast to the tragedy at other locations, the Presbyterian Mo-Ranch Assembly, a summer camp near the Guadalupe River, successfully evacuated about 70 children and adults before the devastating flash floods hit. Camp officials, monitoring weather reports and rising waters on their own, acted proactively without an official warning from local authorities. This decision highlights the self-reliance of some camps in the face of the sudden disaster and raises questions about the official warning system. The camp suffered some damage but accounted for all its guests.</p>

          <p>The jury has begun deliberations in the retrial of Constance Marten and Mark Gordon, who face charges of manslaughter by gross negligence in the death of their newborn daughter, Victoria. The couple was on the run from police in early 2023 when the baby died in a tent on the South Downs. Prosecutors argue the baby was exposed to dangerously cold and damp conditions, while the parents maintain her death was a tragic accident. The couple has already been convicted of concealing the birth and perverting the course of justice.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting in Philadelphia's Grays Ferry neighborhood early Monday resulted in three deaths and ten injuries, including two juveniles who are expected to survive. Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel stated that officers had been monitoring the block over the weekend due to previous disturbances and were nearby when they heard the gunfire. Dozens of shell casings were found at the scene, suggesting a possible exchange of fire, and one person has been taken into custody with a weapon.

Potential consequences include market instability, with investors like Ray Dalio seeing signs of a late-stage debt cycle, persistent inflation, and a squeeze on national security spending as interest payments consume a larger share of the federal budget.

          <p>This article argues that the new nationwide work requirement for Medicaid, part of the president's "One Big Beautiful Bill," will be ineffective and punitive. Critics contend that it's not a measure to prevent fraud, as most eligible adults are already working or unable to, but rather a bureaucratic hurdle designed to push people off the program. Citing past state-level experiments, the analysis suggests the requirement will create immense administrative costs and cause millions to lose health coverage due to red tape, not a refusal to work, without significantly boosting employment.</p>

          <p>Zambia's new Cyber Security and Cyber Crimes Acts are causing significant concern among rights groups, who argue they threaten democracy and free speech. The laws grant the government broad powers to intercept and surveil all electronic communications and have moved the national cybersecurity agency under the Office of the President. While the government maintains the legislation is necessary to combat digital crimes like fraud, critics, including the Law Association of Zambia, warn that vague definitions and stiff penalties will stifle a free press, impact investigative journalism, and create a climate of self-censorship.</p>

          <p>Colleagues of Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez Zeferino, a 25-year-old farm worker activist in Washington state, believe he was politically targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Juarez Zeferino, who was instrumental in winning stronger heat protections and overtime pay for farm workers, was arrested in March and remains in detention. While ICE states his arrest was based on a prior deportation order, fellow organizers point to the Trump administration's aggressive actions against political opponents. They argue his successful advocacy made him a target, intended to silence him and intimidate other immigrant labor organizers.</p>

The funds went to Michigan Citizens for Fiscal Responsibility, a primary funder of the "Unlock Michigan" campaign.

          <p>Despite President Trump's persistent public attacks and threats against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, economists assert that his actual power to influence the central bank's policy is limited. The Federal Reserve is structured to be independent and nonpartisan, with interest rate decisions made by a 12-member committee through consensus. While Trump can appoint some members over time, his immediate ability to force rate cuts is minimal. Powell has publicly resisted the president's pressure, and economists warn that undermining the Fed's independence could lead to severe economic problems like high inflation.

          <p>California's pioneering 2021 law making ethnic studies a high school graduation requirement is now mired in controversy, threatening its implementation. The initiative has become a battleground over accusations of antisemitism, particularly concerning how the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is taught. This has led to lawsuits, a legislative effort to restrict the curriculum, and the governor withholding necessary funding. What was intended to elevate the experiences of marginalized groups has devolved into a bitter political fight, reflecting a national trend of polarization and culture wars infiltrating public education, even in a liberal state.</p>

          <p>The "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) movement, closely associated with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., frequently emphasizes the health risks of poor sleep. However, despite its importance to the chronic conditions the movement targets, sleep has been notably absent from the administration's actual policy planning. While MAHA followers advocate for lifestyle changes, from cutting out seed oils to getting more rest, creating effective government policy around sleep is challenging. This gap illustrates the difficulty of translating the movement's wellness advice into concrete, large-scale legislative action beyond its focus on food and vaccines.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is renewing efforts to strip citizenship from naturalized Americans through denaturalization, a move critics see as a tool for political repression. The Justice Department is prioritizing individuals with undisclosed criminal histories or those deemed a national security threat, but the rhetoric has also targeted political opponents. This strategy echoes the Red Scare era, when denaturalization was used to target individuals with disfavored political views. Legal scholars express concern that the push chills speech and undermines the security of the 24.5 million naturalized citizens in the U.S.</p>
