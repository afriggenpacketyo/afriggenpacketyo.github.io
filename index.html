          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran launched missiles at Israel, wounding at least 21 people in Haifa, Tel Aviv, Be'er Yaakov, and Nes Ziona, with searches underway for those trapped in collapsed buildings. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported approximately 30 missiles were launched, noting that no alert sirens sounded in Haifa despite an impact. The Iranian assault occurred hours after President Trump announced U.S. military strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites in response to Israel's "Operation Rising Lion." Since the operation began, Iran has reportedly fired over 450 missiles and 400 drones at Israel, resulting in 24 deaths, while Israeli strikes have killed 722 people in Iran across 25 provinces. </p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik's 2001 conviction for the murder of her husband, Bob, has been overturned after she spent two decades in prison fighting for her freedom. New testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed inconsistencies and previously untested spots. Working with the Loyola Project for the Innocent, the defense was able to prove that some of the blood spots were never tested and others were not blood at all, which caused the court to overturn the conviction. Dorotik expressed relief and determination to rebuild her life after her release, and is working with advocacy groups to help incarcerated women.</p>

          <p>Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that Tehran reserves all options to defend its sovereignty following U.S. attacks on three major nuclear enrichment facilities. Iran also launched its 20th wave of missile and drone strikes against Israeli military targets, with the IDF reporting missile offensives in western Iran. Araghchi condemned the U.S. attacks on Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan nuclear sites as having "everlasting consequences," and President Trump hailed the strikes as a "spectacular military success," though this claim has not been independently verified. The IAEA reported no radiation or contamination at the nuclear centers following the attacks.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have created a two-kilowatt fiber laser capable of operating without heating or cooling systems in extreme climates, ranging from -50Â°C in the Arctic to 50Â°C in the Sahara Desert. The device is designed for quick deployment for defense and industrial purposes, contrasting with similar lasers that require large cooling units. The innovation, led by Chen Jinbao, involves design choices including 940-nanometer pump lasers and a dual-clad optical resonator. The laser emits a lethal 1,080nm beam when pumped.</p>
