        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced plans to introduce new vocational qualifications known as V-levels for students in England after they complete their GCSEs. These courses are intended to replace existing Level 3 BTECs and other technical qualifications, aiming to simplify what ministers describe as a confusing educational landscape. The proposal also includes creating an alternative qualification to reduce the number of teenagers needing to resit maths and English GCSEs. Educational groups have expressed cautious optimism but also concern that V-levels may not fully fill the gap left by the popular BTEC qualifications.</p>

          <p>A fragile ceasefire in Gaza was broken after Israel launched a series of retaliatory strikes, stating that Hamas militants had targeted its forces, resulting in the deaths of two Israeli soldiers. The Israeli military confirmed hitting multiple targets in the Gaza Strip with aircraft and artillery in response to what it called a "bold violation of the ceasefire." Hamas denied involvement in the reported clashes, reaffirming its commitment to the agreement. Hospital sources in Gaza reported at least 38 fatalities from the Israeli strikes, marking a significant escalation in the conflict.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Nottingham Forest is reportedly in advanced discussions to hire Sean Dyche as its new manager following the recent dismissal of Ange Postecoglou. Dyche has emerged as the primary candidate after Postecoglou was sacked just 17 minutes after a 3-0 defeat to Chelsea, which left the club in the relegation zone. Dyche, who previously managed Everton and spent nearly a decade at Burnley, is seen as a strong contender to steer the club through its difficult season. The club hopes to finalize the appointment quickly to bring stability to the team.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay showcased his strategic adaptability in a 35-7 victory against the Jacksonville Jaguars, despite the absence of star receiver Puka Nacua. McVay deviated from his usual offensive playbook, heavily utilizing a rare formation with three tight ends to successfully counter the Jaguars' defense. Quarterback Matthew Stafford threw for five touchdowns on fewer than 200 yards, a testament to the effectiveness of the revised game plan. This coaching masterclass highlights McVay's ability to innovate under pressure and maintain the team's offensive potency even without key players.</p>

          <p>Chinese biopharmaceutical company Akeso presented highly positive trial data for its cancer drug, ivonescimab, at a major European medical symposium. The drug, a PD-1/VEGF bispecific antibody, showed a clear advantage in treating a specific type of lung cancer, with lower toxicity and higher efficacy compared to existing treatments. Following the announcement, Akeso's Hong Kong-listed shares initially surged before declining amid a broader sell-off in the biotech sector. Analysts noted the drug's potential to be a differentiated asset, positioning Akeso years ahead of its competitors in this therapeutic area.</p>

          <p>In her posthumously published memoir, 'Nobody's Girl,' Virginia Giuffre provides a harrowing account of the abuse she endured from Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, stating she feared she might "die a sex slave." The book details her allegations of being sex-trafficked to powerful men, including three separate sexual encounters with Prince Andrew, one of which she describes as an "orgy" on Epstein's island. The publication has placed the prince under renewed scrutiny, despite his previous denials and a financial settlement with Giuffre. The memoir paints a disturbing picture of a network of exploitation orchestrated by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>

The decline was driven by a persistent slump in the property sector and slower spending on infrastructure and manufacturing. While industrial production exceeded forecasts, the weakness in investment, particularly from the private sector, signals potential downward pressure on future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will cut financial assistance to Colombia and implement new tariffs on its exports, escalating a dispute over drug trafficking. In a social media post, Trump accused Colombian President Gustavo Petro of being an "illegal drug leader" and doing nothing to stop drug production. The move heightens tensions between the U.S. and one of its key allies in Latin America. In response, Petro vehemently rejected the accusations, defending his country's counter-narcotics efforts and describing Trump's statement as a threat to Colombia's sovereignty.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has found that revised medical guidance recommending the early introduction of peanut products to infants has successfully prevented an estimated 60,000 cases of peanut allergies in children. The research, which analyzed health records, showed a significant decline in allergy diagnoses after guidelines were updated in 2015 and 2017, reversing decades of advice to delay exposure. This real-world data confirms the effectiveness of the landmark LEAP trial, which first demonstrated that early introduction could reduce allergy risk by over 80%. The finding represents a major public health success in combating the rise of food allergies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have discovered a key factor behind the exceptional longevity and disease resistance of naked mole-rats. Their findings, published in the journal 'Science,' link these traits to a unique version of a protein involved in DNA repair, which is also present in humans. The study suggests that the enhanced efficiency of this protein in the rodents contributes to their long lifespan, which can reach up to 37 years. This discovery could provide a new molecular basis for developing therapeutic anti-aging strategies aimed at improving human health and longevity.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service discovered and investigated what was described as a "suspicious stand" in a tree near Palm Beach International Airport prior to President Trump's arrival in Florida. The object, which resembled a hunting platform, was found during a routine security sweep of the area. Officials stated that there was no impact on the president's travel and no individuals were present at the location. Sources indicated the stand had likely been there for months and did not have a direct line of sight to the president's aircraft during a period of airport construction.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have indicated they may move to have Patrick Fitzgerald, the lead defense attorney for former FBI Director James Comey, removed from his criminal case. In a court filing, prosecutors suggested Fitzgerald has a potential conflict of interest due to his alleged role as an intermediary in Comey's 2017 disclosures of memos to the media. Comey is currently facing felony charges for making a false statement and obstructing a federal proceeding.

          <p>A California Highway Patrol (CHP) vehicle was hit by shrapnel from a U.S. Marine Corps artillery round that detonated prematurely during a live-fire demonstration at Camp Pendleton. The event, held to celebrate the Marine Corps' 250th anniversary, required the temporary closure of a 17-mile stretch of the busy Interstate 5 freeway. No injuries were reported, but the incident prompted the immediate cancellation of further live ordnance firing over the freeway. California officials have expressed concern over the incident and are requesting a review of safety protocols for future events near public roadways.</p>

          <p>The British military will be granted new powers to shoot down drones that are deemed a threat to its bases in the UK. The plan, set to be announced by the Defence Secretary, introduces a "kinetic option" to allow for faster and more decisive action against potential aerial threats. This policy change follows several mysterious drone sightings over four British airbases used by U.S. forces last year. While the new authority will initially apply only to military sites, it could be extended to civilian locations like airports in the future.</p>
