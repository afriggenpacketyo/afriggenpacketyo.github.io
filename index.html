          <p>Hundreds gathered for the funeral of former Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, who were killed in a targeted attack two weeks ago. The service, attended by former President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, featured eulogies from Governor Tim Walz, who remembered Hortman as a uniquely talented and consequential leader. Speakers praised her commitment to public service, her ability to build consensus, and her deep humanity.

          <p>Following its 12-day war with Israel, Iran's government has deepened its domestic crackdown, executing at least six men on charges of collaborating with Israel. Human rights activists report these individuals were denied due process, part of what they call an accelerated "execution machine" to instill fear. The regime has also arrested over 700 people and implemented new surveillance measures, creating a climate of terror among citizens who fear the government is taking revenge on its own people. Many Iranians express fear of both their government and external conflict, feeling trapped in a dangerous post-war phase.</p>

          <p>The latest version of a major Senate budget bill would accelerate the phase-out of long-standing tax credits for wind and solar energy, a significant policy shift since their 2005 inception. The legislation also proposes a new tax on renewable projects that use Chinese components and offers new tax breaks for coal production. Clean energy advocates and industry leaders warn this could stifle investment, raise energy costs, and cede technological advantage to China. Conversely, opponents of green energy subsidies have praised the move as ending unnecessary support for the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered ancient radio signals that traveled for 10 billion years from a distant galaxy cluster known as SpARCS1049. The signals emanate from a "mini-halo," a vast cloud of high-energy particles and magnetic fields, which has never been detected so far back in cosmic time. Researchers, using the LOFAR radio telescope, believe these energetic particles have been shaping galaxy clusters for nearly the entire history of the universe. The finding provides a new window into how galaxies evolve, driven by phenomena like supermassive black holes or cosmic particle collisions in the early universe.</p>

Ohtani pitched two sharp innings, throwing 20 strikes out of 27 pitches and recording a 101.7-mph fastball, the fastest of his MLB career. Despite his strong performance, the Dodgers' bulk relief pitcher struggled, and the offense was unable to capitalize on opportunities against Royals starter Seth Lugo. While the loss snapped a five-game winning streak, Ohtani's effective outing was an encouraging sign in his recovery from a second Tommy John surgery.</p>

          <p>The Senate is scheduled to hold a crucial procedural vote on a comprehensive tax and spending package strongly endorsed by President Trump. However, its passage remains uncertain due to divisions within the Republican party over provisions like Medicaid cuts, state and local tax deductions, and a proposed debt ceiling increase. Senate leadership worked to secure enough votes, with some holdouts like Senator Josh Hawley eventually agreeing to advance the bill after securing state-specific funding. The White House has framed the bill's passage as a critical fulfillment of campaign promises ahead of the July 4th holiday.</p>

          <p>According to computer scientist Harry Shum, a former head of AI at Microsoft, China is rapidly catching up to the United States in the field of AI algorithms, despite a significant gap in chip technology. Speaking at a summit, Shum noted that while the U.S. remains far ahead in advanced chip production, Chinese firms are making major strides in algorithm engineering. He highlighted the Chinese startup DeepSeek, which achieved results comparable to top U.S. competitors like OpenAI using a fraction of the computing power. This suggests China is finding innovative ways to overcome hardware limitations in the global AI race.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly personally curating a list of top AI engineers and researchers to poach from competitors like OpenAI and Google's DeepMind.
