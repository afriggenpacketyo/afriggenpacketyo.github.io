          <p>Flash flooding in Ruidoso, New Mexico has resulted in at least three fatalities, including two children, after torrential rains inundated the area. The Rio Ruidoso surged to a record height, prompting dozens of swift-water rescues and sweeping at least one house away. This disaster is exacerbated by the region's recent history of devastating wildfires, which left the ground unable to absorb the heavy rainfall, significantly increasing the flood risk. The governor has declared an emergency to expedite federal aid to the affected community.</p>

          <p>Seven of the largest housebuilding firms in the United Kingdom have agreed to a £100 million settlement to fund affordable housing, thereby avoiding a formal ruling from the Competition and Markets Authority. The investigation centered on allegations that the companies illegally shared commercially sensitive information, such as sales prices and buyer incentives. While the firms do not admit wrongdoing, the agreement aims to resolve the matter quickly and ensure a more competitive market moving forward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A review led by former senior judge Sir Brian Leveson has proposed significant reforms to the UK's criminal justice system, including the use of judge-only trials for certain offenses like fraud to tackle a severe case backlog. With nearly 77,000 cases awaiting trial, the recommendations aim to prevent a "total system collapse" by speeding up justice. Critics, however, argue that removing the right to a jury trial for some offenses undermines a fundamental principle of the legal system and could impact fairness.</p>

          <p>The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has warned that an "exodus" of companies from the London Stock Exchange requires urgent government action. The group highlighted that 213 firms have delisted since 2016, citing the need for lighter regulation and better investment incentives to remain competitive, particularly against US markets. The CBI chair suggested potential changes to tax laws, such as altering cash ISA allowances, to encourage more investment into UK companies and support economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British TV presenter Gregg Wallace is facing new allegations of misconduct from an additional 50 individuals, which he denies. The claims, primarily involving inappropriate sexual comments and behavior, have emerged as an inquiry by MasterChef's production company is set to conclude. Baroness Helena Kennedy, chair of an industry watchdog, publicly advised Wallace not to dismiss the women's claims as fabricated, suggesting it would hinder any potential for a future comeback.

          <p>This opinion article argues that while Donald Trump made historic gains with Latino voters, his administration's current aggressive and widespread immigration raids are undermining that support. The author contends that instead of focusing on criminals, the operations are targeting long-term residents and families, creating fear and resentment within the community. Drawing a parallel to California's Proposition 187, which radicalized a generation of Latino voters against the Republican party, the piece suggests that the current cruelty could backfire and push Latinos away from Trump.</p>

However, the Department for Transport has expressed concerns about their impact on the revenue of state-run operators, leading to fears that the government may be seeking to limit or eliminate this competition.

          <h2>Hydrologists Note a Long History of Catastrophic Flooding on Texas's Guadalupe River</h2>

          <p>According to hydrologists, the deadly flash flood along the Guadalupe River in Texas was a known risk based on a long history of similar catastrophic events in the region, known as "Flash Flood Alley." Experts say the area's terrain causes it to react very quickly to heavy rainfall, and the river has experienced major flooding more than a dozen times in the last century. While the National Weather Service did issue a flash flood watch hours before the disaster, the key challenge remains pinpointing the exact location and ensuring warnings are received in time, especially overnight.</p>

          <p>Meeting minutes reveal that officials in Kerr County, Texas, the site of the recent deadly floods, have discussed implementing a modern flood warning system at least 20 times since 2016 but failed to secure funding or move forward. Despite acknowledgments that the county is in a highly flood-prone region, proposals were repeatedly stalled due to cost concerns and even opposition from some commissioners who deemed the idea "extravagant." This history of inaction is now under intense scrutiny following the catastrophic flood that claimed dozens of lives.</p>

The footage shows young campers on a bus being driven away from the devastated area, singing worship songs together as they pass by the rushing floodwaters and debris. The camp, where at least 27 people died, was severely damaged by what officials called a "catastrophic level" of flooding that washed away roads and cut off power, complicating rescue efforts.</p>
