          <p>An exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, is revisiting the complex legacy of the Plattenbau, the prefabricated concrete housing blocks that defined much of East Germany's urban landscape. These buildings were initially promoted as a socialist utopian solution to post-war housing shortages but later became symbols of social decay and extremism following German reunification. The exhibition, "Wohnkomplex: Art and Life in Plattenbau," explores this divisive architectural heritage through artworks that reflect collective memories and the painful transformations of the era. Curators aim to foster a nuanced discussion about belonging and community, moving beyond simple nostalgia for the former East Germany.</p>

          <p>A new book titled "Chinese Encounters with America" profiles twelve Chinese individuals whose lives were shaped by their experiences in the United States, highlighting a past era of cooperation and optimism between the two nations. The book features stories of academics, diplomats, and artists who fostered cultural and scientific exchanges, reminding readers of the shared interests that have since been overshadowed by intense competition and distrust. The co-editors argue that these personal journeys demonstrate the significant benefits of mutual understanding. They express concern that both countries have lost sight of the common ground that once defined their relationship.</p>

          <p>Nikos Michaloliakos, the convicted leader of Greece's neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party, has been granted early release from prison, sparking anger among left-wing political groups. Michaloliakos, who was serving a 13-year sentence for running a criminal organization, will serve the remainder of his term at home on health grounds. His party was linked to violent attacks on immigrants and the murder of an anti-fascist musician. Critics, including Greece's New Left and Communist parties, condemned the decision as a "blow to democracy" and a message of impunity for fascism, demanding that the ruling be overturned.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel drew scrutiny for incorrectly announcing that a suspect in the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk was in custody, only to retract the statement less than two hours later. The misstep occurred during a tense 33-hour manhunt that ultimately led to the successful arrest of a 22-year-old Utah man. However, the initial false report and mixed messaging from law enforcement created confusion and led to criticism about Patel's fitness for the job. Supporters attributed the error to the "fog of war" during a rapidly evolving investigation, emphasizing the final positive outcome of the operation.</p>

          <p>A wave of dismissals and disciplinary actions has swept across the U.S. as employers clamp down on speech related to the assassination of far-right activist Charlie Kirk. Teachers, firefighters, journalists, and even a Secret Service employee have lost their jobs or are under investigation for social media posts perceived as mocking or condoning his death. The Trump administration has also promised action against foreign nationals for similar comments, and the Pentagon is investigating military members. This has created a chilling effect, as conservative activists and groups actively compile and publicize objectionable posts to pressure employers into taking action.</p>

          <p>Peter Mandelson has been dismissed as the United Kingdom's ambassador to the United States after newly revealed emails showed the extent of his supportive relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The emails, published after Prime Minister Keir Starmer had initially defended him, showed Mandelson expressing solidarity with Epstein following his 2008 conviction for soliciting a minor. The revelations made his diplomatic position untenable, marking the third time Mandelson has been forced out of a government position due to scandal. The episode has created a political crisis for Prime Minister Starmer, who appointed the controversial figure.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed a bill that would permit state colleges and universities to offer preferential admission to applicants who can prove they are descendants of people enslaved in the U.S. before 1900. The legislation, part of a broader package addressing the legacy of slavery, is carefully worded to focus on lineage rather than race, in an attempt to comply with the state's ban on affirmative action. Proponents argue it addresses a legacy of exclusion in education, while critics contend it is a proxy for race-based preferences and may face legal challenges. The bill now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom's signature.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, historians of the American Civil War are noting worrying parallels between the current political moment and the dangerously polarized 1850s. Scholars point to similarities in widespread disillusionment with the Supreme Court, the use of troops in domestic matters, and spasms of political violence. They compare modern polarization to the "sectionalism" that tore the nation apart, cautioning that the reaction to violence and the perception of its inevitability can be as dangerous as the acts themselves. While emphasizing the country is not on the brink of another civil war, the experts highlight these historical echoes as a serious cause for concern.</p>

          <p>An opinion column posits that President Biden's decision to run for a second term acted as a roadblock for the next generation of Democratic leaders, including Vice President Kamala Harris. The author recalls Biden's 2020 self-description as a "bridge" to future leaders, suggesting he initially signaled a one-term presidency. By seeking re-election, he prevented potential successors like Harris from engaging in a normal primary process, leaving her with only 107 days to mount a full campaign after he eventually stepped aside. The article suggests that this delay, not Harris's campaign, was a primary factor in the party's subsequent challenges.</p>

          <p>The city of Santa Monica, California, has declared a state of fiscal distress, citing a combination of post-pandemic economic struggles and the staggering cost of sexual abuse settlements. The city has already paid $229 million in claims related to a former police dispatcher who abused children for decades and still faces 180 more claims. This financial burden, coupled with declining tourism and retail revenue, has pushed the affluent city to the brink of a financial crisis.

The proposal, backed by state Democrats, seeks to temporarily bypass California's independent redistricting commission to create five more favorable seats for their party. This would counteract the new maps in Texas and other GOP-led states, which were redrawn at President Trump's request.

          <h2>Boxing Experts Divided on Outcome of Canelo Álvarez vs. Terence Crawford Super-Middleweight Bout</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boxing analysts are offering split predictions for the highly anticipated fight between Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez and Terence "Bud" Crawford. Crawford, considered one of the best pound-for-pound boxers, is moving up two weight classes, raising questions about whether his technical skill and speed can overcome Álvarez's size and power advantage. Those favoring Crawford believe his adaptability and precise counter-punching will expose a potentially declining Canelo. Conversely, supporters of Álvarez argue that he remains the undisputed champion at 168 lbs and that his strength and experience at the weight will ultimately be too much for the smaller challenger to handle.</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly youth-led anti-corruption protests that toppled the government, Nepal has sworn in former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki as its first female interim prime minister. The "GenZ" demonstrations, which saw the parliament set on fire, were initially sparked by a social media ban but grew to encompass broader economic frustrations. After negotiations between the army, the president, and protest representatives, Karki was appointed to lead the country until new elections, which have been scheduled for March 5. Calm has reportedly returned to the capital, Kathmandu, as the new administration takes charge.</p>

          <p>In a new initiative aimed at addressing both declining birth rates and the need for scientific talent, Shanghai has introduced a subsidy program for female researchers returning to work after childbirth. The pilot program, starting with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, will provide a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (about $7,000) to 20 new mothers. To qualify, applicants must be under 40, hold a doctorate, and have given birth in the last two years. While the initial scope is limited, some female scientists view it as a positive step in supporting women's careers in STEM fields.</p>

          <p>An American woman recently released from Taliban custody has issued a dire warning about the health of an elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, who remain imprisoned in Afghanistan. The woman, Faye Hall, was arrested with the couple in February and described their rapidly deteriorating health in harsh prison conditions, stating they are "literally dying." Peter, 80, and Barbie, 76, who have lived in Afghanistan for years and hold Afghan citizenship, still do not know why they are being held. The UN has previously called their detention "inhumane," and there are urgent calls for the US and UK governments to secure their release.</p>

          <p>Several NATO countries, including Denmark, France, and Germany, are deploying additional troops and fighter jets to the alliance's eastern flank to bolster air defenses. The move follows an incident where more than a dozen Russian drones entered Polish airspace, an act Poland's prime minister called the "closest we have been to open conflict since World War Two." While Russia downplayed the incursion, NATO allies have condemned it as a deliberate provocation. The new mission, named Eastern Sentry, is designed to strengthen security and send a clear message of deterrence in response to heightened tensions across the region.</p>

While the wall has brought a tense calm to a village that often came under fire during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, many residents feel a sense of loss and depression.

This score broke the previous tour record for the highest score on a single hole by three strokes.

          <p>An opinion column reflects on the cultural environment of the 1970s and 80s, arguing that the sexual exploitation of young girls, as exemplified by Jeffrey Epstein, was once widely normalized in mainstream society. The author cites examples from movies, music, and art of that era where relationships between adult men and teenage girls were common and often romanticized. The article credits the feminist movement with fundamentally changing these norms by insisting on the principles of consent, recognizing power imbalances, and exposing the ubiquity of sexual abuse. It frames the Epstein scandal as a relic of a pre-feminist culture that has since been challenged and delegitimized.</p>
