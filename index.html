          <p>GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik stated that the U.S. is experiencing its most significant electric load growth since World War II, driven by economic expansion and national security needs. He emphasized that this infrastructure buildout is crucial for supporting economic growth and emerging technologies like artificial intelligence. Strazik also mentioned that GE Vernova's gas turbine orders are sold out for 2026 and 2027, highlighting the continued importance of gas in powering data centers and supporting renewable energy sources, suggesting gas is a 'force multiplier' for wind and solar energy development. The company's recent financial performance exceeded expectations, with shares climbing after posting a strong quarter and maintaining its full-year guidance.</p>

          <p>A Dartmouth College study published in "Nature" estimates that 111 fossil fuel companies caused $28 trillion in climate damage between 1991 and 2020. The study presents a peer-reviewed method for attributing specific climate harms to emissions from individual companies, aiming to hold them liable for extreme weather costs, similar to lawsuits against the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries. The top five emitting companies, including Saudi Aramco, Gazprom, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and BP, are tied to over $9 trillion in climate damage, with the research firm Zero Carbon Analytics counting 68 lawsuits filed globally about climate change damage. The study's authors argue that the scientific case for climate liability is now closed, making it possible to trace harms back to major emitters.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the U.S. government is liable to North Dakota for nearly $28 million in costs incurred while policing the Dakota Access Pipeline protests in 2016 and 2017. The state sued in 2019, seeking $38 million to cover the expenses of managing the protests, which drew international attention due to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's concerns about potential water contamination. Judge Daniel Traynor found the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers liable for failing to follow mandatory procedures, causing harm to North Dakota. The protests, which involved thousands of people, led to numerous arrests and clashes between protesters and law enforcement.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly considering exemptions for automakers from some tariffs, according to the White House. This follows reports that Trump plans to exempt auto parts from tariffs on imports from China, which were imposed to counter fentanyl production, as well as levies on steel and aluminum. The exemption would be separate from existing tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts. Automakers and auto policy groups have been lobbying Trump for tariff relief, while Trump has also suggested that tariffs on cars imported from Canada could increase.</p>
