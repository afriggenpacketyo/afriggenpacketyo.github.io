          <p>Hurricane Erin, currently a Category 2 storm, is projected to grow larger as it moves parallel to the U.S. East Coast. While not expected to make landfall, the hurricane will generate dangerous rip currents and high waves, prompting warnings and some beach closures from North Carolina to New York. Officials in North Carolina's Outer Banks have issued evacuation orders and storm surge watches due to the risk of coastal flooding. The National Hurricane Center is urging the public to heed local warnings, as the hazardous ocean conditions are expected to persist for much of the week.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has issued an urgent warning about counterfeit Labubu dolls, which pose a serious choking risk to young children. These knockoffs, sometimes called "Lafufus," can be small enough to block a child's airway or may break into hazardous small pieces. The agency advises consumers to avoid purchasing these fakes and to immediately discard any they already own. To identify authentic products from the seller Pop Mart, consumers should look for holographic stickers, QR codes, and specific design details like the number of teeth on the doll.</p>

          <p>Former LSU head coach Ed Orgeron has made a significant comparison, stating that Texas Longhorns quarterback Arch Manning is as skilled as, or potentially even better than, 2019 Heisman Trophy winner Joe Burrow. Orgeron, who coached Burrow during his historic national championship season, made the comment after observing Manning at a Texas practice. This high praise comes as Manning prepares to lead the top-ranked Longhorns into the 2025 season, starting with a major test against defending champion Ohio State. Manning himself has remained humble, acknowledging that public opinion is premature given his limited game experience.</p>

          <p>A trend in Silicon Valley sees tech giants like Google, Meta, and Microsoft acquiring top talent from promising AI startups rather than the companies themselves, effectively creating 'zombie companies.' These deals, which often involve massive licensing agreements, provide huge payouts to founders and key researchers but leave the remaining employees and investors in a precarious position. This practice allows large corporations to gain AI expertise while circumventing the regulatory scrutiny associated with traditional mergers and acquisitions. The article explores how this 'soulless' playbook disrupts the venture capital ecosystem and potentially stifles broader innovation by hollowing out independent startups.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has confirmed that he will start interviewing a list of 11 candidates for the next Federal Reserve chair shortly after Labor Day. The process is being expedited as the Trump administration pushes for interest rate cuts to stimulate the U.S. housing market. The diverse group of potential replacements for current Chair Jerome Powell includes current Fed governors, economists, and Wall Street strategists. Bessent reiterated the administration's belief that a significant rate reduction could facilitate a home-building boom, which would help control prices in the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the enduring disputes in the South China Sea are fueled by two mutually exclusive narratives, where one side's defensive actions are viewed as aggression by the other. This perception gap is rooted in conflicting national interests and ambiguous territorial arrangements left over from the post-World War II era. China bases its claims on historical precedent, while other nations interpret international treaties differently, leading to a stalemate. The author suggests that a peaceful resolution is unlikely without first narrowing this fundamental divide through a collaborative, fact-based process to build trust.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has described President Trump's commitment to security guarantees for Ukraine as a significant breakthrough following a summit at the White House. Starmer, a proponent of 'gratitude diplomacy' towards Trump, expressed satisfaction with the progress and the move towards a potential meeting between the Ukrainian and Russian presidents. Despite this optimism, anxiety reportedly remains among European officials about the future of the peace process. The UK and its allies have decided to fully support Trump's peace plans, aiming to ensure Ukraine is in the strongest possible negotiating position.</p>

          <p>Cholera, a severe intestinal infection causing rapid dehydration, is seeing a global resurgence, with conflict zones like Sudan being hit particularly hard. The ongoing conflict there has disrupted access to safe water and healthcare, leading to over 65,000 cases and 1,700 deaths. Children under five are especially vulnerable due to their less developed immune systems. The article explains that the disease is caused by Vibrio cholerae bacteria and spreads through contaminated food and water, not direct person-to-person contact. While an oral vaccine exists, global stockpiles are critically low, complicating efforts to control outbreaks.</p>

Using data from think tanks, maps highlight the front lines and contested regions, including the strategically important Donbas area. The report notes that any potential peace deal involving territorial concessions is complex, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has consistently rejected surrendering land. Furthermore, Ukraine's constitution technically forbids ceding territory, suggesting any agreement might involve freezing the front line rather than an official transfer of sovereignty.</p>

          <p>The invention of the thong bathing suit in 1974 was a political act of rebellion by Austrian-born designer Rudi Gernreich. He created the minimalist garment in response to Los Angeles banning nude bathing on its beaches, aiming to liberate the body rather than sexualize it. Gernreich, a gay Jewish man who fled the Nazis, was a pioneer of unisex fashion and a co-founder of one of the first LGBTQ+ rights organizations in the U.S. His work, including the controversial topless 'monokini' of 1964, consistently challenged societal norms and advocated for body positivity and freedom of expression.</p>

This trend is driven by rising singlehood rates and a cultural shift where men are placing greater importance on fatherhood as a source of purpose. Organizations like Men Having Babies report a significant increase in interest from single men, both gay and straight.

          <p>Spike Lee's latest film, "Highest 2 Lowest," is a contemporary remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1960s classic "High and Low," starring Denzel Washington as a wealthy music producer in a luxury Brooklyn skyscraper. The movie uses its thriller plot—a case of mistaken identity in a kidnapping—to explore themes of class disparity and moral decay. The review suggests the film also functions as a self-aware satire, with Lee reflecting on his own evolution from an independent artist to an established figure. While the film's beginning is described as choppy, it builds into a compelling thriller with a strong performance from Washington.</p>

          <h2>Experts Question Health Benefits and Regulation of Booming Supplement Industry</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-19 07:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the fact that about 60% of Americans use dietary supplements, their health benefits and safety are not well-regulated. The industry operates under a 1994 law that allows manufacturers to make vague health claims without undergoing the rigorous clinical trials required for medications. The FDA has limited power to intervene unless a product is proven to cause severe harm, leaving a market of an estimated 90,000 supplements largely unchecked. Health experts advise that most people can get necessary nutrients from a healthy diet and should be cautious, as taking high doses of certain supplements can sometimes be harmful rather than beneficial.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission has sent a revised draft of a joint statement on trade and tariffs back to the United States as negotiations continue. A European Commission spokesman confirmed the action during a press conference, stating that high-level talks between European and U.S. trade officials are ongoing. The two sides reached a framework for a trade deal in late July, but the European Union is still awaiting executive orders from the White House to finalize specific exemptions, such as those for the automotive industry. The process reflects the detailed and continuous nature of international trade diplomacy.</p>

          <p>India Walton, the Democratic socialist who won the 2021 Democratic primary for mayor of Buffalo, is advising progressives against watering down their politics to appeal to the establishment. Walton believes that her own pivot toward the center after her primary victory, such as softening her stance on charter schools, ultimately cost her the general election. She argues that the Democratic Party's losses among working-class voters stem from abandoning populist economic messages. With progressives gaining new momentum, Walton's advice to emerging candidates is to remain firm in their principles and resist pressure to compromise.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has effectively ended the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, a signature student debt relief program from the Biden era. As of August 1, interest has resumed accruing for the approximately 8 million borrowers enrolled in the plan, and the Department of Education is recommending they switch to other repayment options. This policy reversal is forcing many to face significantly higher monthly payments, causing financial distress and derailing long-term plans like homeownership and starting families.

          <p>An unusual trend has emerged within the MAGA movement, championing cow-based products like beef tallow and raw milk as part of a wellness crusade. Figures like Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy have promoted beef tallow as a healthier alternative to seed oils, and the ingredient is now appearing in skincare and food products popular with a conservative cohort. The article suggests this 'cow-based wellness' aligns with the movement's romanticization of a bygone era and traditional, rural values. This cultural phenomenon links agricultural products to a specific political identity, separate from their actual nutritional or scientific merits.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent court rulings and legal settlements allowing universities to directly pay student-athletes are fundamentally altering the financial model of college sports. For decades, profitable football and basketball programs subsidized numerous non-revenue sports like squash, rowing, and tennis. As athletic departments now need to allocate funds to compensate revenue-generating athletes, there is a growing fear that these less-popular, often upscale sports will be cut. This article argues that while paying top athletes is a long-overdue correction to an unfair system, it likely signals the end for many niche collegiate athletic programs.</p>

          <p>The global professional footballers' union, FIFPRO, is urging a swift resolution to an administrative crisis in India's top domestic soccer competition, the Indian Super League (ISL). The upcoming season was suspended indefinitely due to a contractual dispute between the Indian Football Federation and the private company that runs the league. This uncertainty has led some clubs to suspend player salaries and halt operations, leaving thousands of players and staff in limbo. FIFPRO has condemned these actions as a breach of labor rights and has called on all parties to establish a clear roadmap for the season to begin.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Poland suggests that doctors may quickly become overly dependent on artificial intelligence for diagnostic tasks, potentially dulling their own skills. The research, published in The Lancet, found that gastroenterologists were about 20% less effective at identifying polyps during colonoscopies on their own after just three months of using an AI-assisted system. The study's lead author theorizes that clinicians may subconsciously wait for the AI to highlight abnormalities rather than actively searching themselves. While some experts question the study's methodology, it raises important questions about how to integrate AI into medicine without eroding expert abilities.</p>

          <p>Despite recent gains with Latino voters, the Republican party may be making a critical error by assuming this support extends to its most extreme social and immigration policies. Polling data suggests that while economic concerns initially drew many Latinos toward the GOP, President Trump's approval with this group is now falling. A significant portion of Trump-voting Latinos express concern over aggressive immigration enforcement and its potential to increase racial profiling. The analysis argues that both parties have misread this diverse demographic, and Republicans risk losing their newfound support by failing to adopt a more nuanced approach.</p>
