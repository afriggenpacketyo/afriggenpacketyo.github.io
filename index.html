          <p>Lucy Connolly's 51-word tweet, posted after false rumors about an illegal immigrant being responsible for murders, led to a 31-month jail sentence for inciting racial hatred. The tweet called for mass deportation and setting fire to hotels housing asylum seekers. The Free Speech Union has supported Connolly, arguing the sentence is disproportionate and highlights police overreach regarding online activity. Others argue that Connolly's supporters are advocating for the right to be racist and that her tweet incited violence and should be held accountable for her words.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, a feminist author and activist, passed away at the age of 90. Her influential book "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual assault" redefined the understanding of sexual assault as a crime of power and violence rather than passion. The book's publication led to significant legal and social changes, including the establishment of rape-crisis centers and the rewriting of laws to facilitate the prosecution of rapists. Brownmiller's work sparked both praise and controversy, challenging societal myths and prompting critical discussions about gender, power, and responsibility.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada has invited King Charles III to open the 45th Canadian parliament, signaling a reinforcement of Canada's sovereignty and independence against perceived threats from US President Donald Trump. This move is viewed as a "theatrical display" meant to differentiate Canada from the US, especially after Trump's suggestions of Canada becoming a US state. The King's visit marks a rare occasion, with the last British monarch delivering Canada's throne speech in 1977. While the Canadian population's sentiment towards the monarchy varies, the invitation underscores the government's support for the Crown amidst political tensions.</p>

Refugee advocacy groups are calling for fairness and equal treatment under the law, arguing that all cases should be based on credible evidence of persecution.</p>
