          <h2>US to Impose 35% Tariff on Canadian Imports Starting August 1</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new 35% tariff on all Canadian imports, set to begin on August 1, escalating trade tensions with one of its largest partners. President Trump cited Canada's alleged failure to curb the flow of fentanyl as a primary reason, warning that the tariff rate could increase if Ottawa engages in further retaliation. This new levy is separate from existing sectoral tariffs on steel, aluminum, and autos, and comes amid ongoing trade negotiations that were meant to conclude by July 21. The move signals a continued aggressive trade posture, with Trump also indicating plans to impose blanket tariffs of 15-20% on most other trading partners. (not investment advice)</p>

His company, Arta Finance, has successfully raised over $92 million with backing from prominent investors including Google's CEO Sundar Pichai.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 00:01:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research from Princeton University reveals that threats and harassment against local school officials have surged by 170% since the COVID-19 pandemic. The study found that initial conflicts over mask mandates evolved into disputes over cultural issues, including LGBTQ+ policies and diversity initiatives, with officials across the political spectrum being targeted. Former and current school board members report receiving vitriolic messages and death threats, fueled in part by misinformation spread on social media. Despite the hostile environment, some officials remain committed to their public service, viewing the personal risk as a necessary sacrifice to continue their work.</p>

          <p>In a significant environmental restoration effort, China has demolished approximately 300 dams and shut down hydropower stations along the Red River, a key tributary of the upper Yangtze. The initiative aims to save the habitats of rare and endemic fish species, which have been severely impacted for decades. The dense network of dams had restricted water flow, blocked migratory routes for fish, and reduced suitable spawning grounds. This large-scale action is intended to rejuvenate the river's ecosystem and is considered a critical step in preserving biodiversity in one of China's most important waterways.</p>

          <p>Tensions flared in Ventura County, California, as U.S. Border Patrol agents clashed with protesters during a raid on what federal authorities identified as a marijuana facility. Agents, who were serving a warrant, used tear gas and less-than-lethal rounds to disperse the crowd that had gathered near the farm. The confrontation led to several injuries and drew sharp criticism from California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, who condemned the "senseless militaristic raids." In response, a CBP commissioner stated that 10 undocumented juveniles were discovered at the facility, prompting an investigation into potential child labor violations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is set to begin a significant reduction of its domestic workforce, cutting its staff by approximately 15% through layoffs and voluntary departures. The move, part of a broader Trump administration plan to reorganize the department, will affect nearly 1,800 U.S.-based positions but is not expected to impact overseas staff at this time. The administration aims to streamline operations by closing or merging domestic offices and consolidating functions to focus on what it deems core diplomatic priorities. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and the American Foreign Service Association, have expressed concern that these cuts could undermine American diplomacy and demoralize the workforce.</p>

          <p>A report from the UK's National Audit Office (NAO) has found that Britain's F-35 stealth jet program is being hampered by delays, infrastructure gaps, and personnel shortages, undermining the nation's warfighting capability. Despite the F-35 being technologically superior to previous aircraft, the NAO cited a "disappointing return" on the £11 billion spent so far, with the fleet's mission capability falling well below targets. The report also estimates that the full cost to expand the fleet will be over three times the Ministry of Defence's initial forecast. The MoD responded by stating the program is within budget and that two full squadrons will be ready for deployment by year's end.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a civil lawsuit alleging that prominent Georgia Republican figure Brant Frost IV operated a massive Ponzi scheme through his company, First Liberty Building and Loan. The complaint claims the scheme defrauded 300 investors of at least $140 million by falsely promising high returns from loans to small businesses, while instead using new investor funds to pay earlier ones. Frost is accused of personally misappropriating over $19 million for luxury purchases and political contributions, even as the business was collapsing. The company has since ceased operations, and Frost has agreed to SEC enforcement actions, with financial penalties to be determined by the court.</p>

Economists and central bank advisers have suggested that proactive fiscal policy may be necessary to stabilize the economy if rising trade uncertainties trigger a downturn.

          <p>A massive Martian meteorite, the largest piece of the red planet ever found on Earth, is being auctioned by Sotheby's and is expected to sell for as much as $4 million. The meteorite, named NWA 16788, weighs over 54 pounds and represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet. It was discovered in the Sahara Desert in 2023 after traveling an estimated 140 million miles through space, likely dislodged from Mars by an asteroid impact. Martian meteorites are exceptionally rare, making this auction a significant event for collectors and scientists interested in unlocking the secrets of our planetary neighbor.</p>

          <p>Hopes for a ceasefire in Gaza have dimmed as negotiations between Israel and Hamas remain stalled following meetings between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Trump in Washington. Meanwhile, the conflict continues with intense Israeli strikes across the Palestinian territory. In a particularly deadly incident, the U.S.-based charity Project HOPE reported that an Israeli strike killed 15 civilians, including 10 children, who were waiting for nutritional supplements outside its clinic in Deir al-Balah. The Israel Defense Forces stated the strike targeted a "terrorist" involved in the October 7 attack and said it was investigating the harm caused to uninvolved individuals.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump at the White House on the same day his company became the first to close with a market capitalization over $4 trillion. While the specifics of their discussion were not disclosed, Nvidia has been navigating U.S. export controls on its advanced AI chips, which the Trump administration tightened in April for national security reasons. These restrictions have effectively cut off Nvidia's sales to the lucrative Chinese market, a major concern for the company. President Trump praised Nvidia's stock performance in a social media post, attributing its rise to his administration's tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's threat to impose a 50% tariff on all imports from Brazil is drawing criticism for its overtly political justification and for stretching the legal authority he claims to possess. In a letter to Brazil's president, Trump cited the prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro as a "Witch Hunt" and a reason for the tariff, a departure from typical trade-based reasoning. The administration is invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the same law currently facing a federal court challenge over its use for broad tariff imposition. Critics argue this move is an abuse of power, especially since Trump incorrectly claimed the U.S. has a trade deficit with Brazil. (not investment advice)</p>

The lawsuit also claims Ye stalked Pisciotta after she filed her initial suit, including arranging a "swatting" incident at her home.

          <p>The famous red windmill sails of the Moulin Rouge in Paris are turning once again, 14 months after they were knocked down by high winds in an accident. The celebrated return was marked by a street performance of the can-can by 60 dancers and a fireworks display from the cabaret's roof. The original collapse in April 2024 was due to a mechanical failure, and while new blades were installed last summer for the Olympics, delays with a new motor kept them stationary. The restoration of this iconic symbol of Parisian nightlife, immortalized by art and film, was a joyous event for locals and tourists alike.</p>

          <p>South Korean singer Taeil, formerly of the popular K-Pop group NCT, has been sentenced to three and a half years in prison after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting an intoxicated woman. The Seoul Central District Court delivered the sentence to the 31-year-old musician, born Moon Tae-il, and two other men involved in the 2024 assault. The court noted the gravity of the crime, where the defendants took advantage of a foreign tourist who was unable to resist. Taeil was removed from his group in August 2024 after his agency, SM Entertainment, acknowledged the seriousness of the criminal case against him.</p>

          <p>Tesla has applied for permits to test and deploy its Robotaxi service in Phoenix, Arizona, aiming to compete with Waymo, which already operates a well-established driverless service in the area. The move follows Tesla's recent pilot launch in Austin, Texas, where its vehicles operate with a human safety supervisor on board. While Tesla is seen as a pioneer, it is now playing catch-up to Waymo, employing a different technological approach that relies more on cameras than expensive lidar sensors. The expansion comes as Tesla's initial Austin pilot has faced some documented issues, including a minor accident and traffic violations captured on camera.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the UK experiencing its third heatwave of the year after its warmest and sunniest spring on record, questions are being raised about the cause of the extreme weather. While some may dismiss it as "just summer," climate scientists emphasize that human-influenced global warming is unequivocally making such events more frequent and intense. Analysis shows that a 1°C rise in global average temperature can translate to heatwaves that are 3-4°C warmer in the UK. Today's heatwaves are more widespread and common than historical events like the famed summer of 1976, indicating a clear trend driven by climate change.</p>

          <p>Despite South Korea having the world's lowest birth rate, its fertility clinics are experiencing a boom in demand, with treatments rising nearly 50% between 2018 and 2022. This trend reflects a shift in attitudes, as more individuals and couples turn to technologies like IVF and egg-freezing to plan their families amid social and financial pressures that lead many to delay parenthood. The government has expanded subsidies for these treatments in an effort to address the country's demographic crisis. This rise in fertility treatments contributed to a slight increase in the nation's birth rate in 2024, the first in nine years.</p>
