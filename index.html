          <p>Bryan Kohberger has been sentenced to four consecutive life terms in prison without the possibility of parole for the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students. The sentencing followed a plea deal that spared him the death penalty. During the emotional hearing, family members of the victims delivered powerful impact statements, confronting the killer directly, while Kohberger himself declined the opportunity to speak. The judge called him a "faceless coward" before handing down the sentence, bringing a formal close to a case that has captivated the nation. The article provides extensive details from the hearing, including the raw grief expressed by the victims' loved ones.</p>

          <p>In a complex legal development, a federal judge in Tennessee has ordered the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national facing human smuggling charges. Simultaneously, another federal judge in Maryland has barred U.S. immigration authorities from immediately detaining him upon release. This legal tug-of-war stems from Abrego Garcia's previous erroneous deportation to El Salvador, which the government acknowledged as an "administrative error." His lawyers argue the new orders are crucial to protect his due process rights and prevent him from being unlawfully removed from the country again while his criminal case is pending.</p>

          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix has announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, surpassing market expectations. The company's success is attributed to the surging demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) technology, which is a critical component in chipsets used for generative artificial intelligence. This strong performance has solidified its position as a global leader in the HBM space, notably as a key supplier to AI giant Nvidia. The article highlights how SK Hynix has maintained its edge over competitors like Samsung and Micron in this lucrative market segment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, a stronger-than-expected performance that allowed the nation to avoid a technical recession. The growth, which reversed a contraction from the previous quarter, was primarily driven by a rebound in total consumption and a strong increase in exports. Shipments of key products like semiconductors and petroleum products showed significant gains. The positive economic data comes as South Korea navigates sensitive trade negotiations with the United States and as its central bank maintains interest rates to ensure financial stability.

          <p>Tesla has reported a 16% year-over-year decline in automotive revenue for the second quarter, marking its second straight quarter of falling sales that trailed analysts' estimates. CEO Elon Musk acknowledged the challenging period, suggesting the company "could have a few rough quarters" ahead due to factors like higher tariff costs and the expiration of federal EV tax credits. The article notes that the company's slump is also partly attributed to public backlash against Musk's political activities, which has impacted the brand's image in the U.S. and Europe.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's threats to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell represent a dangerous push for "fiscal dominance," where the central bank is subordinated to the government's political and borrowing needs. The author contends that while Powell's record is imperfect, pressuring the Fed to lower interest rates to mask reckless government spending is a hallmark of failed monetary systems. The article warns that such a move would inevitably lead to higher inflation, economic stagnation, and diminished confidence in U.S. Treasuries, treating a symptom rather than the underlying disease of excessive spending.

          <p>IBM's shares fell in extended trading after the company reported mixed second-quarter financial results. While overall earnings and revenue surpassed Wall Street's projections, driven by strong growth in its infrastructure and consulting divisions, the company's software revenue fell short of analyst expectations. CEO Arvind Krishna noted that some clients were reprioritizing their spending toward hardware. Despite the software miss, IBM maintained its full-year guidance for revenue growth and free cash flow, and reported that its generative AI book of business has grown to $7.5 billion.

According to the document, the bomb squad technicians who responded to a call about grenades found in a storage unit had X-rayed the devices and believed them to be inert. They transported the grenades to a training academy for disposal, where at least one of them detonated as they were being handled.

The incident nonetheless triggered a culture-war debate and left some loyal California customers feeling slighted by the owner's remarks.</p>

Chinese observers suggest this could significantly boost Beijing's geopolitical influence over its power-starved South Asian neighbors, including Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh.

This follows a period of softer sales that began late last year, which executives attribute to a broader consumer pullback amid economic concerns.

The term was then widely popularized during President Martin Van Buren's 1840 reelection campaign, as his nickname was "Old Kinderhook." His supporters formed "O.K.

Under current law, profits exceeding $250,000 for single filers or $500,000 for married couples are subject to the tax. The proposal, which was recently introduced in a House bill by Rep.
