          <p>Amid persistent inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to protect their money's buying power, with top accounts currently yielding rates higher than inflation. The article contrasts national average CD yields with the more competitive rates offered by online banks, which typically have lower overhead costs. It also explains the phenomenon of the inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs presently offer higher returns than long-term ones, and suggests strategies like laddering to maximize earnings in this environment.

          <p>A 42-year-old Peruvian woman has been arrested at Bali's international airport after allegedly attempting to smuggle over three pounds of cocaine concealed within a sex toy and her underwear. Indonesian authorities, who have some of the world's strictest drug laws, stated the woman could face the death penalty by firing squad if convicted. The case highlights Indonesia's role as a major drug-smuggling hub despite its harsh legal penalties, which have previously resulted in executions for foreign nationals convicted of similar crimes.</p>

The company noted encouraging signs, such as a 2.6% increase in transactions over $1,000 and improving sales trends throughout the quarter. However, executives acknowledged that a "deferral mindset" among homeowners persists due to general economic uncertainty, which continues to impact larger home improvement projects more than high interest rates.

          <p>Kentucky's governor has issued an emergency regulation to ban bromazolam, a potent synthetic drug known as "designer Xanax," making its sale and possession illegal. The move follows a request from the state's attorney general, who is also leading a coalition of 21 states urging the DEA to classify the substance as a Schedule 1 controlled drug at the federal level. The unregulated substance, which has never been approved for medical use, was linked to nearly 50 overdose deaths in Kentucky last year alone.</p>

          <p>Shares of Viking Therapeutics experienced a dramatic plunge of over 40% following the release of mid-stage trial data for its oral obesity drug that failed to meet investor expectations. While the pill demonstrated weight loss, the results were considered inferior to competitors like Eli Lilly's drug, particularly concerning the high rate of patient discontinuation due to gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and vomiting. The disappointing outcome has diminished hopes for the company to be a major competitor in the lucrative weight-loss drug market. (not investment advice)</p>

Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez linked the severity of the fires to the climate emergency, while experts also point to land management issues and depopulation in rural areas as contributing factors to the crisis.</p>

          <p>A new budget package passed by Congress will cause several popular clean energy tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act to expire sooner than originally planned. Homeowners and consumers now face accelerated deadlines to take advantage of subsidies for purchasing electric vehicles and installing technologies like rooftop solar panels, heat pumps, and storage batteries. For example, the 30% tax credit for residential solar installations will now end on December 31, 2025, instead of continuing through 2032. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new analysis explores the "New Right," a diverse movement of radical intellectuals who are hostile to liberal democracy and see Donald Trump as a vehicle for fundamental change in the U.S. This group, which includes factions like the "Claremonters," "post-liberals," and "national conservatives," has largely replaced the traditional Reagan-era conservative establishment with a more aggressive, authoritarian-leaning ideology. While internally divided on some issues, they are united by a focus on culture wars, economic nationalism, and a willingness to upend democratic norms.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has accused India of "profiteering" from the war in Ukraine by purchasing large volumes of discounted Russian crude oil and reselling the refined products to global markets. Since Russia's 2022 invasion, India has become Moscow's largest oil customer, a practice Bessent described as "unacceptable arbitrage." The accusation comes as the Trump administration imposes additional tariffs on Indian exports to pressure New Delhi, though some analysts note India initially increased Russian oil imports at the behest of the Biden administration to stabilize global prices.</p>
