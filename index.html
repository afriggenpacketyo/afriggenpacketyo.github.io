          <p>Following a powerful 8.8-magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, a tsunami warning for Hawaii was downgraded to an advisory and later lifted. The event prompted evacuations and shelter openings, but the resulting waves were relatively small, causing minor shoreline flooding without substantial damage. Alerts were also issued for the U.S. West Coast and other Pacific nations, but the widespread, catastrophic impact that was initially feared did not materialize. Officials confirmed that wave heights had peaked and the immediate threat had subsided.</p>

          <p>Certain widely used prescription medications, including some for heart disease, high blood pressure, and depression, can interfere with the body's natural ability to regulate temperature. Drugs like beta blockers and diuretics can reduce sweating or affect thirst perception, making individuals more susceptible to overheating and heat-related illnesses. Health experts stress that patients should continue taking their prescribed medications but must prioritize staying cool and hydrated during heatwaves. The article highlights the growing urgency of this issue as climate change leads to more frequent and intense periods of extreme heat.</p>

          <p>A growing number of high-income American households are falling behind on credit card and auto loan payments, signaling that financial instability is affecting even those earning over $150,000 a year. According to VantageScore data, delinquencies for this group have more than doubled since 2023, a faster rate of increase than for lower earners. Economists attribute this trend to a weaker job market for white-collar workers and rising housing costs, which are eroding the financial cushion these households previously enjoyed. This development raises concerns about broader economic health, as wealthier consumers drive a significant portion of spending. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Critics argue that the Trump administration's "Make America Healthy Again" movement, championed by officials like HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., unfairly blames individuals for chronic illnesses. The rhetoric attributes conditions like autism, diabetes, and obesity primarily to personal lifestyle choices, which patient advocates and medical groups say ignores systemic factors and fosters stigma. This perspective is reportedly influencing policy, contributing to decisions like cutting Medicaid and opposing federal coverage for anti-obesity drugs. The approach is seen by some as eroding trust in medicine and creating harmful narratives around health.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, a former NFL player provides a personal reflection on the recent Manhattan office shooting, where the gunman claimed to suffer from CTE. The author connects the tragedy to the culture of football, which he argues conditions players to ignore pain and hide trauma, and a society that fails to provide adequate mental healthcare. He contends that this silent suffering, combined with the easy availability of firearms in the U.S., creates a deadly combination. The article is a call to action for both the NFL and lawmakers to address brain trauma and gun access as interconnected crises.</p>

          <p>The term "dude" has a rich history that traces back to the 1880s in New York City, where it was used to describe overly fashionable, effeminate young men. The word likely referenced "Yankee Doodle" and was popularized by a poem meant to mock the trend. It later evolved to describe East Coast city dwellers visiting western "dude ranches" in elaborate cowboy attire. By the mid-20th century, the term was adopted by Black and Mexican American communities as a marker of solidarity before entering mainstream surfer and skater culture, eventually becoming a widely used, gender-neutral term of familiarity.</p>

          <p>A new study on Great Tits, a common European songbird, has found that some mated pairs effectively "divorce" at the end of a breeding season. Using radio tags to track their social interactions, researchers at the University of Oxford observed that while many pairs remained together through the winter, others gradually drifted apart. These "divorcing" birds associated with each other less and less over time, suggesting they were forming new social bonds ahead of the next breeding season. The findings underscore the complex and significant role of social relationships in the animal kingdom.</p>

The research, conducted by the Center for Election Innovation & Research, reviewed state-level data and found that official investigations consistently uncover only a minuscule number of cases. Election experts note that safeguards and the severe legal consequences, including deportation, serve as powerful deterrents.

The author connects this phenomenon to a broader cultural policing of Black masculinity, where expressions of joy, softness, or flamboyance are often met with homophobic ridicule. Despite having the best season of his career, Towns became an unwilling avatar in a culture war over what a male athlete is supposed to be. The piece argues that this scrutiny is a modern repackaging of old accusations meant to enforce rigid, humorless norms of masculinity.</p>

          <p>Australia's headline inflation rate fell to 2.1% in the second quarter, its lowest level since March 2021 and below economists' expectations. The slowdown brings inflation almost to the bottom of the Reserve Bank of Australia's target range, strengthening the case for an interest rate cut at its next meeting. The RBA has already cut rates twice this year but held them steady in its last meeting to confirm the downward trend. Analysts now believe this new data provides sufficient evidence for the bank to proceed with another cut to stimulate the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Most Immigrants Arrested in Los Angeles Raids Have No Criminal Record</h2>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's rhetoric about deporting "the worst of the worst," data from recent ICE raids in the Los Angeles area reveals a different reality. An analysis found that in June, nearly 70% of immigrants arrested had no criminal convictions, a sharp increase from previous months. Advocates argue this trend debunks claims that enforcement is focused on public safety threats, showing instead that workers and families are being targeted. The discrepancy between the administration's messaging and the on-the-ground reality is fueling criticism and appears to be contributing to declining public support for the deportation agenda.</p>

          <p>A tsunami alert for Shanghai and China's east coast, issued after a major earthquake in Russia, was canceled on Wednesday afternoon. Authorities had warned of waves up to one meter, but the threat subsided without incident. Now, the region is preparing for the arrival of Typhoon Co-May, a severe tropical storm expected to make landfall with strong winds and heavy rainfall. The storm is the eighth of the season and has prompted authorities in Zhejiang province and Shanghai to issue new warnings as residents pivot from one natural threat to another.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Israel has intentionally and openly used starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza, constituting a crime that is playing out in plain sight. The author cites explicit statements from Israeli officials about imposing a complete siege and details how aid has been systematically blocked, aid workers killed, and agricultural land destroyed. The piece contends that this has been facilitated by the complicity of Western allies, including the U.S. and U.K., who have ignored evidence and continued to provide support. The author concludes that history and courts will ultimately hold the perpetrators and their enablers accountable.</p>

          <p>Germany's government is set to approve a 2026 draft budget that includes significant new borrowing and €126.7 billion in investments aimed at modernizing the country. This high-spending plan comes as new data reveals the German economy shrank by 0.1% in the second quarter, continuing a period of stagnation. Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil has warned that significant austerity measures will likely be necessary starting in 2027 to address a major funding gap. The budget reflects the government's bet that increased spending can spur growth despite the current economic weakness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Swiss banking giant UBS reported a second-quarter net profit of $2.4 billion, doubling its profit from the previous year and beating analyst expectations. The strong performance was driven by its investment bank and global wealth management divisions, which benefited from high market volatility. Despite the positive results, CEO Sergio Ermotti noted that clients remain in a "wait-and-see" mode due to persistent macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties. The bank also confirmed it is on track with its integration of Credit Suisse and will continue its share buyback program. (not investment advice)</p>
