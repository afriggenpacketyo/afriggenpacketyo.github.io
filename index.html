          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that long-term interest rates are likely to increase as the economy evolves and policy remains in flux. He highlighted the possibility of more frequent and persistent supply shocks, creating challenges for the economy and central banks. While Powell didn't directly mention President Trump's tariffs, he acknowledged their potential to slow growth and increase inflation. The Fed has been cautious about easing policy after reducing its benchmark rate by a full percentage point last year, amidst these considerations.</p>

Despite partial paralysis, Smith has made significant progress through physical therapy and is back singing with his rock band.

          <p>A Texas mother, Ashley Pardo, was arrested for allegedly purchasing ammunition and tactical gear for her son, who authorities believe was planning "mass targeted violence" at a San Antonio school.

Some New York congressmen representing suburban districts want the cap abolished or raised substantially, while others support a more modest increase. The House Ways and Means Committee approved a measure to raise the cap to $30,000, but the issue remains unresolved.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals that fewer middle-class Americans can afford to buy a home due to rising prices and mortgage rates, with only about 1 in 5 listed homes affordable for households earning $75,000 annually. The affordability gap stems from a shortage of affordable homes and restrictive zoning regulations in many regions. Cities with the worst affordability gaps include Los Angeles and areas in Pennsylvania, while cities like Raleigh-Cary, North Carolina, show improvement.

Critics worry that reduced staffing could slow decision-making, weaken oversight, and diminish transparency, potentially leading to a nuclear mishap.

          <p>The Trump administration is accusing state authorities and non-profits of illegal activities for providing food and shelter to migrants, despite these services being funded by federal programs and the migrants having been processed and released by immigration officials. The administration has also withheld funds owed to service providers, alleging that government money has gone toward institutions engaged in or facilitating illegal activities. Fema responded by blaming the Biden administration for spending “hundreds of millions of federal dollars housing illegal aliens in our country on American taxpayers’ dime”.</p>

          <p>Despite the White House touting the recent agreement with China to pause tariff increases as a "historic win," diplomatic observers suggest the deal validates Beijing's strategy of defiance against "economic bullying." They caution that the 90-day truce will not prevent long-term confrontations and call for early preparation to address persistent sticking points in bilateral ties. Wu Xinbo of Fudan University noted that China's firm stance was crucial in achieving this outcome, but warned against harboring illusions due to Trump's combative volatility.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to remove Endangered Species Act protections for the lesser prairie-chicken, a groundbird in the southern Great Plains. The administration argues that federal officials made an error when listing the bird, claiming there was insufficient information to show distinct populations. This move is seen as prioritizing oil and gas drilling over environmental safeguards, potentially endangering other species in oil-rich regions. The effort to delist the prairie-chicken puts other threatened species in an even more precarious spot.</p>

          <p>LA28, the committee planning the 2028 Summer Olympics in L.A., is partnering with Archer Aviation to assemble a fleet of electric air taxis to divert traffic. These air taxis will offer 10- to 20-minute flights between vertiports throughout the city, including SoFi Stadium and LAX. The initiative is part of a large-scale effort to create a “car-free” Olympics and improve sustainable transportation. Archer's air taxis will also provide emergency services and security support at the Games, with prices potentially on par with high-end ride shares like Uber Lux.</p>
