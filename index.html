          <p>World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency firm associated with Donald Trump, revealed plans to introduce new products, including a debit card and tokenized commodities. Speaking at a conference in Singapore, CEO Zach Witkoff and co-founder Donald Trump Jr. outlined the vision to bridge crypto with everyday spending and trade assets like oil and gas on the blockchain. The company's stablecoin, USD1, has already become the fifth-largest globally, reflecting a broader trend of the Trump administration embracing the crypto industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford Motor Company reported an 8.2% increase in its third-quarter U.S. sales, driven by strong demand for electric vehicles and large SUVs. Sales of all-electric models surged by 30.2% to a new record, while SUV sales grew by nearly 10%. The growth in EV sales was partly attributed to consumers purchasing vehicles before the expiration of federal incentives. However, CEO Jim Farley anticipates a potential drop in EV market share once the incentive program concludes.</p>

          <p>A political debate has erupted over President Trump's comments suggesting the military could be used as a training ground in "dangerous" American cities. Speaker Mike Johnson framed the remarks as being "cherry-picked" and evidence of Trump taking crime seriously. In contrast, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called the remarks "deeply disturbing," emphasizing that the military's role is to protect against external threats, not to target American citizens. The discussion highlights the stark partisan divide on the use of military force for domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Internet services have been restored across Afghanistan following a two-day shutdown imposed by the Taliban government without explanation. The blackout paralyzed the country, disrupting communications, flights, and banking services, compounding an already severe humanitarian crisis. The restoration came after the United Nations warned the outage risked harming the Afghan people and called for its immediate reversal. The incident underscores the ongoing instability and authoritarian control since the Taliban regained power in 2021.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell after a report from ADP showed a surprise decline of 32,000 private payroll jobs in September. This data gained extra significance as the U.S. government shutdown, which began Wednesday, is delaying the official September jobs report. The shutdown stems from a legislative impasse over a temporary spending bill, with President Trump criticizing Democrats and threatening permanent layoffs of federal workers, adding a new layer of economic risk.

          <p>A federal judge in Idaho determined that a public charter school infringed upon a church's First Amendment rights by canceling its lease for Sunday services. The school, Sage International, terminated the agreement while applying for state-backed bonds, fearing the lease would violate a state amendment preventing public funds from benefiting religious groups. However, Chief U.S. District Judge David Nye ruled that the church would have only benefited incidentally and that the school's action unconstitutionally stifled religious speech. The decision was praised by Idaho's Attorney General as a protection against religious discrimination.</p>

          <p>The British High Court has ordered PPE Medpro, a company connected to entrepreneur Michelle Mone and her husband, to repay the government over £121 million ($163 million) for a breached contract. The court found that the 25 million surgical gowns supplied by the firm during the COVID-19 pandemic were not sterile and therefore could not be used by the National Health Service.

This "livestock landscaping" aims to reduce reliance on gas-powered mowers, lower the carbon footprint of groundskeeping, and prevent soil erosion. The animals are contained by virtual fences using special collars that also transmit data to the herd's owner.

This agreement sets a precedent for other major drugmakers to strike similar deals, providing them with a path to avoid the levies.

          <p>The U.S. government is set to acquire a 5% equity stake in Canadian mining company Lithium Americas and a separate 5% stake in its Thacker Pass project in Nevada. This move is part of a renegotiated $2.2 billion federal loan aimed at boosting domestic production of lithium, a critical mineral for electric vehicle batteries. The deal allows the company to defer a portion of its loan repayment in exchange for the government's ownership stakes. The announcement caused the company's stock to surge over 35%, reflecting strong investor confidence in the project's future.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Gaza Peace Plan is an Unrealistic Fantasy Tailored to Israeli Demands</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's 20-point peace plan for Gaza, while seemingly embraced by Israel's government, is a fantasy that ignores critical realities. The author contends the plan reads like a list of Israeli demands rather than a viable compromise, with significant holes regarding Hamas's approval and the practical implementation of an international stabilization force. Furthermore, the plan lacks concrete details on funding for Gaza's reconstruction and fails to address the core political issue of Palestinian statehood. The piece suggests that for many Israelis, the plan offers a convenient way to close the book on the conflict without engaging with its devastating consequences for Palestinians.</p>

The court heard that the men exploited the vulnerable girls, who were as young as 13, treating them as "sex slaves" and plying them with drugs and alcohol.

While the iconic sausage roll will not be affected in this round, the move reflects a broader trend of price increases across the UK high street. The company still plans to expand, with a net 120 new shops scheduled to open in 2025.</p>

          <p>This analysis suggests that despite its flaws, Hamas may strategically accept President Trump's 20-point peace plan for Gaza. The author argues that while the plan heavily favors Israeli interests and contains colonial undertones, it offers immediate relief to suffering Palestinians and a chance for Hamas to shift its focus. By agreeing to the deal, Hamas could end the war, gain some international goodwill, and pivot its efforts toward building political influence in the West Bank, the true center of Palestinian power. This move would put pressure on Israel and could be a more pragmatic path for Hamas than continuing a draining insurgency.</p>

          <p>A new report from TD Bank indicates that American consumers are increasingly relying on credit cards to cover essential purchases, with groceries and gasoline being the primary sources of financial strain. Groceries were cited by 46% of respondents as their top credit card spending category, and nearly half said their spending on food increased the most over the past year. This trend of leaning on credit to afford non-discretionary items comes as overall credit card balances have risen to near all-time highs.

Instead, they are turning to alternative assets to "shockproof" their wealth, with a notable interest in Bitcoin, which is increasingly viewed as a secure store of value rather than just a speculative asset. While equities remain the dominant long-term holding, this shift reflects a cautious approach to navigating current economic uncertainty.
