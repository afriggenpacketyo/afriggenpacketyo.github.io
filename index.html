          <p>The GOP-led House Oversight Committee has received documents from the Jeffrey Epstein estate, including a "birthday book" that reportedly contains a letter from Donald Trump. Democrats on the committee released a photo of the purported letter, which Trump has previously denied writing and is the subject of a defamation lawsuit he filed against The Wall Street Journal. The documents, which include financial records and flight logs, are part of the committee's ongoing bipartisan investigation into the late financier's network. The release of all documents to the public is not yet confirmed.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is scheduled to accompany President Donald Trump on a state visit to the United Kingdom, joining other prominent U.S. business leaders. This move highlights Nvidia's strategic efforts to maintain a positive relationship with the Trump administration as the company seeks new licenses to sell its advanced AI chips in China. Huang has been actively engaging with the president to argue that allowing these exports benefits U.S. national security by ensuring American leadership in the artificial intelligence race. This follows previous successful negotiations for waivers on other chip sales to China.</p>

As the UN's primary representative body, it operates on a "one state, one vote" basis, allowing for equal representation on issues like economic policy, security, and climate change. Although its resolutions are non-binding, they carry significant normative power and can set the stage for legally enforceable treaties.

          <p>President Donald Trump has continued to suggest federal intervention in Chicago, stating, "We'd love to go into Chicago and straighten it out." His comments follow a controversial social media post referencing the "Department of War," which drew sharp criticism from Illinois leaders. While Trump has since downplayed the post, his administration has launched an expanded ICE operation in the area. Officials in Illinois, New York, and Los Angeles have strongly opposed the idea of deploying federal troops in their cities, viewing it as an unnecessary militarization.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a weak August jobs report, traders are increasingly certain the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, with an 88% chance priced in for a quarter-point reduction. However, a minority of market participants are leaving open the possibility of a more aggressive half-point cut, similar to a move made in 2024. The central bank faces a difficult decision, balancing a weakening labor market against inflation that remains above its target.

          <p>Prince Harry has returned to the United Kingdom for a series of engagements, beginning with an appearance at the WellChild charity awards in London. His visit coincides with the third anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's death, and he privately paid his respects by laying a wreath at her burial site in Windsor. During the awards ceremony, he met with children facing serious health issues and delivered a speech praising their courage. The Prince and Princess of Wales also marked the anniversary by attending a separate event with the Women's Institute, an organization the late Queen long supported.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, has lifted a lower court's injunction, allowing the Trump administration to resume immigration enforcement stops in Los Angeles that were previously restricted. The lower court had barred federal agents from stopping individuals based solely on factors like their apparent race, their use of Spanish, or their presence at a day-laborer site. In a scathing dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued the majority's decision effectively legalizes the racial profiling of Latinos. This ruling is a significant development in the administration's broader immigration crackdown.</p>

Survivors may also receive additional funds through separate negotiations with the archdiocese's primary insurer.

          <p>The Metropolitan Water District is offering a significant incentive of $7 per square foot to businesses, schools, and other public institutions in Southern California to replace nonfunctional grass lawns. This rebate, the largest ever offered by the agency, aims to encourage the adoption of sustainable, drought-tolerant landscapes. The program is a proactive measure to prepare for a new state law taking effect in 2027 that will prohibit the use of potable water on such lawns. The goal is to conserve vast amounts of water while also promoting biodiversity and beautifying properties.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected a lawsuit filed by 19 states and the District of Columbia challenging the Trump administration's mass firing of thousands of federal probationary workers. The court ruled 2-1 that the states lacked the legal standing to sue, stating that the management of the federal workforce is a federal function. This decision overturns a lower court's order that had required the reinstatement of the affected employees and sends the case back to be dismissed. The layoffs were part of the administration's initiative to reduce the size of the federal government.</p>

          <p>Following a routine victory against Andorra, this article examines the often predictable and unexciting nature of England's World Cup qualifying matches. Despite an impressive unbeaten streak in qualifiers since 2009, these games are frequently seen as formalities that lack the jeopardy and thrill of major tournaments. The piece reflects on memorable exceptions, like David Beckham's 2001 free-kick against Greece, while noting that most qualifiers involve England comfortably defeating inferior opponents. This raises questions about whether these matches truly gauge the team's readiness for the challenges of a World Cup.</p>

          <p>Two separate reports, including an independent review by the law firm Latham & Watkins, have found no evidence of misuse of funds by the disaster-relief charity FireAid. The organization, which raised nearly $100 million for Southern California wildfire victims, had faced public scrutiny and calls for investigation over its grant distribution process. The audits concluded that FireAid acted in accordance with its mission, implemented strong accountability measures, and effectively distributed aid to affected communities through vetted local nonprofit organizations. The findings aim to counter misinformation and restore confidence in the charity's operations.</p>

Citing over 205 in-custody deaths in four years, the state is seeking comprehensive court-ordered reform, stating that litigation became necessary after the county refused to comply with demands for improvement.</p>

          <p>Jack Draper, the top-ranked British men's tennis player, has announced he will miss the remainder of the season because of an arm injury. The issue, which caused him to withdraw from the US Open, requires a significant period of rest and recovery. The decision ends his hopes of qualifying for the prestigious season-ending ATP Finals and will likely see his world ranking fall from its current position of seventh.

The Solicitor General argued that being forced to release the approximately $4 billion in funds before they expire on September 30th constitutes a "grave and urgent threat" to the president's authority in foreign affairs. This legal battle is the latest in a series of conflicts over the executive branch's power to withhold funds appropriated by the legislature, with aid groups warning of severe humanitarian consequences.</p>

          <p>The recent collapse of France's government has intensified concerns about the country's massive public debt, which stands at €3.35 trillion, and its potential to destabilize the entire eurozone. Economists warn that the political paralysis makes it difficult to implement necessary budget cuts to reduce the nation's large deficit, which is the highest in the EU. While financial markets have so far remained relatively calm, the crisis in Europe's second-largest economy poses a significant long-term risk to the stability of the euro if the debt situation is not brought under control.

However, their final take-home amounts will differ significantly due to state tax laws.
