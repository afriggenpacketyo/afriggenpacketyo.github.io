          <p>The Trump administration has announced that the 2026 Group of 20 summit will be hosted at President Trump's Doral golf resort in Florida. This decision revives a plan from his first term that was abandoned due to ethical concerns and criticism over potential conflicts of interest. The White House stated the event would be held "at-cost," meaning the resort would not profit from hosting the international forum of the world's largest economies. The agenda is expected to focus on economic prosperity through deregulation and technological innovation, with a potentially smaller guest list than in previous years.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Clackamas County, Oregon, discovered a 40-year-old man living in a fully furnished crawl space beneath a condominium without the owner's knowledge. The resident, Beniamin Bucur, had reportedly been there for an extended period, outfitting the space with a bed, televisions, and other electronics powered by the condo's electricity. Deputies were alerted by a witness who saw a suspicious person entering the area. Upon breaching the locked door, which had a changed lock, they arrested Bucur on charges including burglary and methamphetamine possession, setting his bail at $75,000.</p>

          <p>At the Reform UK party conference, leader Nigel Farage capitalized on the Labour party's internal turmoil following the resignation of Angela Rayner and a subsequent cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Farage delivered an impromptu speech arguing that the Labour government is in crisis and unfit to govern, positioning Reform as the party for working people. He suggested the political instability could lead to an earlier-than-expected general election and urged his party to ramp up campaigning efforts.

          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Anthropic has agreed to a settlement of at least $1.5 billion to resolve a class-action lawsuit brought by a group of authors. The authors alleged that the company engaged in large-scale copyright infringement by using their books, obtained from pirated datasets, to train its AI models. As part of the agreement, Anthropic will pay approximately $3,000 per book and has committed to destroying the datasets containing the copyrighted material. The settlement, if approved, would represent the largest publicly reported copyright recovery in history and sends a significant message regarding copyright in the age of AI.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order to officially rename the Department of Defense back to its historical name, the "Department of War." During the Oval Office signing, Trump stated the change is intended to project a message of "victory" and "strength," arguing the U.S. became too "politically correct" after the name was changed in 1947. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth supported the move, claiming it restores a "warrior ethos" and a focus on winning decisively rather than engaging in endless conflicts. The order establishes "Department of War" as a secondary title while the administration seeks congressional approval for a permanent change.</p>

          <p>China's biotechnology industry has made significant strides in aligning with international standards since a major regulatory reform in 2015, which shifted the focus from generic drugs to innovation. This reform addressed widespread issues with flawed drug applications, leading to a dramatic improvement in the quality of clinical data submitted to agencies like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Despite this progress and a growing global presence, the industry now faces potential setbacks from proposed U.S. tariffs and legislative efforts aimed at curbing its expansion. These measures could challenge China's ambition to become a global leader in the biotech sector.</p>

Revisions to previous months' data further darkened the outlook, revealing a loss of 13,000 jobs in June, the first monthly decline since 2020.

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission, under new leadership appointed by President Trump, has voted to vacate a rule that would have banned noncompete agreements for most American workers. The original ban, finalized in 2024 but halted by a federal judge, was projected to increase wages and spur new business creation by allowing employees to move more freely between jobs. The new FTC chair, Andrew Ferguson, called the rule an illegal overreach but stated the agency would still pursue enforcement against specific noncompete agreements that violate existing antitrust laws. This reversal is a significant policy shift that sides with business groups who argued the ban was harmful.</p>

This practice of "dual-hatting" has resulted in short-staffing and potential conflicts of interest, impacting the executive branch's ability to govern effectively. Examples include Marco Rubio serving in four distinct high-level capacities and a nominee to the Federal Reserve Board planning to remain in his White House economic role.

          <p>Hurricane Kiko has intensified into a powerful Category 4 storm in the Pacific Ocean and is currently on a westward path that could bring it toward Hawaii early next week. The National Hurricane Center reported maximum sustained winds of 130 mph, though a slow weakening is expected to begin over the weekend. While no coastal warnings are in effect, forecasters have cautioned that swells generated by the storm could reach the Hawaiian Islands by the end of the weekend. These swells are likely to produce life-threatening surf and dangerous rip currents, with potential for heavy rainfall and flooding beginning Monday.</p>

          <p>Inter Miami striker Luis Suarez has been suspended for six matches by the Leagues Cup disciplinary committee for spitting at a Seattle Sounders staff member. The incident occurred after a heated melee following Inter Miami's 3-0 loss in the tournament final on August 31. The 38-year-old Uruguayan, who has a history of controversial on-field behavior, apologized for his actions on social media. The suspension applies only to next year's Leagues Cup, although Major League Soccer may impose additional punishments. Teammates Sergio Busquets and Tomas Aviles also received shorter bans for their roles in the altercation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's moves to defund and dismantle U.S.-backed international broadcasters like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe are being characterized as a unilateral disarmament in the global information war against authoritarian regimes. These agencies have historically provided evidence-based news to billions in censored countries like China, Russia, and Iran, countering state propaganda. Critics argue that as American-supported media voices disappear, they are being replaced by state-run outlets from China and Russia, ceding influence and undermining U.S. foreign policy goals. This policy shift represents a significant departure from decades of bipartisan support for promoting free information abroad.</p>

          <p>Close relatives of Bill Pulte, the federal housing official who accused Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud, have themselves claimed primary residence tax exemptions on two separate properties in Michigan and Florida. Public records show that Mark and Julie Pulte, the father and stepmother of the FHFA director, have claimed "homestead exemptions" in both states since 2020, a practice generally not permitted. After being contacted by Reuters, tax officials in Bloomfield Township, Michigan, revoked the exemption on the Pultes' property there, which had also been rented out in violation of the rules, and will issue revised tax bills with penalties.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis of crime statistics in Chicago challenges recent characterizations of the city as a "hell hole" by President Donald Trump. While Chicago recorded the highest total number of homicides of any U.S. city in 2024, its homicide rate per capita ranked tenth among large cities. Furthermore, overall violent crime in the city has been falling, down 11% in 2024 from the previous year and significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels. The analysis highlights the complexity of comparing crime data between cities and cautions against using raw numbers for political rankings, noting that perceptions of crime can be influenced by concentrated spikes in violence.</p>

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed her sharp written response to a dissenting opinion by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in a recent case. Barrett explained that she felt Jackson's "spirited argument" merited an equally "spirited response," emphasizing that their vigorous debates are confined to legal ideas and do not affect their collegial relationship. Quoting her mentor, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, she stated, "I attack ideas. I don't attack people." Barrett dismissed any notion of personal animosity, affirming her "great respect" for Justice Jackson and the court's ability to maintain friendships despite disagreements.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney's government has announced a pause on the mandate requiring 20% of new car sales to be electric by 2026, citing the economic impact of U.S. trade policies. While the short-term target is suspended for review, longer-term goals of 60% by 2030 and 100% by 2035 will remain in place. The announcement was paired with a new "Buy Canadian" initiative that will prioritize domestic goods for federal contracts and create a fund to help Canadian firms. The moves come as Canada's economy shows signs of weakness, with job losses and a rising unemployment rate of 7.1% in August.</p>

          <p>The eight largest U.S. technology companies saw their combined market capitalization increase by $420 billion this week, bringing their total value to $21 trillion. The surge was led by a more than 10% rise in Alphabet's stock after a favorable ruling in its antitrust case, which also boosted Apple's shares. Chipmaker Broadcom's stock jumped 13% after it announced a new $10 billion AI-related contract, reportedly with OpenAI. These gains pushed the collective weight of the eight tech giants to approximately 36% of the entire S&P 500 index, an unprecedented level of market concentration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent report showing a rise in the U.S. unemployment rate to 4.3% and weak job growth could prompt the Federal Reserve to implement a more significant interest rate cut than previously anticipated. This weakening economic signal increases the likelihood of monetary easing to stimulate the economy. As lenders often price in expected Fed actions, a larger-than-expected rate cut could cause mortgage and refinancing rates to fall further than they already have this year. While a weakening job market is negative for the overall economy, it presents a potential opportunity for homebuyers and homeowners to secure lower borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

Emerson, who said he was suffering a mental health crisis and believed he was in a dream, was subdued by the flight crew before he could cut fuel to the engines.
