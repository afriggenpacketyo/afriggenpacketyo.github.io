          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated that the company has not observed any reduction in consumer demand despite the tariffs implemented by President Trump. Jassy made these remarks during Amazon's annual shareholder meeting, noting that they also haven't seen significant increases in average selling prices yet. While Amazon acknowledged that tariffs and trade policies could potentially affect their future guidance, rival retailer Walmart previously cautioned about possible consumer price hikes due to tariffs, prompting a response from Trump to absorb the costs. Optimism around the economy is still uncertain, and consumers are likely to be impacted by the tariffs in the near future.</p>

The Senate's progress on stablecoin legislation and Coinbase's inclusion in the S&P 500 are viewed positively for the crypto industry.

Critics argue the law aims to silence critical voices and eliminate remaining elements of Hungarian democracy, with comparisons drawn to Russia's crackdown on civic activism.

          <p>A federal judge in Boston ruled that the Trump administration violated an order preventing deportations to countries not the migrants' own without due process. The judge, Brian E. Murphy, expressed concern over the deportation of eight immigrants to a third country, believed to be Djibouti, after being told they were being sent to South Sudan. The Homeland Security Department disclosed the deportations but refused to specify the destination. Judge Murphy indicated that the administration's actions could result in a finding of criminal contempt and requested information on the officials involved.</p>

He argues that these distractions create buying opportunities for investors with a long-term perspective. Cramer emphasizes the importance of focusing on companies with strong fundamentals and trustworthy CEOs, rather than being swayed by short-term market fluctuations. He also notes that the action in the 10-year Treasury is putting more pressure on the S&P futures than he has seen in some time, hurting all stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's criticism of South Africa's land seizures from white farmers contrasts with his administration's use of eminent domain to seize land for the U.S.-Mexico border wall. Trump has accused South Africa of persecuting Afrikaners, while simultaneously using government-sanctioned land grabs in the United States. This has impacted landowners in South Texas, who have been forced to give up their property for the construction of the border wall.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add $2.3 trillion to the national debt. Trump visited Congress to urge Republicans to support the bill, but divisions remain between budget hawks and those seeking larger tax cuts.</p>

Some nations involved have said they will summon Israeli ambassadors to account for the incident, calling for investigations and explanations from Israel.

          <p>President Trump's insistence that other countries pay tariffs has led companies to use euphemisms to avoid his anger while still informing investors of financial impacts. Executives are using phrases like "fluid economic environment" instead of directly mentioning tariffs and having CFOs address the issue rather than CEOs. Companies such as Walmart and Mattel have faced backlash from Trump for acknowledging that tariffs could lead to price increases. Experts advise companies to emphasize productivity gains and cost-cutting measures to offset the impact of tariffs without directly criticizing the administration's policies.</p>
