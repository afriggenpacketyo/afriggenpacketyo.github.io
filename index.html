          <p>President Trump threatened to increase tariffs on China if Beijing doesn't remove retaliatory tariffs, potentially raising the total tariff to 104%. This announcement exacerbated market volatility, which was already reeling from the initial tariff announcements. Trump claimed that the U.S. is bringing in billions of dollars from these tariffs, despite evidence to the contrary. The administration's aggressive trade policies are raising concerns about a potential trade war and its impact on the global economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink stated that many business leaders believe the U.S. economy is already in a recession.

Fink expressed skepticism about the market's expectation of multiple rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year.

          <p>The Trump administration petitioned the Supreme Court to block the return of a Maryland man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador.

Polls indicate a close race, with the Liberals recently gaining ground after trailing the Conservatives for an extended period.
