          <p>A federal judge has struck down a Trump executive order targeting the law firm Susman Godfrey, declaring it unconstitutional. The ruling marks a significant victory for the firm, which represented Dominion Voting Systems in its defamation suit against Fox News. Judge Loren AliKhan stated the order violated the First and Fifth Amendments and threatened the independence of the legal profession. This decision is the latest in a series of legal defeats for the administration's attempts to punish law firms perceived as political adversaries.</p>

          <p>House and Senate Republicans are reportedly feeling anxious about internal divisions over a major legislative bill encompassing tax, immigration, and other key agenda items. Some GOP members are urging President Trump to take a more active role in unifying the party, similar to his involvement in passing the bill through the House. While congressional leaders are in contact with the White House, there are varying levels of enthusiasm among lawmakers for more direct presidential intervention. The administration is aiming to have the bill passed by the Fourth of July.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite indexes both closed at record highs, signaling strong investor confidence despite ongoing geopolitical tensions. The market surge is attributed to cautious optimism regarding a more moderate U.S. tariff posture and signs of continued economic growth. Recent data shows inflation remaining near its lowest since 2021 and a sturdy hiring market, which has helped alleviate concerns about a potential downturn. The rally briefly paused following President Trump's announcement to halt trade talks with Canada but recovered by the end of the day. (not investment advice)</p>

Sources indicate the university feared losing federal funding if it did not comply, making this a significant escalation in the administration's campaign to reshape higher education.

This marks a substantial increase from his previous recommendation of a low single-digit percentage. Edelman attributes this shift to the maturation of the crypto market and the obsolescence of the traditional 60/40 stock-to-bond portfolio model due to increased human longevity. He argues that crypto offers diversification and the potential for higher returns compared to other asset classes. (not investment advice)</p>

The move imperils the trade relationship with one of America's top partners and caused a brief dip in the stock market.

          <p>President Trump celebrated a Supreme Court decision that restricts the power of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions against federal policies. The 6-3 ruling was hailed by Trump as a "monumental win," particularly in the context of his executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the order itself, it limited the ability of a single judge to block its implementation across the country. The decision was criticized by Democrats, with Senator Chuck Schumer calling it a "terrifying step toward authoritarianism."</p>

          <p>The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongfully deported to El Salvador and later brought back to the U.S. to face criminal charges, has become increasingly complex. The Trump administration is now threatening to deport him again to a third country after a judge ordered his release pending trial, a move his lawyers are fighting by asking to prolong his detention for his own protection. The article details the administration's extensive efforts to build a case against him, including cutting deals with convicted felons for testimony. The situation highlights a determined, multi-agency campaign to justify the initial deportation.</p>

          <p>This analysis piece characterizes President Trump's reaction to a recent Supreme Court decision as a victory lap for an administration pushing authoritarian boundaries. The ruling, which curbs the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, is seen as removing a key check on executive power. The article argues that in the context of Trump's presidency, this legal shift is particularly concerning, as the courts have been a primary safeguard against his policies. Trump's celebration, combined with the court's conservative majority, signals a significant concentration of power in the White House.</p>

          <p>A study by the Pew Charitable Trusts found that approximately 56 million private-sector workers in the U.S., about half the total, do not have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan. This lack of access presents a major barrier to building sufficient wealth for retirement, as automatic payroll deductions and employer matches are key saving tools. The findings highlight a growing "retirement divide," with nearly 30% of Americans over 59 having no savings at all. Experts warn this creates a crisis, leaving millions reliant solely on a struggling Social Security system.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled 6-3 in favor of parents in Montgomery County, Maryland, who sought the right to opt their elementary school children out of instruction featuring books with LGBTQ themes. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Samuel Alito, stated that denying an opt-out option unconstitutionally burdens the parents' right to free exercise of religion. In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued that mere exposure to different beliefs is not a constitutional violation and warned the ruling would create chaos for public schools. The court ordered the school board to provide advance notice and allow opt-outs.</p>
