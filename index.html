        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese-funded e-commerce giants Temu and Shein are planning to raise prices for US customers in response to increased global trade tariffs imposed during Donald Trump's presidency. The companies cited rising operational costs due to changes in trade rules and tariffs, without specifying the exact price increases. Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods, coupled with the elimination of a tax exemption for items under $800, have impacted their business models. These companies have gained popularity by offering extremely low-priced goods and aggressive online marketing, but now face challenges due to the shifting trade landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche has announced a $50 billion investment in the United States over the next five years, creating over 12,000 jobs. This investment aims to expand research and development facilities, including a new AI research site in Massachusetts, and bolster manufacturing capabilities across several states. The move comes amid concerns over potential tariffs on pharmaceutical goods from abroad threatened by President Donald Trump. The investment will also support the development of next-generation weight loss medicines, with Roche planning to export more medicines from the US than it imports.</p>

          <p>Qatari and Egyptian mediators have proposed a new ceasefire plan between Israel and Hamas, envisioning a truce lasting five to seven years. The proposal includes the release of all Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a formal end to the war, and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Hamas has signaled readiness to hand over governance of Gaza to a mutually agreed-upon Palestinian entity, while Israel continues its military offensive. This mediation effort is described as serious, with Hamas showing "unprecedented flexibility," though the likelihood of success remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is currently engaged in numerous battles with various institutions, including universities, law firms, the media, and the Federal Reserve.

          <p>The introduction of an ATM in Tuvalu, a cash-based society, highlights the increasing encroachment of technology on human interaction, with automated checkouts and AI chatbots replacing human contact in various sectors. While technology offers convenience and efficiency, it also erodes the essential human connections that contribute to societal well-being. Studies show that many people prefer human interaction in retail, and the over-reliance on technology can negatively impact mental health and social skills. There are signs of resistance, such as supermarkets introducing slower checkouts for customers who want to chat with a cashier, which illustrates the importance of human contact.</p>

While Verstappen is known for pushing the limits, this incident may influence his future racing strategies, and it also sends a message from Oscar Piastri that he will not be intimidated.</p>

          <p>China has executed a man for fatally stabbing a 10-year-old Japanese boy in Shenzhen last September, the Japanese embassy in China has confirmed. Zhong Changchun was sentenced to death in January for the attack, which heightened tensions between the two countries. The Japanese government has expressed its solemnity over the execution and urged China to ensure the safety of Japanese nationals in China. The incident also sparked concerns about anti-foreigner sentiment and unchecked nationalism on Chinese social media.</p>

          <p>China's CATL, the world's largest EV battery supplier, has announced a new battery that it claims can add 520 km of driving range with just five minutes of charging. This announcement appears to surpass the fast-charging capabilities of BYD, a Chinese EV giant and Tesla rival. If CATL's claims are accurate and feasible on a larger scale, this technology could alleviate consumer concerns about electric vehicle range and convenience. The company's latest claims would also place its charging speeds comfortably ahead of those of its Western competitors.</p>

          <p>Dropshipping businesses, which rely on open trade between China and the U.S., are facing significant challenges due to President Donald Trump's tariffs. The current 145% tariff on Chinese goods is putting pressure on many dropshipping businesses, leading to decreased revenue and difficulties in importing products. The elimination of the de minimis exemption, which previously allowed duty-free entry for shipments valued at $800 or less, has further compounded the problem. As a result, many businesses are shifting their focus to the European market and diversifying their supply chains.</p>
