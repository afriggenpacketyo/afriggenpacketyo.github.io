            <p>Dr. Peter Marks, former FDA vaccine regulator, expressed strong concerns about declining vaccine confidence and its impact on public health during an interview. He emphasized the safety and effectiveness of the MMR vaccine, particularly in light of recent measles outbreaks, criticizing the HHS Secretary's stance and urging parents to vaccinate their children. Marks highlighted the moral responsibility to protect children against preventable diseases and the potential consequences of losing measles elimination status, drawing a comparison to the importance of car seats for child safety.

The LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) offers this approach in an ETF, distributing roughly 11% to investors through 2035. While ultrashort fixed-income bond ETFs have gained popularity, the bond ladder can serve a broader goal of protecting buying power and immunizing from liabilities.
