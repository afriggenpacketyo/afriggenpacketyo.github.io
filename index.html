Opanowski, a survivor of a brutal attack by her ex-boyfriend Shawn Doyle, shares her story of surviving sexual assault and finding the strength to testify against him years later after he murdered Lori Leonard.

Opanowski's testimony became crucial in Doyle's trial for the murder of Leonard, a single mother of two, where he received a sentence of 25 years to life, as the judge allowed the jury to hear about his prior bad acts against Opanowski and another woman he had victimized.</p>

          <p>The Tokyo government has initiated a project to redevelop a two-kilometer expressway encircling the Ginza shopping district into an elevated greenway for pedestrians by the 2040s. Known as the Tokyo Sky Corridor, the walkway will replace the Tokyo Expressway, or "KK Line," and is modeled after New York City's High Line. The project aims to create a tourist attraction with trees, flowers, benches, public bathrooms, rest areas, and event spaces, with cafes and food trucks planned. However, challenges remain, including addressing summer heat and ensuring the structure can support the weight of soil and plant life, with costs expected to reach 14 billion yen ($97 million).</p>

          <p>Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona encouraged the Democratic party to return to its roots as the "big tent" party, at a town hall in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Gallego cited podcast host Joe Rogan as an example of someone who was "kicked out" of the tent because his message did not completely align with the party's. He emphasized the need for alliances with people they may not agree with 100% of the time, drawing on his own success in Arizona, where there are more registered Republicans than Democrats. Gallego also highlighted the importance of empathizing with voters and addressing their concerns about the economy.</p>

          <p>As China seeks to diversify its food import sources amid global uncertainties, its Southeast Asian neighbors are becoming increasingly viable suppliers, with Yunnan province playing a crucial role in regional agricultural cooperation. The province's involvement dates back to the "alternative crop cultivation programme," which aimed to reduce opium production in the region by sharing agricultural technology and promoting sustainable economic alternatives. Experts say that overseas agricultural investment and cooperation could serve as an effective way to support China's food security by utilizing the land resources of neighboring countries, as living standards have risen and Chinese food consumption patterns have changed significantly.</p>

This expansion strategy reflects a shift towards reaching a broader customer base beyond wealthier urban centers.

Experts suggest that the lack of perceived benefits and limited availability to part-time workers are hindering adoption.

Self-empowering songs in a minor key tend to resonate with audiences, though some acts are attempting to buck this trend. Staging should be memorable without being overly complex, and should embrace the LGBT community. It's important to have a surprise element, like a costume change or a key change, to make the song stick in people's minds.</p>

He also recounts his involvement in an unsuccessful escape attempt. He said that security was very tight when he left in 1958.
