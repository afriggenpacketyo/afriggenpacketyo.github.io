        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Inter Miami's loss in the Leagues Cup final, Luis Suárez appeared to spit on a Seattle Sounders staff member, escalating tensions after the match. A shoving match initiated immediately after the final whistle, with Suárez grabbing Sounders midfielder Obed Vargas around the neck, prompting further involvement from other players, including Sergio Busquets. Sounders coach Brian Schmetzer downplayed the incident, emphasizing the team's performance, while Messi remained uninvolved. Suárez has a history of controversial behavior, including biting incidents, making this latest incident another mark on his career. The post-match scuffle overshadowed Seattle Sounders' victory, but the team insisted on moving past the incident. The article underscores the focus on the team and its performance and the desire to move past the scuffle. The events are certainly less than ideal, and the tone of the article appears to reflect this. </p>

          <p>The European Union suspects Russia of jamming the GPS system of a plane carrying European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to Bulgaria. While the plane landed safely, the EU spokesperson condemned the act as blatant interference and intimidation, reinforcing the commitment to bolster European defense capabilities and support for Ukraine. The incident highlights the urgency to invest in European security. The Kremlin denied the allegation, but the incident underscores ongoing tensions between the EU and Russia. The event is a negative one which is potentially a symptom of broader instability. </p>

          <h2>Chinese Exporters Absorb Portion of US Tariff Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 08:30:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese exporters are reportedly bearing 9% of the cost burden from tariffs imposed by the U.S., indicating their strong bargaining power. According to CICC analysts, U.S. importers struggle to fully pass tariff costs to consumers or shift the burden to exporters, resulting in compressed profit margins. Regression analysis of shipment sizes, tariff rates, and price changes in U.S. imports revealed a 2.4% drop in average prices of goods imported from China between April and July, despite a 27 percentage point tariff increase. This suggests that Chinese goods maintain a competitive edge in the market. The article suggests that China's economy is doing well and absorbing the cost of tariffs. </p>

          <p>Several countries are considering reducing the number of public holidays to boost economic productivity, but evidence supporting this idea is limited. Studies suggest only minor GDP increases are possible, and some argue that holidays increase worker well-being and productivity in the long term. The US is an outlier in the OECD, with no statutory leave, while countries with more combined days off often have high GDP per capita. Worker productivity depends on various factors, not just hours worked. The article discusses a debate on the economic impact of public holidays. </p>
