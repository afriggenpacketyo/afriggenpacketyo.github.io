          <p>Columbia University has agreed to a significant settlement with the Trump administration to resolve investigations into antisemitism on campus. The deal includes a $200 million payment to the federal government and $21 million to the EEOC, in exchange for the restoration of hundreds of millions in frozen research grants. As part of the agreement, the university will implement reforms, including a ban on protest masks and ending its DEI policies, a move praised by the administration as a model for other universities. The university stated it does not admit wrongdoing but acknowledges the need for reform.</p>

          <p>A rare violet sea snail, known as Janthina, was discovered on a La Jolla Shores beach, marking the first sighting by Scripps researchers in a decade. These pelagic snails typically live in warmer subtropical waters and float using a self-secreted bubble raft. The oceanographer who found them noted the water was unusually warm, leading to speculation about a potential connection to climate change. Researchers are encouraging the public to report any further sightings of these distinctive purple creatures, which are voracious predators of Portuguese man o' war, to better understand their changing distribution patterns.</p>

          <p>Columbia University will pay a $200 million settlement to the U.S. government to end a dispute over its handling of on-campus antisemitism and restore frozen federal funding. This agreement codifies several reforms, including stricter rules for protests and the appointment of an independent monitor. The article contrasts Columbia's compliance with Harvard University's decision to sue the administration over similar funding cuts and political pressures. U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon praised Columbia's actions as a potential "roadmap" for other universities facing scrutiny over campus culture and DEI programs.</p>

          <p>South Korean semiconductor firm SK Hynix announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, significantly exceeding market expectations. This surge is attributed to the high demand for its advanced high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are essential components for artificial intelligence technologies used by companies like Nvidia. The company's success in the HBM market has allowed it to challenge its rival, Samsung Electronics, for dominance in the global memory space. SK Hynix expects strong demand to continue, driven by ongoing AI investments from major tech firms. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the article explores concerns among users about data privacy and the potential for circumvention using tools like VPNs. While age verification companies assert the security of their systems, some users worry about potential data leaks and believe the measures will push people toward less secure, fringe websites.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has ruled that President Trump's executive order aimed at curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The court found the order invalid because it contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States. The administration had argued the amendment's "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" clause excludes children of undocumented immigrants, an interpretation the court rejected. While the policy is already on hold due to other court actions, this decision marks a significant appellate-level judgment on the merits of the case.</p>

          <p>After making his debut at first base for the San Francisco Giants, Rafael Devers made a surprising admission, stating he prefers playing a defensive position over being a full-time designated hitter. Devers explained that being on the field keeps him active and prevents him from overthinking his next at-bat. This contrasts with his time at the Boston Red Sox, where he had been adamant about his desire to exclusively handle DH duties, even publicly rebuffing suggestions he might play first base. Devers' change of heart comes after he was traded to the Giants and immediately put into a defensive role.</p>

Opponents of the plan, led by Rep. Troy E. Nehls, argue it is inhumane, unworkable, and a waste of taxpayer money, estimating the cost at over a billion dollars. However, some conservationists warn that stopping the removal of the more aggressive barred owls will likely lead to the extinction of the spotted owl.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan migrants, recently released from El Salvador's notorious CECOT mega-prison, have provided firsthand accounts of severe abuse and inhumane conditions. The men were deported from the U.S. to El Salvador under allegations of gang affiliation, which they deny. In interviews, they described systematic beatings by guards, being held in dark punishment cells without water, and being cut off from legal help and family contact. Their release was part of a prisoner swap negotiated between the U.S. and Venezuelan governments, offering the first detailed glimpse into a prison from which officials claimed inmates would only leave "inside a coffin."</p>

          <p>A new study from Common Sense Media has found that a majority of teenagers are using AI companions, with many interacting with them daily for advice, emotional support, and friendship. Researchers and teens themselves express concern that this trend could hinder the development of real-world social skills and redefine human relationships. While some teens use AI for mundane questions, others discuss serious issues with chatbots instead of people, drawn by the AI's constant availability and non-judgmental nature. Experts worry this could exacerbate youth loneliness and create a dependency on AI for validation and decision-making.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Internal government figures show that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is on track to carry out over 300,000 deportations in the first year of Trump's second term, the highest number since the Obama administration in 2014. In the first six months, ICE recorded nearly 150,000 removals. While this represents a significant increase driven by a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration, the total still falls far short of the administration's stated goal of one million annual deportations. Officials hope to expand operations with new funding aimed at hiring thousands more agents and increasing detention capacity.</p>

          <p>A House Oversight subcommittee has voted to issue a subpoena to the Justice Department for its complete investigative files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The motion, pushed by Democrats, received bipartisan support with three Republicans voting in favor, signaling a break from GOP leadership's resistance on the matter. The committee also voted to subpoena numerous high-profile figures from past administrations, including former presidents and attorneys general. This move intensifies pressure on the Trump administration to provide more transparency regarding the Epstein case, following a recent DOJ review that claimed no incriminating "client list" exists.</p>

          <p>This analytical article examines the Trump administration's new "AI Action Plan," framing it as a strategy that defers heavily to the private sector to achieve global AI dominance. The plan's three pillars—enhancing innovation, building infrastructure, and promoting American AI—involve stripping away regulations and streamlining environmental reviews to accelerate development. The piece highlights the close ties between the administration and tech executives from companies like OpenAI and Palantir, whose policy recommendations are closely mirrored in the final document. The plan is presented as a high-stakes bet on Silicon Valley's ability to deliver prosperity without significant government oversight.</p>

With Southern California Edison's aging equipment being a leading theory for the fire's cause, and insured loss estimates ranging from $20 billion to $45 billion, the state's Catastrophe Response Council warns the fund's financial health is under severe strain.

The story highlights the surge in sexual violence used by gangs to terrorize communities in Port-au-Prince, where medical charities report a nearly threefold increase in patients since 2021.
