          <p>Analysts suggest that America's next-generation fighter jets and ‚Äúloyal wingmen‚Äù drones could offset China‚Äôs numerical advantage in military strength, potentially widening the operational range in the Indo-Pacific. The US Air Force is developing unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) as part of the collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) program. These drones are designed to augment crewed fighter aircraft in air-to-air missions. However, experts note that China is also advancing in military technology, narrowing the gap. </p>
