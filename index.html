          <p>More than 25 protesters were arrested after occupying an academic building at the University of Washington, demanding the school sever ties with Boeing due to the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The group, Students United for Palestinian Equality and Return, stated that those arrested needed medical attention, some having been injured during the arrest. The university said the protesters were covering their faces and stacking furniture near entryways, and that those remaining in the building would face legal and student conduct actions. Boeing has a long-standing relationship with the University of Washington, having donated about $10 million for the construction of the Interdisciplinary Engineering Building.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, Germany's conservative leader, fell short of a majority in the parliament vote to become chancellor, securing only 310 of the required 316 votes in the Bundestag. This defeat is considered unprecedented in modern German history and a significant blow to Merz, occurring two and a half months after winning Germany's federal elections. The Bundestag has 14 days to choose Merz or another candidate, with potential for multiple votes. The far-right party Alternative for Germany called for fresh elections following Merz's failure, while his colleague Johann Wadephul expressed confidence in a second attempt. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to the Trump administration's offer of $1,000 to illegal immigrants who self-deport, Senator Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) suggested a system of fines and work visas. Gallego proposed that immigrants pay a $5,000 fine, undergo a background check, and receive a renewable work visa for a few years. The $1,000 offer from the Trump administration is part of a crackdown on illegal immigration, with the Department of Homeland Security claiming it will decrease deportation costs by around 70 percent. Gallego noted that immigrants would pay for the cost of their background check, similar to the current process for other immigrants.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is offering illegal immigrants $1,000 and paid travel to return to their home countries, utilizing the CBP Home app to trace their journey. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described self-deportation as the safest and most cost-effective way to avoid arrest. The DHS noted that one person had already received a ticket for a flight from Chicago to Honduras, describing the offer as a dignified route that would cut deportation costs. Trump suggested that those who self-deport might someday be offered a legal route back to the US if they are deemed "good people."</p>

          <p>While overall inflation remains above policymakers' target, prices for some consumer goods and services are declining. The article notes price decreases in airfare, produce, household goods, electronics, and gasoline, attributing these shifts to factors like seasonal supply, lower transportation costs, and technological advancements. Economists caution that these price declines may be temporary due to potential tariff increases and volatile market conditions.

          <p>President Trump is again targeting sanctuary cities, reigniting a legal battle over federal funding. While Democrats previously unified against such measures, their response is now less consistent, reflecting internal disagreements on immigration. Trump's policies remain popular, posing a messaging challenge for Democrats. The administration's actions have faced legal challenges, with courts siding with local officials. However, the debate highlights the difficult position Democrats face in balancing public skepticism towards immigration with concerns about Trump's enforcement approach.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plan to offer $5,000 "baby bonuses" to encourage Americans to have more children is unlikely to succeed, according to experts. They argue that the high costs of healthcare, housing, and childcare present significant barriers to family expansion. Other countries with similar bonus programs have seen limited impact, as families simply shift their timelines rather than having more children. Experts suggest that more substantial policy changes, such as childcare subsidies and affordable healthcare, are needed to address declining birthrates.</p>

          <p>Americans are increasingly experiencing "tip-creep," with gratuities now requested in unexpected places like self-checkouts and bookstores, leading to a growing backlash. While tipping has long been customary for service workers, its expansion has sparked resentment and a sense of guilt among consumers. Some are reducing their tips in hopes of forcing employers to raise wages, while others are avoiding tipping at establishments with regular minimum wage laws. Donald Trump's proposal to eliminate taxes on tips has drawn criticism, with opponents arguing it would incentivize low wages and further expand tipping culture.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the decline of Congress's power and assertiveness, leading to presidential and judicial overreach. This decline is attributed to internal choices that centralized power in congressional leaders, encouraging performative partisanship and making Congress ancillary to the presidency. The author argues that the lack of legislative action renders government actions symbolic, testing the boundaries of executive power and regulatory reform. The article calls for members of Congress to reclaim their power and responsibility for the system to work as intended.</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic discusses the shift in feminism from the 1990s to the early 2000s, focusing on the rise of postfeminism and the co-opting of "Girl Power" by commercial interests. The author, Sophie Gilbert, argues that this shift, influenced by the AIDS crisis and the rise of porn, led to a focus on sexual power as the primary form of empowerment for women. Gilbert critiques the individualistic outlook of 21st-century feminism and calls for a return to collective action and a focus on issues that benefit all women. The article touches on the influence of social media, the complicity of women in upholding sexist culture, and the need for better media education.</p>

          <p>The growing political divide between young men and women is attributed to economic shifts over the past half-century, rather than solely culture war issues. Declining manufacturing jobs and increasing economic inequality have disproportionately affected men, leading to job insecurity and regressive gender norms. Traditional gender roles made consumerism less appealing to men, while feminist messages empowered women in business and employment. Redefining men's roles in caretaking and production is crucial, as manufacturing is unlikely to make a comeback.</p>
