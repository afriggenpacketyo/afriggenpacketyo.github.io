          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, further halting the Trump administration's plans to significantly cut jobs and reorganize major federal agencies under the DOGE initiative, which is backed by Elon Musk. The judge, Susan Illston, emphasized that while presidents can set policy priorities, Congress is responsible for creating, funding, and assigning duties to federal agencies. The Trump administration has appealed the decision to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and is expected to seek a block on the injunction's enforcement, arguing that the President should have executive authority. This ruling protects federal employees and maintains the agencies' ability to fulfill their statutory obligations.</p>

The attacker reportedly claimed affiliation with MKY and referenced Chkhikvishvili in online postings.

          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union and a 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured outside the United States, leading to immediate market declines.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed hope that the threat would "light a fire under the EU" to offer more concessions.

          <p>The European Union faces significant challenges in securing a trade pact with the United States following President Trump's threat of a 50% tariff on EU goods. Trump's claim that the EU was formed to take advantage of the United States complicates negotiations. While some analysts believe economic pressures will prevent Trump from pushing Brussels too far, others warn that an EU-US deal appears harder to reach due to the bloc's large goods trade surplus with the US and the difficulty of reaching consensus among EU member states.</p>

          <p>Royal Mail is under investigation by Ofcom for failing to meet its annual delivery targets, with a significant percentage of first-class mail arriving late.

Royal Mail COO Alistair Cochrane acknowledged the need for improvement and cited ongoing modernization efforts, but also called for urgent reform of the universal service obligation.

          <p>Experts predict that credit card interest rates are unlikely to decrease significantly in the near future, potentially remaining elevated well into 2026. Despite potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, lenders are expected to consider factors like default risk and operating margins before lowering APRs. High credit card debt per household and increasing delinquency rates contribute to this outlook. Consumers are advised to explore debt repayment strategies and contact card issuers for potential hardship rate reductions to manage their debt effectively during this period of high interest rates.</p>

The bill includes tax cuts for businesses, investors, and homeowners in high-tax areas, offset by reductions in social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP. Analyses suggest that the bottom tenth of households could see a decrease in income, while the top 10% would experience an increase. This legislation compounds the regressive nature of recent tariff policies, further skewing financial benefits towards the wealthy.</p>

          <p>As interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) decline, experts advise careful consideration of their uses this summer. While HELOCs offer flexibility, using them for non-essential expenses like vacations is discouraged due to the risk of long-term debt. Prudent uses include consolidating high-interest credit card debt, tackling home improvements, and potentially covering college costs if other options are less favorable. Using a HELOC to buy a new house before selling the old one requires a solid repayment plan to avoid accumulating additional debt. Using a HELOC to fund a summer vacation is not investment advice.</p>

          <p>Dressers sold by Wayfair and Amazon are being recalled due to safety concerns regarding tip-over risks, particularly for children. The Sivan Six-Drawer Double Dresser and the Rolanstar 6-Drawer Dresser do not meet safety standards and can tip over if not anchored to the wall. Consumers who own these dressers are advised to stop using them unless they are secured and to contact the respective companies for a refund. No incidents or injuries have been reported, but the recalls are being conducted as a precautionary measure.</p>
