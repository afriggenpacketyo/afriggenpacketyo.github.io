          <p>New Jersey Transit executives and the union representing train drivers resumed negotiations on Saturday, the second day of the state's first transit strike in 40 years. Agency Chief Executive Kris Kolluri met with union representatives after the union's national president requested further talks. The strike began due to stalled contract talks, primarily concerning pay, with the union seeking parity with other regional commuter railroads. Kolluri stated the agency's commitment to reaching a deal while remaining fiscally responsible, and he also advised commuters to work from home if possible on Monday if the strike continues.</p>

This creature, part of the extinct group radiodonts, possessed a unique circular mouth lined with teeth and flaps for swimming. The discovery provides new insights into the complexity of animal life during the Cambrian period, revealing that the Mosura had a segmented abdomen-like region, unlike other radiodonts. The well-preserved fossil also showed the Mosura's open circulatory system.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies have faced resistance from federal courts, which are upholding the principle of due process for immigrants. The Supreme Court criticized the administration for providing inadequate notice to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation. Legal scholars have praised the courts for supporting due process but expressed concern that such intervention was necessary. The rulings come as Trump officials have openly questioned the need for due process in deportation cases.</p>

Simion has shifted his tone recently, but his limited knowledge of economics and foreign policy remains a concern.
