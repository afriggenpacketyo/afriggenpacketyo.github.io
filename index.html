          <p>Jim Cramer observed that Wall Street reacted positively to the U.S. bombings in Iran, suggesting the region's reduced relevance to the stock market. Oil prices initially rose but then significantly declined, influenced by Iran's claim of striking a U.S. military base in Qatar, which Qatar denied. Cramer noted the global energy market's changed dynamics due to increased U.S. oil production, providing a buffer against supply shocks. He also highlighted positive company-specific news lifting stocks, suggesting the market's resilience despite geopolitical tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Georgetown University professor, Dr. Jonathan Brown, faced social media backlash after suggesting Iran should conduct a symbolic strike on a U.S. military base. Brown initially posted his hope for de-escalation, but conservatives interpreted his comments as wishing harm upon American soldiers. Critics also highlighted Brown's family connections to individuals previously accused of supporting terrorist organizations. Georgetown University stated they were "appalled" by the post and are reviewing the matter to determine if further action is needed, while Brown has since deleted the tweet.</p>
