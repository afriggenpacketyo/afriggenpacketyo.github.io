          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has arrived in Washington, D.C., for a crucial meeting with former President Donald Trump and several European leaders to discuss a path to peace with Russia. Zelenskyy emphasized the need for a lasting peace, stating that previous temporary truces and ineffective security guarantees from the past have failed to prevent Russian aggression. He expressed gratitude for American and European support, highlighting recent Ukrainian military successes as proof of their capability to defend their territory while hoping joint strength will compel Moscow to end the war.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, has regained Category 4 strength while moving north of the Caribbean. Although the storm is not expected to make direct landfall on the U.S. East Coast, the National Hurricane Center warns of life-threatening surf and rip currents along the seaboard throughout the week. Tropical storm warnings are active for the Turks and Caicos and the southeast Bahamas, which are expected to experience significant rainfall and potential flooding. Forecasters note the storm's intensity is fluctuating due to an eyewall replacement cycle, but it will remain a powerful and dangerous major hurricane for several days.</p>

          <p>The United States and South Korea have begun their annual Ulchi Freedom Shield joint military exercises, an 11-day program involving 21,000 troops designed to enhance their readiness against North Korean threats. While the allies maintain the drills are purely defensive, Pyongyang has condemned them as a "military confrontation" and has historically responded with missile tests. The exercises occur as South Korean President Lee Jae-myung prepares for a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has previously demanded increased payments for the American troops stationed in the country.</p>

          <p>This opinion article asserts that the killing of journalists in Gaza is a deliberate Israeli strategy to silence credible Palestinian voices and control the global narrative of the conflict. The author, who has communicated with the Al Jazeera Gaza team, highlights the professionalism and dedication of reporters who continue their work despite immense personal loss and direct threats. The piece argues that by discrediting and eliminating these journalists, often by labeling them as militants, Israel aims to create an information vacuum where its justifications for military actions cannot be effectively challenged. The author criticizes Western media for giving undue weight to Israeli claims that have historically proven unreliable.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have successfully converted human stem cells into dopamine-producing neurons and transplanted them into mice, significantly reducing depressive behaviors like anxiety and anhedonia. The engineered cells helped repair neural circuits involved in mood regulation, boosting the mice's ability to experience pleasure. This breakthrough provides proof-of-concept for using cell therapy to treat neuropsychiatric conditions, such as major depressive disorder, by directly targeting and reconstructing dysfunctional areas of the brain. The research offers potential new avenues for treating patients with treatment-resistant depression.</p>

          <p>Ahead of high-stakes peace talks, this analysis focuses on the immense human toll of the war in Ukraine, arguing that discussions of "land swaps" overlook the eradication of entire communities and ways of life. Reporting from the frontlines, the article details how villages have been emptied, homes destroyed, and residents left exhausted by constant attacks, transforming the conflict from a territorial dispute into a matter of "human estate." It underscores that for Ukrainians, ceding territory to Russia is not a simple transaction but a permanent loss of their homes, livelihoods, and cultural identity, a reality they believe is misunderstood by international leaders.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is preparing to evacuate a group of 30 to 50 critically ill and injured children from Gaza for medical treatment within the next few weeks. This will be the first government-coordinated operation of its kind during the conflict, managed by the Foreign Office, Home Office, and Department of Health. The children, selected by the World Health Organization, will travel with family members and undergo biometric checks in a third country before arriving in the UK to receive care from the NHS. The initiative follows calls from a cross-party group of MPs to bring vulnerable children to safety amid the collapse of Gaza's healthcare system.</p>

Officials stated the downpour was too intense and sudden for the early warning system to be effective, highlighting that climate change is causing more extreme and unpredictable weather events. While some international aid has been offered, Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority stated that the country currently has sufficient resources to manage the crisis.</p>

Methanol, a toxic alcohol found in poorly manufactured spirits, is a known danger in parts of Southeast Asia, with symptoms that can mimic a normal hangover before leading to blindness or death.

In a social media post, Trump stated that Zelenskyy "can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to," suggesting Ukraine should abandon its goals of reclaiming Crimea and joining the NATO alliance. These comments align with long-standing Kremlin demands and place significant pressure on the Ukrainian leader before the trilateral talks, which also include European leaders.

Experts warn that the disease has returned "with a vengeance" and that lives are being lost due to disruptions in the supply of test kits and treatments.

          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has officially added over 6,000 new words and phrases this year, including terms born from internet culture like "skibidi," "delulu," and "tradwife." "Skibidi" is a nonsense word from a viral YouTube series, while "delulu" is a shortened form of delusional, and "tradwife" describes women who promote traditional gender roles online. These additions reflect the growing influence of Gen Z and Gen Alpha slang on the English language. Lexicographers noted that while it is unusual for such niche internet terms to gain entry, they are only added if they demonstrate significant staying power and impact on everyday speech.</p>

          <p>A Sacramento woman and her 8-month-old daughter, who had been missing for weeks, were found deceased inside their submerged vehicle on Sunday. Whisper Owen, 36, and her baby, Sandra McCarty, were last seen on July 15 after a doctor's appointment. A volunteer dive team located their truck pinned underwater beneath a bridge in San Joaquin County. Authorities had previously stated they did not suspect foul play in the disappearance. The California Highway Patrol is now investigating the circumstances that led to the vehicle ending up in the water.</p>
