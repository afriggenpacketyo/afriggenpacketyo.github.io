        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is permanently terminating the distribution of data from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS). This system is crucial for meteorologists as it uses microwaves to see through clouds and analyze the internal structure of tropical cyclones, which is not possible with standard infrared or visible satellite imagery. Experts warn this decision will significantly degrade forecast accuracy, especially for storms that intensify overnight, potentially putting coastal communities at greater risk during hurricane season. The move stems from a decision by the U.S. Navy, which processes the data for NOAA.</p>

          <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a plan to force a full, word-for-word reading of the 940-page Republican spending and tax bill on the Senate floor. This procedural maneuver is expected to take up to 15 hours and is intended to delay the legislative process and draw public attention to the bill's contents. While the move will not ultimately prevent a final vote, it serves as a high-profile protest and allows Democrats more time to scrutinize the massive text. Following the reading, a 20-hour debate period will commence before a "vote-a-rama" on amendments.</p>

          <p>Police in Belgrade, Serbia, clashed with thousands of anti-government protesters who were demanding early parliamentary elections and the resignation of President Aleksandar Vucic. Demonstrators, led by students, used flares, while riot police responded with pepper spray. The protests, which have been ongoing for months, were initially sparked by a fatal rail station collapse last year that was blamed on government corruption. President Vucic has rejected calls for a snap election and alleges that foreign powers are fueling the unrest, while a counter-protest by his supporters also took place nearby.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has once again rejected an effort by former President Donald Trump to have a defamation lawsuit filed by the exonerated "Central Park Five" dismissed. The judge ruled that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP law, which protects against lawsuits targeting free speech, does not apply in federal court. The lawsuit was filed by the five menâ€”Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, and Korey Wiseâ€”who were wrongfully convicted in a 1989 assault case. They allege Trump defamed them by falsely claiming during a presidential debate that they had killed someone and pleaded guilty.</p>

          <p>A recent arrest in Southern California highlights a growing trend of civilians impersonating Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers across the United States. Experts warn that the increased use of plainclothes and masked federal agents for immigration raids makes it easier for criminals to pose as officers to commit crimes, including kidnapping and sexual assault. Several such cases have been reported in states like South Carolina, North Carolina, and Florida, where imposters have targeted immigrants. A former FBI agent described the practice as a public safety threat for both civilians and legitimate officers.</p>

          <p>The Senate Republican version of a major spending bill aims to make former President Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while also introducing new restrictions on social programs. The legislation includes work requirements for Medicaid, cost-sharing measures for the SNAP food stamp program, and an increase in the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000. To fund these priorities and increase defense spending, the bill proposes raising the national debt ceiling by $5 trillion. The package faces a tight timeline and must navigate the Senate's complex reconciliation process to pass without Democratic support. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a significant backbench revolt that forced a U-turn on welfare reform, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has described fixing the "broken" benefits system as a "moral imperative." Speaking at a party conference, he affirmed that the government would protect the welfare safety net but would not allow it to become a "snare" for those able to work. The government had to alter its plans to tighten eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (PIP) after facing a potential defeat in the Commons. Despite the concessions, some Labour MPs and the Unite union are still pushing for more changes.</p>

The couple shared their personal struggles, from being denied access in a hospital delivery room to fighting for health insurance for their children.

The students designed the machine to be operated by BISM's blind and low-vision employees, featuring open hardware for tactile interaction.

While not featuring blockbuster rulings like the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the term reinforced a states-rights brand of conservatism.

By analyzing DNA from over 130 skeletons buried under the city's houses, researchers found that where biological connections existed, they were traced through the female line. This indicates that upon marriage, men likely moved into their wives' households, and female offspring remained connected to their birth homes. The study also noted that grave goods were five times more common for females, reinforcing the idea of a society where maternal lineage was central to social structure.</p>

In his eulogy, Governor Tim Walz remembered Hortman as the "most consequential speaker in Minnesota history" and a talented legislator who worked to improve the lives of Minnesotans. Hortman was praised for her leadership, bipartisan collaboration, and commitment to public service, with speakers urging attendees to honor her legacy by engaging in politics with empathy and respect.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old woman sustained minor lacerations to her leg and foot in what officials believe was likely a bite from a juvenile shark at Jones Beach, New York. The woman was in waist-deep water when the incident occurred but did not see what bit her. After examining photos of the non-life-threatening injuries, experts concluded the bites were most likely from a juvenile sand tiger shark. Swimming was temporarily suspended, but patrols by drones and lifeguards will continue through the summer, even as officials emphasize that unprovoked shark bites remain extremely rare worldwide.</p>

The effort is part of Meta's high-stakes race for AI dominance and has caused a stir in Silicon Valley, with some competitors calling the offers "crazy."

While some capabilities remain, he described the event as an "important setback" for Iran's program. Grossi emphasized the urgent need for diplomacy and for IAEA inspectors to regain access to assess the remaining material and activities, noting that knowledge and industrial capacity cannot be destroyed.

A concerned driver had called in the sighting along the remote stretch of road connecting the Central Coast and the San Joaquin Valley. However, when an officer arrived to investigate the scene, they did not find a stranded feline. Instead, the supposed tiger cub turned out to be a deceased hawk.

          <p>One week after the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites, the administration's narrative about the mission's success has shifted. Initially, President Trump and the Defense Secretary claimed the sites were "obliterated," but this was later contradicted by a leaked Defense Intelligence Agency assessment suggesting the setback to Iran's program was only a matter of months. Top officials then began using more nuanced language, describing the damage as "significant" and "substantial." By the end of the week, the administration's stated goal appeared to pivot from program destruction to achieving a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, raising questions about the attack's original objectives and true impact.</p>

Other cases include the detention of a Marine veteran's undocumented father and the wife of another Marine who was detained while seeking legal residency.

          <p>The Getty Villa has reopened to the public for the first time since being closed for nearly six months due to the Palisades fire in January. While the museum building itself was undamaged, the surrounding grounds required extensive repairs. The reopening coincides with the debut of a new exhibit, "The Kingdom of Pylos," which features over 230 works of ancient Messenian art and artifacts, many of which are being displayed in the United States for the first time. The museum is currently operating on a limited schedule from Friday through Monday to welcome back visitors.</p>
