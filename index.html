          <p>Arsenal is looking to harness the "anger and rage" from their recent loss against Bournemouth in their upcoming match against PSG. The team needs to improve their defense, particularly regarding set-pieces, which have been a recurring weakness this season. Despite often taking the lead, Arsenal has struggled to maintain their advantage, dropping significant points from winning positions. Former West Ham goalkeeper Rob Green expressed concerns about Arsenal's confidence and ability to score goals without key player Declan Rice.</p>

          <p>Several federal prosecutors in Los Angeles, including the chief of the Public Corruption and Civil Rights Section, have resigned following a plea deal offered to a sheriff’s deputy convicted of using excessive force.

The move has been criticized as highly unorthodox, undermining the jury verdict and potentially allowing the deputy to continue working in law enforcement.
