          <h2>European Pharmaceutical Industry Faces Potential Disruptions from Proposed US Tariffs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European pharmaceutical industry is bracing for potential disruptions as President Trump considers imposing tariffs on pharmaceuticals as part of his plan to reshape global trade and bolster US manufacturing. These tariffs could significantly impact the flow of essential medicines, including insulin, heart treatments, and flu vaccines, from the European Union to the United States. Pharmaceutical products and chemicals are the bloc’s No. 1 export to America. The move would have serious — and wildly uncertain — consequences for drugs made in the European Union.</p>

          <p>Australia, once a welcoming destination for international students, is now considering capping their numbers due to an escalating housing crisis. Politicians are debating these caps as a solution to unaffordable housing, which has become a major concern for voters. This shift marks a significant change for Australia, whose economy has heavily relied on international education. While politicians are looking at capping international students, there should be more focus on improving the selection criteria, according to Ali Bajwa, a Pakistani native and naturalized citizen.</p>

          <p>US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have reportedly deported three American children, aged 2, 4, and 7, along with their Honduran-born mothers.

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's temporary restoration of legal status for thousands of international students, many remain worried.
