          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin to push for an end to the conflict in Ukraine, following peace talks in Istanbul. Trump aims to address the high casualty rate, estimated at over 5,000 Russian and Ukrainian soldiers per week, and discuss trade. This renewed contact follows unsuccessful peace talks in Istanbul, where Putin declined to participate. Kyiv and its European backers are advocating for a 30-day ceasefire, while Moscow insists on conditions such as Ukraine ceding control of several regions and blocking Kyiv's NATO accession.</p>

          <p>Annual energy bills in the UK are predicted to fall by £129 in July, marking the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. This decrease, nearly 7%, would result in a typical annual bill of £1,720 for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit. While a positive development, analysts caution that prices remain significantly above pre-decade levels, potentially leaving many households struggling with affordability. The Energy Saving Trust emphasizes the need for government policy action to upgrade homes and reduce energy bills on a larger scale.</p>

          <p>Analysts are advising investors to be cautious about potential negative market surprises in the coming months, particularly after Moody's downgraded the US government's credit rating due to large fiscal deficits and rising interest costs. This downgrade led to a sharp sell-off in stocks and a rise in the 10-year Treasury yield. Experts also anticipate a potentially challenging third-quarter earnings season, where the impact of tariffs may be most pronounced. The second quarter earnings season has created a false sense of security about the profit impact of tariffs, but the tariffs won't be felt until the current quarter.</p>

The article further discusses how societal views shifted, elevating women's friendships in the 18th and 19th centuries while simultaneously fostering self-consciousness around male intimacy, influencing modern expectations and expressions of friendship.</p>

          <p>The EU and UK are working towards a level of cooperation not seen since Brexit, with new agreements on fisheries, trade and security. Deals were agreed as British PM Starmer hosts EU leaders in London. The agreements are aimed at slashing red tape and growing the British economy. An agreement on fisheries allows EU fishermen to have access to British waters for an extended period 12 years in exchange for the EU indefinitely easing red tape on food and drink imports and exports.</p>

          <p>Many federal student loan borrowers have seen their credit scores drop significantly as loan servicers resumed reporting delinquent accounts to credit bureaus. Borrowers who were unaware of their repayment obligations or unable to make payments during the pandemic pause are experiencing substantial credit score declines. Loan servicers began reporting delinquent accounts in January 2025, and wage garnishments are expected to resume soon for those more than 270 days late on payments. A lack of understanding of the student loan repayment process had borrowers missing communications from their loan servicer telling them to enroll in a repayment plan.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer is betting that the public is ready to move past Brexit and focus on practical solutions to improve relations with the EU. The new UK-EU deal aims to smooth the relationship within existing parameters, avoiding reopening major questions like membership of the single market and customs union. While the Conservatives have criticized the deal as a "surrender," Starmer's government believes that making the relationship smoother within those parameters is mere pragmatic common sense. The success of Starmer's approach hinges on whether the public truly wants to minimize friction with the EU.</p>
