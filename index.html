          <p>The article discusses the combat debut of China's PL-15E air-to-air missile during a skirmish between Pakistan and India in Kashmir, marking the first real-world test of the missile's capabilities after years of speculation. The deployment of the PL-15E by the Pakistan Air Force is seen as a reminder of China's growing prowess in air-to-air missile systems and advanced fighter aircraft. This development has implications for regional security in the Asia-Pacific and potential Taiwan conflicts, sparking discussions about China's increasing ambition in the global arms market. Conflicting claims from both sides in the Kashmir conflict make accurate performance assessment difficult.</p>

          <p>Motown legend Smokey Robinson is under criminal investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department following allegations of multiple sexual assaults dating back to 2014. The allegations stem from a civil suit filed by four former housekeepers, who accuse Robinson of sexual battery, assault, false imprisonment, gender violence, and creating a hostile work environment, seeking $50 million in damages. Robinson's attorney denies the accusations, claiming the accusers filed the police report to publicize their case.

          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction of 0.7% in the January-March period, marking the first decline in four quarters, according to government data.

          <p>An international team of researchers conducted an extensive genetic analysis tracing the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas, shedding light on the prehistoric human expansion that shaped the early genetic landscape of the western hemisphere. The study found that Native Americans are descendants of Asian populations, particularly from the West Beringian region, and that early migrants to South America formed distinct, isolated groups due to environmental conditions. This work could reveal new insights about disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy contracted more than expected in the first quarter of 2025, with new data revealing that stagnant consumption and falling exports are weighing heavily on the country. The economic slowdown has been largely attributed to falling exports, which drive the Japanese economy, and uncertainty caused by US President Donald Trump's trade policies, including tariffs on Japanese goods. Experts suggest that the economic slowdown trend will become clearer as Trump's tariffs take effect, increasing calls for greater fiscal spending. The article notes the Japanese central bank had long maintained a policy of negative interest rates to boost the economy but began to gradually hike rates last year.</p>

          <p>A massive dark patch has appeared off the coast of Rio de Janeiro near Barra da Tijuca Beach, with Reuters drone shots showing brownish water contrasting with the ocean's blue. According to biologist Mario Moscatelli, the stain is linked to urban growth and a lack of universal sanitation in the region, leading to sewage flowing into rivers, lagoons, and ultimately the sea. The color of the patch is greener due to the presence of cyanobacteria, a type of algae that multiplies in unhealthy conditions with high sewage levels.</p>

          <p>Romania is on the brink of electing a far-right president, George Simion, in an upcoming runoff election, following his comprehensive win in the first round. This rise is rooted in decades of economic failure, widespread insecurity, and mass emigration, fueling anti-establishment anger. The author argues that traditional parties have failed to address the broken economic model, contributing to the country's slide to the far right. Simion's platform focuses on catering to the domestic business class, while poor Romanians are left with empty promises of tax cuts, and his policies are compared to Viktor Orban's Hungary.</p>

          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April as investors moved away from U.S. markets due to President Donald Trump's trade policies. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen ($56.6 billion) worth of equities and long-term bonds, marking the largest net inflows for a calendar month since 1996. This shift was attributed to Trump's tariff shocks, which altered global investors' outlook on the U.S. economy and asset performance. However, as the U.S. softens its trade stance, confidence in U.S. assets is being restored. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared a polio outbreak in Papua New Guinea after samples of the virus were found in two healthy children during routine screening. Less than half of the country's population is immunized against polio, and the WHO is calling for an immediate vaccination campaign. The virus strain is genetically linked to one circulating in Indonesia, and the ongoing campaign will target children aged 10 and below, aiming to reach around 3.5 million people. The article notes that Polio has staged a comeback elsewhere in Asia in recent years.</p>

          <p>Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice has suggested that the UK could learn from Dubai's national pride and low crime levels, noting that Dubai schools educate children about being proud of their country. He splits his time between Westminster, his Skegness constituency and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which he visits "once every six to eight weeks" to spend time with his partner, journalist Isabel Oakeshott. Tice acknowledged that Dubai is not "perfect" but argued that politicians are ignoring lessons from countries "getting it right." The article also notes Dubai is ruled as an absolute monarchy.</p>

          <p>Japanese parliament enacted a law to allow preemptive acts of cyberdefense, giving the government the ability to monitor communications data and neutralize hostile servers in the event of an attack. The "active cyberdefense" law obliges operators of key infrastructure to report cyber breaches to the government. This move aims to enhance Japan's cybersecurity capacity to levels on par with the United States and major European nations. The government will establish a new independent panel to oversee data acquisition and analysis, ensuring that surveillance is conducted properly.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, as exports fell sharply. Uncertainties caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies affected Japan's export-heavy economy, although domestic demand showed some strength. While the weak yen has given a competitive advantage to Japan's exports, this has been "overpowered" by China's machinery and tool exports. Japan's top trade negotiator warned of downside risks to the economy from U.S. trade policy.</p>

The fine, issued by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), charges $500 for every day she has remained in the country since the order. The woman's attorney argues that the removal order should be lifted, as she has resided in the U.S. for over 10 years with no criminal record and is the mother of three U.S. citizen children.

Economists suggest that without deeper political integration and better coordination of fiscal and industrial policies, Europe risks being forced to adjust to the choices of others without shaping the outcomes. The climbdown in superpower tensions following high-wire talks in Geneva has led to a mutual reduction in tariffs, providing a respite in the turmoil that has roiled markets.</p>
