          <p>Jonathan Peter Brooks, a plastic surgeon, has been convicted of attempting to murder his former colleague, Graeme Perks, following a break-in and stabbing incident at Perks' home in Halam, Nottinghamshire, in January 2021. Brooks harbored deep-seated animosity towards Perks, who was a witness in disciplinary proceedings against him. The trial, held at a court in Loughborough, concluded more than four years after the attack, with Brooks found guilty of attempted murder after previously denying the charges, which included attempted arson and possession of a bladed article.</p>

          <p>The UK government is relaxing electric vehicle (EV) sales targets to support the car industry in response to new tariffs imposed by the US. While the ban on new petrol and diesel car sales remains in effect from 2030, manufacturers will now have more flexibility in meeting annual EV sales goals and face reduced fines for non-compliance. This decision comes as US President Donald Trump has levied a 25% tariff on cars imported to the US, a key export market for the UK. Opposition parties criticize the measures as insufficient to stimulate the car industry.</p>

          <p>With potential price increases due to tariffs, frugal shoppers may want to consider ways to save money at the grocery store ahead of summer. Strawberries are at the peak of both supply and flavor in late spring. Mexico supplies about 90% of the avocados consumed in the U.S., so this already-expensive produce to get even pricier. Mangoes and pineapples become a lot more affordable in late spring as imports from Mexico and Central America flood the market before summer. Canada exports large amounts of wheat, barley and oats to the U.S., so tariffs could influence prices here.</p>

These cuts include layoffs at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
