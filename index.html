The firm has been actively increasing its stakes, with holdings in companies like Mitsui and Mitsubishi now exceeding 10%. Buffett has expressed long-term commitment to these investments, which were initially attractive due to what he considered a 'ridiculous price.'

          <p>As part of a ceasefire agreement that includes the release of Israeli hostages, Hamas is demanding that Israel free prominent Palestinian prisoners, including Marwan Barghouti and Ahmad Saadat. These individuals were excluded from a list of 250 prisoners Israel published for release. The deal, proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, is in its first phase, with 20 Israeli hostages expected to be freed soon. The disagreement over which prisoners to release could potentially complicate or delay the implementation of the agreement.</p>

          <h2>Proposed U.S. Ban on Using Russian Airspace Could Increase Costs for Chinese Airlines</h2>

          <p>A proposal by the U.S. Department of Transportation to prohibit Chinese airlines from using Russian airspace for flights to and from the U.S. could lead to significant financial consequences. Analysts suggest this move, intended to level the playing field for U.S. carriers who avoid the airspace, would force Chinese airlines to either cancel flights or absorb higher costs from rerouting. This could disrupt flight schedules that are often planned six months in advance. The decision comes as the process for approving next year's summer flight season is set to begin.</p>

          <p>Plaid Cymru, a political party in Wales, has announced a plan to offer trainee teachers up to £30,000 if the party wins the next Senedd election. The incentive aims to retain teaching staff within Wales, particularly for Welsh-medium instruction and high-demand subjects like math and science. The policy is designed to match similar incentives offered in England by 2030 and would require recipients to work in Wales for five years. The party estimates the plan will cost £6-£7 million, sourced from funds already designated for curriculum support.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of assassinating UnitedHealthcare's CEO Brian Thompson, have filed a motion to dismiss several federal charges, including the one that carries a potential death penalty. The defense argues that Mangione was not read his rights before being questioned and that his backpack, containing a gun, was searched without a warrant. They are also challenging the federal murder charge by arguing the alleged underlying crime of stalking does not qualify as a 'crime of violence.' Mangione has pleaded not guilty to both state and federal charges in the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>With Cameroon's presidential election approaching, there is widespread frustration and apathy among the country's youth, who constitute over half the population. The disqualification of popular opposition figure Maurice Kamto has led many to believe the election is a foregone conclusion, with 92-year-old incumbent Paul Biya expected to win an eighth term. While some youth leaders observe a trend of boycotting the election out of disillusionment with unemployment and corruption, others note an increase in voter registration. The outcome may hinge on whether this disaffected demographic chooses to participate.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how former President Donald Trump has increasingly integrated himself into the world of sports, particularly combat sports like MMA, to project an image of strength and machismo. His appearances at events are seen as a strategy to leverage fan psychology, where allegiances to winners create a sense of personal success. The author argues that this 'MAGA-fication' of sports promotes a more brutish and rule-breaking sensibility, weakening the collective sense of boundaries that sports are traditionally meant to teach. This is exemplified by plans to host a UFC fight on the White House grounds.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author grapples with mourning the death of her grandmother while witnessing the immense suffering and loss of life in Gaza. She describes this as 'disenfranchised grief,' where her personal sorrow feels unearned or indulgent compared to the scale of the ongoing atrocity. The author reflects on how the constant stream of devastating images from the conflict recalibrates what feels worthy of grief. Ultimately, she finds defiance and a connection to her heritage in the act of cooking her grandmother's recipes, asserting that creating space for joy and sorrow is a way to refuse to let cruelty strip away humanity.</p>

Instead of viewing regret as a purely negative emotion tied to the past, the authors suggest it can be a tool for self-discovery in the present. By allowing oneself to experience the sadness, disappointment, or guilt associated with past mistakes, one can learn valuable lessons about their current self. The piece argues against a 'no regrets' philosophy, positing that engaging with this difficult emotion is essential for personal growth and understanding.</p>

Powell, who was recently sacked from Starmer's cabinet, is campaigning as a voice that will speak truth to power, while Phillipson, a current cabinet member, pitches herself as a loyal insider. With many party members reportedly disgruntled, the election of Powell is seen as a likely outcome that could signal dissatisfaction with Starmer's leadership.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing hunger, true famines have become increasingly rare, a significant achievement of the modern era driven by agricultural advancements. The world is projected to grow more grain this year than ever before, with global production of cereal crops far exceeding current use. This abundance is the result of a 'green revolution' involving better seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and widespread irrigation. While modern famines, like those in Gaza and Sudan, are now primarily caused by political failures and conflict, the overall progress in food production marks a historic success.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to legal scholars and historians, former President Donald Trump and his allies are using the recent killing of rightwing influencer Charlie Kirk to justify broad attacks on political adversaries. The response has included launching investigations into liberal donor George Soros, labeling critics the 'enemy within,' and branding the Democratic party a 'domestic extremist organization.' Experts describe this as 'page one of the authoritarian playbook,' using an act of violence as a pretext to undermine civil society, weaken opponents, and consolidate power. This strategy is seen as a dangerous move that threatens democratic norms.</p>

Thanks to the quick action of her medical team, Choate was resuscitated, and her daughter was delivered safely via C-section.

          <p>A Chinese military technology magazine has reported that China's electronic warfare (EW) force successfully tricked a foreign spy plane in the South China Sea. The EW system allegedly simulated the radar signals of a super-large vessel, such as an aircraft carrier, from up to 300km away. This deception may have caused the foreign aircraft to track a non-existent target or travel to an incorrect location. The report is a rare public disclosure of a specific combat operation involving China's increasingly sophisticated electronic warfare capabilities.</p>

This comes as the Trump administration characterizes opposition to its policies as a violent conspiracy, launching investigations into non-profits and threatening lawyers. Advocacy groups say they have been forced to increase security measures as they navigate a more hostile environment while trying to support immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>The Sudan Emergency Response Rooms (ERRs), a network of thousands of local volunteers, are providing critical humanitarian aid to millions displaced by the country's civil war. This grassroots effort, recently honored with a Right Livelihood Award, delivers food, shelter, and medical support by coordinating logistics through local organizers. A volunteer explains the work is rooted in the Sudanese value of 'nafeer,' or collective action, where communities come together to help one another.
