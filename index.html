        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is offering tax refunds to major French cognac makers like Hennessy and RÃ©my Martin to resolve an anti-dumping investigation. The deal requires producers to agree to minimum selling prices and avoid dumping practices, with a July 5 deadline looming. If no agreement is reached, temporary tariffs could become permanent, impacting the primarily French-produced spirit. This move occurs amidst broader trade tensions between China and the European Union, with the potential agreement offering a path to de-escalation for the industry.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a major review of its parental leave and pay policies for the first time in decades, aiming to modernize the system. The review will examine maternity, paternity, and shared parental leave, which critics have labeled as flawed and among the worst in the developed world. Campaign groups have praised the review as a generational opportunity to create a system that better supports working families.

          <p>The European Central Bank's chief economist, Philip Lane, has stated that the recent cycle of monetary policy interventions to control inflation is now complete. He affirmed that the primary goal of reducing the inflation rate from its peak back toward the 2% target has been achieved. While this phase is over, Lane cautioned that the ECB must remain prepared for new economic shocks and potential future rate adjustments. Other central bank officials echoed this sentiment, suggesting that any future moves would likely be further rate cuts to support a sluggish European economy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized Elon Musk's opposition to the 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' suggesting government subsidies for Musk's companies could be investigated. Musk has vehemently attacked the legislation as harmful to the American economy and threatened to support primary challengers against its backers. The article also details legislative maneuvering in the Senate, where an amendment by Senator Susan Collins to increase rural hospital funding failed.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to mortgage lender Nationwide, UK house prices fell by 0.8% in June, marking the most significant monthly decline since February 2023. This drop is partly attributed to weaker demand following recent changes to stamp duty tax thresholds, which made home purchases more expensive for many. Despite the slowdown, the annual price growth stood at 2.1%. Economists suggest this soft patch may be temporary, anticipating that low unemployment, rising earnings, and potential future interest rate cuts from the Bank of England could reinvigorate the housing market.

          <p>The UK's Labour government is managing a significant internal rebellion over planned changes to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip), a key disability benefit. Over 120 Labour MPs have threatened to oppose the bill, forcing ministers to offer concessions, such as delaying stricter eligibility criteria for new claimants until November 2026. Despite the large government majority, the dispute highlights deep ideological divisions within the party regarding welfare reform. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is personally engaging in a persuasion campaign to convince MPs that the changes are necessary for the welfare state's long-term stability.</p>

          <p>Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have developed a new framework using satellite remote sensing data to more accurately monitor carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants. This innovative method could provide a standardized, high-precision approach for global carbon accounting, which is currently lacking. The study suggests this technology has significant potential for verifying emissions from individual facilities and detecting anomalies. The framework could also be adapted to monitor other major emission sources, such as oil and gas fields or steel plants, enhancing global climate change mitigation efforts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate conducted a marathon voting session, known as a 'vote-a-rama,' on President Trump's major tax and spending bill, with Republicans aiming to pass it before a July 4 deadline. The legislation, which advanced on a narrow party-line vote, includes increased spending on border security and defense, offset by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. Democrats used the session to force votes on numerous amendments, putting Republicans on the record on controversial issues ahead of midterm elections. The bill's passage remains uncertain, with a few Republican senators still withholding their final support.</p>

          <p>Four major car dealer associations in China's affluent Yangtze River Delta have publicly appealed to automakers to revise their sales strategies. The dealers cite severe challenges, including high inventory levels, disorderly market competition, and immense pressure on their cash flow due to an ongoing industry price war. They allege that some automakers are forcing them to sell new vehicles at a loss, a practice that could violate competition laws. This public complaint highlights the significant financial strain the intense price competition is placing on the retail side of the world's largest auto market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Iowa has become the first U.S. state to remove gender identity from its civil rights code, eliminating non-discrimination protections for transgender and nonbinary residents in areas like housing and employment. The new law, which took effect Tuesday, also defines sex based on reproductive organs at birth and prevents changes to sex designations on birth certificates. This move reverses nearly two decades of legal protections and aligns with a broader trend in Republican-led states to enact restrictions on transgender rights.

The administration is promoting the site's remoteness and harsh environment as a deterrent, with the press secretary referring to it as 'Alligator Alcatraz.'

The RSPCA suggests the spike may be due to longer daylight hours, meaning more people are outside to witness and report abuse.

          <p>The Trump administration has moved to withhold $6.8 billion in federal education funds that Congress had already appropriated for the current fiscal year. The freeze impacts programs supporting teacher training, after-school activities, and aid for English learners and migrant students, with California set to lose at least $811 million. State education leaders have condemned the action as illegal, warning it will immediately harm students and disrupt programs for which staff have already been hired. The administration claims it is reviewing the funding to align with presidential priorities.</p>

          <h2>California Republican Lawmakers Urge Trump Administration to Focus ICE Raids on Violent Criminals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 23:13:15 EDT</div>

          <p>A group of six Republican state legislators in California has sent a letter to President Trump, urging federal immigration authorities to shift their focus from sweeping workplace raids to targeting violent criminals. The lawmakers argue that the current tactics are causing widespread fear, harming communities, and creating labor shortages in critical industries like construction and hospitality. While supporting the deportation of violent offenders, they contend the broad raids are arresting many non-criminal individuals and negatively impacting the state's economy and workforce.</p>
