        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A landmark international agreement to cut global shipping emissions was unexpectedly abandoned after Saudi Arabia and the United States, under President Trump, successfully ended negotiations. Over 100 countries had gathered to approve the deal, which aimed to make shipping the first industry with internationally mandated emission reduction targets. The Trump administration's threats of tariffs influenced several nations, leading to a motion to adjourn talks for a year, despite broad industry support for consistent global standards. This decision, described as "unacceptable" by some, significantly delays crucial efforts to curb the 3% of global emissions contributed by shipping, potentially pushing back regulations planned for 2028.</p>

          <p>John Bolton, former National Security Advisor to President Trump, pleaded not guilty in federal court to 18 counts related to the alleged mishandling of classified information. The indictment claims Bolton shared over 1,000 pages of sensitive "diary-like entries," some classified up to top secret, with two relatives during his tenure from 2018 to 2019. These entries allegedly contained detailed information from high-level government meetings, intelligence briefings, and discussions with foreign leaders. His attorney, Abbe Lowell, asserted that Bolton did not unlawfully share or store any information and that the charges are politically motivated, aiming to silence Trump's opponents.</p>

Analysts estimate DuPont currently trades at a 38% discount compared to its sum-of-parts valuation. The CNBC Investing Club plans to hold both DuPont and the new Qnity shares, viewing Qnity as a potentially stronger long-term investment due to its growth prospects in the semiconductor industry. Separately, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk experienced stock declines after President Trump's remarks about potentially lowering Ozempic's out-of-pocket costs to $150 a month, impacting the GLP-1 drug market.

          <p>A federal judge has lifted travel restrictions for Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, allowing him to speak at rallies and events across the U.S. as he fights his deportation case brought by the Trump administration. Khalil, a green card holder, was previously confined to a few states but the judge deemed him not a flight risk. He was arrested by ICE agents in March, becoming a prominent figure in the Trump administration's crackdown on pro-Palestinian campus activism, which it alleges is antisemitic. Khalil denies the government's accusations of misrepresenting past associations on his green card application and emphasizes the importance of his First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>Hungarian leader Viktor Orbán has enthusiastically welcomed President Trump's announcement of a second summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest to discuss the Ukraine war. Orbán, a close ally of both Trump and Putin, hailed the planned meeting as "great news for the peace-loving people of the world," despite the European Union accusing him of turning Hungary into an autocracy. The summit follows an earlier bilateral meeting in Alaska that yielded no tangible results, and comes as Russia continues its bombardment of Ukrainian cities. Hungary's government has maintained an adversarial stance towards Ukraine, opposing its EU bid and prohibiting weapons transit.</p>

          <p>As the government shutdown enters its third week, Democrats attribute the prolonged stalemate to their profound distrust of President Trump, which is hindering traditional bipartisan "gang" negotiations. Senator Richard Blumenthal questioned the efficacy of agreements when the president disregards established norms. While some bipartisan talks exist on specific issues, such as extending Affordable Care Act tax credits, no comprehensive group has formed to resolve the broader funding lapse. Democrats remain wary that Trump could unilaterally derail any agreement, as he has done in the past, leading them to demand his direct involvement or an "ironclad path forward" for a resolution.</p>

These furloughs affect personnel crucial for managing and safeguarding vital strategic assets and maintaining one-of-a-kind equipment.

          <p>Gold's recent record-breaking run, exceeding $4,300 and up over 60% this year, is prompting a significant shift away from the traditional 60/40 stock-bond investment portfolio. Many strategists and investors are now advocating for a 60/20/20 model, allocating 20% to alternatives like gold and Bitcoin, citing increased correlation between stocks and bonds. Central bank demand, de-dollarization, and geopolitical tensions are driving gold's appeal as a hedge against inflation and risk, with gold ETFs seeing record inflows. While gold is considered "risk off," Bitcoin, also reaching record highs, represents a more "risk on" alternative in this evolving portfolio strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

Regulators and industry leaders express concern that over-inflated projections could lead to billions in unnecessary infrastructure investments.

          <p>Falling behind on credit card payments can lead to wage garnishment, a serious consequence where a portion of one's paycheck is legally withheld by an employer. Federal law caps the maximum garnishment at the lesser of 25% of disposable income or the amount by which weekly disposable earnings exceed 30 times the federal minimum wage. However, states can impose stricter limits, with some even prohibiting garnishment for unsecured debts entirely. This article outlines strategies to address delinquent debt and avoid garnishment, such as negotiating settlements directly with creditors, working with debt relief companies, or entering a debt management plan. Bankruptcy is presented as a last resort for those with multiple debts and limited income.</p>

Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva expressed particular anxiety about the burgeoning "shadow bank" sector, or private credit, which has grown significantly since tighter bank regulations post-2008. The IMF fears this sector, with banks having $4.5 trillion of exposure, could trigger global chaos if loans sour. Recent failures of private credit-backed companies and warnings from figures like JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon underscore these mounting financial risks, keeping policymakers vigilant.</p>

          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff's suggestion that President Trump send federal troops to San Francisco has led to the resignation of prominent startup investor Ron Conway from the Salesforce Foundation board. Conway, a longtime Democratic donor, cited misaligned values with Benioff, who later appeared to walk back his comments by emphasizing local leadership responsibility for city safety. The controversy highlights the intersection of tech industry leadership, political stances, and corporate social responsibility, drawing criticism and amplification from figures like Elon Musk. The Trump administration has previously deployed the National Guard to other cities like Portland and Chicago, sparking protests and legal challenges over civil liberties.</p>

          <p>President Trump is signaling a renewed focus on ending the Ukraine war, announcing plans to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest following a recent phone call where Putin reportedly congratulated him on Middle East peace efforts. Trump, who previously boasted of his ability to end the conflict in "one day," is now preparing for his second face-to-face meeting with Putin during his second term, potentially within two weeks. The White House is also considering supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, a move the Kremlin views as a "serious escalation." This push for peace comes after a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, which Trump believes creates momentum for resolving other global conflicts.</p>

For players like Najma Arefi, who fled Afghanistan, this tournament represents not just wearing a jersey but also giving a voice to countless silenced women.

          <p>Residents of Gloster, Mississippi, are suing Drax Biomass after the UK-owned company secured a permit to become a "major source" of hazardous air pollution at its local wood pellet production plant. This decision reverses an earlier denial, allowing Drax to increase emissions despite residents' warnings of existing adverse health consequences like dizziness and headaches. The plant converts trees into pellets for Drax's UK power station, which receives billions in renewable energy subsidies despite criticism over unsustainable sourcing and previous fines for inaccurate data. The lawsuit alleges unlawful exposure to chemicals and pollutants, severely impacting the predominantly Black, low-income community's health and environment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen funding for two critical New York City infrastructure projects—the Gateway tunnels and the Second Avenue Subway extension—by imposing an onerous regulatory-review process. This move is widely interpreted as political pressure on Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, who represent New York. The administration is challenging the projects' compliance with new diversity mandates, even for work already underway, claiming the right to shut down federally subsidized transportation projects nationwide. Critics argue this action transforms Trump, who once championed efficient development by bypassing red tape, into the "NIMBY in chief" by weaponizing government bureaucracy against necessary development.</p>
