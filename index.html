          <p>A freight train collided with a double-decker bus in Atlacomulco, Mexico, resulting in at least eight fatalities and 45 injuries. The incident occurred in an industrial area, and video footage suggests the bus was slowly crossing the tracks in heavy traffic when the train struck it. Authorities are investigating the crash, which took place at a crossing that appeared to lack visible gates or warning signals. The bus company and the train line, Canadian Pacific Kansas City of Mexico, have acknowledged the accident and are cooperating with the investigation.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected Donald Trump's attempt to overturn an $83.3 million jury verdict for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. The court dismissed Trump's arguments that the damages were excessive and that he should have presidential immunity, stating he failed to provide new grounds for reconsideration. The ruling affirmed that the jury's findings from a previous case, where Trump was found liable for sexual abuse after denying Carroll's claim that he sexually assaulted her, could be applied to this case. Carroll's lawyer celebrated the decision, expressing a desire for the appellate process to conclude.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy in Pierce County, Washington, has been arrested after authorities discovered a cache of firearms and writings detailing a "mass shooting scenario" at his home. The investigation began after police received a tip that the boy was making threats to kill and had access to guns. A search of the home uncovered numerous secured and unsecured firearms, loaded magazines with disturbing notes, and other materials indicative of planning a mass shooting. The sheriff's office noted that the teenager, who was arrested on unspecified charges, has not been enrolled in any school district since 2021.</p>

Ives stated his belief that Worldcoin's biometric identity verification system will become the standard for authentication in the age of AI.

          <p>A strike by the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union has severely disrupted London's Underground network, forcing commuters to find alternative transportation like bikes and buses. The union is demanding better pay and a reduction of the standard work week from 35 to 32 hours, citing the strain on employees and a budget surplus at Transport for London (TfL). TfL has called the demands "simply unaffordable," stating that such a change would cost hundreds of millions of pounds. The industrial action has drawn criticism from some commuters and public officials, who are urging both sides to negotiate a resolution.</p>

          <p>France's government has been toppled after Prime Minister François Bayrou lost a no-confidence vote in the National Assembly, creating a new political crisis for President Emmanuel Macron. The vote was triggered by Bayrou's push for an unpopular budget with deep spending cuts to address the nation's significant public debt. This marks the third prime minister to be ousted under Macron in a short period, highlighting the instability caused by a hung parliament. Macron must now find a fourth prime minister who can build a consensus among deeply divided lawmakers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article from Fox News posits that as Americans no longer watch the same television shows, advertisements have become one of the last forms of shared media and a central battleground in the culture wars. The author traces how television shows once reflected and shaped societal conversations on issues like race and homosexuality over decades. Now, with a fragmented streaming landscape, advertisements like those from Bud Light or Pepsi are where these cultural debates play out for a mass audience. The piece argues that advertisers should focus on selling products rather than engaging in progressive politicking to avoid alienating consumers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected a lawsuit from 19 states and the District of Columbia that challenged the Trump administration's mass firing of thousands of probationary federal workers. The court ruled 2-1 that the states lacked the legal standing to sue, as the management of the federal workforce is a federal function, not a state interest. The administration terminated at least 24,000 employees as part of a plan to reduce the size of the government. While a lower court had ordered the reinstatement of workers, the appeals court decision effectively dismisses the states' challenge on procedural grounds.</p>

          <p>This sports commentary reflects on the often dull and routine nature of England's World Cup qualifying matches, contrasting their consistent success in qualifiers with their frequent disappointment in major tournaments. The article notes that England has lost only four World Cup qualifiers in the last 30 years, leading to matches that lack jeopardy and excitement for fans. It highlights memorable exceptions, such as David Beckham's 2001 free-kick against Greece, but argues that most qualifiers involve breaking down defensive, lower-ranked teams. The piece concludes that these games are a formality before the true test of England's progress begins.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to resume its sweeping immigration enforcement stops in the Los Angeles area, lifting a lower court's restraining order. The previous order had barred federal agents from detaining individuals based solely on factors like race, language, or occupation without reasonable suspicion. The administration argued the injunction hindered law enforcement, while dissenting justices warned the decision puts constitutional freedoms at risk by allowing seizures of people who appear Latino or work low-wage jobs. This ruling is a key development in the administration's campaign for mass deportations in Southern California.</p>

          <p>Following the collapse of the French government, economists are expressing concern that the country's political turmoil and massive public debt could pose a risk to the stability of the eurozone. France's sovereign debt stands at approximately €3.35 trillion, or 113% of its GDP, one of the highest ratios in the EU. The political deadlock makes it difficult to implement necessary spending cuts, leading to higher risk premiums on French bonds. While a short-term crisis is not imminent, experts warn that continued instability in Europe's second-largest economy could undermine the European Central Bank's credibility and create broader economic contagion.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage approaches a one-year low, financial experts advise that prospective homebuyers can take steps to secure even better terms. Key strategies include improving one's credit score by paying bills on time and keeping debt low, as a higher score directly translates to a lower interest rate. Increasing the down payment, ideally to 20% or more, can also lead to more favorable loan terms and help avoid private mortgage insurance. Finally, borrowers should consider alternatives to a 30-year fixed loan, such as an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), which can offer a lower initial rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a series of late-game collapses and a bullpen ERA ranking in the bottom half of the league, the Los Angeles Dodgers are not planning to change their bullpen hierarchy yet. Manager Dave Roberts and pitching coach Mark Prior have expressed continued belief in their high-profile but underperforming relievers, including closer Tanner Scott and setup man Blake Treinen. The team hopes these experienced pitchers can regain their form before the playoffs, drawing parallels to last season when the bullpen found its stride at the right time. However, Roberts acknowledges that his faith is not blind and has given opportunities to younger arms.</p>

          <p>This article provides context for the collapse of France's government after Prime Minister François Bayrou lost a confidence vote over his proposed budget cuts. The crisis stems from President Emmanuel Macron's 2024 snap election gamble, which resulted in a hung parliament and has made governing exceptionally difficult. With France facing a debt of over €3.3 trillion, Bayrou's attempts at austerity were met with unified opposition. Macron must now either appoint a fifth prime minister in under two years or call another risky election, with potential candidates from both the left and right being considered to break the political deadlock.</p>

In response, the Department of Homeland Security announced "Operation Midway Blitz," an enforcement action targeting undocumented immigrants.
