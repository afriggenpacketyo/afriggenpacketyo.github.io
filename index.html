          <p>A vehicle plowed into a crowd at a Filipino heritage festival in Vancouver, resulting in at least 11 fatalities and numerous injuries, according to Canadian authorities. Terrorism has been ruled out as a motive, with police stating the suspect, who was apprehended by bystanders, has a history of mental health issues. Vancouver's mayor described the incident as the city's darkest day, while Prime Minister Mark Carney expressed condolences to the victims and the Filipino Canadian community. The Lapu Lapu Day festival celebrates Filipino heritage and resistance to colonization.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll reveals that while President Trump maintains support from his base, many Americans believe his administration focuses too much on tariffs and not enough on lowering prices. This perception is negatively impacting his approval ratings on the economy and inflation. While supporters approve of his deportation program, concerns are growing about the economy and potential impacts of tariffs. The poll also highlights a divide between Republicans and Democrats regarding the direction of the country under Trump's leadership.</p>
