          <p>The Trump administration mistakenly issued reduction-in-force notices to hundreds of key CDC employees, including those involved in Ebola and measles outbreak responses and the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, due to a "coding error." These affected employees are expected to receive formal rescission notices within days, but hundreds of other HHS staff will still face job losses amid the ongoing government shutdown. Separately, President Trump announced he is directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to use "all available funds" to ensure military members receive their pay on October 15. This directive comes as Congress remains deadlocked over negotiations to reopen the federal government, with Trump refusing to negotiate until Democrats address healthcare demands.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is exhibiting an unparalleled dominance in the tech industry, rapidly expanding its influence across various sectors from data center development to consumer applications. The privately held company, led by CEO Sam Altman, has achieved a $500 billion valuation and boasts 800 million weekly users for its ChatGPT chatbot. This rapid growth and extensive investment across the AI stack, including recent deals with major tech players and the launch of new products like Sora AI video app, is creating a "gold rush mentality" but also uncertainty for smaller startups. Experts note the speed of disruption is faster than ever, with OpenAI's deep capital and vertical integration challenging traditional market dynamics.</p>

Authorities responded to the incident near Pacific Coast Highway and Huntington Street, where two individuals were rescued from the helicopter wreckage, and three others on the street sustained injuries. A witness described hearing a "ping" and seeing a part fly off before the helicopter spun out of control and slammed into the ground. The crash occurred during an event called "Cars 'N Copters on the Coast." The cause of the incident is currently unclear, with an ongoing investigation, and a section of Pacific Coast Highway was closed to traffic.</p>

          <p>British heavyweight David Allen suffered a unanimous points defeat against Russian Arslanbek Makhmudov in a headline fight at a raucous Sheffield Arena. Despite a passionate 9,000-strong home crowd, the 33-year-old Allen, who had returned to the sport with titles in mind after a five-year hiatus, faced his toughest opponent yet in the imposing Makhmudov. Allen showed resilience, landing significant body shots and uppercuts, particularly sparking to life in the ninth round. Although he pushed hard in the final round, it was not enough to secure a victory. This marks another setback in Allen's career, but he expressed determination to continue, having previously rebuilt his career over the past four years.</p>

          <p>Former investment banker and LAUSD superintendent Austin Beutner appears to be laying the groundwork for a mayoral run against incumbent Karen Bass in 2026. Social media accounts briefly displayed "AUSTIN for LA MAYOR" banners and campaign text, which were quickly removed, fueling speculation about his intentions. Beutner, 65, would be the most significant challenger to Bass, who is seeking a second term amidst recent city crises including the devastating Palisades fire, a $1-billion budget shortfall, and federal immigration crackdowns. Beutner brings diverse experience from finance, journalism, and local government, having previously explored a mayoral bid in 2012 before withdrawing.</p>

          <p>William Bordsen, a 40-year-old murder suspect, has been returned to jail after a judge revoked his bond, bringing relief to the family of the victim, Robert Murphy. Bordsen was initially arrested in July on first-degree murder charges for the alleged beating death of 65-year-old Murphy but managed to bond out in only three days. Prosecutors presented new evidence indicating Murphy was not intoxicated as Bordsen claimed, and cellphone video reportedly showed Bordsen taunting Murphy as he lay dying. The victim's son expressed profound outrage that Bordsen was ever released, and the suspect is now held in jail under no bond, though the family remains concerned about future changes.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard troops in the Chicago area, upholding a lower court's ruling against the White House's request. The Trump administration sought to deploy approximately 500 federalized National Guard soldiers from Texas and Illinois to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities amidst ongoing protests. While the court's order keeps troops off Chicago streets, it granted the administration's request to temporarily keep these federalized troops under federal control. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul hailed the decision as a victory for the state and local law enforcement, emphasizing the protection of community rights to protest.</p>

          <p>As China drafts its 15th five-year plan, the document is expected to reflect evolving high-level policy priorities and a new approach to infrastructure spending and investment. Previous plans, such as the 4-trillion-yuan stimulus package in 2009, fueled massive economic growth and connected vast populations, though they also contributed to local government debt. Despite these concerns, officials and government advisers still see considerable value in these investments. Economists remain bullish on the scale of infrastructure spending over the next half-decade, noting projects are likely to become more tech-driven and people-focused to meet the demands of a new era.</p>

This attack comes less than two weeks after a report into the facility found violence had "increased markedly," with many prisoners feeling unsafe, particularly older men convicted of sexual offenses.

          <p>An early season storm is expected to bring widespread and beneficial rainfall to the Los Angeles region next week, with the peak anticipated on Tuesday. This unusually deep low-pressure system is forecast to drop 0.5 to 1.5 inches of rain on Los Angeles and Ventura counties, with up to 3 inches in mountainous areas. While minor flooding on some roads is expected, little major flooding is anticipated, according to the National Weather Service. Meteorologists noted that this storm, though strong, won't be sufficient to end the region's wildfire season. Residents are advised to monitor forecasts due to potential flash flooding and debris flow risks in burn scar areas, along with expected strong wind gusts.</p>

While five soldiers were also injured in the incident, Quaker's injuries prevented his return to ceremonial duties.

This closure impacts 21 museums and research centers, affecting millions of visitors and researchers.
