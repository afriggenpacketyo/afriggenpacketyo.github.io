        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chelsea's Senegalese striker, Nicolas Jackson, is set to join German champions Bayern Munich on a loan deal that includes an option for a permanent transfer. The agreement involves an initial loan fee of £13 million, with a subsequent purchase option valued at £56.2 million. Jackson, who joined Chelsea in 2023, has reportedly agreed to a pre-contract with Bayern and is traveling to Germany to finalize the move. His opportunities at Chelsea have become limited following the arrival of new signings, and this transfer offers him a chance for more consistent playing time at a top European club.</p>

          <p>A Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has affirmed a lower court's decision, ruling that President Donald Trump does not possess the authority to unilaterally modify the nation's tariff schedules. This judgment represents a significant legal challenge to the administration's trade policies, which have heavily relied on the use of tariffs. The decision is expected to be appealed, potentially leading to a major showdown over executive power and trade authority at the Supreme Court. This ruling underscores the ongoing constitutional debate regarding the separation of powers in U.S. economic policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A worldwide movement to protect children online, exemplified by regulations like the U.K.'s Online Safety Act and the proposed U.S. Kids Online Safety Act, is driving a surge in AI-driven safety technologies. These laws compel tech companies to shield minors from harmful content, with significant financial penalties for non-compliance. In response, companies like Yoti are developing AI-based age verification systems using facial analysis, while phone manufacturers are creating child-safe smartphones with built-in content filters. This regulatory pressure is creating a new market for digital safety solutions, though it also raises privacy concerns among critics.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked the visas of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and 80 other officials, preventing them from attending the upcoming UN General Assembly session in New York. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the decision was due to actions undermining peace efforts and seeking unilateral statehood recognition. This move, welcomed by Israel, raises questions about U.S. obligations under the UN Headquarters Agreement, which generally ensures access for foreign officials. The Palestinian leadership expressed astonishment at the decision, calling it a violation of international law and urging its reversal.</p>

          <p>Violent protests erupted in Makassar, Indonesia, after a motorcycle taxi driver was killed by a police vehicle, leading to the deaths of three people. Demonstrators set fire to a local council building, trapping and killing one civil servant and two staff members. The unrest stems from public anger towards the Mobile Brigade Corp (Brimob), a paramilitary police unit known for its aggressive tactics. President Prabowo Subianto has promised a thorough investigation into the driver's death and urged for calm as the situation presents a major test for his new administration.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has fired a Department of Justice paralegal, Elizabeth Baxter, for making an obscene gesture and cursing at a National Guard member in Washington, D.C. The incident occurred as Baxter was arriving at work, where she reportedly bragged about her actions to a security guard. In a termination letter, Bondi stated that employees who disrespect law enforcement and oppose the department's mission will no longer be employed. This dismissal follows that of another DOJ paralegal accused of assaulting a federal officer, reflecting a strict stance on employee conduct within the current administration.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's recent struggles, highlighted by a Carabao Cup loss to Grimsby Town, stem from difficulties in implementing manager Ruben Amorim's tactical gameplan. This article provides an in-depth analysis of Amorim's rigid 5-2-3 positional system, which relies on creating numerical overloads in wide areas through specific passing routines. However, opponents have effectively countered this strategy with man-to-man marking and by mirroring United's formation, neutralizing their primary method of attack. The system's lack of encouragement for individual dribbling and roaming further limits its effectiveness against disciplined defensive setups in the highly competitive Premier League.</p>
