          <h2>Over 100 Aid Organizations Warn of Mass Starvation in Gaza</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 10:23:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of 115 international aid organizations has issued a stark warning about "mass starvation" in Gaza, attributing the crisis to the Israeli government's siege. The joint statement highlights the severe food and water shortages, with 90% of the population facing difficulty accessing water and some aid workers now needing to queue for food. The groups, including Oxfam and Save the Children, accuse Israel of imposing restrictions that lead to chaos and death, while an Israeli spokesperson denies the existence of a famine and blames Hamas for disrupting aid distribution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Nations human rights office reported that Israeli forces have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians seeking food aid in Gaza since May, with most deaths occurring near sites run by an American contractor. Amid warnings of famine, desperation is growing, with the Gaza Health Ministry reporting 80 child starvation deaths since the war began. Israel denies the UN's figures and blames Hamas for the crisis, while a joint statement from 28 Western-aligned nations condemned the "inhumane killing of civilians" and the dangerous aid delivery model.</p>

          <p>A concert at Italy's Reggia di Caserta palace featuring renowned Russian conductor Valery Gergiev was abruptly canceled following a public outcry over his support for President Vladimir Putin. The cancellation was praised by critics, including Yulia Navalnaya, widow of the late opposition leader, who argued that artists supporting the Russian regime should not be welcomed in Europe. Gergiev has faced similar cancellations at other major venues for refusing to denounce Russia's invasion of Ukraine, while the Russian Foreign Ministry condemned the move as discriminatory "cancel culture."</p>

          <p>New York City Councilwoman Inna Vernikov, a Republican, has voiced alarm over the popularity of Democratic mayoral candidate Zohan Mamdani, suggesting his support is driven by a "pipe dream" and a "culture of shame." Vernikov, who grew up in Soviet Ukraine, argues that Mamdani's socialist policies are a dangerous, failed experiment and that many of his privileged white voters are motivated by guilt. She characterizes his platform as a collection of unachievable promises, labeling him a communist whose ideas are counter to American democracy.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Centre claim to have developed a new design platform that overcomes a major computational obstacle in aviation known as the "curse of dimensionality." The software allows for a vast number of design variables without increasing the computing load, a long-standing challenge. To demonstrate its capability, the researchers applied it to the design of the US Navy's canceled X-47B stealth drone, stating their system achieved dramatic improvements in balancing stealth, aerodynamics, and propulsion.</p>

          <p>The sea slug Elysia chlorotica exhibits a remarkable biological feat by stealing chloroplasts from the algae it eats and incorporating them into its own body to perform photosynthesis. This process of symbiosis, where the slug essentially becomes part-leaf, raises profound questions about evolution, suggesting that the transfer of genetic material between species may be a more significant driver of change than previously thought. While the exact mechanism remains a mystery, the creature serves as a vivid example of how the boundaries between an organism and its environment can be fluid.</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis suggests that President Trump's aggressive use of tariffs is achieving tangible results, exemplified by a recent trade agreement with Japan. The deal, which sets a 15% tariff on Japanese goods, is seen as a win for the Trump administration's hardball approach and could serve as a model for negotiations with other economic blocs like the EU. While the tariffs are raising significant revenue for the U.S. Treasury, questions remain about the long-term impact on American consumers and the stability of the U.S. dollar.

However, with the team having played consecutive extra-time matches, some analysts argue that the fresh legs of the in-form substitutes might be crucial for overcoming fatigue in the final.</p>
