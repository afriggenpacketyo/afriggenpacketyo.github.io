          <p>The UK government has granted police new powers to impose conditions on recurring protests, allowing them to consider the cumulative impact of previous demonstrations. This move follows a day of mass arrests and comes amid ongoing protests related to the proscription of Palestine Action. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the policy is about placing restrictions, not banning protests, to balance the right to protest with community safety, particularly for Jewish communities feeling intimidated. Critics, including the Liberal Democrats and Amnesty International, argue the measures undermine free speech without addressing the root causes of hate.</p>

          <p>In the investigation into the 2023 murder of Kenneth Fandrich at an Intel campus in Oregon, detectives raced against time to secure a crucial piece of evidence: a maroon minivan believed to be the primary crime scene. The suspect, Dr. Steven Milner, allegedly used the vehicle to kill Fandrich before abandoning it. After being towed and sold, investigators tracked the minivan to a metal scrapyard, only to discover it had been crushed into scrap metal just a week before their arrival. This setback forced prosecutors to build their case against Milner without the significant forensic evidence the van likely contained.</p>

          <p>Major corporations including Amazon, Meta, and warehouse REIT Prologis have co-founded the Sustainable Concrete Buyers Alliance (SCoBA) to address the significant carbon footprint of concrete manufacturing. The initiative aims to use the members' collective purchasing power to create demand for low-carbon concrete, thereby encouraging producers to invest in expensive decarbonization technologies. By establishing a 'book-and-claim' system, the alliance will allow companies to purchase environmental attribute certificates for sustainable concrete without needing to physically ship the material over long distances. This market-driven approach is designed to accelerate the adoption of greener building materials across the industry.</p>

          <p>In his new memoir, "Cat on the Road to Findout," singer-songwriter Yusuf Islam, also known as Cat Stevens, explores his lifelong spiritual journey and complex public identity. The artist discusses his early rise to stardom, his subsequent conversion to Islam, and his nearly 30-year departure from the music industry, which he initially believed was forbidden by his new faith. He now reconciles his past and present by performing as Yusuf/Cat Stevens, viewing it as a complete picture of who he is. The article also touches on his controversial 1989 comments regarding Salman Rushdie, which he attributes to a misjudged attempt at humor.</p>

Sanders, who was seen sitting frequently during the game, reported feeling significant pain and a throbbing sensation in his leg, which he attributed to a lack of blood flow. This issue follows a series of serious health challenges for Sanders, including the amputation of two toes in 2021 due to blood clots and recent treatment for bladder cancer.

          <p>Senator Cory Booker (D-N.J.) has described the ongoing government shutdown as a "tsunami of Donald Trump's creation," emphasizing the severe impact on Americans' healthcare. Speaking on ABC's "This Week," Booker stated that the key difference in this funding battle is the imminent threat of tens of millions of people losing health insurance due to Trump's policies attacking Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. He asserted that Democrats are focused on the real-world consequences for citizens rather than political blame. Booker also defended his party's leadership, noting that they have been actively trying to negotiate a resolution.</p>

          <p>The Wayne National Forest in Ohio, a critical wilderness area reclaimed from early 20th-century coal mining, is now targeted for logging under a Trump administration executive order.

Critics fear that large-scale clear-cutting could release pollutants trapped in the soil from old mines, contaminate waterways like the Ohio River, and increase flood risks.

He explains that nonverbal cues, especially tone, carry significant emotional weight and can make simple questions feel like accusations, leading to escalation. The article suggests that partners should practice self-awareness, pausing to rephrase when their tone is harsh and owning the mistake. For those on the receiving end, it is recommended to calmly ask for the statement to be repeated in a different way, interrupting the cycle of defensiveness without escalating the argument.</p>

          <p>Under new leader Zack Polanski, the Green Party of England and Wales is shifting its strategy from a localized, consensus-building approach to a more confrontational, "eco-populist" stance. Polanski has promised to "pick fights" to gain national attention and cut through a splintered political landscape, a style embraced by his leadership team. The party, which has seen a surge in membership, is now targeting urban constituencies and studying the playbook of parties like Reform UK to craft simple, emotionally resonant messaging. This pivot aims to turn growing momentum into concrete electoral power, though it risks alienating some traditional rural supporters.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing a proposal, prompted by President Trump, to end the requirement for public companies to file quarterly reports, potentially shifting to a semi-annual schedule. Proponents argue this change would reduce costs and allow companies to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term earnings pressure. However, the move could significantly impact the revenue of major accounting firms, which earn substantial fees from quarterly audits and reviews. The debate also considers the potential effects on market transparency and investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge identifies her number one rule for parents as banning all electronic devices from a child's bedroom overnight to ensure adequate sleep. In her book, she argues that this single, straightforward rule is crucial for the physical and mental health of children, whose developing brains rely on sleep for cognitive growth and emotional regulation. Research shows that a majority of adolescents miss out on sleep due to late-night device use, a habit linked to increased risks of depression and anxiety. Twenge advises parents to be firm in implementing this rule, even with older teens, by explaining its importance for their well-being.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News poll indicates that most Americans do not believe either party's position is worth causing a government shutdown, with many concerned about its potential economic impact. President Trump, Congressional Democrats, and Republicans all receive net negative approval ratings for their handling of the situation. The poll also highlights negative public perceptions of both parties, with Democrats most often described as "weak" and Republicans as "extreme." A majority of Americans believe the Trump administration is not sufficiently focused on key issues like lowering prices, viewing the shutdown as a distraction.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the European Union's immediate economic threat comes from expanding U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum goods, not from Chinese electric vehicles (EVs). The U.S. has recently added hundreds of new items, including components for transport and energy products, to its tariff list, which will directly impact European exporters. The author suggests that Brussels should negotiate a compromise with Beijing on the EV issue to free up political capital to push back against the more pressing threat from Washington's protectionist trade policies. This strategic pivot is presented as essential for protecting European suppliers and climate goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>JPMorgan has challenged the popular retirement savings goal of $1 million, suggesting that for most American households, a lower target is more realistic and sufficient. Using an income-replacement model, the bank estimates that a household earning $90,000 annually would need approximately $700,000 by age 65 to maintain its lifestyle. The analysis indicates that a seven-figure savings goal is typically only necessary for households with current incomes of $125,000 or more. However, these calculations rely heavily on supplemental income from Social Security, which faces potential funding shortfalls in the coming decades. (not investment advice)</p>
