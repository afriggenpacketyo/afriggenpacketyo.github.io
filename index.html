          <p>Nexstar Media Group is still deciding whether to resume broadcasting "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on its ABC-affiliated stations following the show's return to air. The program was preempted on dozens of Nexstar and Sinclair-owned stations after host Jimmy Kimmel made controversial comments linking an alleged killer to President Trump's MAGA movement. This move has left the late-night show unavailable in approximately 20% of the country, prompting ongoing discussions between the broadcast owners and Disney to ensure the program aligns with the interests of the communities they serve.</p>

The entrepreneurs acquired the brands of bankrupt retailers like RadioShack, Pier 1 Imports, and Modell's Sporting Goods with the promise of transforming them into profitable online businesses. However, the SEC alleges they misrepresented the companies' financial health to investors, using new investor funds to pay returns to earlier backers and diverting at least $16 million for personal use.</p>

          <p>The NFL's finance committee has approved the sale of a 2.35% stake in the Chicago Bears, establishing a new league record valuation of $8.9 billion for the franchise. The stake, previously held by the estate of the late Andrew McKenna, was sold to the team's existing majority owners, the McCaskey and Ryan families. This valuation significantly surpasses the team's estimated worth from a year ago and reflects the soaring value of NFL teams, even as the Bears continue to explore options for a new stadium to replace the aging Soldier Field.</p>

This attack follows other recent security threats at federal immigration facilities in Texas, prompting officials to condemn the violent rhetoric directed at law enforcement and increase security at ICE locations nationwide.</p>

          <p>A French Foreign Ministry spokesperson has defended a UN initiative recognizing a Palestinian state, countering the Trump administration's view that such a move would be a gift to Hamas. The official stated that the plan, co-led by France and Saudi Arabia, is designed to marginalize the terror group by reviving the two-state solution and includes commitments to condemn the October 7th attacks and exclude Hamas from any future government. This diplomatic effort is framed as a way to create stability and is coherent with the logic of the previous Abraham Accords.</p>

          <p>In a challenging economic climate with high interest rates, managing multiple debts has become increasingly difficult for many borrowers. This article outlines several structured strategies to tackle debt, including the "debt snowball" method, which focuses on paying off the smallest balances first for psychological motivation, and the "debt avalanche" method, which targets high-interest debts to save money. Other viable options discussed are consolidating debts with a personal loan, using a 0% APR balance transfer credit card, or seeking professional help through a debt management plan.

The lawsuit alleges that the crash, which killed 67 people, was preventable and resulted from systemic failures to address safety concerns despite more than 30 documented near-misses in the area. Attorneys for the victim's family argue that all parties were aware of the risks posed by congested airspace around Reagan National Airport but failed to take adequate measures.</p>

          <p>Residents in the San Rafael area of Northern California have been warned about an unusually aggressive squirrel that has reportedly attacked at least five people, sending two to the emergency room. Victims described the squirrel launching itself at them unprovoked, resulting in bites and scratches. A local wildlife rescue organization suggests the animal's aggressive behavior likely stems from being hand-fed by humans when it was young, causing it to lose its natural fear and associate people with food.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has signaled a more conciliatory approach toward China, calling for engagement in a "spirit of mutual understanding" to address ongoing trade disputes. This softer tone suggests the European Union is prioritizing cooperation with Beijing on critical global issues, such as the war in Ukraine and climate change. The shift comes despite persistent European concerns over China's export controls, market access barriers, and industrial overcapacity, indicating a strategic move to navigate a complex geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced that his department will return $13 billion in funding that was appropriated during the Biden administration for green energy projects. Wright claimed that climate action policies have failed to lower global emissions and have only increased energy costs, thereby reducing quality of life. The move is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to dismantle previous climate policies and halt renewable energy projects, such as offshore wind farms.</p>
