          <p>Mounjaro, a weight loss injection, is now available at GP surgeries in England for eligible patients meeting strict criteria, including a BMI of 40 or over with specific health conditions. NHS England is implementing a phased approach to manage demand and resources, with wider availability expected in the coming years. The injection, which makes users feel full and can lead to significant weight loss, requires regular check-ups and wrap-around care. GPs are urging people to check their eligibility before contacting their local surgery due to workforce constraints, as Mounjaro is also available through specialist weight management services.</p>

Palestine Action, which has targeted arms companies, claims its actions aim to disrupt the supply chain to what they describe as "genocide".

          <p>As the conflict between Israel and Iran escalates, the possibility of regime change in Iran is being discussed, but experts warn of potentially disastrous consequences based on historical examples. Foreign-imposed regime change is a violation of international law and often leads to power vacuums, violence, and instability, as seen in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya. Analysts doubt the feasibility of external regime change in Iran without ground forces and local support, highlighting the need for a transition backed by the Iranian people. The article emphasizes that aerial bombardment alone is unlikely to bring about regime change.</p>

He expressed concern that the strikes were undertaken without congressional approval, which holds the sole authority to declare war. Himes warned of a worst-case scenario involving dead soldiers, moved nuclear material, and the construction of a nuclear device. </p>

          <p>Iran's parliament has approved a measure to potentially close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for global oil transit, in response to recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Experts suggest this move risks alienating neighboring oil-producing countries and key trade partners like China. While the decision rests with Iran's national security council, the closure could lead to higher energy prices and increased geopolitical tensions. Analysts believe Iran is unlikely to fully close the strait, as it would harm its own oil exports and provoke a strong response from the U.S. and Israel.</p>

          <p>As Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex crimes trial nears its conclusion, legal experts are raising questions about missing key witnesses and lingering uncertainties in the case. Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani questioned why Gina, Victim 3 in the indictment, did not testify and why Diddy's chief of staff, Kristina "KK" Khorram, was not called to the stand. Rahmani suggested that Khorram could have been a crucial witness, potentially even a co-conspirator, given her alleged involvement in the alleged sex and drug trafficking.

The researchers monitored superconducting quantum chips alongside muons produced by cosmic rays and gamma ray-induced particle disturbances. The findings, published in Nature Communications, suggest that these particles can induce correlated errors in qubits, potentially impacting the scaling of quantum processors. The proposed detection method could also be applied in cosmic ray and dark matter particle detection.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the wife of Marine Corps veteran Adrian Clouatre, was detained by ICE during a routine immigration appointment in Louisiana, despite still breastfeeding their 3-month-old daughter. Paola, a Mexican national who entered the U.S. seeking asylum as a child, was subject to a deportation order from 2018 due to her mother's failure to appear at a hearing. The detention has separated Paola from her family, including her newborn, and has raised concerns about the treatment of military families under current immigration policies. The Clouatres are seeking to reopen the case and halt the deportation order.</p>

          <p>The escalating tensions in the Middle East, including U.S. strikes on Iran and threats to close the Strait of Hormuz, are causing concerns about the global economy. Analysts warn that a potential shutdown of the Strait of Hormuz could lead to higher crude prices, increased U.S. inflation, and complications for the Federal Reserve's rate-cut plans. Gold is expected to benefit from geopolitical shocks, while Chinese assets may remain relatively shielded. The uncertainty is prompting increased risk aversion in the markets.</p>

          <p>NATO allies are set to pledge to increase their defense spending, with the U.S. pushing for a target of 5% of GDP, comprised of 3.5% for "pure" defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure. While some member states are committed to this goal, others struggle to meet the existing 2% threshold. The U.S. aims to see concrete action and clear timelines, but concerns remain about whether these pledges will materialize, given the economic trade-offs and political challenges involved.

However, challenges are emerging, including high inflation, soaring interest rates, and worker shortages. Russia's economy minister has warned of an impending recession, with concerns about stagnation and the impact of sanctions on technology imports and vital investment projects.
