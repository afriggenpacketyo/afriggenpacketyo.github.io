          <p>Dick Barnett, a key player in the New York Knicks' successful 1970s era, has died at the age of 88. Barnett, known for his unique jump shot, was a member of the only two NBA championship teams in Knicks history. His passing was announced by the Knicks shortly after their playoff victory against the Detroit Pistons. Barnett was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in April 2024, recognizing his 14 seasons in the NBA, including nine with the Knicks, where he played alongside legends like Walt Frazier and Willis Reed.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is scheduled to visit the Philippines to enhance security cooperation, including a potential intelligence-sharing agreement. Analysts suggest that China is likely to view this strengthened US-Japan-Philippines alliance with caution, perceiving it as a potentially hostile bloc near its borders. The General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) is a central focus of Ishiba's visit, aiming to facilitate the exchange of classified military information and defense technologies between the two countries, both allies of the United States. Such an agreement could allow the three nations to more effectively monitor China's activities in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly accused Ronen Bar, the head of Israel's domestic security agency, Shin Bet, of lying to the Supreme Court. This accusation is the latest development in a legal dispute over Netanyahu's attempt to dismiss Bar, citing a lack of trust. Bar has alleged that the decision to remove him was motivated by expectations of personal loyalty rather than professional considerations. The case was brought by Israeli watchdog organizations and opposition parties challenging Netanyahu's decision to oust Bar.</p>

          <p>Despite his low approval among Ukrainians, Donald Trump's recent statement questioning Russia's continued aggression has offered a glimmer of hope to Ukraine. Trump questioned why Putin would continue to attack Ukraine while the US is trying to broker peace talks, suggesting that Putin may not want to stop the war. This comes at a critical time when the United States has been pushing Ukraine to accept a peace plan that would require them to abandon NATO aspirations and recognize Crimea as Russian, a deal which Ukraine has rejected. Ukrainians are hopeful that Trump will not force them into an unfavorable peace agreement.</p>

          <p>U.S. airstrikes targeting Yemen's capital have reportedly killed at least eight people, according to Houthi rebels, amidst a month-long American military campaign. The U.S. military's Central Command stated that Operation Roughrider has killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and leaders associated with missile and drone programs. The U.S. insists the strikes, initiated under President Trump, aim to deter Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and on Israel, and to pressure Iran. The Houthis have aired footage of the strikes, while the U.S. military has limited the release of specific information about the attacks to preserve operational security.</p>

          <p>Despite challenges including halted permits and political backlash, the onshore wind energy industry is experiencing a 'repowering' phase, replacing aging turbines with newer, more efficient models. This trend benefits companies like GE Vernova, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa, leading to revenue increases and stock improvements. As wind power generating capacity grows, operators face decisions to upgrade or replace turbines, offering economic benefits like avoiding property acquisition and increasing electricity output. While public opposition and permitting processes remain hurdles, repowering offers a pathway for delivering more electrons to the grid.</p>

          <p>The BBC has identified members of Kenya's security forces who fatally shot anti-tax protesters outside parliament in June 2024. Their analysis indicates that the victims were unarmed and posed no threat. Despite a parliamentary committee's order for an investigation, no report has been issued and no one has been held accountable. The BBC's analysis of videos and photos traced the fatal shots back to a police officer and a soldier. The article details the events leading up to the shootings, including the protesters' demands and the government's response.</p>
