          <p>Following the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, members of Congress from both parties are postponing or moving outdoor public events indoors due to heightened security fears. Lawmakers like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ruben Gallego have delayed rallies, while others have expressed deep concern over the rise in political violence. The rooftop nature of the attack has drawn parallels to the 2024 attempt on President Trump, prompting a broad rethinking of security protocols for public figures.</p>

          <p>In response to the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, President Donald Trump stated he is concerned for the country and urged his supporters to respond with nonviolence. Trump announced he will posthumously award Kirk, a close ally, with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. The president also confirmed he has spoken with Kirk's "absolutely devastated" wife, Erika. Kirk's body was transported to his family in Arizona aboard Air Force Two, accompanied by Vice President JD Vance.</p>

          <p>A new immigration holding facility in El Paso, Texas, designed to be the largest in U.S. history, is being described as a "giant tent city" by Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar. The facility, operated by a contractor with no prior public record of running detention centers, has a capacity for 5,000 people. Escobar raised concerns about conditions inside, including poor food quality and a lack of information provided to detainees, who she says are kept in a "black box" regarding their future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On his eighth album, "Play," Ed Sheeran attempts to rebound from the commercial misfires of his last two introspective records by incorporating Asian and Middle Eastern musical influences. While the album features instruments like the sitar and collaborations with Indian artists, critics note that these elements are often assimilated into his familiar brand of mainstream pop rather than being fully explored. The record is seen as an enjoyable, if safe, effort that plays to his strengths but misses an opportunity to be more adventurous.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A program called Reflection Point is helping businesses build empathy and improve teamwork by having colleagues discuss short stories, similar to a book club. The initiative, used by nearly 150 companies, aims to give employees a chance to share life experiences and practice communication skills in a low-stakes environment. Research suggests a direct link between empathy and commercial success, and leaders who have implemented the program report seeing a "dramatic change" in their teams' ability to connect and work together effectively.</p>

          <p>The assassination of 31-year-old conservative activist Charlie Kirk has ignited a debate over his polarizing political legacy among young Americans. Supporters remember him as a charismatic figure who championed conservative Christian values and gave them a voice, while critics point to his provocative and often divisive rhetoric on issues like gun rights and abortion. Despite their differing views on his politics, both allies and opponents have widely condemned the use of violence, expressing shock and concern that political discourse has descended into a fatal attack.</p>

          <p>Denmark has significantly improved its cancer survival rates over the past 25 years, transforming from one of Europe's poorer performers into a leader that the UK's NHS is now studying.

The model also emphasizes patient experience, with improved hospital environments and options for at-home chemotherapy, offering potential lessons for other state-funded healthcare systems.</p>

          <p>Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate President Trump at a Florida golf course in 2024, forfeited his right to continue his opening statement after the judge repeatedly warned him for going off-topic. Routh, who is representing himself, gave a rambling speech that mentioned Adolf Hitler and global conflicts instead of addressing the case. Prosecutors allege Routh meticulously plotted the attack and was spotted by a Secret Service agent aiming a rifle before he could fire, leading to his arrest after a brief chase.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike that killed five Hamas members and a Qatari security officer in Doha has severely strained relations between the U.S. and its Persian Gulf allies. Gulf nations, which host major U.S. military bases like Al Udeid in Qatar, have long relied on a U.S. security umbrella for protection, but this attack by a key U.S. ally has undermined that trust. The strike was particularly galling for Qatar, as it had hosted the Hamas political office at Washington's request, leading to widespread condemnation from across the Gulf region.</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk at an open-air event at Utah Valley University has raised significant questions about the security protocols in place. The suspect reportedly fired from a rooftop overlooking the venue, a vulnerability for outdoor gatherings that are difficult to fully secure compared to indoor events. While local police and Kirk's private security were present, experts suggest that threat assessments may not have fully accounted for a sniper-style attack. The incident highlights the growing challenges and costs of protecting public figures in an era of heightened political tensions.</p>

Despite souring his legacy at Brentford by forcing a move, his former coaches and teammates describe him as someone with an unbreakable will to succeed, a quality Newcastle hopes will help fill the void left by the departure of their previous star forward.</p>

His comments came in response to an employee question about a perceived lack of empathy following recent layoffs and a new mandate requiring workers near its headquarters to return to the office three days a week. While the company is performing well financially, Nadella acknowledged the social contract can be broken when new or junior employees lack mentorship in a remote-first environment.</p>
