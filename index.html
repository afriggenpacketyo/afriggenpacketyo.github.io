          <p>The second round of direct talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul yielded an agreement to exchange more prisoners of war, but produced minimal progress toward ending the ongoing conflict.

          <p>The Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to Maryland's assault weapons ban, with a majority of justices not providing a reason.
