          <p>A shooting in a Midtown Manhattan office building resulted in the deaths of four individuals, including an off-duty NYPD officer. The suspect, who was reportedly wearing body armor and carrying a high-powered rifle, later died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound after barricading himself inside the building. The incident, which occurred at 345 Park Avenue, prompted a large-scale police response and warnings for the public to avoid the area. The motive for the attack is currently under investigation by authorities, with the FBI providing support at the scene.</p>

          <p>Intense rainstorms in northern China have led to severe flooding, resulting in at least 30 fatalities in the outskirts of Beijing. The heavy rainfall has prompted the evacuation of over 80,000 people from the Chinese capital, according to state media reports. The deaths were concentrated in the hilly districts of Miyun and Yanqing, which are located far from the city's downtown area. Authorities are continuing to manage the crisis as the situation develops, with rescue and relief efforts underway in the affected regions.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Issues Guidance on Religious Expression for Federal Employees</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has issued new guidance affirming the rights of federal employees to express their religious beliefs in the workplace. According to a memo from the Office of Personnel Management, this includes discussing religion and attempting to persuade colleagues, provided they stop if requested and the conversation does not constitute harassment. The policy allows for displaying religious items and inviting coworkers to religious events, building on similar guidance from the Clinton administration. The move has drawn criticism from groups like the Freedom From Religion Foundation, which argue it unconstitutionally encourages proselytizing in a government setting.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to hold an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss a European-led peace plan and humanitarian aid efforts for Gaza. The plan was presented to U.S. President Donald Trump during a recent meeting and follows discussions with French and German leaders. The move comes amid increasing international and domestic pressure for the UK to formally recognize Palestinian statehood, a step supported by a significant number of MPs. The government has described Palestinian statehood as a matter of "when, not if," aiming to create a pathway toward a sustainable two-state solution.</p>

          <p>School districts across the U.S. are facing potential cuts to mental health resources following the Trump administration's discontinuation of millions in federal grant funding. The Department of Education cited concerns that the grants were used for "race-based actions," a claim disputed by service providers who now face letting go of counselors and social workers. This comes amid a nationwide shortage of child mental health professionals, particularly in rural areas, with 47 states failing to meet recommended counselor-to-student ratios. The department states it will review applications for new awards, but districts worry about the immediate impact on student safety and well-being.</p>

          <p>Recent cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are threatening to increase food insecurity and place greater strain on food banks, particularly in impoverished rural areas like Hancock County, Georgia. The county already has the highest rate of child food insecurity in the nation, and many residents rely on local pantries to supplement meager benefits. A CBS News analysis projects billions will be cut from SNAP over the next decade, while other federal programs supporting food banks have also been reduced.

According to Capital Economics, this could reduce the EU's annual GDP by 0.2%, while the Trump administration claims it will boost U.S. manufacturing and exports. Despite the higher tariffs, the deal provides some economic certainty by avoiding a threatened 30% rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A court in Bogota has convicted former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe of witness tampering, a landmark case marking the first time an ex-president in the country has been found guilty in a criminal court. Uribe was found to have bribed witnesses to provide false testimony in a separate investigation into his alleged ties to right-wing paramilitary groups. The highly politicized case, which dates back to 2012, could result in a prison sentence of up to 12 years for the former leader. Uribe has maintained his innocence, claiming the proceedings are politically motivated.</p>

          <p>A garment factory in Lesotho, which previously produced Trump-branded golf shirts, is at risk of closure due to high import tariffs imposed by the U.S. government. The southern African nation was hit with a 50% tariff rate, threatening its vital textile industry, which is the country's largest private-sector employer. Workers at Precious Garments report that their hours and pay have been cut in half, and they have been warned of a potential shutdown. The situation highlights the severe real-world consequences of U.S. trade policy on smaller, developing economies that had previously benefited from duty-free access.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Policy Views Are Heavily Shaped by Television News</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic suggests that President Trump's worldview and policy responses are significantly influenced by what he sees on television. Using his recent comments on starvation in Gaza as an example, the article notes Trump cited TV images as his basis for disagreeing with the Israeli prime minister's assessment, stating "you can't fake that." This reliance on media, particularly cable news, over intelligence briefings or expert advice, makes him susceptible to manipulation and narrows his understanding of complex issues. The author argues this approach is especially dangerous in an age of misinformation and deepfakes.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Guardians closer Emmanuel Clase is under investigation by Major League Baseball for sports betting, potentially jeopardizing investments made by fans through the company Finlete. The platform allows fans to invest in an athlete's career in exchange for a share of future earnings, and hundreds of investors have reportedly put over $315,000 into Clase. If found to have bet on baseball, Clase could face a suspension or a lifetime ban, which would void his contract and nullify any future earnings.

          <p>Amid a July slump, the Los Angeles Dodgers are reportedly looking to acquire another position player before the trade deadline, with a focus on upgrading their outfield defense. While the team's superstar hitters have struggled, a key priority is to add a premium defender to prevent runs, which could be crucial for a potential playoff run keyed by strong starting pitching. One name gaining traction is Minnesota Twins outfielder Harrison Bader, a strong defender who is also having a solid offensive season. Such a move could bolster the team's defense and shift other players to more natural positions.</p>

Hogan's successful lawsuit, which followed Gawker's publication of a surreptitiously filmed sex tape, resulted in a $140 million verdict that bankrupted the media company. Legal experts note that while the case didn't set new legal precedent, it served as a cultural turning point. It established clearer boundaries on publishing graphic content and affirmed privacy rights for both celebrities and ordinary citizens in an era of internet oversharing.</p>
