            <p>Democratic lawmakers have voiced concerns that President Trump's tariff policies could lead to corruption and self-dealing within the administration. In a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, 47 House and Senate members requested details on plans to prevent the misuse of tariffs for personal enrichment. Led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Reps. Judy Chu and Linda Sánchez, the Democrats highlighted opportunities for undue influence due to the administration's tumultuous tariff rollout. As the minority party, their ability to compel a response is limited, but the letter signals a focus on Trump's economic handling.</p>

            <p>A federal court dismissed the Trump administration's appeal regarding the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador. The court mandated that government officials be deposed about the accidental deportation. Abrego Garcia is being held in a Salvadoran mega-prison due to an administrative error, prompting his lawyers to sue for his return to the United States. The court criticized the government's unwillingness to bring Abrego Garcia back, emphasizing the importance of due process. The Justice Department argued that the court was interfering with foreign policy, but the appellate court rejected this notion.</p>

Drake's team stated that the Super Bowl performance further solidified the public’s belief in the truth of the allegations against Drake.

Moore said he spoke with two deportees from the U.S., both of whom were originally from El Salvador and had been deported from Virginia and California. He said one had been in the U.S. for 20 years and was a high-ranking member of the brutal gang MS-13. According to Moore, both deportees "were not afraid to admit" that they had killed people.</p>

Serving in the Revolutionary War from 1781 to 1783, she bravely fought for her new nation, even taking a musket ball to the thigh and performing self-surgery to avoid detection. Her secret was eventually discovered after she fell ill, leading to an honorable discharge and later, a military pension with the help of Paul Revere. Sampson's story continues to inspire, with Congress passing the Deborah Sampson Act in 2021 to provide better healthcare and resources for women veterans.</p>
