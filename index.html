            <p>Concerns are rising about the potential impact of China selling its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in response to President Trump's trade policies. If China and other nations were to accelerate these sales, mortgage rates would rise further, potentially destabilizing the already struggling spring housing market. The Federal Reserve's current policy of letting MBS roll off its portfolio adds to the potential pressure. The concern is that mortgage spreads would widen in response to either China, Japan or Canada coming in with a retaliatory objective. (not investment advice)</p>
