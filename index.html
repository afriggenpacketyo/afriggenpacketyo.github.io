          <p>President Trump has confirmed a third lethal military strike on a boat in the Caribbean, resulting in three fatalities. The administration justifies these actions by classifying drug cartels as terrorist organizations, allowing for the use of deadly force typically reserved for imminent threats. This policy shift, which bypasses traditional law enforcement interdictions by the Coast Guard, has drawn criticism regarding its legality and potential classification as a war crime. The Pentagon released a video of the strike, which targeted a vessel allegedly trafficking narcotics toward the United States.</p>

The woman was hospitalized with serious injuries, including multiple broken bones, and told police she feared for her life.

          <p>The man who pleaded guilty to the 2022 attempted assassination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh is now using the name Sophie Roske and female pronouns, according to a recent court filing. The document, a routine pre-sentencing request, refers to the defendant as "Ms. Roske," although Nicholas remains the legal first name. Roske was arrested near Kavanaugh's home with weapons and tactical gear just before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Prosecutors are seeking a 30-year sentence, citing the defendant's intent to alter the court's composition for ideological reasons despite acknowledged mental health issues.</p>

          <p>A U.S. court has sentenced Qingzhou Wang, an executive of the Wuhan-based company Amarvel Biotech, to 25 years in prison for trafficking fentanyl precursor chemicals and money laundering. Wang and a colleague were convicted for their roles in shipping hundreds of kilograms of these chemicals to the United States, often disguised as common goods and using cryptocurrency for payments. This case marks a significant moment in U.S. law enforcement, as it is the first time Chinese companies have been prosecuted for trafficking these chemicals directly into the U.S. rather than through Mexico.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation has uncovered significant issues with counterfeit products and fraudulent sellers on Walmart.com, as the retailer rapidly expanded its third-party marketplace to compete with Amazon. The report found that lax vetting processes allowed sellers to use stolen identities of legitimate businesses, such as a pizza parlor, to sell fake goods, including potentially dangerous health supplements and beauty products. Former employees stated they were pressured to approve seller applications quickly to fuel growth, leading to what one expert called a "Wild West" environment.

          <p>The U.S. National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) has issued a memo to law enforcement warning that al Qaeda and its affiliates continue to pose a significant threat to the United States. The memo states that the group is leveraging global conflicts and U.S. military involvement to inspire potential attackers, specifically through media publications. The NCTC advises government officials to enhance personal security by avoiding public disclosure of travel plans and warns of potential attacks on large public gatherings like sports and music events. This warning reaffirms the persistent danger from the organization responsible for the September 11th attacks.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping have approved a deal concerning the future of TikTok's U.S. operations, though Beijing's confirmation was more reserved. The proposed agreement would reportedly involve a consortium of U.S. investors, including Oracle, acquiring TikTok's American business, allowing it to continue operating under U.S. control. A key point of contention remains the ownership of the app's powerful algorithm, which pushes content to its 170 million American users. While Trump expressed optimism about closing the deal, some U.S. lawmakers remain concerned about potential continued influence from the Chinese Communist Party.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, British supermodel David Gandy expressed serious concerns about the rise of artificial intelligence in the fashion industry, calling for greater regulation to protect human creativity. He pointed to campaigns that now use entirely AI-generated models, which he fears could make real models, photographers, makeup artists, and other professionals redundant. Gandy, who is one of over 2,000 models advocating for government action, also voiced worries about the mental health impact of young people viewing AI-generated images of non-existent people. He emphasized that while the industry must adapt, it needs rules to preserve its artistic integrity.</p>

          <p>Evans Kibet, a 36-year-old Kenyan long-distance runner, has appeared in a video released by the Ukrainian army, claiming he was tricked into fighting for Russia. Now a prisoner of war, Kibet tearfully explains that he traveled to Russia for what he believed was a job opportunity, only to be forced to sign military papers and sent to a training camp with the ultimatum to "fight or be killed." He says he escaped during his first mission and surrendered to Ukrainian soldiers. His family in Kenya is in shock but relieved he is alive, and they are appealing to their government to help bring him home.</p>

          <p>Russia is launching Intervision 2025, a revival of a Soviet-era song contest, positioned as an alternative to Eurovision, from which it was banned following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The event, initiated by a decree from Vladimir Putin, features 23 participating countries, primarily Russian allies from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as well as the United States. The Kremlin-backed contest aims to showcase cultural traditions and project an image of international cooperation, though critics in Ukraine view it as a propaganda tool to whitewash Russia's aggression. The contest emphasizes traditional values and features jury voting rather than a public televote.</p>

          <p>A recent wave of multi-billion-pound investments from U.S. tech giants like Nvidia and Microsoft is fueling optimism about the United Kingdom's future as an AI superpower. During President Trump's state visit, executives praised the UK's rich history of scientific research and innovation, suggesting the country is too humble about its capabilities. While some critics, like former Deputy PM Nick Clegg, argue the UK is just taking "crumbs from the Silicon Valley table," the influx of capital is seen as a major boost for the economy. This growing tech "bromance" may also signal a pro-growth shift in UK regulatory policy to attract further investment.</p>

          <p>Oscar-winning actor Cillian Murphy has confirmed a "Peaky Blinders" film is forthcoming from Netflix, though he remains tight-lipped about the plot to keep it a surprise for fans. Reflecting on his iconic role as the violent gangster Tommy Shelby, Murphy stated that playing the character for a quarter of his life has been a defining privilege, but emphasized he is nothing like the "psychopathic" patriarch in real life. The actor, who is currently promoting his new film "Steve," noted that the joy of long-form television was growing older with a character, an experience he never anticipated when the show began in 2013.</p>

          <p>Clashes erupted outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Chicago when federal agents used tear gas and pepper balls to disperse around 100 protesters. The demonstrators, including two Democratic congressional candidates, were attempting to block vehicles during "Operation Midway Blitz," a local immigration crackdown. At least three arrests were made as masked agents in riot gear confronted the crowd, an action one candidate described as a "violent abuse of power." The protest was partly in response to the recent fatal shooting of a local father by an immigration officer during a traffic stop.</p>

          <p>UCLA has implemented new, formalized rules for campus protests that both align with and diverge from recent demands made by the Trump administration. The guidelines, which were developed after a year of campus feedback, ban unauthorized encampments in key areas like Royce Quad and prohibit disruptions to campus operations, in line with federal pressures. However, the rules also expand free speech zones and allow for pre-approved overnight events, contrary to the administration's call for a total ban. University officials state the policies aim to balance free speech with safety and are not a direct reaction to political pressure.</p>

The show has grown from a monthly event to a sold-out weekly staple, helping to launch the careers of upcoming comics by fostering a sense of community. It stands out as one of the few consistent shows catering specifically to the Latinx community in a majority-Latin city.</p>

          <p>Estonia has invoked Article 4 of the NATO treaty, requesting urgent consultations with allies after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace for 12 minutes. The Estonian foreign ministry condemned the "brazen" incursion over the Gulf of Finland, and NATO confirmed its jets immediately intercepted the Russian aircraft. This marks the second time in a week a NATO member has triggered Article 4 due to Russian military activity, following a similar request from Poland. The incident has heightened regional tensions, with EU officials calling it a dangerous provocation and a test of the West's resolve.</p>
