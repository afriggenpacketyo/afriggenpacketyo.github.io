          <p>Australia's economy experienced stagnant growth in the first quarter of the year, with a 1.3% year-on-year increase, failing to meet economists' expectations of 1.5%. This figure mirrors the previous quarter's growth rate and comes as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has been easing monetary policy. The RBA anticipates a gradual pickup in domestic GDP growth throughout 2025, driven by a recovery in consumption and strong public demand. However, the central bank acknowledges that weaker global demand and uncertainty could dampen this recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Duke Tanner, a former professional boxer who received clemency from President Trump in 2020 and a pardon in May 2025, shared his experiences and views on criminal justice reform. Tanner, who served 16 years in prison on drug trafficking charges, emphasized the importance of rehabilitation and faith during incarceration. He also commented on the possibility of Trump pardoning Sean "Diddy" Combs, stating that if Trump makes that decision, there's likely a valid reason behind it, suggesting potential mishandling of the law. Tanner advocates for clemency for others he believes deserve it, contrasting his case with Hunter Biden's pardon.</p>

The 2022 guidance was issued after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," passed by the House and now in the Senate, faces criticism for potentially causing millions to lose Medicaid coverage and health insurance. Critics describe it as an attempt to roll back the Affordable Care Act (ACA) without explicitly labeling it as such, focusing instead on reducing "waste, fraud, and abuse" in government health programs. The bill includes changes to ACA enrollment and eligibility, leading to projected coverage losses and increased costs for enrollees. Democrats have framed the bill as an assault on healthcare, while Republicans argue it targets fraudulent enrollment and preserves resources for vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>A controversy has emerged regarding the use of xenon gas by British climbers to expedite acclimatization on Mount Everest, alongside a Nike-sponsored attempt for Faith Kipyegon to break the four-minute mile with strategic pacing. These initiatives have sparked debate about the ethics of using technology and tactics to push human limits in sports. Critics argue that such interventions diminish the spirit of the challenge, while proponents highlight the ingenuity and endurance involved. The article explores the historical context of similar controversies, such as the use of oxygen in early Everest expeditions and pacing in Bannister's four-minute mile.</p>

          <p>Bhim Kohli, an elderly man who was racially abused before being fatally attacked, had reported to police that he witnessed an assault on another Asian man near his home two weeks prior. Kohli himself had been walking his dog when he was attacked, and it was later revealed that he had been targeted with racial abuse by children in July. Despite these reports, a local resident believes police did not take the incidents seriously enough, which could have prevented the fatal attack. Leicestershire Police stated that an internal review did not identify any missed opportunities that could have prevented Kohli's death, but identified areas for improvement in logging anti-social behavior.</p>

          <p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett has faced increasing criticism from right-wing figures, despite President Trump's public support. Criticism stems from Barrett's votes on cases involving foreign aid, Trump's sentencing, and Venezuelan detainees.

Despite these rumblings, she has delivered votes overturning Roe v Wade, expanding gun rights, and rolling back the power of federal agencies.</p>
