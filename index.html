        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced a significant surge in April, primarily fueled by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which effectively counteracted a sharp decline in exports to the United States due to escalating tariffs. The overall exports rose by 8.1%, surpassing expectations, while imports saw only a slight decrease of 0.2%. Despite a 21% drop in exports to the U.S., exports to ASEAN countries soared by 20.8%, with notable growth in shipments to Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. This shift indicates China's adaptability in navigating trade challenges and diversifying its export markets amidst ongoing trade disputes.</p>

          <p>Shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China's leading contract chip maker, experienced a nearly 7% decline following the release of its first-quarter earnings, which failed to meet anticipated estimates. While revenue increased by approximately 28% year-over-year to $2.24 billion and profit attributable to shareholders surged by 162% to $188 million, these figures fell short of LSEG's mean estimates. SMIC attributed the earnings miss to production fluctuations affecting blended average selling prices, with expectations for this impact to extend into the second quarter. Despite the earnings shortfall, SMIC's wafer shipments increased by 15% from the previous quarter, driven by geopolitical shifts and government policies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has hinted at the possibility of reducing tariffs on goods imported from China as high-level trade talks are scheduled to commence. Trump acknowledged that tariffs, currently at 145%, cannot increase further, suggesting a potential decrease. These comments were made during the unveiling of a tariff agreement with the UK, the first since Trump imposed steep levies in April. The upcoming meeting in Switzerland signals a potential de-escalation in the trade war between the two economic superpowers, although analysts caution that the negotiations are likely to be lengthy and complex.</p>

          <p>New soil testing conducted by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has revealed elevated levels of lead and other toxic metals in soil at homesites previously cleared by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers after recent wildfires. In the Eaton burn scar, approximately 27% of soil samples from scraped areas and 44% from unscraped areas exceeded California's state standards for residential properties. Public health officials are recommending that property owners consider potential soil contamination ahead of rebuilding efforts, as some developers have already begun construction without soil testing requirements. The county results underscore concerns about the effectiveness of federal cleanup efforts in removing hazardous contaminants from residential properties affected by wildfires.</p>

          <p>China's exports grew by 8.1% in April, defying expectations despite increased tariffs imposed by the United States. The growth is attributed to transshipment through other countries and trade contracts signed before the tariffs were announced. Experts anticipate a gradual weakening of trade data in the coming months and hope for a swift resolution to trade negotiations between China and the US. Trump has imposed tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports, leading to retaliatory duties by China on American goods.</p>
