          <p>China's Ping An Bank is leveraging the popularity of Pop Mart's Labubu dolls to attract young customers amid intense competition in the retail banking sector. New clients who open a savings account and deposit over 50,000 yuan for at least three months may receive a Labubu blind box. The campaign has gone viral on social media, with users expressing excitement over the free collectible. This strategy reflects the struggle of Chinese retail banks to attract and retain young customers amid low interest rates and a declining retail banking customer base, as the country's population ages and income levels decrease. </p>

          <p>UK companies are reducing hiring and not replacing departing workers, leading to a decrease in job vacancies, according to official figures. The number of available jobs fell by 63,000 between March and May, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, the highest in almost four years. The rise in National Insurance contributions paid by employers and the increase in the minimum wage are factors contributing to this trend. Economists predict the unemployment rate will continue to rise as businesses offset increased employment costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Disorder broke out in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, following a protest over an alleged sexual assault, with masked individuals throwing masonry at police and setting houses on fire.

          <p>Restrictions on international students in the U.S. could lead to a brain drain, compromising the country's human capital, according to experts. The Trump administration's efforts to limit international student enrollment, particularly at institutions like Harvard University, are undermining the U.S.'s role as a magnet for global talent. With about half of U.S. STEM PhDs conferred on international students and increasing numbers of American students exploring academic options abroad, these restrictions could hinder the talent pool for U.S. graduate schools. These policies may inadvertently accelerate technological advancements in countries like China, where students can now obtain world-class education domestically.</p>

          <p>Japan plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from government stockpiles to curb elevated prices of the staple food, according to farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi. The rice, consisting of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, will be sold through direct contracts with retailers. The move will leave the country with a rice reserve of around 100,000 tons, down from about 910,000 tons before the government began releasing stocks. The government hopes that the cheaper rice will bring down overall prices and address public frustration over rising costs.</p>

Consumer spending on Temu and Shein has decreased in the U.S., while it has grown in the EU and the UK. However, the companies are encountering regulatory scrutiny in Europe, including a proposed €2 customs fee and investigations into deceptive business tactics. These challenges could reshape how platforms like Shein and Temu operate in Europe over the next few years. (not investment advice)</p>

Niger ordered China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) to terminate the contracts of expatriate employees with more than four years' service. The dispute underscores the limits of Beijing's non-interference policy, which has meant China remained essentially regime-agnostic. Observers said the situation highlights the economic costs for Beijing as some nations experience a rise in nationalism.</p>

The report acknowledges that Japan's efforts remain insufficient, as the country ranked 118th out of 146 economies in the 2024 Global Gender Gap Index. The government aims to step up efforts to advance gender equality by ensuring women have more opportunities to participate in decision-making across a range of fields. The government also adopted its latest basic policy on gender equality and women's empowerment, with a focus on local economies and small businesses.</p>
