          <p>Japan's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that Japan will not agree to a trade deal with the U.S. unless all new tariffs are reviewed, particularly those on automobiles and auto parts. Akazawa emphasized the need for the U.S. to reconsider the tariffs, which include a 25% duty on automobiles, a major concern for Japan as a car exporter. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba echoed this stance, highlighting that Japan is negotiating with the U.S. on all tariffs, including those on steel and aluminum. Trump's administration has imposed these tariffs following his return to the White House in January, creating tension in trade relations.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry conveyed his desire for reconciliation with the Royal Family, expressing frustration over security arrangements preventing his family's UK visits. In a BBC interview, he mentioned his father's reluctance to speak with him due to security issues and acknowledged King Charles's limited time, emphasizing the preciousness of life and need to end the family dispute. The prince highlighted security as the primary obstacle to reconciliation, urging intervention from the King, Prime Minister, and Home Secretary. However, the courts have consistently rejected his claims of unfair treatment regarding security downgrades, citing his non-working royal status and overseas residence.</p>

          <p>A man in his 20s was taken in for questioning by police after the skeletal remains of his former girlfriend were found in his home near Tokyo. The man, who had been warned for stalking 20-year-old Asahi Okazaki before she went missing in December, returned to Japan from overseas Saturday afternoon. During a search of the man's house in Kawasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture, on Wednesday, the police discovered a bag containing human remains under the floorboards. The police said Saturday that the body had been confirmed as that of Okazaki's. Autopsy findings showed signs of burning and that more than a month had passed since her death.</p>

          <p>Early vote counting in Australia's general election indicated a likely second term for the ruling center-left Labor Party. Projections gave Labor 70 seats and the opposition coalition 24 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives. Energy policy and inflation were major campaign issues, with both sides acknowledging a cost of living crisis. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese noted improved relations with China, leading to the removal of trade barriers that had cost Australian exporters billions. The election also highlighted changing demographics, with younger voters outnumbering Baby Boomers for the first time.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following recent local election successes, Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, now controls 10 local councils and seeks to implement significant spending cuts. Farage envisions a "Doge in every county," mirroring Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, to reduce council expenditures. The party intends to target climate change initiatives and diversity programs, prioritizing essential services like social care and infrastructure. Reform UK also plans to resist central government's placement of asylum seekers in their controlled areas, despite lacking direct control over immigration policy.</p>

Nigel Farage hailed the results as signaling "the end of two-party politics" and the decline of the Conservative party. While Labour's Keir Starmer acknowledged that people are not yet experiencing the benefits of a Labour government, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch pledged to restore her party as a "credible" alternative. The Conservative party suffered substantial losses, losing 676 seats and control of all 16 authorities it was defending.</p>

          <p>Luke Charters, MP for York Outer, is advocating for a reevaluation of the ban on alcohol consumption in football stands, suggesting a more modern approach. Legislation from 1985 prohibits fans from drinking alcohol within sight of the pitch in the top five tiers of English men's football. Charters argues that this creates an inconsistency, as other sports allow alcohol consumption during games. He proposes conducting trials to assess the potential impact of lifting the restrictions, with support from the Football Supporters Association. A similar trial is underway in the women's game, which is not subject to the 1985 ban.</p>

This is significant as captive animals often lose essential survival behaviors. The success in both environments suggests potential for scaling back habitat degradation effects. Axolotls, culturally important to Mexicans and known for their regenerative abilities, face threats from human interference and pollution, making these findings crucial for their conservation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Times reports that President Trump's tariffs are causing anxiety among truck drivers and port workers in Los Angeles. With tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, the flow of goods into the U.S. is expected to slow, leading to less work for those who move cargo through the ports. Truckers express concern about potential job losses and financial hardship. Senator Alex Padilla decries the tariffs, predicting lost jobs, higher prices, and empty shelves. A report estimates that a 1% decline in cargo to the ports could wipe away thousands of jobs.</p>
