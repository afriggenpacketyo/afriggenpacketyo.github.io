          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a significant 36% drop in the first quarter of 2025, its worst performance since late 2022.  This decline is attributed to several factors, including CEO Elon Musk's controversial role in the Trump administration's cost-cutting initiatives, which has led to protests and boycotts, as well as decreased sales and increased competition in the EV market.  The situation underscores the impact of political and market forces on Tesla's performance.</p>
