          <p>Singapore Airlines' shares plummeted over 8% following a reported 59% plunge in its first-quarter net profit, reaching S$186 million ($144 million). This significant decline, the largest intra-day drop since August 2024, was attributed to reduced interest income and losses from associated companies, including Air India post-Vistara merger. Despite the airline noting healthy demand for air travel and cargo, Maybank downgraded SIA stock to "SELL." The investment bank cited weaker cargo demand and higher operating costs as reasons for reducing profit estimates by 25-29% over the next three years, concluding the stock is overvalued relative to its performance.

          <p>A tragic shooting incident in Midtown Manhattan resulted in the deaths of a New York City police officer and three other individuals, with the suspect, Shane D. Tamura, dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Officer Didarul Islam, a 36-year-old four-year veteran, was hailed as a hero by Mayor Eric Adams, who noted Islam's dedication to protecting New Yorkers and his family, including a pregnant wife and two young sons. Surveillance video captured the gunman entering a Park Avenue building with an M4 rifle, immediately opening fire, and continuing his rampage through the lobby and up to the 33rd floor. The mayor described the event as a "violent, despicable attack," with another person critically injured.</p>

          <h2>Lawsuit Challenges Trump Administration's No-Bail Policy for Undocumented Immigrants</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A class-action lawsuit challenges the Trump administration's new policy requiring undocumented immigrants arrested by ICE to remain in detention without bail, a reversal of previous practice. This abrupt change impacts individuals with long-standing U.S. ties, potentially leading to months or years of detention before their cases are resolved. Advocates and immigration lawyers argue the policy is an "arbitrary and capricious" misinterpretation of the law, violating due process rights and causing "catastrophic" harm to families. While DHS asserts the policy closes "loopholes" for safety, federal courts are now weighing its legality, with one preliminary injunction already issued in a similar case.</p>

          <p>A devastating incident off Miami Beach led to the deaths of two children, aged 7 and 13, and left two others in critical condition after a sailboat carrying summer campers collided with a barge. Six individuals, including five children and one adult camp counselor from the Miami Youth Sailing Foundation, were aboard the vessel when it was struck and submerged. Emergency response teams rushed to the scene, transporting three children to Ryder Trauma Center in critical condition. Witnesses described seeing the children "flying off" the boat upon impact, with one hearing a girl's shouts for help from beneath the barge. The U.S. Coast Guard has initiated an investigation into the tragic accident.</p>

While Israel announced a "tactical pause" for aid, international bodies like UNRWA warn of severe malnutrition and child deaths, stressing that current aid levels are a fraction of what's needed.

The article highlights the dire humanitarian situation, with UNRWA reporting that one in five children in Gaza City is malnourished and over 100 children have died of hunger. Desperation has led to "self-distribution" of aid from convoys.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump's "private" visit to Scotland provided UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer with invaluable diplomatic access, including shared travel on Air Force One and extensive, informal press interactions. Downing Street considers this direct engagement crucial for strengthening the relationship, despite the often unpredictable nature of Trump's public remarks. The article notes Starmer's careful navigation of topics like immigration and Gaza during joint appearances, and No 10's positive reception of Trump's seemingly tougher stance on Gaza, anticipating potential alignment with UK-France-Germany peace efforts. This visit exemplifies the unique and highly public style of Trump's international diplomacy.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer posits that President Trump's recent trade agreements, including the deal with the European Union, failed to ignite a market rally because investors are currently focused on other significant economic events. Cramer attributes this market indifference to "tariff ennui," a perceived predictability in Trump's trade negotiations where high tariffs are threatened but then softened with concessions. He highlights that Wall Street's primary attention is currently on upcoming Big Tech earnings, the Federal Reserve's meeting, and the release of employment data. Cramer also anticipates heightened presidential pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell for interest rate cuts, regardless of the forthcoming labor report. (not investment advice)</p>
