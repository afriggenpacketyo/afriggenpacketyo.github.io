The author points out that concerns about Biden's age have been prevalent for years and that the recent release of a book detailing his decline is simply the latest chapter in this saga. While acknowledging that politicians often conceal information and that Biden's age is a valid concern, the author suggests that the "cover-up" of his condition is less significant than the observable facts.
