        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has lowered its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, marking the first rate reduction of President Trump's second term. The move, intended to support a slowing labor market, brings the federal funds rate to a range between 4% and 4.25%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the challenge of balancing a hiring slowdown with rising inflation, stating the central bank's focus has shifted toward addressing downside risks to employment. The decision follows a period of sustained public pressure from the White House for more aggressive rate reductions. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's latest decision to cut interest rates by a quarter-point was accompanied by projections indicating two more similar cuts may occur before the end of the year. The central bank's "dot plot" revealed a wide disparity among officials' expectations, with one member, likely new governor Stephen Miran, advocating for much more aggressive reductions. Fed Chair Jerome Powell characterized the cut as a risk management measure aimed at a weakening labor market, while noting there was not widespread support for a larger half-point reduction. This internal division highlights the complex economic conditions facing policymakers. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. labor market is showing significant signs of cooling, with job growth nearly halting and prompting the Federal Reserve to implement an interest rate cut. Experts note that businesses are becoming more cautious with hiring due to economic uncertainty and the rise of artificial intelligence, which is impacting entry-level roles. The rate reduction is intended to stimulate business activity and hiring, though economists caution that the Fed's influence is limited in an economy driven by supply-side shocks. The slowdown is particularly affecting younger workers trying to enter fields like software development and marketing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, Arizona Senate President Warren Petersen is proposing legislation to rename a state highway in his honor. The proposal seeks to designate State Route 202 as the "Charlie Kirk Memorial Loop 202" to ensure his legacy endures. This legislative effort comes as tens of thousands are expected to attend a public memorial service for Kirk, which will feature prominent speakers including President Donald Trump.

          <p>A 29-year-old solo hiker sustained serious but non-life-threatening injuries after being attacked by a bear on the Turbid Lake Trail in Yellowstone National Park. The hiker managed to deploy bear spray during the attack and was later evacuated by park medics to a hospital. Officials stated the bear, believed to be a grizzly, will not be captured or euthanized as the incident was a "surprise encounter" and the animal did not display unnatural behavior. This marks the first bear attack in the park since 2021, prompting the temporary closure of the trail.</p>

          <p>San Francisco Supervisor Joel Engardio has been recalled from office following his support for permanently closing a section of the Great Highway to create a car-free park. The recall was driven by constituents in the Sunset neighborhood who argued the closure negatively impacted their quality of life and created traffic safety issues. While the park measure, known as Sunset Dunes, passed citywide, it failed within his district. Engardio conceded the election but stood by his decision, highlighting a broader tension in the city between environmental goals and residents' reliance on vehicles for transportation.</p>

The decline is also supported by falling 10-year Treasury yields, another key influencer of mortgage rates.

          <p>The Trump administration is reinstating a more challenging version of the U.S. citizenship civics test, increasing the number of questions applicants must study and pass. The new test will require applicants to correctly answer 12 out of 20 questions from a pool of 128, replacing the previous version that required 6 correct answers out of 10 from a pool of 100. This change, which was previously implemented in 2020 and then rescinded by the Biden administration, is part of a broader effort to tighten the legal immigration process. Pro-immigrant advocates argue the move creates unnecessary barriers for long-term residents seeking citizenship.</p>

          <h2>Report Reveals Treasury Secretary Bessent Made Mortgage Claims Similar to Those Used Against Fed's Cook</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report has revealed that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent once declared two different properties as his "principal residence" on mortgage documents signed on the same day in 2007. This is similar to the allegations of mortgage fraud that President Trump used in his attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. While Bessent's lender stated they were aware of the circumstances and that no rules were broken, the revelation highlights a potential political double standard, as Bessent himself had previously commented that officials accused of such actions should be examined. Cook has denied any wrongdoing and is currently suing to block her removal.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, financial experts suggest that savers may want to secure a long-term certificate of deposit (CD) to lock in current rates before they decline further. With the possibility of additional rate cuts later this year, a long-term CD offers a guaranteed return and protects savings from the variable rates of standard savings accounts. Even with rates already lower than last year, a $10,000 investment in a multi-year CD can still yield over a thousand dollars in interest. This strategy provides stability and predictable earnings in an otherwise uncertain economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters anticipate the storm will remain over open water for several days, posing no immediate threat to land. However, the system is expected to intensify and could potentially develop into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend as it tracks north of the Caribbean. While its long-term path remains uncertain, current models suggest it could approach Bermuda by next week, prompting meteorologists to monitor its development closely.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume a daily amount of alcohol equivalent to nearly two human cocktails through their diet of fermented fruit. Scientists measured the ethanol content in fruits like figs and plums, finding that while the alcohol level is low, the large quantity consumed results in a steady intake. This study provides direct chemical evidence supporting the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that the human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in our primate ancestors' fruit-eating habits. The findings indicate chimps are exposed to a consistent low dose rather than becoming intoxicated.</p>

          <p>A new survey by InterNations has ranked the best countries for expatriates, with Panama, Colombia, and Mexico taking the top three spots. The ranking was based on factors like quality of life, ease of settling in, and personal finance, where Latin American and Asian countries performed strongly. The United States ranked 36th, falling outside the top 20 due to low scores in healthcare affordability and quality, as well as concerns over political stability. The results highlight a trend where expats are prioritizing financial security and a welcoming culture, finding these qualities more readily available outside of Western nations.</p>

          <p>California, along with Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii, has issued its own set of vaccine recommendations for COVID-19, flu, and RSV, creating a formal break from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The move comes after Governor Gavin Newsom signed a law empowering the state to set its own immunization schedules, a response to what state leaders call a politicization of the federal agency under the Trump administration. The West Coast Health Alliance's guidance was developed by state health experts and differs from recent CDC changes, particularly regarding recommendations for children and pregnant women, reflecting a growing divide in public health policy.</p>

Several parcels exploded in Germany, Poland, and the UK, while others were intercepted. The international investigation, involving multiple European and North American agencies, uncovered that suspects were recruited via Telegram and paid in cryptocurrency, revealing a sophisticated network for executing disruptive attacks.</p>

          <p>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has been diagnosed with an early form of skin cancer, his doctor confirmed on Wednesday. The diagnosis came after two skin lesions were removed and tested during a recent hospital visit. Bolsonaro had been taken to the hospital from his house arrest after feeling unwell with separate medical issues. His doctor stated that he will require regular monitoring to ensure the removals were complete and to check for new lesions. Bolsonaro is currently under house arrest after being convicted last week for plotting a coup following his 2022 election loss.</p>
