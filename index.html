            <p>Following a volatile week in the bond market, U.S. Treasury yields fell as investors analyzed President Trump's unexpected tariff exemptions on smartphones, computers, and electronic components. The 10-year Treasury yield decreased by approximately 8 basis points to 4.409%, while the 2-year Treasury yield dropped about 10 basis points to 3.853%. These exemptions were granted to allow companies time to relocate production to the U.S., although Trump indicated the exemptions may not be permanent. Some traders are speculating whether foreign investors will reduce their Treasury holdings amidst this uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A strike by Birmingham bin workers is set to continue after the latest pay offer from the city council was rejected, prolonging a month-long dispute over proposed pay cuts for drivers.

The dispute centers on the council's decision to remove Waste Recycling and Collection Officer roles, potentially resulting in significant pay reductions for affected workers. The ongoing strike has led to a major incident declaration due to accumulating rubbish and increased vermin, raising public health concerns.</p>

            <p>A CNBC Supply Chain Survey indicates that President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to lead to a reshoring of manufacturing to the U.S. Most companies surveyed believe the cost of building new domestic supply chains would be at least double current costs. Instead, many companies are considering relocating supply chains to lower-tariffed countries. The survey also revealed concerns about consumer demand, raw material prices, and the administration's strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

Regardless of the scenario, Waller believes the Fed will still cut interest rates, with the timing dependent on the size of the tariffs.

This declaration comes after the Trump administration claimed it was not legally obligated to secure Abrego García's return, despite a Supreme Court ruling that the administration should "facilitate" bringing him back.

            <p>The Phoenix Suns have fired head coach Mike Budenholzer after just one season, following a disappointing performance that saw the team miss the playoffs despite having a roster of All-Star players. The Suns finished with a 36-46 record, failing to meet expectations and snapping a four-season streak of postseason appearances. The decision signifies major upcoming roster upheaval for a team that has underachieved for three straight seasons. Owner Mat Ishbia has deep pockets and a desire to win, but almost every move he has made since taking over the team in February 2023 has backfired.</p>

With Medicaid being the primary source of insurance coverage for addiction treatment, significant cuts could reverse progress in reducing overdose deaths. Some GOP lawmakers have suggested excluding certain demographics, such as young men, from Medicaid eligibility, despite men being disproportionately affected by drug overdose deaths.</p>
