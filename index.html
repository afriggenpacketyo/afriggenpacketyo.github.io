            <p>Retail sales in March saw a significant increase of 1.4%, exceeding expectations and indicating strong consumer demand despite concerns about potential tariffs imposed by President Trump. Motor vehicle sales experienced a surge, suggesting consumers were attempting to purchase goods before tariffs took effect. However, this robust spending contradicts recent sentiment readings that express widespread fear that tariffs will negatively impact the economy and raise prices. The report indicates that consumers are anticipating higher prices in the near future and are taking advantage of current bargains. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Justice Department, under Attorney General Pam Bondi, has filed a civil suit against the state of Maine challenging its policy on transgender athletes participating in women's sports. The lawsuit alleges that Maine's policy violates Title IX by prioritizing gender identity over biological reality, thereby depriving female athletes of fair competition and equal opportunities. This legal action is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to highlight the issue, which they view as politically advantageous. Maine's governor has criticized the administration's actions as executive overreach and downplayed the significance of transgender athletes in school sports.</p>

            <p>Harvard University is resisting demands from the Trump administration, which include changes to governance, admissions, and DEI programs, even at the risk of losing $2.2 billion in federal funding. Harvard's president, Alan Garber, asserts that the university will not compromise its independence or constitutional rights. The administration's demands are seen as an attempt to curb antisemitism on campus, but Harvard views them as an overreach that violates academic freedom and exceeds the government's authority. This standoff highlights the growing tension between the federal government and higher education institutions regarding academic freedom and civil rights.</p>

The union claims that while council leader John Cotton has publicly stated that workers moving "sideways" will not lose pay, this guarantee has not been officially documented. The strike, which began on March 11, has resulted in significant waste accumulation in the city. The council insists that reforms are necessary and that it must undertake a full job evaluation process to avoid further equal pay issues.</p>

            <p>The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has reported that delinquent student loan payments are a significant factor in the recent decline of national average credit scores. The end of pandemic-era forbearance on federal student loans has led to many borrowers facing substantial drops in their credit standing. This decline could result in reduced credit limits, higher interest rates, and overall diminished credit access for millions of borrowers. The researchers expect that over nine million student loan borrowers will face substantial declines in credit standing over the first quarter of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>An article in *The Atlantic* examines the paternalistic attitudes prevalent in Silicon Valley, particularly in the context of artificial intelligence. The author argues that the tech industry often presents itself as both eclipsing and serving humanity, fostering a dynamic where corporations act and the public reacts. The piece draws parallels to the HBO show *Silicon Valley*, which satirizes the gendered power dynamics and hubris of tech culture. The article questions whether AI is a tool or a weapon, and whether humans can settle for machines that leave the work of trying to be good humans to the humans.</p>

            <p>Artists are expressing outrage over the use of their work to train AI systems without consent or compensation, particularly in the context of image generation and book piracy. While arguments about copyright and fair use are common, the author suggests a more potent argument: that artists are experiencing moral injury by being forced to contribute to technologies they fundamentally oppose. This moral injury stems from feeling compelled to violate their own values, leading to shame, anxiety, and depression. Framing the issue as moral injury challenges the narrative that AI innovation is inherently beneficial and essential for progress.</p>

New vehicle sales are significantly above last year's pace, while used vehicle sales are also up. This surge in demand is driven by consumers trying to avoid higher prices due to tariffs, but there are concerns that sales could decline once tariff-free inventories are depleted.

            <p>A federal judge has criticized the Department of Justice for failing to comply with her order to facilitate the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The judge ordered expedited discovery in the case, emphasizing that she would not tolerate "gamesmanship or grandstanding." Abrego Garcia's lawyers argue that the Trump administration has defied court orders by refusing to provide information about their client's location and efforts to return him to the U.S. The judge stated that "every day Mr. Abrego Garcia is detained in CECOT is another date of irreparable harm."</p>

            <p>An opinion piece in *The Guardian* argues that American women and children are in crisis, with nearly half living in poverty or low-income situations. The author contends that the Trump administration's policies and the Republican-majority Congress's budget proposals will exacerbate these issues. Potential cuts to Medicaid, food assistance, and childcare programs are highlighted as particularly harmful to women and children. The author criticizes tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy, arguing that they come at the expense of essential services for working families.</p>

            <p>Taiwanese leader William Lai's approval ratings have dropped amid growing tensions with mainland China and a recall campaign targeting opposition lawmakers. A recent poll indicated that approval of his job performance has decreased, while disapproval levels have risen to their highest point since he took office. The findings suggest that Lai is facing unprecedented levels of public dissatisfaction. The survey also warned that U.S. President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs targeting the island may be having an impact and risked hitting his support further.</p>

            <p>An article in *The Atlantic* recounts the author's experiment with dyeing potatoes instead of Easter eggs, a trend driven by rising egg prices. The author found the experience unfulfilling and the results aesthetically displeasing, arguing that potatoes are an inadequate substitute for eggs. The piece critiques the insincerity of the trend, suggesting that it disrespects children's ability to discern between simple, nice things and complicated, inferior things. The author ultimately concludes that the tradition of dyeing eggs is worth the cost and that the replacement of eggs with potatoes feels like a symbol of the wan stupidity of our cultural moment.</p>

            <p>A doctor in Berlin has been charged with murder in the deaths of 15 patients under his palliative care, with prosecutors alleging he acted out of a "lust" for killing. The doctor is accused of administering anesthetics and muscle relaxants without the patients' knowledge or consent, causing respiratory arrest and death. The case has drawn comparisons to other instances of medical professionals murdering patients, raising concerns about oversight in the healthcare system.

An additional half-dozen staff members with experience working on the floor in question reported other health concerns that did not involve brain tumors.</p>

            <p>As mortgage rates rise due to tariff-related economic uncertainty, homebuyers are increasingly turning to adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which offer lower initial interest rates but are considered riskier. Overall mortgage application volume has decreased, but the share of ARM applications has jumped to its highest level since November 2023. Economic uncertainty and rate volatility are making prospective buyers hesitant. The trend indicates that borrowers are prioritizing lower monthly payments in the face of rising home prices and economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

While the ECB had previously signaled a potential pause in monetary easing, the recent trade and tariff developments have shifted this view. Uncertainty surrounding trade policies is prompting renewed concerns about euro area growth, forcing the ECB to consider further rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>An article in *The Atlantic* explores the children's game of Cooties and its connection to real public-health concerns, particularly vaccine hesitancy. The author notes the irony of children engaging in a playful imitation of infection and vaccination at a time when vaccine skepticism is on the rise. The piece criticizes Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s skepticism towards vaccines, contrasting it with the medical wisdom embedded in the childhood ritual of cootie shots. The author suggests that in an era of adult skepticism, the cootie shot stands as an inadvertent rebuke to anti-vaccination sentiment.</p>
