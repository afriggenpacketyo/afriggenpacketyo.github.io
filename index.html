          <p>China's cyberspace regulator has summoned Nvidia to address national security concerns regarding its H20 artificial intelligence chips, which are designed for the Chinese market. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) is investigating potential vulnerabilities, including tracking and remote shutdown capabilities, following reports and calls from U.S. lawmakers to implement such features. This inquiry presents a new geopolitical challenge for Nvidia, which is trying to navigate U.S. export restrictions while catering to the significant Chinese market. The company had previously taken a substantial writedown on unsold H20 inventory due to the U.S. curbs.</p>

CEO Wael Sawan expressed satisfaction with the performance amidst a challenging macroeconomic environment, highlighting the company's ongoing transformation and cost-reduction efforts.

          <p>The French government has strongly condemned comments made by Spain's transport minister, who referred to a group of French Jewish teenagers removed from a flight as "Israeli kids." In a joint statement, French ministers called the remark unacceptable and discriminatory, arguing it wrongly equated French citizens of Jewish faith with Israelis. The incident involved 44 teenagers being removed from a Vueling flight in Valencia, with the airline citing safety risks from alleged tampering with emergency equipment. The camp organizer disputes this, and France has also criticized the use of force by Spanish police against a trip counselor.</p>

          <p>Malaysian airlines, including budget carrier AirAsia, are reportedly showing interest in China's domestically produced C919 passenger jet as an alternative to Airbus and Boeing. According to Malaysia's Transport Minister, the long waiting times for aircraft delivery from the two major manufacturers are prompting regional carriers to seek faster and more affordable options. China is actively promoting its C919 aircraft, made by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), to meet growing air travel demand in Southeast Asia. This interest signals a potential diversification in aircraft procurement within the region's aviation industry.</p>

          <p>Airlines are demanding answers from NATS, the UK's air traffic control provider, after a system failure caused widespread flight cancellations and delays across the country. The "radar-related" issue was resolved in 20 minutes by switching to a backup system, but it led to over 150 cancellations and grounded thousands more flights. Major airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet expressed frustration, with Ryanair's executive calling for the NATS CEO to resign, citing a similar major outage in 2023. The disruption is expected to have a knock-on effect for days as airlines work to reposition aircraft and accommodate stranded passengers.</p>

          <p>A Russian aerial strike on Kyiv has resulted in the deaths of six people, including a six-year-old boy, after hitting several residential buildings. According to the city's military administration, one building suffered a direct hit, and at least 52 people were injured in attacks across 27 locations in the capital. Ukrainian officials condemned the overnight strike as a "horrible" and "sinister act," stating that it proves Russia is deliberately targeting civilians and their homes.

          <p>Australia's pioneering national ban on social media for individuals under 16, aimed at tackling a youth mental health crisis, is facing scrutiny from some experts. While the policy enjoys strong public support, critics question the causal link between social media use and poor mental health, suggesting other factors like social inequity and climate anxiety are also significant. Professor Marilyn Campbell argues the ban is an overly simple solution to a complex problem and could push young people to less safe corners of the internet. The article also explores the difficulties of enforcement and notes that social media can provide vital community connections for some youths.</p>

          <p>A new poll reveals that nearly half of British adults are either delaying having children or deciding against it entirely, with financial concerns being the primary factor. The survey found that the high cost of raising children and expensive childcare are the most significant deterrents for prospective parents. This trend aligns with record-low birth rates in England and Wales, with deaths projected to outnumber births from 2030, making immigration the main driver of population growth. The issue has entered political discourse, with politicians acknowledging that housing costs and job instability are constraining family planning choices for many.</p>

          <p>Trading Standards officials across Britain are fighting what they describe as an "endless battle" against organized crime gangs selling illegal tobacco and vapes on high streets. An investigation in Newport, South Wales, found 19 shops shut down in nine months, with criminal activities including forced labor and drug dealing. Limited enforcement powers mean that even when shops are closed, they often reopen or relocate quickly. The illicit trade not only undermines legitimate businesses and deprives public services of tax revenue but also fosters fear and criminality in local communities, according to residents and officials.</p>

This move follows similar successful fundraising efforts by other Chinese drug developers, such as Innovent Biologics and Ascentage Pharma.

          <p>Democrats in Texas are vehemently opposing a new congressional map proposed by state Republicans, labeling it a "grossly unfair" and "deeply undemocratic" gerrymander. The draft plan would redraw districts to make five currently Democratic-held seats lean Republican, a move encouraged by President Trump to bolster the GOP's narrow House majority. Critics argue the map intentionally fractures Black and Latino communities to dilute their voting power, warning it could violate the Voting Rights Act. The proposal has ignited a fierce political battle, with some Democrats suggesting blue states like California and New York should respond by redrawing their own maps.</p>

          <p>A jury in Colorado has found dentist James Craig guilty of first-degree murder for killing his wife, Angela, by poisoning her protein shakes with arsenic and cyanide.

Evidence presented during the trial included Craig's internet search history for terms like "undetectable poison."

          <p>China's manufacturing sector contracted more than expected in July, marking the fourth straight month of decline as the economy faces headwinds. The official Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.3, below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. The slowdown is attributed to a traditional off-season, extreme weather events, and ongoing trade tensions with the United States. Sub-indexes for new orders and employment also remained in contraction territory, signaling persistent weakness and aligning with expectations for slower economic growth in the second half of the year (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A senior Chinese diplomat has argued that the European Union's recent trade deal with the United States could deepen its economic and security dependence on Washington, thereby undermining its goal of achieving "strategic autonomy." Shi Mingde, China's former ambassador to Germany, asserted that the EU's policy of "de-risking" from China is flawed, as the bloc's reliance on the U.S. is even stronger. Beijing has consistently supported European strategic autonomy but views the de-risking strategy as a veiled attempt to contain China's economic and technological growth, creating a complex geopolitical dynamic for the EU.</p>

          <p>Ford has increased its forecast for the financial impact of U.S. tariffs, now expecting them to cost the company approximately $2 billion in the current year. The automaker, which manufactures most of its vehicles in the U.S., has already paid an extra $800 million in duties in the second quarter. The higher-than-expected costs are attributed to sustained tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, where Ford has facilities, as well as duties on imported steel and aluminum.
