          <p>The article details the struggles House Republicans are encountering in passing President Trump's expansive tax and spending bill, which narrowly cleared the Senate. Despite the approaching July 4 deadline, Speaker Mike Johnson faces significant opposition from both moderate and conservative GOP members, who are concerned about the bill's estimated $3.3 trillion addition to the national deficit and proposed deeper cuts to social programs like Medicaid. Trump has personally intervened, hosting meetings to sway holdouts, but many remain unconvinced, highlighting deep divisions within the party over fiscal responsibility and constituent impact. The outcome remains uncertain as the House seeks to reconcile its version with the Senate's.</p>

          <p>Music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs was found guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution but acquitted of more severe charges, including racketeering conspiracy and sexual assault trafficking, in his federal trial. He will remain in detention awaiting sentencing, with prosecutors suggesting a four to five-year prison term, though his lawyers sought immediate release on bail. The verdict follows a high-profile trial featuring graphic testimony from former girlfriends, who described drug-fueled "freak-offs" and allegations of control and abuse. Combs' defense maintained the encounters were consensual, while acknowledging his drug problem and instances of domestic violence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the procedural implications of a tie vote in the U.S. House of Representatives, a scenario made more plausible by the current slim Republican majority and internal party divisions, such as those seen with President Trump's budget bill. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, House rules dictate that a question before the chamber "shall be lost" in the event of a tie, with no tie-breaker mechanism available. The article highlights a recent instance in February 2024 where a tie vote on an impeachment effort was narrowly averted by a last-minute vote change, underscoring the precarious nature of legislative outcomes in a closely divided chamber.</p>

          <p>The United States government has rescinded its export restrictions on chip design software to China, as confirmed by U.S.-based Synopsys, a key industry player. This policy reversal comes after the U.S. had previously required companies like Synopsys to obtain licenses for exporting semiconductor-related goods to China since May. The lifting of these curbs is seen as a significant development amid a broader trade truce between the two nations, potentially easing tensions and facilitating trade in the critical technology sector. This move could impact global supply chains and foster greater technological collaboration.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation by the Trump administration led to a prolonged legal battle, has alleged "psychological torture" and "severe beatings" during his detention at El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison. In a new legal filing, his attorneys detail severe mistreatment including forced kneeling for hours, sleep deprivation, and inadequate nutrition, resulting in a 31-pound weight loss. Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. in June and promptly charged with human smuggling, but his lawyers are seeking to prevent further deportation, despite the Trump administration's claims of his MS-13 gang affiliation, which he strongly denies.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's equity capital markets are experiencing a strong resurgence, with new listing volumes jumping eightfold to $14 billion in the first half of 2025, positioning the city to become the world's largest listing destination this year. This surge is attributed to a confluence of factors, including Beijing's regulatory support for mainland companies to list offshore, a muted pace of A-share listings, ample market liquidity, and delisting fears in U.S. markets. The trend is driven by Chinese firms seeking to fund globalization strategies and capitalize on improved market valuations, particularly in emerging sectors like AI and biotech.

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked the Trump administration's policy that restricts migrants crossing the southern border from seeking asylum. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled in a 128-page order that President Donald Trump exceeded his legal authority by attempting to "adopt an alternative immigration system," stating neither the Constitution nor the Immigration and Nationality Act grant such unilateral power. The executive order, issued in January, had declared the border situation an "invasion" and suspended asylum access. The judge's decision, which recognized the executive branch's challenges, was stayed for 14 days to allow for an appeal and implementation preparation.</p>

Trump linked his call to a news article about a federal housing regulator seeking an investigation into Powell's testimony regarding Fed headquarters renovations. While Trump nominated Powell during his first term, he has consistently attacked him for not lowering interest rates. Powell, however, stated that rates would have been cut if not for Trump's tariff policies. The legality of the president unilaterally removing a Fed chair, who can only be forced out "for cause," remains a point of contention.</p>

          <p>A report by His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services found that Manchester City Council's heavy redaction of evidence significantly delayed investigations into historical child sexual assault cases. Some material provided contained pages with only a few visible words, rendering evidential assessment impossible. While the council cited complex data-sharing rules to prevent jeopardizing prosecutions, the delays severely impacted operations like Green Jacket and Bernese. A new information-sharing protocol has since been agreed upon, allowing investigators to view and assess unredacted documents remotely, though this has meant restarting parts of the process.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology indicates that estrogen plus progestin hormone therapy increases breast cancer risk in women under 55 with a uterus, while estrogen alone reduces it. Dr. CÃ©line Gounder, a CBS News medical contributor, explained that the combination is necessary for women with a uterus to prevent endometrial cancer, whereas estrogen alone can be given to those without a uterus. This research refines previous understandings from an early 2000s study, which focused on older women and led to misconceptions about hormone therapy's safety. The article emphasizes the importance of consulting a doctor to weigh individual risks and benefits based on timing and type of therapy.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, a former criminology student, has pleaded guilty to the murders of four University of Idaho studentsâ€”Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, and Madison Mogenâ€”in November 2022 as part of a deal to avoid the death penalty. He will be sentenced to life in prison on July 23. During the hearing, prosecutors revealed new details, including that Kohberger purchased the knife online eight months prior and left a sheath with his DNA at the scene. While the plea provides closure for some victims' families, others expressed disappointment, wanting a full confession and answers regarding his motives and whether he acted alone.</p>

Investigators later found his car meticulously cleaned and his apartment scrubbed, indicating an elaborate cover-up.

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study reveals that nearly 50% of Latino voters supported Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, a notable increase from his 2020 performance. While Kamala Harris still secured a slight majority, the study indicates a significant shift towards Trump, with experts like Mike Madrid suggesting a growing "populist" trend among Latino voters, rather than a conservative one. Analysts propose that Democratic Party immigration policies and a perceived lack of focus on economic mobility contributed to this disillusionment.

The evolving picture of damage comes as Iran has suspended cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, accusing it of bias.
