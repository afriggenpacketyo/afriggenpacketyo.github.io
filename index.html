        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has agreed to cap tariffs on European Union pharmaceuticals and semiconductors at 15%, backing down from earlier threats of tariffs as high as 250%. This clarification comes as part of a broader trade agreement aimed at de-escalating economic tensions between the two major trading partners. In exchange for the U.S. tariff limits, the EU has committed to eliminating its own tariffs on all U.S. industrial and agricultural goods. However, a reduction in U.S. tariffs on European cars from 27.5% to 15% is conditional on the EU first implementing its tariff cuts through legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel's defense minister has threatened to destroy Gaza City if Hamas fails to agree to terms for disarmament and the release of all hostages. This declaration follows the Israeli cabinet's approval of plans for a major assault, despite international opposition and a recent ceasefire proposal from mediators that Israel has seemingly rejected. The United Nations and aid organizations have expressed grave concerns over the potential for a deepened humanitarian crisis, as the planned operation would involve evacuating one million residents. The conflict, which began after a Hamas-led attack, has resulted in over 62,000 deaths in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver a highly anticipated speech at the Jackson Hole symposium, with investors and economists looking for signals about future interest rate policy. The address comes as President Trump continues to publicly pressure the Fed for rate cuts to stimulate the economy, a demand Powell has so far resisted. With jobs growth stalling and inflation rising, market expectations for a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting have increased significantly. Powell's speech will be his last at the annual event as chair, adding to the scrutiny of his economic outlook and potential policy hints. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia has reportedly instructed its component suppliers, including Amkor Technology and Samsung Electronics, to halt production related to its H20 AI chip, which was specifically designed for the Chinese market. This move follows reports that the Chinese government ordered local tech giants like ByteDance and Alibaba to stop purchasing the chips due to national security concerns. Beijing has raised questions about potential tracking technology or remote-access "backdoors" in the chips, a claim Nvidia's CEO has denied. The suspension creates further uncertainty for Nvidia's business in China, a lucrative market impacted by ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's Supreme Court has suspended an earlier order that mandated the removal of all stray dogs from the streets of New Delhi, a decision that had sparked protests from animal rights activists. The new ruling directs that stray dogs should be caught, sterilized, and immunized before being released, with removal reserved only for cases of rabies or extreme aggression. The court also banned the public feeding of strays, instructing municipal bodies to establish designated feeding zones to manage the issue.

          <p>Millions of people in the United Kingdom are expected to face significant travel disruptions during the upcoming bank holiday weekend due to a combination of busy roads and rail strikes. The RAC anticipates 17.6 million car journeys, warning of heavy traffic on major routes like the M5, particularly on Friday. Concurrently, a strike by the RMT union will halt all CrossCountry rail services on Saturday and cause major alterations on other days, impacting key routes across the country. The disruption coincides with several major events, including the Notting Hill Carnival and Reading and Leeds festivals, likely adding to the travel congestion.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's third-largest steelworks, Speciality Steels UK (SSUK), has been placed under government control after an insolvency court granted a winding-up order sought by creditors. This move puts the future of nearly 1,500 workers in Rotherham and Sheffield in uncertainty, though the government has agreed to cover wages while it seeks a buyer for the business. The company, part of Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty Steel empire, was deemed "hopelessly insolvent" by the judge. The government's intervention aims to ensure an orderly process that could allow steel production to restart under new ownership, safeguarding a nationally important industry.</p>

Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center stated that the hazardous swimming conditions are likely to persist for several more days.

Despite the slowdown, this marks the 40th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, maintaining pressure on the central bank to consider raising interest rates. The "core-core" inflation rate, a key metric for the bank that also excludes energy prices, held steady at 3.4%. (not investment advice)</p>

Beyond the health impacts, the analysis also highlights a decline in economic productivity, noting that for every degree increase above 20°C, productivity falls by 2%.

This initiative follows a successful pilot program that stopped £17 million in incorrect payments to 2,600 people in less than a year.

          <p>An investigation has revealed that some international aid workers feel their organizations are self-censoring and watering down criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza to avoid jeopardizing their operational status. This "chilling effect" reportedly intensified after Israel introduced a new, stricter registration process for NGOs, which requires sensitive data and can deny permits based on employees' past statements. Some workers claim they have been asked to remove terms like "occupation" and "blockade" from public statements, leading to a sense of complicity in misrepresenting the severity of the humanitarian crisis. The dilemma forces organizations to choose between speaking out and risking access, or staying quiet to potentially continue their work.</p>

          <p>The space race between the U.S. and China is intensifying, with Beijing making significant strides in its mission to land astronauts on the Moon by 2030. China recently conducted successful tests of its Lanyue lunar lander and Long March-10 carrier rocket, key components of its ambitious lunar program. These advancements challenge the timeline of NASA's Artemis program, which aims for a crewed lunar landing around 2027 but has faced delays and budget issues. While the U.S. has a historical advantage, China's rapid technological development and consistent mission successes over the past decade suggest it could potentially beat NASA back to the lunar surface.</p>

          <p>A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket has launched the U.S. Space Force's reusable, unpiloted X-37B space plane on its eighth classified, long-duration mission. The rocket lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, with the Falcon 9's first-stage booster successfully returning for its sixth landing. While the specifics of the mission are secret, officials disclosed that payloads on board will test advanced laser communications and a quantum navigation sensor designed to operate without GPS. The X-37B, which resembles a miniature space shuttle, serves as a test bed for new space technologies and can remain in orbit for extended periods, with one previous mission lasting nearly 909 days.</p>

          <p>The European Union's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, has cautioned against any peace deal that would require Ukraine to cede territory to Russia, describing it as a "trap that Putin wants us to walk into." Speaking after EU leaders participated in White House peace talks, Kallas emphasized the need for "credible and robust" security guarantees for Ukraine, stating that the strongest guarantee is a strong Ukrainian army. Her comments highlight European concerns over President Trump's push for a quick end to the war, which has included suggestions of territorial swaps, a proposal Ukraine has consistently rejected.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has ordered the closure of a controversial migrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, known as "Alligator Alcatraz," citing severe and irreparable environmental damage. The ruling prohibits the transfer of any new detainees to the facility and mandates that the Trump administration wind down its operations within 60 days. The decision is a significant victory for a coalition of environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, who argued the government bypassed necessary environmental reviews. The judge's order upholds legislation designed to protect the Everglades, a fragile ecosystem and UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

          <p>A court in Bangkok has cleared former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra of royal defamation charges, a significant legal victory that eases a major threat to his family's influential political movement. Thaksin faced up to 15 years in prison over remarks he made in a 2015 media interview, which prosecutors alleged violated Thailand's strict lese majeste law. The judges ruled that the evidence was insufficient to convict him. The acquittal is considered unusual, as such cases rarely end in a not-guilty verdict, and it comes as his daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, currently serves as the country's prime minister.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's order, allowing the Trump administration to proceed with canceling National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and gender identity. In a 5-4 decision, the court ruled that the legal challenge from 16 states and research groups over the grant terminations belongs in the Court of Federal Claims. The ruling enables the administration to pull back funding it deems unaligned with its policy objectives, which include a directive for federal agencies to cancel DEI-related grants. The underlying legal battle over the administration's directives will continue in the lower courts.</p>

          <p>In a rare admission of military casualties, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un stated his "heart aches" for soldiers killed while fighting for Russia in its war against Ukraine. During a ceremony in Pyongyang honoring a unit that had returned from the Kursk region, Kim met with bereaved families and praised the deceased soldiers as heroes. North Korea began sending troops and equipment to support Russia's war effort last year, but the regime has been largely silent about the heavy losses its forces have reportedly suffered. Western intelligence estimates suggest thousands of the approximately 12,000 North Korean troops deployed have been killed or wounded.</p>

          <p>The recent meeting of European leaders with President Zelenskyy at the White House demonstrated continued support for Ukraine, but it also highlighted concerns over President Trump's focus on a swift end to the war rather than a just peace. For Ukrainians, a fair resolution requires the liberation of all territories seized by Russia, a goal that international partners seem increasingly hesitant to champion explicitly. While the show of unity in Washington was a positive signal, the path to a meaningful dialogue with Russia is fraught with obstacles. Many in Ukraine fear that any potential negotiations could legitimize Russia's aggression without achieving true security or sovereignty.</p>

          <h2>Scientific Study Reveals Corn Plants Communicate to Defend Against Pests</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has found that corn plants can communicate with their neighbors by releasing a volatile chemical compound called linalool when planted in high-density fields. This airborne signal prompts nearby corn plants to alter their soil microbiome, which in turn helps them better defend against pests. Researchers observed that maize plants in the inner rows of dense fields suffered less damage from herbivores than those on the edges, although their growth was also reduced. This discovery of plant-to-plant communication offers new insights into how agricultural practices could be optimized to enhance natural pest resistance and potentially improve crop yields.</p>

          <p>Colombia is facing a severe security crisis after two separate attacks attributed to dissident FARC factions killed at least 18 people. In the city of Cali, a car bomb exploded near a military aviation school, killing six people and injuring over 60, prompting the mayor to declare martial law. In a separate incident, a drone attack on a police helicopter involved in a coca eradication mission killed all 12 officers on board in a rural area near Medellin. The attacks underscore the challenges to the country's fragile peace process and the persistent violence from armed groups involved in drug trafficking.</p>
