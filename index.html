          <p>CBS News has introduced a price tracking tool to help consumers monitor the rising costs of everyday household expenses, including food, utilities, and rent. The tracker utilizes data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index, focusing on goods and services that represent a significant portion of family budgets. This tool aims to provide clarity on cost-of-living pressures, especially as potential tariffs could further influence prices for common items.</p>

          <p>A recent push by the Trump administration to protect eagles from wind turbines is being viewed skeptically by critics, who suggest it is a tactic to undermine wind energy development. While wind turbines do pose a threat to birds, the article notes that other factors like climate change and stray cats are far more deadly. It also points out the irony that the administration is simultaneously weakening broader environmental protections that have historically helped eagle populations recover and thrive.</p>

The strong performance was driven by a 90% growth in USDC circulation, reflecting increased interest from financial institutions amid a more favorable regulatory environment.

          <p>Mortgage experts suggest that a significant drop in mortgage rates to below 6% is unlikely to occur before mid-to-late 2026, barring a major economic downturn or geopolitical crisis. Factors such as low unemployment and persistent inflation are expected to keep rates elevated. While waiting for lower rates might seem prudent, some experts advise that buying now could offer advantages like lower home prices and the ability to start building equity, with the option to refinance later.

          <p>In a federal trial examining the legality of President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, a commanding general testified he never heard the situation described as a "rebellion." The trial centers on whether the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits military involvement in domestic law enforcement. While military officials stated their mission was to protect federal property, testimony revealed differing interpretations of when military support was justified, raising questions about the scope of presidential power.</p>

The designation, which tightens scrutiny on the group's supporters, coincides with a visit from Pakistan's army chief and follows a new U.S.-Pakistan trade agreement related to resource development in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis examines why the Trump administration appears to be taking a more lenient approach toward China on trade tariffs while imposing harsher penalties on countries like India. Reasons for the shift include a desire to avoid a tariff spike during the holiday retail season and to create space for broader negotiations on technology and rare earths, a sector where China holds significant leverage. This strategic pivot suggests Washington may be prioritizing a complex negotiation with Beijing over maintaining a uniformly aggressive tariff policy.</p>
