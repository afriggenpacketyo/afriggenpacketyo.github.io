          <p>China is expected to maintain a cautious approach regarding the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, even if the United States were to intervene militarily. While Beijing has close ties with Tehran, it is likely to weigh the strategic implications and trade relations before taking any decisive action. The Chinese foreign ministry has expressed serious concerns over the escalating tensions and urged countries with influence over Israel, seemingly referencing the US, to play a constructive role in easing the situation. China has also stated its willingness to mediate peace talks between Iran and Israel, reflecting its desire for regional stability. The country opposes any behavior that violates the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and infringes upon the sovereignty, security and territorial integrity of other countries.</p>

          <p>An Australian nurse had her life upended when scammers hijacked her phone number and drained her bank accounts. The scammers were able to change her email, passwords, and open bank loans in her name. Phone porting is a legitimate process that lets you keep your phone number when switching carriers, but scammers have learned how to exploit it. The FCC recommends contacting your phone company and bank, and placing a fraud alert on your credit reports if you have been a victim of a phone porting scam.</p>

          <p>The escalating Israel-Iran conflict could trigger new security and economic challenges for Pakistan, which is already grappling with militancy, separatism, and economic instability. Pakistan shares a 909-kilometer border with Iran's restive Balochistan province, where officials announced on Monday that all formal border crossings with Iran had closed for an indefinite period amid intensifying strikes between Israel and Iran. The relationship between predominantly Sunni Pakistan and Shiite-majority Iran has been complex, with the cross-border region affected by attacks from Baloch separatists who are fighting a war of independence against the Pakistani state. A wider conflict in the Middle East could disrupt global oil supplies and drive prices higher.</p>

Rising debt levels could also lead to a decline in the value of the dollar, further incentivizing holders of Treasurys to shed their holdings.
