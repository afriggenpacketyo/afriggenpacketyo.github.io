            <p>Alibaba's Taobao is witnessing a surge in popularity in the US, driven by Americans seeking cheaper goods due to tariffs. The app's ranking among free apps on Apple's App Store jumped significantly, reflecting a growing trend of consumers turning to Chinese shopping platforms. TikTok videos showcasing affordable knock-off luxury items are fueling this demand, leading to increased downloads of apps like DHgate. This trend underscores the impact of trade wars on consumer behavior and the appeal of budget-friendly alternatives. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a significant breakthrough by successfully fueling an operational thorium molten salt reactor, marking a global first in clean energy technology. The experimental reactor, located in the Gobi Desert, uses thorium as a safer and more abundant alternative to uranium. With the capacity to generate 2 megawatts of thermal power sustainably, this development positions China at the forefront of harnessing thorium for nuclear power. Experts suggest that thorium could potentially meet China's energy demands for tens of thousands of years while minimizing radioactive waste.</p>

            <p>Eli Lilly's experimental obesity pill, orforglipron, has demonstrated positive results in a late-stage trial involving patients with Type 2 diabetes, meeting the company's goals for blood sugar and weight reduction. Patients experienced an average weight loss of 7.9% after 40 weeks, with no plateau observed, and the pill showed a safety profile comparable to existing injections. While the pill fell slightly short of some analysts' expectations for a key diabetes metric, Eli Lilly anticipates regulatory approval for obesity by the end of the year and for diabetes in 2026. If approved, this needle-free alternative could address supply shortages and solidify Eli Lilly's position in the growing weight loss market. (not investment advice)</p>

While emphasizing the need for further confirmation, the team believes this is the strongest evidence yet of possible life beyond our solar system.

He argued that lower oil prices and groceries, coupled with tariff revenue, warrant immediate rate cuts, similar to actions taken by the European Central Bank. This is not the first time Trump has criticized Powell, but it marks the first instance of explicitly calling for his firing, despite Powell's assertion that the president lacks the authority to do so.

            <p>The National Institutes of Health's top researcher on ultra-processed foods, Dr. Kevin Hall, resigned, accusing aides to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of censorship. Hall claims he was blocked from speaking to a reporter and his written answers were edited without his consent. He also alleges he was prevented from presenting his research at a conference and given an ultimatum regarding a manuscript. An HHS spokesperson denied the accusations, but Hall questioned their definition of censorship. This departure marks the latest in a series of high-profile exits from the NIH under the Trump administration.</p>

            <p>A federal judge found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt for ignoring his order barring the deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members. Judge James Boasberg determined the government's actions demonstrated a willful disregard for the court order. The administration has one week to submit a plan to "purge" the contempt finding by allowing the deported individuals to challenge their removal. If the government fails to comply, Boasberg will demand the names of the officials who ignored his order and potentially prosecute them for contempt.</p>
