        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Authorities apprehended Vance Luther Boelter late Sunday as the suspect in the killing of Minnesota Democratic state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in what was called a "politically motivated assassination." Boelter also allegedly shot Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, in a separate attack Saturday morning, with the couple in stable condition as of Sunday evening. Authorities located what they believe to be the suspect's vehicle in Sibley County, Minnesota, about an hour outside of Minneapolis, finding "items of evidence" in the car "that are relevant to this investigation." More than 100 law enforcement officers and a number of SWAT teams searched the area until late into the night Sunday before locating Boelter. The state of Minnesota is reeling after the attacks, and lawmakers and the public are on edge.</p>

          <p>Discontent is growing in the Tokyo metropolitan area due to proposals to construct giant data centers in residential areas, leading to industry groups working to smooth relations between locals concerned about the "eerie" facilities' imposing nature and the companies that operate them. Some projects are being scrapped due to opposition from residents worried about electricity shortages, heat islands, and obstruction of their natural light. Municipalities are taking action, with Tokyo's Koto Ward requiring data center business owners to install signs announcing construction earlier and to clearly indicate the location of heat-emitting outdoor units. Inzai has begun considering whether to set restrictions on the construction of data centers near residential areas. It is important for business owners to disclose information and steadily work to build trust with the communities affected.</p>

          <p>Crude futures jumped about $5 per barrel after Israel launched airstrikes against Iran without U.S. support, stoking fear among investors that the conflict could spread to disrupt oil supplies in the Middle East. Oil traders viewed Israel's attack as the most significant geopolitical event since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with crude prices posting their strongest gains since March 2022. Israel launched a "targeted military operation" against Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile program, with the attack not appearing to have disrupted any significant oil infrastructure. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Iran against targeting U.S. interests in the region, stating that the U.S. was not involved in strikes against Iran, and that their top priority is protecting American forces in the region.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales in May grew at their fastest rate since late 2023, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Monday, in part helped by the extended Labor Day and Dragon Boat holidays. Retail sales last month jumped 6.4% from a year earlier, sharply beating analysts' estimates for a 5% growth in a Reuters poll and accelerating from the 5.1% growth in the previous month. Growth in industrial output slowed to 5.8% year on year in May from 6.1% in the prior month, coming in slightly weaker than analysts' expectations for a 5.9% rise. The rise of retail sales came as a surprise, likely boosted by the lasting effects from consumer goods trade-in program, though falling property prices could dampen consumer sentiment.</p>

          <p>Shares of Santos surged as much as 15.23% Monday after it received a non-binding takeover offer of $18.72 billion by an Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company-led group. The takeover bid led by ADNOC's investment arm XRG follows two confidential, non-binding and indicative proposals from the same consortium on Mar. 21 and Mar. 28, according to Santos. The consortium also includes the Abu Dhabi Development Holding Co and global private equity firm Carlyle Group, offering a cash offer price of $5.76 (8.89 Australian dollars) per Santos share, which translates to a 27.73% premium from its closing price last Friday. Santos' board said it intends to "unanimously recommend" the company's shareholders to vote in favor of the potential transaction, in the absence of a superior proposal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan has requested eight countries and regions to block its residents from accessing licensed online casino websites, a government source said Monday. It is a crime in Japan to gamble with overseas-based betting sites, prompting the government to address the issue by urging the operators to cut off access to their sites. Japan has moved to crack down on illegal gambling following media revelations that some professional athletes and celebrities have used online casinos. A police survey estimated that more than 3 million people in the country have gambled online, with authorities believing that approximately $8.6 billion is spent annually by gamblers in Japan.</p>

          <p>China's economic data sent mixed signals in May, with US tariffs continuing to weigh on the countryâ€™s manufacturing and exports but domestic consumption picking up slightly in the run-up to a major online shopping festival. Retail sales rose by 6.4 per cent in May, compared with the 5.1 per cent growth observed in April, exceeding forecasts. The stronger consumption figures came as China gears up for one of its largest online shopping festivals of the year on June 18, and with the government continuing to boost consumer spending via a large-scale trade-in programme for appliances and other household goods. Industrial output, pressured by US tariffs and fierce domestic competition, grew in May by 5.8 per cent, year on year, according to the NBS data.</p>

Researchers published a study that showed how the lifespan of a PeLED could be extended to more than 20 years at a comparable brightness to commercial displays. The teamâ€™s PeLEDs reached a brightness of 1.16 million nits, far exceeding the brightest commercial display screens, which usually cap out at several thousand nits.</p>

          <p>Malik Tillman scored twice as the United States built a three-goal, first-half lead and ended a four-game losing streak by routing Trinidad and Tobago 5-0 on Sunday in a Concacaf Gold Cup opener. The victory came after days of controversy over Christian Pulisicâ€™s desire to rest during the Gold Cup and coach Mauricio Pochettino not including the star in a pair of pre-tournament friendlies the attacker offered to play in. The US had 70.5% possession and a 21-3 advantage in shots against the Soca Warriors, whose 2-1 home win against the Americans in 2017 ended a streak of seven straight World Cup appearances by the US. The Americans have won their group in 16 of 17 Gold Cups, along with a second-place finish behind Panama in 2011, and improved their group stage record to 41 wins, one loss and five draws.</p>

The article notes that there is an incentive for companies to exaggerate their investment plans to gain favor with the administration. The analysis suggests that the actual impact of Trump's policies on investment is more incremental than claimed.</p>
