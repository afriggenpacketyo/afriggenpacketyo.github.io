          <p>President Trump's new tariffs include a 10% baseline tariff on all US imports, along with higher, customized rates for specific countries deemed "worst offenders."  The EU, China, Vietnam, and Japan are among those facing increased tariffs.  Canada and Mexico are not subject to the baseline rate due to existing tariffs.  The plan aims to address trade imbalances and protect American jobs and manufacturing, but is expected to cause significant global economic disruption.</p>
