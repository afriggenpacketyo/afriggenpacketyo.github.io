            <p>Kenan Malik critiques Donald Trump's efforts to exert political control over Harvard University by demanding viewpoint diversity through faculty hiring practices. Malik argues that while viewpoint diversity is important, Trump's approach, which includes affirmative action for conservatives, is a form of identity politics that undermines academic freedom and meritocracy. The author suggests that the solutions being proposed often threaten to make the problem worse. Malik concludes that fostering genuine debate requires rethinking social and political engagement and celebrating the ability to consider different perspectives.</p>

            <p>Train services on Tokyo's Yamanote and Keihin-Tohoku lines have resumed after a suspension caused by track-switching work to improve access to Haneda airport. The suspension, lasting over 24 hours, affected approximately 550,000 people. East Japan Railway Co. carried out platform expansion work at Tamachi Station and relocated nearby tracks to prepare for the construction of a new line directly connecting central Tokyo and the airport, scheduled to open in the fiscal year starting April 2031.</p>
