          <p>A Chinese university team has successfully trialed a new brain-computer interface implanted through blood vessels, avoiding open-skull surgery. This minimally invasive method helped a paralyzed patient regain some limb movement, positioning it as a potential alternative to more invasive techniques like those used by Elon Musk's Neuralink. The procedure involves inserting a stent electrode into the brain's vascular network via a neck vein, which could significantly reduce surgical risks and recovery times for patients with paralysis.</p>

          <p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has condemned the new aid distribution system in Gaza, operated by the Israel- and U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), calling it "inherently unsafe" and a "death sentence." The UN reports that over 400 Palestinians have been killed while trying to get food from GHF sites, which bypass the UN and other NGOs. Guterres emphasized that the search for food should not be fatal and called for the political courage to implement a ceasefire in the region.</p>

          <p>The first meeting of the newly appointed CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), whose members were selected by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has sparked alarm in the scientific community. The proceedings were characterized by committee members, including noted vaccine skeptics, questioning established vaccine safety data and promoting unproven hypotheses of harm. This shift in direction, along with the recent termination of U.S. funding for a global childhood vaccination initiative, signals a potential overhaul of American public health policy.</p>

          <p>In a major 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court has limited the ability of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions that block government policies across the entire country. The ruling stemmed from a case involving President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, but its impact is much broader, reining in a judicial tool used against both Republican and Democratic administrations. While the court narrowed the injunctions against the birthright citizenship policy, it did not rule on the constitutionality of the policy itself.</p>

          <p>A fourth federal judge has permanently blocked one of President Trump's executive orders aimed at punishing an elite law firm, in this case, Susman Godfrey. U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan ruled the order unconstitutional, stating it violated the firm's rights and represented an attack on the American legal system's independent bar. This ruling is the latest in a series of legal defeats for the administration's campaign to use executive power against law firms representing clients or causes the president opposes.</p>

          <h2>Labour Government's U-Turn on Benefit Cuts Raises Questions About Long-Term Economic Strategy</h2>

          <p>The UK's Labour government executed a major U-turn on planned cuts to disability benefits after facing a significant rebellion from its own MPs. The reversal raises questions about the credibility of the government's long-term economic plans and its ability to manage its large parliamentary majority. While the initial cuts were intended to save billions and meet self-imposed borrowing rules, critics argued the policy was a short-term cost-cutting exercise rather than a genuine reform to help people back into work.
