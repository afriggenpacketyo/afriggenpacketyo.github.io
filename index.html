          <p>A New York City Department of Environmental Protection worker was killed, and two others were injured in an explosion aboard a sewage boat docked on the Hudson River. The incident occurred at the North River Wastewater Resource Recovery Facility in West Harlem. The explosion, which sent heavy black smoke into the air, happened while three DEP employees were working on the vessel, which transports raw sewage. The deceased worker, a 33-year veteran of the DEP, was ejected from the boat by the force of the explosion. The U.S. Coast Guard is investigating the cause, with initial reports suggesting it may be linked to hot work on the boat. </p>

          <p>Tracey Lynch, sister of Jason Corbett, is fighting to clear her brother's name after he was killed by his wife, Molly Corbett, and her father, Tom Martens, in North Carolina. Martens and Corbett claimed self-defense, alleging Jason was choking Molly, but Lynch disputes this, asserting they murdered Jason and then attempted to defame him. Jason, a widower with two children, had hired Molly as an au pair before marrying her and moving to the U.S. Lynch highlights inconsistencies in Molly's accounts and maintains that Jason was planning to return to Ireland with his children, which motivated the crime. The North Carolina Court of Appeals is currently reviewing the case after Martens and Corbett were initially convicted of second-degree murder but were later released and given a new trial, eventually pleading no contest to voluntary manslaughter.</p>

          <p>Chinese military scientists have achieved a technological breakthrough with the development of the world's fastest electromagnetic coilgun, capable of firing 3,000 rounds per minute. This rate significantly surpasses traditional firearms and U.S. commercial models. The advancement involves eliminating capacitors, the traditional bottleneck in electromagnetic weapons, by powering the coilgun directly with lithium batteries. This innovation is detailed in China’s Journal of Gun Launch & Control and has raised concerns among military experts, as it could redefine future combat scenarios due to its increased firing capacity and efficiency.</p>

          <p>Juan Soto delivered a crucial two-run double in the fourth inning, leading the New York Mets to a 5-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dodgers' overworked pitching staff was a key factor in the game, with starter Tony Gonsolin struggling with command after a solid start. Gonsolin's difficulty in the fourth inning, marked by consecutive walks, set the stage for Soto's decisive hit. Mets starter David Peterson pitched effectively, contributing to the Dodgers' reliance on their bullpen, which had been heavily used in previous games. </p>

          <p>Lucy Connolly's online post, which followed a false rumor about an illegal immigrant being responsible for a murder, led to her imprisonment and ignited a debate about free speech. Connolly called for setting fire to hotels housing asylum seekers, leading to a 31-month jail term for inciting racial hatred. While some view the sentence as tyrannical, others argue it's a necessary consequence for inciting violence. Connolly's appeal was dismissed, and her husband asserts she is not racist but made a mistake, while a local MP defended the police action, emphasizing the dangers of online spaces.</p>

The ruling underscores ongoing legal challenges to the Trump administration's deportation policies, with the judge noting the man poses no security threat.

          <p>Swarms of midges are causing problems at the World Exposition in Osaka, making visitors uncomfortable and raising health concerns. The small flies are present on walls and pillars, with visitors struggling to avoid swallowing them. While the midges don't bite, their dead bodies can trigger asthma and allergic reactions if inhaled. The expo organizer is taking action by spraying insecticide, treating areas with growth inhibitors, and installing insect repellent lights. </p>

          <p>New York City's beaches opened for the season with 280 certified lifeguards, fewer than the city needs, but more than last year. Officials are hoping to increase staffing as summer approaches, with incentives like higher wages and signing bonuses. Beachgoers expressed relief at seeing lifeguards, though the city still falls short of its full staffing needs. The city has also made efforts to make it easier to become a lifeguard by holding qualifying exams in multiple boroughs and loosening requirements for some positions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Susan Brownmiller, a feminist author and activist, died at 90, leaving behind a legacy that transformed societal views on sexual assault. Her groundbreaking book “Against Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual Assault” challenged the notion of sexual assault as an act of passion, reframing it as a crime of power and violence. The book, which provided a comprehensive history of sexual assault, influenced the women's movement, leading to the establishment of sexual assault crisis centers and the reform of laws to facilitate the prosecution of perpetrators. Despite facing criticism for some of her views, Brownmiller remained a significant figure in the fight against sexual assault.</p>
