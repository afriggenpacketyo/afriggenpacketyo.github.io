          <h2>Chinese Study Suggests Chemotherapy May Inadvertently Accelerate Cancer Metastasis</h2>

          <p>A study by Chinese researchers suggests that chemotherapy, while effective against primary tumors, might awaken dormant cancer cells, potentially accelerating the spread of cancer to other organs. The findings, observed in breast cancer models, help explain why metastasis can occur even after successful initial treatment. The research team also identified drugs that could inhibit this process in mice when used alongside chemotherapy, and a clinical trial involving human breast cancer patients is now underway to test this new combined approach.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major federal regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The legislation allows banks and other financial institutions to issue digital currencies backed one-to-one by liquid assets like the U.S. dollar, aiming to enhance financial innovation and payment efficiency. Supporters believe this will bolster the dollar's global status and could expand the stablecoin market to trillions, while critics raise concerns about potential loopholes for money laundering.

          <p>A Brazilian court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle tag and adhere to a nighttime curfew amid an ongoing trial. The restrictions were imposed over fears he might flee the country while facing accusations of plotting a coup to prevent his successor from taking office, a charge he denies. The case has drawn international attention, with the U.S. government under President Trump reportedly applying pressure by revoking visas for Brazilian judicial officials and threatening tariffs to support his political ally.</p>

          <p>The UK Met Office has issued an amber weather warning for parts of the country, including London, forecasting torrential rain and thunderstorms that could lead to dangerous flash floods. Following a recent heatwave that left the ground parched and unable to absorb water effectively, authorities warn that over a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours. The severe weather is expected to cause significant disruption to transport, potential power cuts, and flooding of homes and businesses, with the public urged to take precautions.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has initiated a defamation lawsuit seeking at least $10 billion in damages against the Wall Street Journal, its owner Rupert Murdoch, and parent companies Dow Jones and News Corp. The legal action stems from a report detailing a sexually suggestive birthday letter allegedly sent by Trump to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. Trump has vehemently denied writing the letter, calling it fake and malicious, while a spokesperson for Dow Jones stated the publisher has full confidence in the accuracy of its reporting and will defend itself vigorously.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the People's Liberation Army Engineering University have proposed a new "X-railgun" design that aims to overcome the power limitations of the navy's current electromagnetic weapon. The existing naval railgun, first seen on a ship in 2018, is limited to firing relatively light 15kg projectiles, which are considered too weak for major naval warfare. By cross-stacking two railguns into one, the army's proposed design could nearly double the force, allowing it to launch 30kg shells at speeds of Mach 7, significantly enhancing its military application.</p>

          <p>An adviser for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has stated that the global financial system must rewrite its rules to adapt to a future dominated by tokenized assets. Shin Hyun-Song, a BIS economic adviser, highlighted that the rise of stablecoins presents significant challenges to existing infrastructures for payment and settlement. He noted that the cross-border and pseudonymous nature of these digital tokens could complicate efforts to combat money laundering and require new regulatory approaches, a concern amplified by recent market surges.

          <p>In a recent interview, acting ICE director Todd Lyons confirmed the agency plans to use government databases, including Medicaid, to locate and arrest immigrants in the U.S. illegally. He defended the practice as a way to find individuals who have been ordered deported or have criminal records. Lyons also addressed the controversial use of masks by ICE agents during arrests, stating that while he is not a proponent, he will continue to allow it due to concerns for officer safety amid a reported 800% increase in attacks on personnel this year.</p>

          <p>Prominent voices within the MAGA movement, who had recently been critical of the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files, are now rallying in his defense. The shift in sentiment followed a Wall Street Journal article about an alleged letter from Trump to Epstein, which prompted the president to file a major defamation lawsuit. This, combined with Trump's subsequent call to release grand jury testimony, has unified his base against a common media target and cooled internal backlash, with supporters framing the developments as a significant victory.</p>

          <p>President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs, according to his White House physician. The condition, described as "benign and common" in people over 70, occurs when veins struggle to return blood to the heart, causing it to pool in the legs. After a full evaluation including ultrasounds, the doctor confirmed the CVI diagnosis but found no signs of more serious issues like blood clots, declaring the president to be in "excellent health." Treatment typically involves compression and exercise.</p>

The ruling requires medical professionals to be on hand to disable the device moments before the execution drug is administered, a decision the state is expected to appeal quickly.</p>

While many of the UK's 9,000 wasp species are solitary, the social wasps that interact with humans are noticeably more abundant. Experts remind the public that despite their nuisance reputation, wasps are vital apex predators in the ecosystem, acting as natural pest controllers for gardens and farms.

For these supporters, Epstein's connections and the handling of his case are not just about one man's crimes but are seen as proof of a wider, sinister system.
