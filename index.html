          <p>The UK and the European Union have reportedly reached an agreement to reset relations following Britain's exit from the EU in 2020. The deal includes reciprocal access to fishing waters until June 2038, energy cooperation, and a security and defense partnership. Both sides will also work towards a youth mobility scheme allowing young people from the UK and EU to work, study, volunteer, or travel in each other's countries for a limited time. The agreement also explores the potential use of e-gates by UK passport holders in European airports, which could reduce long queues for British travelers.</p>

          <p>As Britain and the European Union hold their first summit since Brexit, analysts describe it less as a reunion and more as exes working together for the sake of their children. While some Britons see Brexit as a chance to control borders, others view it as an economic setback. With the war in Ukraine and a shift in US alliances, both sides are realizing they need each other more than anticipated. The summit focuses on smaller issues like fishing rights and youth mobility, while larger issues like the single market and freedom of movement remain off the table.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed in April, signaling that consumption remains a concern for the world's second-largest economy, with sales rising 5.1% year-on-year, missing analysts' estimates. However, industrial output grew 6.1% year-on-year, stronger than expected, indicating that the impact from US tariffs was not as harsh as anticipated. The urban unemployment rate in April eased to 5.1% from 5.2% in March. Despite these figures, a statistics bureau spokesperson noted that domestic demand, including consumption, still lacked momentum, and that the real estate sector remained in a period of "adjustment".</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly seeking a "one-stop shopping" deal with South Korea, bundling negotiations on trade, tariffs, and defense cost-sharing into a single comprehensive agreement. While South Korean officials have stated that defense payments are off the table, leading presidential candidates have hinted at being open to discussing a defense cost-sharing agreement. Analysts suggest that South Korea could "pay more" by investing in its forces and buying more U.S. military equipment, though such a transactional approach could damage U.S. credibility.</p>

          <p>The Ministry of Justice in the UK has announced that a "significant amount" of private data, including criminal records, has been hacked from the Legal Aid online system. The breach, dating back to 2010, may include contact details, addresses, dates of birth, national ID numbers, employment status, and financial data. The Ministry urges those who have applied for legal aid to be vigilant for suspicious activity and has taken the online services offline. Investigations are ongoing with the National Crime Agency and the National Cyber Security Centre.</p>

          <p>Domestic energy prices in the UK are forecast to decrease in July, marking the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap for a year. Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that the bill of a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall by Â£129 a year, a drop of nearly 7%. This would bring the typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit to Â£1,720, down from the current level of Â£1,849. The price cap is based on the cost of each unit of energy.</p>
