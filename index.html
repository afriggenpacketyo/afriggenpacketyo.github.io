          <p>Five people have been killed in a mass shooting at a prominent food market in Bangkok, with Thai officials confirming the suspect is also deceased. The attack took place at the Or Tor Kor Market, a location renowned for its high-quality fresh fruit and seafood. This incident highlights a concerning trend, as Thailand has experienced several other deadly shootings in recent years, including a 2023 mall attack and a 2022 childcare center tragedy. Although gun ownership is relatively high for the region, such violent events challenge the nation's sense of security.</p>

          <p>Shi Yongxin, the abbot of China's famous Shaolin Temple, is under criminal investigation for multiple serious allegations, including embezzlement and having improper relationships. Known as the "CEO monk" for transforming the ancient temple into a global commercial brand, he has now been stripped of his ordination certificate by China's Buddhist association. This is not the first time he has faced scrutiny, having been cleared of similar charges in 2015. The investigation into financial corruption, in particular, threatens to severely damage his reputation among the public.</p>

          <p>Leaders from Thailand and Cambodia have convened in Malaysia for urgent ceasefire negotiations aimed at resolving deadly border clashes. The fighting, which has killed at least 35 people and displaced over 260,000, was initiated after a landmine explosion. Hosted by the Malaysian Prime Minister, the talks are under international pressure, with the U.S. and China attending as observers. The negotiations represent a critical effort to de-escalate a rare military confrontation between members of the ASEAN regional bloc.</p>

          <p>The Royal College of Nursing in England is expected to overwhelmingly reject a 3.6% pay increase, raising the likelihood of major strike action later in the year. The union has described the offer as "grotesque," noting that it is lower than pay rises awarded to other public sector workers like doctors and teachers. While the government insists it cannot increase the headline pay offer, it remains open to talks on broader pay structure reforms. This development follows a similar rejection by the GMB union, signaling widespread discontent among NHS staff.</p>

The print was found on the underside of a clay "soul house," a model building placed in tombs during the Middle Kingdom period. Curators believe the handprint was left by the artisan who created the object while moving it to dry before firing. The find is considered exceptionally exciting as it offers a direct, personal connection to the often-anonymous craftspeople of ancient Egypt.</p>

In return, the EU has secured a lower rate than the 30% that was threatened and will open its markets to American exports at zero tariff.

          <p>Joseph Czuba, the Illinois landlord convicted of a fatal hate crime, has died in prison custody. Czuba was serving a 53-year sentence for the murder of 6-year-old Wadee Alfayoumi and the attempted murder of the boy's mother, Hanan Shaheen, in October 2023. Prosecutors proved at trial that Czuba targeted the Palestinian-American family because of their faith and in response to the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war. The brutal attack, in which the boy was stabbed 26 times, deeply affected the local community and renewed fears of anti-Muslim violence.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Dubai are conducting a widespread crackdown on illegally modified and overcrowded apartments, a move that is displacing thousands of low-wage migrant workers. The campaign was launched over fire safety concerns, particularly after a recent high-rise blaze in a building with partitioned units. For many workers earning only a few hundred dollars a month, these "jerry-rigged" spaces are the only affordable housing option. With no viable alternatives, those evicted are left in a precarious situation, struggling to find shelter in one of the world's most expensive cities.</p>

          <h2>Japanese Automakers Face Dual Threat from US Tariffs and Chinese Competition</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 00:01:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new US-Japan trade deal lowering auto tariffs to 15% offers little relief for Japanese automakers, who face a much larger threat from rising Chinese competition. While the deal provides some tariff certainty, the rate is still significantly higher than historical levels, and the industry's long-held global dominance is eroding. Chinese brands are aggressively expanding into markets once dominated by Japanese companies, such as Southeast Asia and Australia. This external pressure, combined with domestic economic challenges, creates a difficult outlook for Japan's crucial automotive sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has officially commenced construction on the Yarlung Tsangpo River hydropower project in southern Tibet, which is slated to become the most powerful dam on Earth. The groundbreaking marks the culmination of 74 years of extensive scientific research and exploration of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which began with the first state-sponsored expeditions in 1951. The massive infrastructure project represents a significant engineering and strategic achievement for Beijing, harnessing the immense power of one of the region's most important rivers after decades of planning.</p>
