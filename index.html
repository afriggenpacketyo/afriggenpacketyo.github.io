          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to nominate E.J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, as the new commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The nomination follows Trump's firing of the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, whom he accused of manipulating jobs data after a report showed slowing growth. Antoni, a contributor to the Project 2025 policy blueprint and a vocal critic of the BLS, was reportedly advocated for by former White House advisor Steve Bannon. His appointment requires confirmation by the Senate to lead the crucial government agency responsible for economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sheila Jordan, a highly respected and unique voice in jazz, has passed away at the age of 96. Known for her innovative style, she recorded the iconic album "Portrait of Sheila" in the 1960s and was honored as a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master in 2012. Despite facing challenges including racial prejudice and single motherhood, her dedication to the music of Charlie Parker shaped her life and career. Jordan's career flourished later in life, and she became a distinguished educator, continuing to record and perform well into her nineties, leaving behind a legacy of artistic integrity and resilience.</p>

Antoni, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation, has a history of publicly criticizing the agency's methodology, once calling its health insurance figures "phoney baloney." Trump stated the nomination is to ensure the release of "HONEST and ACCURATE" numbers, while critics and former BLS leaders have warned the move undermines the agency's independence.

          <p>Nigeria's military has announced that a joint air and ground operation in the northwestern state of Zamfara resulted in the deaths of more than 100 armed gang members. The operation was launched after intelligence indicated that a large group of "bandits," as they are locally known, were preparing to attack a village. These armed groups have been responsible for widespread terror, including kidnappings for ransom and imposing taxes on local communities. While the government frequently conducts such military operations, the violence has persisted, exacerbating a malnutrition crisis as farmers are driven from their land.</p>

While D.C. did see a homicide spike in 2023, total violent crime in 2024 reached a 30-year low and continues to decline this year, a trend also seen in other cities Trump has targeted, like Los Angeles and Baltimore. Experts and city officials argue that Trump's narrative ignores significant progress in crime reduction and relies on false portrayals of the city's safety. The article suggests the move is more political than a data-driven response to a crisis.</p>

          <p>Colorado is battling two massive wildfires, with over 1,000 firefighters deployed to combat the blazes under challenging conditions of gusty winds and extreme drought. The Lee fire has become the fifth largest in the state's history, burning over 130,000 acres with minimal containment. Another blaze, the Elk fire, is 30% contained. The fires have prompted evacuations, including a correctional center, and led to air quality warnings. This event is part of an explosive fire season across North America, intensified by climate change, with nearly all U.S. firefighting resources currently deployed to manage 36 large, active fires nationwide.</p>

The woman's boyfriend, Alexander McKellar, confessed to her that he and his twin brother had fatally struck Parsons in a hit-and-run and buried his body. After McKellar showed her the remote grave, she dropped the can as a marker and later alerted police. Parsons' family expressed immense gratitude, stating his body likely would never have been found otherwise. The McKellar brothers were subsequently brought to justice for the crime.</p>

The Israeli military claimed responsibility, alleging that al-Sharif was a Hamas operative, a claim Al Jazeera and al-Sharif had previously denied. The incident has been condemned by press freedom organizations, which note that at least 178 Palestinian journalists have been killed since the war began. With international media largely barred from Gaza, the burden of reporting has fallen on local journalists, who face extreme danger. Al Jazeera described the strike as a "targeted assassination" of one of the last remaining voices reporting from within the territory.</p>

The article notes a telling gaffe where Trump mistakenly said he was "going to Russia," revealing how central Putin is to his narrative.

The analysis confirms that while the city's homicide rate spiked in 2023, it was not a record high, and overall violent crime has been on a significant downward trend, hitting a 30-year low in 2024. Figures from the city's police department show violent crime is down 26% this year compared to the same period in 2024.

Previously, Trump had echoed concerns about Tan's ties to China and declared him "highly CONFLICTED."

The move will result in more federal officers on patrol and raises concerns about police accountability, given Trump's rhetoric.

          <p>Residents of Paterson, New Jersey, are facing a fourth day of little to no water service after a 140-year-old water main broke on Friday. The outage has left thousands with extremely low pressure and forced many to rely on bottled water and portable public showers and toilets.

          <p>The government of Niger has launched an investigation into the sale of the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth, which recently sold for over $5 million at a Sotheby's auction. Officials in the West African nation, where the 54-pound meteorite was discovered, claim it may have been smuggled out of the country and are treating the case as possible "illicit international trafficking." Sotheby's maintains that the rock was exported in line with all relevant international procedures. The dispute highlights the growing and complex issue of cultural and natural heritage ownership, as rare minerals discovered in countries like Niger are sold on the international market.</p>

          <p>Residents of Washington D.C. are divided over President Trump's decision to federalize the city's police force and deploy the National Guard. While some activists and residents in safer neighborhoods view the move as a political stunt, "red meat" for his base that will not improve safety, others in areas with higher crime rates express a desperate desire for any action that might make their streets safer. The article captures this dichotomy, contrasting protesters who fear an authoritarian power grab with long-time residents who feel their safety concerns have been ignored by local officials. The differing perspectives highlight the complex relationship between crime perception, data, and political intervention in the city.</p>

He described the summit as a "feel-out meeting" and said he would update European leaders and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy afterward.

          <p>Education Secretary Linda McMahon has embarked on a 50-state tour to advocate for the Trump administration's goal of dismantling the U.S. Department of Education. The tour promotes returning education policy and funding to the states, with McMahon highlighting Louisiana's recent success in improving literacy as a model. The administration began downsizing the department after an executive order in March, a move that faces legal and congressional challenges. Democrats and critics argue that abolishing the department would create chaos for students who rely on federal programs, particularly the 7.5 million students with disabilities who receive supplemental grants.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis piece characterizes President Trump's federalization of Washington D.C. law enforcement as a "farcical" and performative act of bullying rather than a serious response to a crisis. The author argues that D.C.'s unique legal status as a federal enclave makes it a uniquely soft target for a president seeking to project strength without facing the legal and political pushback possible from a state governor. The article notes the deployment appears absurd on the ground, with federal agents patrolling tourist areas far from crime hotbeds. It concludes that while the move is a disaster for the city's vulnerable populations, it's more an admission of weakness than a prelude to a full authoritarian takeover.</p>
