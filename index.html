          <p>A Michigan Wolverines kicker missed a crucial 32-yard field goal against the Oklahoma Sooners, moments after an ESPN announcer praised his accuracy, leading to speculation of an "announcer's jinx." This incident contributed to Michigan's 24-13 defeat on Saturday night, adding to their troubles. The team struggled overall, with Oklahoma's quarterback John Mateer leading a strong offensive performance, while Michigan's freshman phenom Bryce Underwood had a difficult game. The Wolverines' loss dropped their season record to 1-1, highlighting areas for improvement.</p>

          <p>Russia's overnight strikes across Ukraine proved deadly, with at least two people, including a one-year-old child, killed and several injured in cities like Kyiv, Odesa, and Kharkiv. Falling debris from downed drones ignited fires in multiple residential buildings in the capital. Concurrently, Ukrainian drones sparked a fire at an oil refinery in Russia's Krasnodar region, underscoring the reciprocal nature of the conflict. Poland scrambled fighter jets to safeguard its airspace as the war rages on, with diplomatic peace efforts remaining stalled amidst deliberate targeting of civilian areas.</p>

          <p>A collaborative US-China research team has developed an innovative method to launch millimetre-scale robots by harnessing the rapid energy release from collapsing vapor bubbles. This breakthrough involves rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles that then violently collapse. The technique, detailed in the journal Science, allows scientists to precisely control how and where these tiny jumpers launch from a wet surface, and even enables them to swim, showcasing a novel application for micro-robotics.</p>

          <p>The United States Men's National Team experienced a disappointing 2-0 defeat against South Korea in a friendly match, raising "alarm bells" just months before hosting the World Cup. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino's experimental roster displayed significant defensive communication issues and failed to capitalize on scoring opportunities throughout the game. Despite Pochettino's assurances that the team will be ready for the World Cup, the lackluster performance has intensified concerns about the team's form and readiness for the global stage, casting a shadow on their preparations.</p>

          <p>Postal traffic into the United States has plummeted by over 80% following the Trump administration's decision to end a "de minimis exemption" for low-cost imports.

Eighty-eight countries have suspended some or all postal services to the US due to the inability of carriers to collect new customs duties, impacting international trade and supply chains.
