          <p>Afghan refugees in Iran are facing increased danger and uncertainty as the conflict between Iran and Israel intensifies. The fighting is exacerbating already dire conditions in Afghanistan, with prices for Iranian-imported goods surging, putting its frail economy under further strain. Millions of Afghan refugees in Iran, who once fled in search of safety and a better life, are now facing renewed uncertainty and pressure from officials as the armed conflict escalates. Returning to Afghanistan is not a viable option for most Afghan refugees, who fear persecution under the Taliban regime.</p>

          <p>Following an Iranian missile strike that hit the Soroka Medical Center in southern Israel and other residential buildings near Tel Aviv, Israeli leaders have vowed intensified attacks on Iranian military and government targets. Israel's defense chief accused Iran of war crimes and said Ayatollah Ali Khamenei would be held accountable. The article details the extent of the damage to the hospital and other buildings, as well as the number of people wounded in the attacks. Israel also warned of a new threat of cluster bombs fired by Iran, launching a public awareness campaign to educate citizens on how to respond to unexploded bombs. The escalation occurs as President Trump considers direct U.S. involvement in Israel's efforts to dismantle Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erick made landfall in Mexico's western state of Oaxaca early Thursday as a Category 3 storm, with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph. The storm was downgraded slightly before making landfall, from a powerful Category 4 to a Category 3. While slightly reduced in power, Erick is still considered a major hurricane as a Category 3, which can carry winds of up to 129 mph (210 kph). Erick is expected to rapidly weaken as it crashes into the coastal mountains of southern Mexico, and the system is likely to dissipate late Thursday or early Friday, the hurricane center said.</p>

          <p>Double the number of households in Britain will get £150 off their energy bills this winter as the government changes the rules on who qualifies for the Warm Home Discount. The qualification about property size, type and home energy score is being scrapped. As a result this winter 2.7 million more homes will get this extra energy bill help, including almost a million households with children. The bill for expanding the Warm Home Discount will be paid by energy companies and could be passed on through the standing charge, so it is possible all customers will see a slight increase in bills in the autumn to cover this announcement.

The team aims to raise £50,000 for Head Up, a mental health charity benefiting the British armed forces community.

          <p>An analysis suggests that SiriusXM Holdings is poised to outperform the S&P 500 over the next five years. The satellite radio leader's subscriber base peaked in 2019 and isn't heading in the right direction, with a decrease of about 303,000 self-pay subscribers in the first quarter of 2025 alone. Profitability is also heading in the wrong direction, with free cash slow down by about 33% over the past two full years. The first phase of SiriusXM's turnaround plan was mainly focused on cost reduction, and after a couple of years, the company has done a great job in this area. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amber heat health alerts are in place across the whole of England with temperatures likely to exceed 30C for the first time this year. The alerts, which will last until 09:00 BST on Monday, come as an expected heatwave approaches much of the country. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said increased pressures on health and social care services were likely, including increased demand. Temperatures will widely be between 27C and 30C on Thursday across east Wales, the Midlands, and East and South East England with a few locations around Greater London and the home counties reaching 31C.</p>

          <p>Samsung is planning to launch a thinner version of its flagship foldable smartphone, the Galaxy Z Fold6, to compete with Chinese rivals like Honor and Oppo, who have released thinner and lighter devices. Slimness has become a critical factor for foldable phones, as consumers are less willing to compromise on thickness for the larger screen. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also said Apple plans to make a folding iPhone starting next year. Despite advances, the market for foldable devices remains small, accounting for just 2% of the overall smartphone market this year.</p>

The Bank hinted at further interest rate cuts, which could come as soon as August. Governor Andrew Bailey said interest rates "remain on a gradual downward path", but warned: "The world is highly unpredictable." There are concerns that the conflict between Israel and Iran, a major oil producer, could send energy costs higher and drive overall prices up, which would impact further rate decisions.

He is now pivoting to a backup plan, developing "Scientist AI" to block harmful actions by other AIs. Scientist AI would calculate the probability that an AI's action would cause harm and block it if the risk is too high, acting as a guardrail for AI systems.</p>

Meanwhile, Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi has confirmed that he will hold talks about the escalation of their nuclear programme with his counterparts from the UK, France and Germany and insisted his country was committed to diplomacy.</p>

          <p>Israel launched airstrikes on Iran's Arak heavy water reactor, following attacks on other Iranian nuclear sites, raising concerns about plutonium production. The Arak reactor was part of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, with Iran agreeing to redesign the facility to alleviate proliferation concerns. The U.N. nuclear watchdog noted that since it was not in operation and contained no nuclear material, there was no danger to the public after the strike from any “radiological effects.” Israel’s military said its fighter jets targeted the Arak facility and its reactor core seal to halt it from being used to produce plutonium.</p>
