          <h2>NHS to Offer Free Chickenpox Vaccine to Young Children in England and Wales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 03:30:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starting next January, the NHS in England and Wales will introduce a free chickenpox vaccine for all young children, given in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab. This initiative aims to safeguard youngsters from severe, albeit rare, complications of the varicella virus, and alleviate the financial burden on parents taking time off work. The Department of Health and Social Care estimates chickenpox causes £24 million in lost income and productivity annually in the UK. Health minister Stephen Kinnock highlighted the importance of protecting children's health and supporting working families. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommended the vaccine's introduction in November 2023, with experts predicting a dramatic reduction in overall chickenpox cases. This brings the UK in line with other countries like the US, which introduced the jab decades ago.</p>

          <p>Scottish Labour MSP Colin Smyth's Holyrood pass has been deactivated following reports he allegedly placed a camera in a Scottish Parliament toilet. Smyth was previously suspended by Labour after being charged with possessing indecent images of children and now faces a further police charge concerning the camera allegations. The parliament's chief executive cited the ongoing criminal investigation as the reason for deactivating his pass. Scottish Labour confirmed swift action was taken upon learning of the serious allegations, but cannot comment further due to legal proceedings. The incident has caused significant distress among Holyrood staff, who have been offered confidential support services.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark has significantly cut its 2025 annual growth forecast from 3% to 1.4%, primarily attributing the revision to weaker expectations for pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk. The economy ministry noted a fall in Denmark's U.S. exports in early 2025, influenced by inventory build-up, increased competition in the weight loss drug market where Novo Nordisk's market share has declined, and the impact of generic medicines. Additionally, the threat of U.S. tariffs on Europe's pharmaceutical sector, despite a recent EU-U.S. trade deal, also weighed on the forecast. Despite this adjustment, the ministry emphasized that Denmark's economy remains strong overall, with high employment and projected inflation below 2%. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government did not conduct its own cost analysis for the largest reorganization of English councils in decades, instead relying on a 2020 report from the County Council Network (CCN). Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner had claimed billions could be saved by merging councils in 21 areas. However, the CCN has since revised its analysis, now suggesting the reorganization might yield no savings and could even incur costs in some scenarios, particularly if multiple smaller unitary authorities are created. The government maintains the changes will improve services and save taxpayer money, despite the lack of independent verification and the CCN's updated findings.</p>

Fearnley, still early in his professional career, competed hard but was ultimately outplayed by Zverev's consistency, acknowledging his own struggles with capitalising on opportunities and hitting 12 double faults. He noted that top players often employ such mind games, a lesson he previously encountered with Novak Djokovic. Despite the defeat, Fearnley expressed optimism about his development, particularly his serve, believing he will overcome these challenges with continued experience in high-pressure environments.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur is reportedly on the verge of securing RB Leipzig attacker Xavi Simons for 60 million euros (£51.8 million). The 22-year-old Netherlands international has already completed his medical in England, with an agreement in principle between the clubs expected to be finalized within the next 24 hours. This move follows Chelsea's earlier interest in Simons, though they are now pursuing a £40 million deal for Manchester United's Alejandro Garnacho. Simons is poised to become one of Tottenham's significant summer signings, joining Joao Palhinha and Mohammed Kudus, after the club's previous attempts to sign other attacking midfielders did not materialize.</p>

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro stated the change would save American lives and generate up to $10 billion annually in tariff revenues.

          <p>Irish rap trio Kneecap is set to play a high-energy homecoming gig in Belfast, eight months after their last performance, following a year marked by political controversy and police investigations. The band, known for rapping in English and Irish, has faced scrutiny for their vocal pro-Palestinian stance and past comments, including one about MPs that led to a police probe. One member recently appeared in court on a terrorism offense charge, which he denies. Despite cancellations and a canceled US tour due to legal proximity, fans and fellow artists support their anti-establishment message, valuing their challenge to the status quo.</p>

          <p>West Mercia Police are investigating a new report of child sexual assault at Berrow Wood School, where numerous former staff have already been convicted for abusing pupils between 1968 and 1991. The BBC understands this latest report concerns at least 14 former staff members, some of whom are still alive. Many boys with troubled backgrounds were sent to the reform school, enduring beatings and sexual assault. Survivors, like Chris Brosnan, who was identified by a laundry number, describe lasting trauma and seek accountability from the government, which recently halted a proposed redress scheme for child sexual assault survivors.</p>

          <p>Russia's state space agency Roscosmos plans its first test launch of the Soyuz-5 rocket in December, aiming for full operational status by 2028. The Soyuz-5, a medium-class launch vehicle, is seen as a reincarnation of the Zenit-2 rocket, equipped with powerful RD-171MV engines. This launch is a significant undertaking for Roscosmos, which has faced substantial funding shortages and lost international partnerships since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The agency has shifted launch plans to Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome, highlighting its efforts to maintain its space program despite geopolitical and financial hurdles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has appointed Jim O'Neill, deputy to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the new director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), replacing Susan Monarez after just one month. Monarez's lawyers allege her illegal sacking was due to her refusal to "rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives," a claim the White House countered by stating she was "not aligned with the president's agenda." This leadership change follows the resignations of several senior CDC officials, citing frustration over vaccine policies and the "weaponizing of public health" under Kennedy's influence, raising significant concerns among health experts.</p>

          <p>New Orleans and the Gulf Coast region are commemorating the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which made landfall on August 29, 2005. This historic storm resulted in nearly 1,400 deaths and remains the costliest in U.S. history, with damages estimated at around $200 billion in today's currency. The predominantly Black community of the Lower 9th Ward, known for its high rate of multi-generational homeownership, suffered immense devastation as multiple levee breaches completely inundated the area, destroying thousands of homes and claiming many lives. The anniversary serves as a poignant moment to reflect on the catastrophic impact and the long journey of recovery and rebuilding undertaken by the resilient communities affected.</p>

          <p>New Zealand Police have released CCTV footage believed to show Thomas Callam Phillips, a fugitive father, and one of his children, nearly four years after he disappeared with his three children into the remote wilderness. The footage, captured at 2 a.m. outside a retail store, shows two masked individuals loading groceries onto a quadbike shortly before a burglary where only milk was taken. Police suspect this incident could indicate a disruption in the support Phillips has been receiving. Authorities have offered a NZ$80,000 reward for information and are focused on the children's wellbeing, who have been living off-grid.</p>

          <p>Tencent Holdings is pursuing "aggressive" growth in the international cloud computing market, fueled by increasing overseas demand for Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) models. Senior executive vice-president Dowson Tong Tao-sang, CEO of Tencent's Cloud and Smart Industries Group (CSIG), noted that overseas cloud operations have been the company's fastest-expanding segment, achieving high double-digit growth. Tong emphasized significant opportunities to provide Chinese open-source AI models to international clients, particularly as markets seek to host large language models within their own regions. This strategic focus reflects Tencent's efforts to keep pace with rapid AI developments and intensify competition among tech giants.</p>

This new referral follows an earlier one concerning other properties, which led to a DOJ investigation.
