          <p>Catastrophic flash flooding in Kerr County, Texas, has resulted in at least 59 fatalities, including 38 adults and 21 children. The disaster, triggered by heavy rains along the Guadalupe River, inundated several areas and prompted a large-scale emergency response. Officials have confirmed that search and rescue operations are still ongoing for missing individuals, among them campers and a counselor from Camp Mystic. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has described the event as an "extraordinary catastrophe," while emergency responders have rescued over 850 people, many of whom were found clinging to trees to survive.</p>

          <p>During a post-match interview at Wimbledon, American tennis player Ben Shelton made a public plea for his sister to get more time off from her job at Morgan Stanley. He credited his sister, Emma, as his "lucky charm" for his successful run in the tournament and asked for help in convincing her employer to let her stay. The heartwarming request was successful, as Shelton later confirmed in a social media video that his sister's request for additional paid time off was approved. Shelton has advanced to the fourth round of the tournament without dropping a set.</p>

          <p>Indirect ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas are set to resume in Doha, Qatar, even as Israeli military operations continue across the Gaza Strip. Recent Israeli airstrikes have reportedly killed at least 38 Palestinians, with the military stating it has targeted over 100 Hamas sites in the last day. The current U.S.-led proposal involves an initial 60-day truce, a partial hostage release, and increased humanitarian aid, but talks have previously stalled over Hamas's demand for a permanent end to the war. Prime Minister Netanyahu's office confirmed an Israeli delegation was sent, but he has called Hamas's latest demands "unacceptable."</p>

          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal was halted due to a failure in the new electronic line-calling system. The system failed to make an audio call on a crucial point when a shot from Kartal landed out, leading the chair umpire to order the point replayed. Pavlyuchenkova, who would have won the point, expressed frustration, claiming a game was "stolen" from her. The All England Club attributed the incident to operator error and confirmed the umpire followed the correct procedure for when the system is unable to track a point.</p>

          <p>Military experts writing in the PLA Daily have suggested that the Chinese military needs to undergo structural reforms to effectively counter modern drone threats. They propose the creation of specialized counter-drone combat units capable of rapid responses, viewing it as a long-term objective. In the interim, the experts recommend integrating advanced counter-drone capabilities into existing units, such as upgrading electronic warfare teams with AI-driven analysis and mobile jamming technologies. This focus reflects the growing importance of unmanned aerial vehicles in recent global conflicts, including in Ukraine and the Middle East.</p>

          <p>A new biography by Pulitzer Prize-winner Ron Chernow delves into the complex life of Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain. The article explores how Twain's identity as "the American" was shaped by both the idyllic adventures that inspired his novels and a persistent fear of poverty that fueled his adult life. Chernow's book examines how Twain's sardonic humor was rooted in personal pain and how his work continues to resonate with modern themes of politics, race, and class. Despite his fame, Twain's life was marked by ill-fated investments, yet his writing remains a vital and widely read part of American culture.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has described the White House's efforts to eliminate federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as "shortsighted" and "misguided." The administration has targeted PBS and NPR, claiming they spread "radical, woke propaganda." Burns argues that such cuts are foolhardy, as public media primarily serves rural areas and provides essential services like children's programming, educational content, and emergency information. He likened PBS to an application of the Declaration of Independence to the media world, emphasizing its "bottom-up" structure that represents all Americans and allows for in-depth projects not feasible elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after its release, a new report looks back on the notoriously difficult production of Steven Spielberg's classic film "Jaws." Shot on the open seas of the Atlantic, the production was plagued by a malfunctioning mechanical shark, a ballooning budget, and a schedule that tripled in length. Actor Richard Dreyfuss recalls that the cast and crew initially believed the film would be a failure. However, the 27-year-old Spielberg turned these challenges into cinematic opportunities, creating a film that ushered in the era of the summer blockbuster and forever changed Hollywood, becoming the highest-grossing movie of its time.</p>

Researchers found 18 structures, including temples and residential complexes, along with ceremonial objects and sculptures. The site's strategic location and its connection to the Caral society, which was decimated by climate change, make it a significant find for understanding the region's ancient history.</p>

Findings include cases of gang sexual assaults, victims found tied to trees, and sexual assault in captivity.

Proposed in 1865, it was conceived as a tribute to the end of slavery in the United States, with the statue depicted standing on broken chains and shackles. It was poet Emma Lazarus who, in her 1883 sonnet "The New Colossus," reimagined the statue as a "mother of exiles" welcoming immigrants. This new meaning gained prominence with the opening of Ellis Island in 1892 and was later solidified by President John F. Kennedy's popularization of the phrase "a nation of immigrants."</p>

The official, Ignacio Alejandro Roaro, was attending the game at a local sports center filled with families and children when the attack occurred. The city council condemned the killing as a "treacherous, despicable, and cowardly attack." The state of Guanajuato, while an industrial hub, is Mexico's most violent state due to turf wars between rival drug cartels, including the Santa Rosa de Lima gang and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S.</p>

          <p>The head of London's Metropolitan Police, Sir Mark Rowley, has stated that football clubs should contribute to the £70 million annual cost of policing their matches in the UK. In an interview, the commissioner questioned why event organizers who require a police presence do not pay for it, advocating for a "polluter pays approach." The comments were made as Sir Mark called for a radical reform of UK policing, suggesting the current 43-force model in England and Wales be consolidated into 12 to 15 larger forces to better cope with modern demands and strained funding. Previous suggestions to make clubs pay have been criticized by sports bodies.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Bitcoin's adoption rate highlights a fundamental debate over its purpose, with only about 5% of the population owning the cryptocurrency. The article contrasts the original vision of Bitcoin as "peer-to-peer electronic cash" with its current primary use as a "digital gold" or a store of value. Proponents argue that, like gold, widespread ownership isn't necessary for it to be a valuable asset, while critics view it as a speculative collectible with no underlying cash flows. The network's low transaction capacity also poses a practical barrier to its use as a daily currency, leaving its future dependent on developing genuine utility beyond speculation.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece examines China's renewed policy focus on boosting domestic consumption to rebalance its economy away from exports. The author notes that this pivot is crucial amid faltering global demand and geopolitical tensions, but faces significant challenges. Chinese households maintain high savings rates due to an inadequate social safety net and concerns about healthcare, education, and retirement costs. While disposable income has risen, consumer confidence has not fully recovered, as indicated by a recent decline in imports. The article concludes that for the consumption-driven growth model to succeed, it must be supported by substantial structural reforms to address these underlying issues.</p>

          <p>A merchant vessel traveling in the Red Sea was attacked and set on fire on Sunday, reportedly after being struck by projectiles and what may have been bomb-carrying drone boats. According to maritime security firms, the ship came under attack from armed men in multiple small boats about 60 miles southwest of Hodeida, Yemen. The vessel's armed security team returned fire, but the ship was later hit and set ablaze. While there was no immediate claim of responsibility, suspicion has fallen on Yemen's Houthi rebels, who have previously launched similar attacks on shipping in the vital trade corridor.</p>

The lion, named Zeus, escaped from the Land of Lions park early Sunday and attacked the farmer, who was sleeping outdoors after watering his fields. The man fought off the animal until police arrived and scared it away by firing shots into the air; the lion was later found and killed. The farmer was hospitalized with wounds to his head, shoulder, and legs. An investigation has been launched into how the animal managed to escape its enclosure.</p>

          <p>Russia has become the first country to officially recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, a move welcomed by the Taliban's foreign minister as the start of a "new phase of positive relations." Until now, no nation had formally recognized the radical Islamist group, which returned to power in 2021. Experts suggest Russia's decision is driven by economic interests, including the potential for Afghanistan to serve as a trade hub with Asia, and a desire to take a leading role among autocratic states. The move has raised concerns among human rights activists, who fear it normalizes the Taliban's repressive policies, particularly against women.</p>

          <p>An analysis piece examines President Trump's significant expansion of presidential power, raising concerns among critics about the erosion of democratic norms and institutional guardrails. The article points to a series of unilateral actions, including ordering a military strike on Iran without congressional approval, imposing tariffs by declaring a national emergency, and taking control of a state's National Guard. These actions, combined with a compliant Congress and attacks on the judiciary, are seen as undermining the separation of powers. Experts warn that this trend, while not starting with Trump, could set dangerous precedents for the authority of future presidents.</p>

The piece explores how this successful storyline blurred the lines between performance and reality for audiences, creating a powerful cultural moment. It also reflects on the potential connection between the rise of villainous anti-heroes in wrestling and the later success of Donald Trump's political persona, suggesting wrestling fans were uniquely prepared for the political shifts to come.</p>

          <p>Five months into President Trump's second term, the U.S. economy has remained surprisingly stable, defying both the administration's promises of a "golden age" and critics' predictions of an "economic catastrophe." Key indicators like unemployment and inflation have seen little change, and while GDP growth has slowed, it has not collapsed. The article argues that Trump's more extreme tariff policies were quickly moderated, preventing a major trade war, while his other economic policies have had a limited short-term impact. The economy is described as simply "okay," which may be a political problem for a president whose supporters expect more dramatic results. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new animated film, "The King of Kings," based on a Charles Dickens book about the life of Jesus, has become a box office success, particularly among Christian audiences. The movie, featuring a star-studded voice cast, aims for broad appeal by telling the biblical story through a historical lens and avoiding overt political messaging. However, this review argues that despite its aspirations, the film's on-the-nose evangelism and often awkward attempts at humor make it unlikely to resonate with viewers who are not already believers. The article contrasts it with more nuanced biblical adaptations like "The Prince of Egypt," suggesting the film is a missed opportunity for the genre.</p>

The recent victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York's mayoral primary is seen as a key example of this energy. While the movement lacks a single, unified policy platform, it is broadly focused on working-class affordability issues and a change in leadership from figures like Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer.</p>
