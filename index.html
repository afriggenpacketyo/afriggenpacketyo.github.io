          <p>Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier is one of six individuals charged in connection with an illegal gambling operation that allegedly used inside information for unlawful NBA wagers. The charges were announced by the FBI, adding another layer to the league's recent struggles with gambling-related integrity issues. This case follows the lifetime ban of former Toronto Raptors player Jontay Porter, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud for betting on his team to lose and sharing confidential information with gamblers, highlighting a growing concern for professional sports leagues.</p>

          <p>A Metropolitan Police officer, PC Philip Neilson, has been dismissed with immediate effect for gross misconduct after a BBC Panorama investigation recorded him making highly racist and discriminatory remarks. The panel upheld three allegations, including comments about an "invasion" of "scum" from the Middle East and suggesting unlawful violence against migrants. Neilson is the first of ten current or former officers to face accelerated misconduct hearings resulting from the undercover report, with the panel describing his conduct as an "utter disgrace" that caused significant reputational harm.</p>

          <p>Data from analytics firm Cotality indicates that rent growth for single-family homes in the U.S. has hit its lowest point in 15 years, with just a 1.4% annual increase in August. This slowdown continues a trend seen in the latter half of the year, with significant regional differences; Chicago saw robust growth while Dallas experienced a decline. The cooling trend also extends to multifamily apartments, where a construction boom has increased supply and pushed the national vacancy rate to a record high, providing some relief to renters.

          <p>The Colorado River is at a breaking point due to prolonged drought and systematic overuse, jeopardizing water and power supplies for 40 million people across seven states and Mexico. Critically low levels in its largest reservoirs, Lakes Mead and Powell, have intensified high-stakes negotiations between Upper and Lower Basin states over future water-sharing agreements. Experts emphasize that the crisis is driven by a warming climate and an inability to reduce consumption, with the vast majority of water being used for agriculture, particularly for water-intensive cattle-feed crops like alfalfa.</p>

          <p>Shares in Sweden's Volvo Cars surged by as much as 41%, putting the stock on track for its best trading day ever after the company announced third-quarter profits that far exceeded analysts' expectations. The automaker, owned by China's Geely Holding, attributed the strong results to its ongoing cost-saving initiatives and certain one-off financial items, which helped boost its operating margin. Despite the stellar quarter, Volvo's leadership cautioned that the short-term market outlook remains challenging due to macroeconomic pressures and price competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A potentially disruptive strike on Broadway has been averted after the musicians' union, AFM Local 802, reached a tentative three-year labor agreement with producers. The deal, which includes increases in wages and health fund contributions, was secured just before a strike deadline that would have silenced nearly two dozen musicals. This resolution follows a similar agreement recently made with the Actors' Equity Association, settling labor tensions during a period of record-breaking box office success for the theater industry.</p>

          <p>A proposal in Tallahassee, Florida, to sell a city-owned golf course to a private country club has ignited public fury because the property contains the unmarked graves of enslaved people from a former plantation. Archaeologists have identified dozens of potential burial sites on the land, but a memorial promised by the city four years ago has never been built.
