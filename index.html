          <p>A New York jury found music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs guilty of two prostitution-related charges but acquitted him of more severe racketeering and sex trafficking counts. Following the verdict, the judge denied his request for bail, ordering him to remain in custody pending his sentencing, which is tentatively set for October. Prosecutors argued Combs remains a flight risk and has shown no remorse, while his defense team asserted he is a "model prisoner" and that the verdict was a major victory.</p>

          <p>Following recent U.S. and Israeli military strikes on its nuclear facilities, Iran has passed a law to halt cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), raising concerns among non-proliferation experts. This move prevents independent verification of its nuclear program, potentially allowing Iran to rebuild in secret. Some analysts worry this could be a "fork-in-the-road" moment, possibly leading Tehran to withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty and pursue a more aggressive, clandestine path toward nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, a former criminal justice doctoral student, pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary in the 2022 slayings of four University of Idaho students. The plea deal allows him to avoid the death penalty, instead facing four consecutive life sentences without parole. In court, Kohberger affirmed his guilt, bringing an emotional reaction from the victims' families, who have expressed mixed feelings about the agreement, which provides legal finality but avoids a public trial.</p>

          <p>A coalition of former federal health officials has warned that proposed fiscal year 2026 budget cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could have severe negative health consequences. The proposal would slash the CDC's budget by over 50%, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion, deeply impacting state and local health departments that rely on federal funding. Experts predict these cuts to chronic disease prevention, HIV prevention, and injury prevention programs will lead to Americans being sicker and an increase in preventable deaths.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the apparent contradiction between Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s stated mission to "make America healthy again" and his support for a bill that would significantly cut Medicaid. The legislation is projected to remove nearly 12 million people from the health insurance program, which serves many of the nation's sickest and lowest-income citizens. While Kennedy argues for shrinking the program to focus on the "most vulnerable," critics and medical groups warn that limiting access to care will directly undermine public health.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Planned Parenthood, Alexis McGill Johnson, has warned that a provision in the Republican-led budget bill could be "existential" for the organization. The bill would ban Medicaid from reimbursing non-profits that provide abortions, potentially stripping Planned Parenthood of $700 million in federal funding. This could force the closure of nearly 200 health centers, primarily in blue states, and jeopardize care for over 1.1 million patients.
