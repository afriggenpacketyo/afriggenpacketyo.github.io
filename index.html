            <p>Sarah Rehak, a nurse at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, ran the Boston Marathon to support the hospital that aided her father's recovery from a traumatic brain injury sustained in a car accident. Inspired by the care her father received, Sarah changed her career path to become a nurse and now works on the same brain injury floor where he was treated. She shares her family's story with patients to offer hope and optimism during their recovery, and her father cheered her on at Mile 16 of the marathon. This story exemplifies the power of compassionate care and the impact it can have on both patients and their families.</p>

            <p>Google has lost a significant antitrust case, with a federal judge ruling that the company illegally maintained a monopoly in the online advertising market.

This ruling comes amid growing scrutiny of Big Tech companies and their market power, with public sentiment increasingly favoring regulation. While breaking up large companies is challenging, this case could mark a turning point in how tech giants are held accountable for anti-competitive practices.</p>

However, by the end of the first quarter, Brazil regained a $700 million trade surplus with China.

            <p>Survivors of the Eaton fire protested State Farm's handling of insurance claims, alleging delays and denials that have left victims in financial distress. They urged the California Insurance Commissioner to investigate State Farm's practices. The protest coincided with State Farm's request for a 17% emergency rate hike, which victims view as a betrayal. Victims described being unable to return to contaminated homes and facing lowball offers from inexperienced adjusters. Consumer advocates argue that State Farm has not justified the rate increase.</p>

            <p>A US judge has ruled that Google possesses an illegal monopoly in online advertising technology. The US Department of Justice and 17 states sued Google, alleging the company illegally dominated the technology that determines which ads are placed online and where. Google intends to appeal the decision. The ruling marks Google's second antitrust loss in a year, following a previous ruling that it held a monopoly on online search. Regulators claim Google has repeatedly used its market power to self-preference its own products.</p>
