          <p>The United States has lifted its export restrictions on crucial chip-design software for China, according to announcements from semiconductor software firms Synopsys and Cadence. Both California-based companies confirmed they are working to restore access for their Chinese customers after the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security reversed the ban. The original restrictions, implemented in May, had required these firms and others like Siemens EDA to obtain special licenses for exporting their products to China. This policy change signals a potential de-escalation in the ongoing technology trade tensions between the two nations.</p>

This diplomatic shift follows Armenia's dissatisfaction with Russia's lack of intervention in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war and subsequent conflicts with Azerbaijan.

          <p>House Republicans are struggling to secure enough votes to pass President Trump's signature domestic policy legislation, facing resistance from both moderate and conservative members. A crucial procedural vote was held late Wednesday as leadership scrambled to unify the party and meet a self-imposed July 4 deadline. The bill, which passed narrowly in the Senate, includes extensive tax cuts and increased spending on border security and defense, but changes made by the Senate have alienated some House members. The outcome remains uncertain as GOP leaders can only afford a few defections.</p>

          <p>A large fire and several powerful explosions have destroyed a fireworks warehouse in Yolo County, Northern California, leaving seven people unaccounted for.

Two individuals were treated for injuries, but officials have not confirmed the status of the seven missing people, some of whom were reportedly working at the facility. The company, which has an active license for fireworks, released a statement expressing concern for those affected and is cooperating with the investigation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's major tax and spending bill appeared on the verge of failure in the House late Wednesday, as Republican leaders could not secure the necessary votes for a key procedural motion. With four Republicans voting no after an hour, the bill's advancement was stalled, highlighting deep divisions within the party over the Senate's version of the legislation. Both conservative hardliners and moderates have expressed strong opposition to changes made in the upper chamber, particularly regarding the depth of Medicaid cuts. The setback jeopardizes the administration's goal of passing the bill before the July 4 holiday.</p>

          <p>A federal jury found music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs guilty on two counts of transporting individuals for prostitution but acquitted him of the more severe charges of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy.

Combs, who will be sentenced in October, faces a maximum of 10 years in prison for each conviction.

          <p>Amid a contentious vote on a major domestic spending bill with a slim Republican majority, the possibility of a tie vote has drawn attention to House rules. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House of Representatives has no such mechanism. According to official House procedure, if a vote on any question or motion results in a tie, the measure is considered to have failed. This rule underscores the high stakes for party leadership when managing a narrow majority, as every single vote becomes critical to passing legislation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked a Trump administration policy that broadly restricted migrants who cross the southern border from being able to seek asylum. In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss stated that the president does not have the authority to unilaterally create an "alternative immigration system" that supplants laws passed by Congress. The executive order, issued in January, had suspended asylum access based on the declaration of an "invasion." The judge's decision has been stayed for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire is burning out of control in eastern Crete, Greece, forcing the evacuation of approximately 1,500 people from homes and tourist accommodations. The blaze, which started Wednesday near Ierapetra, has been fanned by strong winds, spreading over a 6km front and destroying some properties in the settlement of Agia Fotia. Authorities have deployed over 150 firefighters and multiple helicopters to combat the fire, which is burning through rugged, forested terrain. The incident is part of a broader pattern of extreme heat and wildfires affecting Europe.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly called for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to resign "immediately," escalating his long-running criticism of the central bank's leader. Trump, who appointed Powell during his first term, has repeatedly attacked him for not cutting interest rates more aggressively to stimulate the economy. The demand came after Powell suggested that the Fed would have already cut rates if not for the economic impact of the Trump administration's tariff policies. The president's ability to remove a Fed chair is legally questionable, as they are typically protected to ensure the bank's independence.</p>

          <p>An official inspection has found that historical child grooming investigations in Manchester were severely hampered because the city council provided heavily redacted evidence to the police. The report from His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) noted some documents had only a few words visible, making them impossible to use. The delays particularly affected two major operations investigating child sexual exploitation. Manchester City Council defended its actions, citing complex data-sharing rules, but a new, more efficient protocol for sharing unredacted evidence has since been established.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology suggests that a specific type of hormone therapy for menopause symptoms could elevate the risk of breast cancer for some women. The research found that for women under 55 with a uterus, a combination of estrogen and progestin was associated with a slightly increased risk. Conversely, for women without a uterus who can take estrogen alone, the treatment was found to reduce the risk. This evolving science highlights the importance of personalized medical advice, as the type and timing of hormone therapy are crucial factors in its safety and effectiveness.</p>

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study reveals that Donald Trump secured nearly half (48%) of the Latino vote in the 2024 presidential election, a significant increase from his 36% share in 2020. Political experts suggest this rightward shift is not necessarily ideological but reflects a growing populist sentiment within the community. Analysts point to disillusionment with the Democratic party's economic messaging and its progressive stance on immigration as key drivers. The findings challenge long-held assumptions about the Latino electorate and signal a dynamic and evolving political landscape that both parties have struggled to understand.</p>
