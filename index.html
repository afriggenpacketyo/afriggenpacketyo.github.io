          <p>President Trump stated he has 'no intention of firing' Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, despite previously criticizing him. Trump nominated Powell to lead the Fed during his first term in the White House. Trump also expressed optimism about improving trade relations with China, suggesting tariffs could be reduced if a deal is reached. These remarks followed concerns that pressure on Powell to lower interest rates could cause prices to rise, particularly with existing trade tariffs. The International Monetary Fund downgraded the US economic growth forecast due to tariff-related uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Six leading policy groups representing the U.S. automotive industry are joining forces to lobby the Trump administration against the imposition of 25% tariffs on auto parts, scheduled to take effect by May 3. The groups, representing dealers, suppliers, and major automakers, argue that the tariffs could jeopardize U.S. automotive production and harm already distressed auto suppliers. They emphasize the importance of the automotive sector to the U.S. economy, supporting 10 million jobs and contributing $1.2 trillion annually. The letter comes after President Trump indicated a willingness to reconsider the tariffs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that President Trump's recent comments indicating a potential softening on tariffs against China may not signal significant progress in trade talks but could instead give Beijing an advantage. Trump stated that tariffs on Chinese goods 'will not be as high as 145 per cent' and 'won't be zero.' Economists believe these remarks reflect the US's anxiety to reach a deal, potentially allowing China to negotiate more favorable terms. The analysts emphasize that there has been no substantial change in US-China tariff negotiations.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its 2025 GDP projections for China and India, citing trade tensions and 'high policy uncertainty.' The IMF also reduced Japan's growth forecast.

The IMF's forecast aligns with a broader trend of research firms and banks cutting growth forecasts for Asian economies.

          <p>The Real ID deadline is approaching quickly, and most states are not yet fully compliant. Starting May 7, Americans will need a Real ID to pass through airport security or enter federal buildings. A data analysis shows that many states have low compliance rates, meaning a significant portion of travelers may face difficulties at airport checkpoints. The TSA plans to implement additional screening for those with non-compliant IDs, potentially causing travel delays. The Real ID Act was passed in 2005 to enhance the security of state-issued identification.</p>

          <p>China's energy-storage industry is facing a challenging outlook due to the escalating US-China trade war and reduced government support. This has led to caution against price competition from an industry group. With exports to the US likely impacted by higher tariffs, producers are projected to trim capital expenditure, potentially shrinking the annual expansion of battery energy-storage systems (BESS). The sector is also grappling with a price war resulting from overproduction, leading to a decline in export prices.</p>
