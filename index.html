          <p>Torrential rains in central Nigeria have caused devastating floods, resulting in at least 110 deaths and the displacement of many residents. The heavy rainfall lasted for several hours, submerging and washing away over 50 residential houses, primarily affecting the Tiffin Maza and Anguwan Hausawa districts of Mokwa town. Local authorities are conducting search and rescue operations, with many more people still at risk and left homeless. This event marks the beginning of the rainy season in Nigeria, recalling severe flooding in previous years that caused widespread displacement and destruction. The community is requesting government support to cope with the aftermath of the disaster, which is the worst flooding they've experienced in 60 years. The author's tone is one of concern for the community and a sense of urgency regarding the ongoing rescue efforts.</p>

However, Swift noted that she has delayed re-recording "Reputation" due to its personal significance and the difficulty in improving upon the original, but has fully re-recorded her self-titled debut album.

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that President Donald Trump can terminate the protected status of approximately 500,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela while an appeal of the president's order is still pending. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, arguing that the ruling undervalues the devastating consequences this decision will have on the lives of these immigrants. These immigrants were previously allowed to remain in the United States for up to two years due to conflicts or unsafe conditions in their home countries. The ruling follows a previous decision allowing the Trump administration to revoke the status of nearly 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants under the Temporary Status Program.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report by Enders Analysis accuses major tech firms like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft of enabling the "industrial scale theft" of premium video services, particularly live sports. The report points to the Amazon Fire Stick as a key device used to access illegal streams, costing broadcasters significant revenue and exposing users to cyber-crime risks. Sky and DAZN executives have warned that piracy is causing a financial crisis in the broadcast industry, with illegal streams often requiring users to provide sensitive information, such as credit card details. While Amazon claims to be vigilant in combating piracy, the report suggests more action is needed from tech platforms and governments to protect the creative industries.</p>

          <p>In today's economy, where home prices and equity levels have surged, homeowners need to carefully consider how much home equity to borrow. While interest rates on home equity loans and HELOCs are relatively low, borrowers should only borrow an amount they can comfortably repay. Factors like inflation, interest rate predictions, and repayment structures should be considered to prevent any threat of foreclosure. Calculating monthly payment costs and understanding the potential short- and long-term affordability will help homeowners determine an appropriate amount of equity to borrow.

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron called on Europe and Asia to fortify coalition and avoid being caught in the intensifying rift between the U.S. and China. Addressing the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, Macron urged Indo-Pacific nations to establish a "new coalition" to counter the "constraints and side effects" stemming from the growing U.S.-China rivalry. Macron emphasized that France is both a friend and an ally of the United States and cooperates with China while adhering to its own interests. His speech comes amid a regional tour aimed at bolstering France's defense cooperation with other nations, concerned about becoming collateral damage in the U.S.-China trade war and geopolitical disputes with Beijing.</p>

          <p>The last hospital providing health services in the North Gaza governorate, al-Awda hospital, has been evacuated after the Israeli military ordered its immediate closure. The hospital's director reported receiving threats of bombing or killing those inside if the evacuation was not carried out. Patients were moved to al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, but medical equipment could not be relocated due to impassable roads. The World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed concern, stating that the closure means there is no remaining functioning hospital in the area, severing a critical lifeline for the people. The situation underscores the dire humanitarian crisis and the challenges in providing healthcare in the region.</p>

          <h2>Campaigner Says Disposable Vapes Ban May Not Reduce Appeal</h2>

          <p>A ban on single-use vapes in the UK is unlikely to significantly reduce the appeal of e-cigarettes to teenagers, according to the head of Action on Smoking and Health (Ash). Hazel Cheeseman argues that reusable models are too similar to disposables, retaining the same bright colors, cheap prices, and easy availability that attract young people. While the government aims to curb youth vaping rates and reduce electronic waste, stronger action is needed to regulate packaging, design, and advertising. Some former smokers have found vaping more addictive than cigarettes, raising concerns about the long-term health risks.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift has successfully bought back the rights to her first six albums, ending a long-running battle over the ownership of her music. The saga began in 2019 when Scooter Braun acquired Swift's former record label, Big Machine, gaining control of her early discography. Swift responded by vowing to re-record those albums, releasing "Taylor's Versions" to diminish the value of the original masters. She has yet to complete the project, pausing on the "Reputation" album due to its personal significance, but has every intention to release the vault tracks at a later date.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's ambitious Golden Dome missile defense program, which aims to create space-based weapons to intercept strikes against the US, is not expected to be fully operational before the end of his term. While Trump predicted the program would be completed within three years, the Pentagon's implementation plan envisions only a demonstration under ideal conditions by the end of 2028. The program will be rolled out in phases, initially focusing on integrating data systems before developing space-based weapons, relying heavily on Elon Musk's SpaceX for tracking systems. The technology to identify and eliminate ballistic missiles in their early launch phase is not expected to be ready for years.</p>
