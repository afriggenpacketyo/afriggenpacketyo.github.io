          <p>Nations including Japan, South Korea, and Thailand have expressed shock and regret following the Trump administration's announcement of renewed tariff threats. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba called the move "truly regrettable," while other Asian and African leaders voiced similar concerns. Despite the negative reactions, most countries have indicated they will continue negotiations with the U.S. ahead of the new August 1st deadline, hoping to secure more favorable trade terms. Trade policy experts note that the administration's negotiating tactics seem to have had little impact on the final proposed rates for many nations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new malaria treatment developed by Novartis, specifically formulated for babies and very young children weighing under 4.5kg, has been approved for use. This breakthrough addresses a critical treatment gap, as infants were previously given modified doses of drugs for older children, posing a risk of overdose. The drug, Coartem Baby, is expected to be rolled out in African nations within weeks, where malaria disproportionately affects children under five. The development, a collaboration with the non-profit Medicines for Malaria Venture, is being hailed as a major public health advancement.</p>

          <p>The government of El Salvador has informed United Nations investigators that the U.S. maintains legal responsibility for Venezuelan migrants deported to its Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT). This contradicts public statements from both governments, which claimed the men were outside U.S. jurisdiction after being transferred under a controversial deal. Lawyers for the migrants argue this revelation proves the U.S. government has been dishonest with the courts and can be compelled to act on the migrants' behalf. The case challenges the legality of the Trump administration's program to house migrant detainees in foreign prisons.</p>

          <p>Australia's central bank has surprisingly decided to maintain its policy rate at 3.85%, contrary to economists' expectations of a rate cut. The Reserve Bank of Australia stated it needs more time and information to confirm that inflation is sustainably on track to its target, noting recent data was slightly stronger than anticipated. This decision was met with disappointment by Australia's Treasurer, who highlighted the government's progress in combating inflation and relieving cost-of-living pressures. The Australian dollar strengthened following the announcement amid a broader economic slowdown in the country. (not investment advice)</p>

In a clinical trial, the therapy delivered a healthy copy of the OTOF gene to the inner ear, leading to significant hearing improvement in all 10 participants, who suffered from a genetic hearing impairment. The effects were particularly pronounced in children, with one seven-year-old regaining nearly full hearing and the ability to hold conversations.

In some American cities, such as San Bernardino, California, parking lots constitute nearly half of the downtown land area, often with poor design and a lack of safety features. The study, which analyzed data from the National Safety Council, attributes many incidents to driver distraction, with a high percentage of drivers admitting to using phones or engaging in personal grooming.

          <p>During a White House dinner, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he was nominating U.S. President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. The meeting was expected to focus on securing a ceasefire in Gaza, with Trump expressing optimism that a deal is progressing well and that Hamas is willing to meet. The leaders also discussed the recent U.S.-backed strikes on Iran's nuclear program and the potential relocation of Palestinians from Gaza, a controversial topic. Trump also made unexpected remarks about resuming weapons shipments to Ukraine, expressing disappointment with Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics has projected a 56% decline in its second-quarter operating profit, falling short of market expectations. The company is struggling to meet the demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, a critical component for AI systems dominated by leader Nvidia. Analysts attribute the disappointing forecast to Samsung falling behind competitors like SK Hynix in securing certification and orders from Nvidia for its advanced HBM chips. The guidance also reflects ongoing operating losses in its chip foundry business and the impact of U.S. restrictions on chip sales to China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A man in Colma, California, was stabbed and sustained life-threatening injuries during a dispute over a place in line for a Pokémon card restock at a GameStop. Police arrested two suspects, alleging one cut in line, leading to a verbal confrontation that escalated into a physical attack. The victim was allegedly struck with a mason jar, and then stabbed with the broken glass. Such violence over the collectible cards, which can be resold for significant profit, has become a recurring issue for retailers, with hobbyists blaming "scalpers" for creating a volatile environment.</p>

As part of a settlement, Caltech and Simplilearn agreed to changes ensuring more transparency, and Simplilearn will refund $2.4 million in tuition to hundreds of students.

          <p>A commentary in the Los Angeles Times argues that the Trump administration's priorities are dangerously misplaced, focusing on immigration enforcement while cutting funds for scientific research and weather forecasting. The author criticizes the recent deployment of federal agents to Los Angeles's MacArthur Park as a political stunt that terrorizes communities without addressing real issues. The article contrasts this with budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health and weather services, which it contends are critical for addressing real threats like pandemics and climate change-fueled natural disasters. The author suggests these policies represent a move toward an authoritarian agenda.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has reversed its plan to lay off tens of thousands of employees, stating that a large-scale reduction-in-force is no longer necessary. The agency is on track to reduce its staff by about 30,000 by the end of the fiscal year through attrition, retirements, and a hiring freeze, which it claims has eliminated the need for the previously considered cuts. The initial plan, aimed at returning staffing to 2019 levels, would have cut over 80,000 jobs. Critics argue the staff reduction is due to a toxic work environment and will inevitably harm services for veterans.</p>

Beijing stated the change was a technical adjustment to alleviate air traffic and improve safety.

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Justice Department and FBI has concluded that Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide and that investigators found no evidence of a so-called "client list" or proof he blackmailed prominent individuals. The findings, detailed in a memo, aimed to address widespread conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein's 2019 death in federal custody and his criminal activities. Investigators stated the review revealed no credible evidence to pursue charges against uncharged third parties. The White House defended the review as a commitment to transparency, though some material was withheld due to its graphic nature.</p>

          <p>South Korea has canceled a planned $2.2 billion follow-on order for 36 AH-64E Apache Guardian attack helicopters. The decision was reportedly driven by the demonstrated vulnerability of helicopters to modern air defenses and drones, as seen in the war in Ukraine, as well as a significant increase in the aircraft's cost. A member of South Korea's National Assembly stated that the country must invest in future warfare capabilities like drones and smart systems rather than expensive legacy platforms. The move reflects a growing global reevaluation of the attack helicopter's role on the modern battlefield.</p>
