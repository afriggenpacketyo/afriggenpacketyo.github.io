          <p>German police are conducting a new search in Praia da Luz, Portugal, nearly two decades after Madeleine McCann disappeared from a holiday apartment complex in 2007. McCann was three years old at the time of her disappearance, which prompted a large-scale investigation. German investigators have focused on Christian Brückner as the prime suspect since 2020, though he has not been charged in connection with the case and denies involvement. Brückner is currently serving a sentence in Germany for a sexual assault committed in Portugal in 2005, and the new search is supported by Portuguese police.</p>

Despite allegations in the Polish media about his past, including ties to hooliganism and irregular acquisition of social housing, Nawrocki's victory signals potential challenges for the current government of Donald Tusk.

          <p>The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to lift a lower court's injunction that has blocked plans to reduce the federal workforce and reorganize federal agencies. A district court order has frozen efforts at 19 agencies and 11 Cabinet departments to implement President Trump's executive order for mass firings. The administration argues that the President does not need special permission from Congress to exercise control over agency staffing. The case was brought by federal employee unions, nonprofits, and local governments, who claim only Congress can lawfully reorganize the federal bureaucracy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court's intervention to proceed with planned layoffs of thousands of federal workers across numerous agencies. This request follows a lower court's preliminary injunction preventing the administration from implementing these reductions-in-force. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argues that the president has the authority to oversee personnel decisions within the executive branch without congressional approval. The administration claims the injunction interferes with its ability to manage internal operations and retain employees deemed not in the government's best interest.</p>

The study projects an additional 25.4 million cases of tooth decay and $9.8 billion in associated costs over five years if water fluoridation is halted. The effects would disproportionately impact publicly insured and uninsured children, who already face higher risks of unmet dental needs. The American Dental Association maintains that water fluoridation is safe and effective in preventing cavities, supported by decades of research.</p>

          <p>A suspect has been charged with a federal hate crime following an attack on a rally in support of Israeli hostages in Gaza at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado. The suspect, identified as a 45-year-old, allegedly shouted "Free Palestine" and used makeshift incendiary devices during the attack. Four women and four men were hospitalized, and the FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted terror attack. The US Department of Homeland Security said that the man had entered the US on a tourist visa in 2022 and was in the country "illegally."</p>

Participants who closely followed the diet had a 9% lower risk of dementia, while those who improved their adherence over 10 years had a 25% lower risk.
