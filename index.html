          <p>An Amtrak train traveling from Los Angeles to Seattle struck a disabled semi-truck obstructing the tracks near Lompoc, California, leading to injuries and a significant fuel spill. The incident resulted in major injuries for the truck driver and minor injuries for three train passengers among the 218 on board. Approximately 3,600 gallons of diesel fuel spilled from the truck, necessitating a closure of Highway 1 in the area between Main Street and Brown Road. The train remained upright, and passengers were safely bused to their destinations as Amtrak police and local law enforcement initiated an investigation into the collision. This event highlights the inherent dangers of track obstructions and the potential environmental impact of such accidents.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 22:30:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers in Hong Kong and mainland China are adapting to significantly higher gold prices, driven by persistent demand for wedding jewelry despite global market surges. Gold prices have climbed over 48% this year, reaching a record high of US$3,883 per ounce, following a substantial 26% increase last year, which was the biggest annual gain in 14 years. Retailers like Chow Tai Fook observe that consumers have gradually accepted this new price level since March, indicating a cultural resilience in purchasing habits. This ongoing trend highlights the deep-rooted importance of gold in Chinese wedding customs, even as economic factors push valuations to unprecedented levels. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's Kospi index surged over 3% to an all-time high, propelled by significant gains in heavyweight Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. This market uplift follows the announcement of a strategic partnership between the two chipmakers and OpenAI, aimed at supplying advanced memory chips essential for next-generation AI. While these companies saw substantial stock increases, the broader Asian market experienced mixed results, with Japan and Australia advancing, though Chinese and Indian markets were closed for holidays. The overall market optimism, including fresh highs for the S&P 500, is partly fueled by investor bets that the ongoing U.S. government shutdown will be short-lived, despite some predictions of a longer impasse.

The Los Angeles city attorney's office declined to file charges, though the specific reason for this decision was not provided. Cruz had been held in police custody for five hours after three women accused him of intentionally spraying them with water while he washed his car. His agent maintained that the women had parked too close, refused requests to move, and began recording Cruz, suggesting any water splash was unintentional during his attempt to communicate with them.</p>

          <p>The Israeli navy intercepted the Global Sumud Flotilla, carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza, and detained activists, including climate campaigner Greta Thunberg. Israel stated the vessels were "safely stopped" for approaching an "active combat zone" and violating a lawful naval blockade, transferring those aboard to an Israeli port. The GSF, however, condemned the interception as "illegal" and "a brazen act of desperation," alleging that one vessel was deliberately rammed and others hit by water cannons. This incident, which follows previous aid blockades, has sparked international protests and led to Colombia expelling Israeli diplomats. The context is ongoing efforts to deliver aid to Gaza amid a declared famine and Israeli restrictions, with Israel claiming it prevents supplies from reaching Hamas.</p>

          <p>Portland Police are seeking public assistance to locate a woman accused of assault near the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) building, after one of its "dialogue liaison officers" (DLOs) lost track of her. The DLO, a sworn officer tasked with "hold[ing] a safe space" for protesters, was flagged down by a victim but the suspect refused lawful detention and fled. This incident highlights challenges with the DLO program, which was established after the violent 2020 protests to build rapport with demonstrators rather than primarily engage in enforcement actions. The case has since been assigned to a detective in the Major Crimes Unit, though no specific information regarding the alleged assault has been released by authorities.</p>

With fewer than 16% of homes affordable for typical households in 2023, this "tongue-in-cheek" effort aims to strengthen the brand's connection with coffee-loving renters, a growing population across the country.

          <p>An Idaho state judge has ruled against the public release of graphic crime scene photos from the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students by Bryan Kohberger. Judge Megan Marshall determined that disseminating these "incredibly disturbing" images would cause "extreme emotional distress" for the victims' families, an impact that outweighs the public's interest in the investigation's conduct. While portions showing victims' bodies or immediate blood must be blacked out, other investigation records, including videos of distraught friends on the morning the bodies were found, can still be released. This decision aims to protect the families from further trauma, especially after Kohberger pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life without parole.</p>

          <p>A U.S. citizen and Alabama construction worker, Leo Garcia Venegas, has filed a class-action lawsuit against immigration agents after being detained twice within weeks during workplace raids. The lawsuit, filed by the Institute for Justice, alleges "unconstitutional and illegal immigration enforcement tactics," specifically targeting industries with large immigrant workforces. Venegas, who was born in the U.S., claims agents targeted workers who appeared Latino and dismissed his Alabama-issued Real ID driver's license as fake. The Department of Homeland Security denied racial targeting, stating arrests are based on "reasonable suspicion" of illegal presence, but did not address why Venegas, a citizen, was detained.</p>

          <p>Ecuador is intensifying its anti-drug operations, with increased police raids targeting drug dealers, in response to US President Donald Trump's declared war on drug cartels. Ecuador, a transit country for drug cartels, is on Trump's list of troublesome nations and is receiving US resources and military support, including plans for a new military base. Ecuadorian security forces are stepping up efforts to assure cooperation, hoping intelligence gathered from lower-level arrests will aid US efforts against higher-ranking figures. This collaboration aims to disrupt the vast global drug network, with police officers like "Lynx" using advanced tools such as drones to spot drug deals. The efforts underscore the devastating impact of drug-related violence in poorer countries.</p>

          <p>The federal government initiated a shutdown after lawmakers failed to agree on extending funding, stemming from weeks of partisan disagreements over health care tax credits. Democrats refused to support funding without addressing expiring health insurance subsidies, while Republicans insisted on negotiating such issues separately, advocating for a "clean" continuing resolution. Despite Republican majorities in both chambers, Senate rules require 60 votes for spending bills, necessitating bipartisan support that was not achieved. This impasse led to hundreds of thousands of federal workers being furloughed without pay, impacting essential services and potentially costing billions, as illustrated by the $3 billion loss from the 2018-2019 shutdown.</p>

          <p>Huntington Beach, California, has declared itself a "non-sanctuary" city, explicitly opposing California's statewide "sanctuary" policies regarding undocumented immigrants. Mayor Pat Burns, a strong Trump supporter, championed the unanimous council initiative, arguing that illegal immigration impacts residents immeasurably due to unknown backgrounds. This status allows local police to assist federal immigration enforcement, contrasting with California law that restricts such cooperation, although Burns acknowledges police cannot use ICE translators or systems. While the Trump administration has threatened to withhold federal grants from sanctuary jurisdictions, these attempts have largely been blocked in courts, making Huntington Beach's stance primarily a political statement.</p>

Ali Herischi stated his clients, one a Christian convert who entered with his pregnant wife, "disappeared" from ICE's detainee locator system before being deported without notice. Their asylum claims were reportedly denied, and appeals were in progress when they were removed. An Iranian official announced approximately 120 Iranian nationals would be returned from the U.S., a move the U.S. has not officially acknowledged. Herischi called the deportations "unconscionable," arguing they contradict US foreign policy goals of protecting those who stand against the Iranian regime.</p>

An autonomous Waymo was filmed in Atlanta blowing past a stopped school bus with flashing red lights, an offense that would incur a $1,000 fine for a human driver. This follows another incident where police in the San Francisco Bay Area pulled over a Waymo for an illegal U-turn, unable to issue a ticket without a human driver. While Waymo claims significant safety improvements over human drivers, experts emphasize the need for higher standards and proper implementation before widespread adoption of self-driving technology.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders adopted a unique silent protest after fellow first-year QB Dillon Gabriel was promoted to the team's starting position, leaving Sanders as the No. 3 quarterback. When questioned by reporters about not moving up the depth chart, Sanders literally muted himself, moving his mouth and gesturing without producing any sound, a creative way to avoid responding. This comes after Sanders, a former college star and son of NFL legend Deion Sanders, dropped to the fifth round of the draft despite earlier projections. His silent response may be a reaction to critical remarks from analyst Rex Ryan regarding Sanders' previous comments about his NFL playing capability compared to other league quarterbacks.</p>

          <p>Understanding cooking oils is crucial for health, as different fats impact cholesterol levels, with some raising and others lowering "bad" cholesterol. Professor Nita Forouhi debunks common myths, asserting that rapeseed and sunflower oils are "absolutely good for us," being low in saturated fats and high in healthier mono- and polyunsaturated fats, which can reduce disease risk. Modern margarines are also deemed healthy, containing minimal trans fats, unlike their predecessors. While extra virgin olive oil is best for salad dressings due to its low smoke point, basic olive oil is suitable for shallow frying. For deep frying, vegetable or sunflower oil is recommended for their ability to withstand higher temperatures without breaking down.</p>

An analysis by BBC Verify and BBC Russian found 21 of Russia's 38 large refineries have been hit this year, with successful attacks up 48% from last year. These strikes, some deep inside Russia, are part of Ukraine's strategy to pressure Russia and restrict its war-funding capabilities, as stated by President Zelensky. The impact is visible in long queues at petrol stations, rationing in occupied Crimea, and small stations shutting down. While crude oil exports remain high, this campaign significantly increases the "pain of the protracted conflict" for Russia.</p>

Public revulsion at their attack appears to have prompted their backtrack, with the hackers stating, "We are sorry for hurting kids" and claiming all child data is now deleted.
