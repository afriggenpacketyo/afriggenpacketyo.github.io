          <p>Small business owners are facing significant financial challenges due to the Trump administration's changing tariffs on Chinese goods, causing instability and impacting profitability. Bobby Djavaheri, owner of Yedi Houseware Appliances, explains how a sudden 145% tariff increase drastically affected his business, forcing him to increase prices. While tariffs have since been reduced to 30%, uncertainty remains, and shipping costs have tripled, leaving businesses struggling to navigate the fluctuating trade landscape and adapt to the changing economic environment.

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers are on the brink of striking if an agreement isn't reached by midnight, potentially impacting over 300,000 commuters. The primary dispute revolves around pay raises, with the union claiming they haven't received an increase in five years. While NJ Transit asserts they've offered a fair wage, the union argues the figures are misleading. Gov. Phil Murphy may declare a state of emergency if the strike proceeds, and NJ Transit has a contingency plan that accommodates only 20% of daily riders.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding the ability of federal courts to issue nationwide injunctions against government actions deemed unconstitutional. The cases involve President Trump's order to eliminate birthright citizenship, which lower courts blocked with nationwide injunctions. The Trump administration argues these injunctions impede the executive branch's duties, while opponents argue they are essential to check presidential power. The outcome hinges on key justices and could significantly alter the judiciary's role in upholding constitutional law.</p>

The Department of Health and Human Services indicated that substantial updates to existing vaccines may require additional clinical evaluation, potentially affecting the availability of shots for even high-risk individuals. Officials are also questioning the necessity of COVID vaccines for children under 12, with some experts suggesting annual booster shots may offer only marginal benefits to younger, healthy individuals. Some experts fear these changes are part of a larger effort to undermine vaccine use.</p>

          <p>A brain-dead pregnant woman in Georgia has been kept on life support for three months to allow her fetus to develop, a decision her family says was dictated by the state's strict anti-abortion law. The hospital reportedly cited the state law, which restricts abortion after cardiac activity is detected, as the reason for not removing life support. The family is upset that they don't have a say in the matter. The fetus is reported to have fluid on the brain, raising concerns about its health after birth.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed former Sheriff Alex Villanueva's $25-million lawsuit against Los Angeles County for the second time. The lawsuit alleged that the county defamed him and violated his rights by flagging his personnel file as "do not rehire" after a panel determined he had harassed two officials. Villanueva claimed the "do not rehire" notation made it difficult for him to find a job. While the federal claim was dismissed, state matters are still pending.</p>
