          <p>General Motors has issued a recall for 597,630 full-size trucks and SUVs in the U.S. due to a manufacturing defect that could lead to sudden engine failure and increase the risk of a crash. The recall affects models from 2021 to 2024, including Cadillac Escalade, Chevrolet Silverado 1500, and GMC Sierra 1500. Dealers will inspect and repair or replace the engine free of charge, with owner notification letters expected to be mailed on June 9, 2025. This action follows an investigation by U.S. auto safety regulators after receiving complaints about engine failures in GM vehicles equipped with L87 V8 engines.</p>

          <p>A judge dismissed criminal charges against Henrry Villatoro Santos, a Virginia man accused by the attorney general and FBI director of being a regional leader of the MS-13 gang, at the request of the Justice Department, paving the way for expedited deportation proceedings. Villatoro Santos's attorney criticized the Justice Department for the lack of explanation for withdrawing the charges and accused them of attempting to bypass due-process protections. The Justice Department has not publicly tied him to any acts of violence, and his attorneys have repeatedly questioned the nature of the proceedings. The case has drawn parallels to other politically sensitive case dismissals.</p>

          <p>Representative Elise Stefanik is contemplating a run for governor of New York and is in a feud with Speaker Mike Johnson after her nomination for U.N. ambassador was withdrawn. Stefanik, who expected to sail through her Senate confirmation, had already packed up her office and sent her chief of staff to a new job. However, the nomination was pulled, and she is now back on Capitol Hill, blaming Speaker Johnson for the situation. This has led to a strained relationship between the two, with Stefanik publicly accusing Johnson of dishonesty and setting the stage for potential clashes as Johnson tries to pass the president’s domestic policy agenda.</p>

          <p>Spanish police rescued three children, ages 8 and 10, who had been locked up in a house by their German parents since December 2021, a situation described as a "house of horror." The children were allegedly confined to caged beds, forced to wear diapers and face masks, and were cut off from the outside world. A neighbor alerted the police after noticing that the children did not attend school, prompting the rescue and the arrest of the parents, who are now in custody while the children are in a care home. Police found a large quantity of medication inside the house.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has reportedly been in communication with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele regarding Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison. Abrego Garcia, who lived in Maryland with his family, was deported in March despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution. The Trump administration claimed he was a member of MS-13, which his wife and attorney deny.

          <p>President Donald Trump acknowledged that Americans might have to do with less as a result of the ongoing trade war with China. He suggested that children might have fewer dolls, and goods may cost slightly more, but insisted that the trade war would ultimately be worse for China, which relies on the U.S. market. Trump also claimed that many goods imported from China are unnecessary for Americans. He reiterated his commitment to securing a fair trade deal, accusing China of being the "chief-ripper-offer."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump responded to Joe Rogan's warning about becoming "monsters" over aggressive migrant deportation plans, agreeing that caution is necessary. When questioned about court challenges to deportations, Trump defended his administration's actions by referring to those being deported as "criminals" and stating that he was elected to remove them. Despite Moran's assertion that "even bad guys get due process," Trump contended that a different standard applies to migrants who enter the country illegally. The president also addressed the Supreme Court's order to facilitate the return of a wrongfully deported migrant, alleging that the individual was a violent gang member.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump blamed former President Joe Biden for the U.S. economy contracting in the first quarter of 2025, suggesting he would also blame Biden for the second quarter's results. Trump stated that the economic downturn was a result of policies inherited from the Biden administration, despite the Commerce Department report indicating that the GDP decline reflected companies importing goods to get ahead of Trump's tariffs. The president's remarks came after the Commerce Department reported a 0.3% annualized pace decline in GDP, marking the first quarter of negative growth since 2022. This claim is inaccurate, as the GDP figure reflects a wave of imports made to try to get ahead of Trump's promised tariffs.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a slowdown in early 2025 due to tariffs and policy shifts implemented by President Trump, leading to a decline in gross domestic product. While underlying economic growth remained solid, businesses and consumers reacted to the constant stream of tariff announcements, causing spending and investment patterns to shift. Economists anticipate further slowing in the coming months as tariffs drive up prices and create uncertainty. However, some positive news emerged on inflation, which cooled in March, though concerns remain about the long-term impact of tariffs on prices.</p>

He argues that the nation is tottering on the edge of dictatorship and that every American with authority must loudly and boldly explain the danger. Reich calls for Democratic members and progressives in Congress, as well as former presidents and business leaders, to speak out against what he sees as complicity in tyranny. He expresses fear that the regime will openly defy the supreme court and that the nation will not make it through the second 100 days.</p>

          <p>Raging wildfires in Israel forced the government to close major roads, evacuate towns near Jerusalem, and request international assistance. The fires disrupted the country’s annual memorial day ceremonies, replacing solemn broadcasts with footage of evacuations.

Eyal Caspi, head of Israel’s fire and rescue service, suggested that climate change was likely exacerbating the strength of the wildfires.

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a contraction in the first quarter of 2025, shrinking at a 0.3% annual rate, as businesses rushed to stockpile goods ahead of President Trump's sweeping tariff policies. The slowdown comes amid growing concerns that Mr. Trump's wide-ranging tariffs could disrupt the U.S. economy, with some economists raising the chances of the U.S. slipping into a recession in 2025. The increase in imports, as well as a 5.1% decline in government spending, impacted growth in the first quarter. Economists expect the U.S. economy to slow in 2025, partly due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs.</p>

The contraction in growth may not be viewed as negatively given the potential for the trend to reverse in subsequent quarters.
