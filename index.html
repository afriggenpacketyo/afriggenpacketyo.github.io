          <h2>Goldman Sachs Upholds Tariff Impact Forecast Amid Presidential Criticism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 11:39:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle has reaffirmed the firm's forecast that tariffs will increasingly burden U.S. consumers, estimating they will bear about two-thirds of the costs by fall. This position stands firm despite direct criticism from President Donald Trump, who publicly questioned the bank's economic analysis and suggested leadership changes. Mericle emphasized the research's consistency with findings from other economists, suggesting that companies benefiting from tariff protection might raise prices, transferring the cost to consumers. The forecast indicates a potential rise in the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge to 3.2% by year-end, potentially impacting inflation targets. Despite this, Mericle anticipates the Fed will likely still consider interest rate cuts, prioritizing labor market concerns over this one-time price level effect. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asserts that Russian President Vladimir Putin is "bluffing" about pursuing peace, aiming instead for the occupation of Ukraine. Speaking after a virtual meeting with President Trump and European leaders, Zelenskyy stressed the need for continued international pressure and sanctions on Russia to achieve genuine peace. He expressed hope that the upcoming Trump-Putin summit in Alaska will prioritize an immediate ceasefire, reiterating Ukraine's demand for a trilateral meeting format that includes Kyiv. European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, have publicly supported Ukraine's territorial integrity and insisted on its involvement in any peace discussions, underscoring the complex diplomatic landscape surrounding the conflict.</p>

          <p>Actor Jason Momoa, known for his role as Aquaman, revealed a harrowing near-drowning incident during a 2007 surf trip off Maui's notorious Jaws break. His leash snapped seven miles offshore, leaving him adrift amidst massive 10-foot waves. Despite extensive water training, Momoa reached a breaking point, feeling his body give up before his toe hit a reef, and a friend eventually spotted him. The ordeal, which saw him bleeding and battered, underscored the extreme dangers of the ocean. This personal account highlights the actor's real-life brushes with peril, far removed from his on-screen aquatic heroics.</p>

          <p>Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska's largest military installation, will host the highly anticipated summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. This 64,000-acre site, a key Cold War-era defense hub, was chosen for its security and strategic location, satisfying White House requirements. The meeting aims to discuss ending the Ukraine war, though expectations for an immediate ceasefire are tempered. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is not expected to attend, despite calls for trilateral talks. The choice of Alaska carries historical resonance, as the U.S. purchased the territory from Russia in 1867, adding a symbolic layer to the high-stakes diplomatic engagement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. famine early warning system, FEWS NET, is being restored after a multi-month suspension initiated by the Trump administration in January. Established in 1985 following the Ethiopian famine, this crucial system integrates diverse data, from weather to trade, to predict hunger hotspots up to eight months in advance. Its unexpected shutdown created a significant gap in critical information for global aid organizations and governments, raising concerns about planning for food crises. The revival is welcomed by humanitarian aid experts, who underscore FEWS NET's vital role in preventing human suffering, mass migration, and ensuring stability, emphasizing its cost-effectiveness over reactive disaster relief efforts.</p>

This follows its U.S. bankruptcy filing earlier this month, attributed to significant debt and changing consumer habits. Analysts note the brand's waning popularity against online competitors like TikTok shops and fast-fashion giants, with some also citing the impact of U.S. tariffs on Asian-sourced goods as a contributing factor to its financial woes.</p>

          <p>U.S. tariffs are significantly increasing the prices of coffee, specialty teas, and spices, leading to inflation for these tariff-sensitive items. Coffee prices surged 14.5% year-over-year in July, impacting small businesses like Bethany's Coffee Shop, which has seen costs rise 18-25% since January. Importers of natural resources, like coffee and tea, face limited options to avoid these tariffs, as shifting sourcing is difficult. Retailers are struggling with slim margins, with concerns that these increased costs will force price hikes for consumers or lead to lower quality products.

          <p>A new Gallup survey reveals that U.S. adult alcohol consumption has reached a record low, with only 54% reporting drinking, a significant drop from 62% in 2023. This decline is largely attributed to a growing public perception that even moderate drinking is harmful, with a majority (53%) now holding this view, up from 45% last year. Fewer Americans are drinking regularly, and the average weekly intake has fallen to its lowest since 1996. This trend is not linked to a shift towards recreational cannabis.

          <p>CoreWeave, an AI data center renter, saw its stock drop 14% after reporting a wider-than-expected adjusted loss of 27 cents per share in its second quarterly results as a public company. This performance came ahead of a lock-up expiration, which could potentially add further volatility to its shares. Despite the loss, the company's revenue more than tripled year-over-year to $1.21 billion, exceeding Wall Street forecasts, driven by surging artificial intelligence demand. CoreWeave also raised its 2025 revenue guidance and secured expansion deals with hyperscale customers, indicating robust demand. However, some analysts noted light capital expenditures guidance and delayed spending until the fourth quarter as potential points of weakness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A murder investigation began when Angela Craig was placed on life support, leading to the swift arrest of her husband, Dr. James Craig, a Colorado dentist. The central piece of evidence stems from a package delivered to his dental office, which a staff member accidentally opened to reveal a container labeled "potassium cyanide." Angela Craig's initial symptoms, including feeling "drugged" and dizzy, alarmingly aligned with cyanide poisoning. Police allege James Craig was in his wife's hospital room shortly before her condition critically worsened, prompting a nurse to alert authorities about the suspicious package. The defense may argue James Craig intended the poison for himself or that the investigation was rushed, noting the absence of poison found in initial tests.</p>

The two-phase program will allow drugmakers more frequent engagement with the FDA during critical development stages, such as facility design, and provide early feedback to expedite application assessments.

          <p>Reverse mortgages offer older homeowners a way to convert home equity into cash without adding monthly payments, providing a potential lifeline amidst rising inflation and interest rates. Benefits include freeing up cash flow by eliminating existing mortgage payments and offering flexible fund disbursement options, such as lump sums or credit lines. However, experts warn of high upfront fees, ongoing costs, and significant risks in declining housing markets, which could lead to negative equity. While potentially useful for unexpected medical expenses, these loans are costly and may not suit those not planning long-term residency.

          <p>The average two-year fixed mortgage rate in the UK has fallen below 5% to 4.99%, marking a "symbolic turning point" for homebuyers. This is the first time rates have been this low since the market turmoil following Liz Truss's mini-budget in September 2022, which caused borrowing costs to soar. While the Bank of England has cut interest rates multiple times, future reductions remain uncertain, with inflation forecasts suggesting the base rate may hold steady. The competitive mortgage market sees lenders offering ultra-competitive rates, with some as low as 3.7%. This easing of rates, combined with rising wages, is gradually improving affordability and contributing to resilience in the housing market, with modest house price gains expected.
