          <p>Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party Senator Nicole Mitchell has been convicted of felony burglary following an incident where she broke into her stepmother's home. Mitchell testified that her intention was to retrieve sentimental items belonging to her late father, including his ashes, claiming her stepmother was suffering from Alzheimer's and had cut off communication. However, a jury found her guilty after reviewing evidence, including bodycam footage where she admitted she was not "good at this." The conviction carries a potential sentence of up to 20 years, and the state's Senate Majority Leader expects her to resign as previously pledged.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Proposes New Legislation to Preemptively Stop Mass Attackers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 20:07:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new law designed to intercept individuals planning mass casualty events, even if they lack a specific terrorist ideology. The proposed legislation aims to close a legal gap highlighted by the Southport attack, where plotters without a clear ideological motive could not be charged with serious preparatory offenses like terror suspects. This new power would allow police to intervene and charge individuals for researching targets or other planning steps, treating such actions with the same gravity as preparing for acts of terrorism. The goal is to provide law enforcement with the tools to prevent violence from lone, obsession-driven individuals.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers Star Mookie Betts Benched for a Day Amidst Ongoing Hitting Slump</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 19:59:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts gave superstar shortstop Mookie Betts an unplanned day off to help him mentally reset from a season-long slump. After a poor performance following the All-Star break, Betts's batting average fell to .241, a career low for a full season, and his frustration was visibly mounting. Roberts stated the decision was made to take the pressure off Betts and allow him to watch a game from a different perspective, hoping it will be beneficial for his mindset and mechanics. While Betts was willing to play, the manager insisted on the break, highlighting the urgency of addressing the uncharacteristic struggles of the key player.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces reportedly opened fire on crowds of Palestinians attempting to get food from aid distribution hubs in southern Gaza, resulting in at least 32 deaths. The incident occurred near sites operated by the U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an alternative to U.N. aid distribution. Witnesses described indiscriminate firing on people, including women and children, as they sought essential supplies in a chaotic environment. The Israeli military stated it fired warning shots after a group approached troops in a closed-off area overnight, highlighting the extreme dangers civilians face amid the catastrophic humanitarian crisis in the region.</p>

          <p>The family of Cornelius Taylor, a 46-year-old man experiencing homelessness, has filed a lawsuit against the city of Atlanta after he was crushed to death by a bulldozer during a sweep of an encampment. The lawsuit alleges that city workers failed to check if anyone was inside the tents before flattening them in preparation for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. Taylor's death has sparked outrage among advocates, who condemn the city's approach to clearing encampments as inhumane amidst an affordable housing crisis. The family is seeking a jury trial and unspecified damages for what their attorney described as a tragic and preventable death.</p>

          <p>The use of nicotine pouches, also known as white snus, is rapidly increasing among young people in the UK, with some users as young as 11. These small, flavored pouches are placed under the lip and can deliver a potent nicotine hit, leading to addiction and severe gum damage. Because they are not classified as tobacco or vape products, there are currently no age restrictions on their sale, a loophole that Trading Standards is urging the government to close. Health professionals are concerned about the long-term effects, as dentists are already treating patients with significant gum lesions caused by the products.</p>

          <p>Motorists at Edinburgh Airport are increasingly parking in nearby lay-bys and side streets to avoid the £6 fee for a 10-minute stop in the official drop-off zone. This practice, observed in a half-mile radius of the terminal, involves drivers waiting for a message from arriving passengers before quickly picking them up at unofficial points to circumvent the charges. The RAC found that over half of the UK's busiest airports have increased these fees, prompting frustration among drivers who feel the costs are extortionate. While a free drop-off area exists, it is located about half a mile from the terminal, posing difficulties for those with mobility issues.</p>

          <p>A discussion is underway in the UK about potentially shortening the six-week summer school holiday to address issues like learning loss, holiday hunger, and childcare challenges for working parents. Proponents argue that a shorter break, redistributed throughout the year, could help close the learning gap between students from different economic backgrounds and lower family costs. However, the proposal is divisive, with many teachers opposing it, citing the need for time to recharge and plan. While some academy schools have already moved to a five-week summer break, a wider national change remains a complex and contentious issue.</p>

The government is proposing new measures, including sending investment information to those with funds in low-interest accounts, to encourage a shift from cash savings to stocks and shares. This initiative aims to make the UK a "nation of investors," though experts caution that it could backfire if not handled carefully, particularly in attracting more women to investing. The plan has sparked debate over potentially reducing the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs to incentivize the change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's women's national team secured a place in the Euro 2025 semifinals by defeating France 6-5 in a tense penalty shootout. The match ended 1-1 after extra time, with Germany playing over 100 minutes with only 10 players due to an early red card. Goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger emerged as the hero, making a crucial save in the shootout after having also scored a penalty herself. The dramatic victory was a significant turnaround for the team, which had faced criticism after a heavy loss in their final group stage game. Germany will now face World Cup winners Spain in the next round.</p>

          <p>After being hailed as the language of the future, Mandarin is seeing a decline in popularity among learners in the United States and other Western nations. University enrollments for Mandarin in the U.S. have dropped by 25% from their peak in 2013, with similar downward trends observed in the UK and New Zealand. This shift marks a significant reversal after years of rapid growth, which was fueled by China's economic rise. While the exact causes are multifaceted, the waning interest suggests a change in geopolitical perceptions and career incentives that once drove students to pursue Chinese language studies in large numbers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented new restrictions on flights from Mexico and is threatening to terminate the partnership between Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico. This action is a response to the Mexican government's decision to move airlines from Mexico City's main airport to a newer, more distant one, which the U.S. claims violates a bilateral trade agreement. Mexican airlines must now seek U.S. government approval for their flight schedules, a move that could significantly impact the over 40 million passengers who travel between the countries annually. The decision could escalate a broader trade war and has been criticized by the airlines. (not investment advice)</p>

The day also included a bizarre moment when his shot from the rough dislodged a buried golf ball from the ground. Despite being six shots behind leader Scottie Scheffler, McIlroy's strong finish and the incredible support from the crowd have left him feeling he has "half a chance" for a miracle victory.</p>

The discussion highlighted the growing trend of For Sale By Owner (FSBO) transactions, with sellers opting for flat-fee MLS listings and real estate attorneys to save money.

Over 900 people have reportedly been killed in the past week, with both sides accused of atrocities. The conflict prompted intervention from Israel, which declared its support for the Druze and conducted strikes on Syrian government forces. Although a US-brokered pact was intended to halt the fighting and Israeli strikes, reports of gunfire and looting emerged from Suweida city shortly after the ceasefire was supposed to take effect, casting doubt on its viability.</p>
