          <p>The second series of 'With Love, Meghan' on Netflix offers an intimate glimpse into the Duchess of Sussex's personal life, featuring celebrity friends and candid revelations. Meghan shares details about her daily routines, including making hot breakfast for her family, and her cooking preferences, like adding flax and chia seeds to pancakes for her children. She also fondly recalls missing Magic Radio from the UK, a lighthearted admission. The article highlights the show's aspirational and relentlessly upbeat tone, providing nuggets about her early acting career and the moment she realized her love for Prince Harry. This installment continues to focus on lifestyle, deliberately omitting discussions of the Royal Family rift or her past as a working royal, while subtly protecting her children's privacy.</p>

          <p>The families of Justyna Czoska and Wojtek Kowalkowski, two of four people involved in a fatal helicopter crash on the Isle of Wight, are grappling with immense loss. Ms. Czoska's daughter expressed profound grief, while a fundraiser has been initiated to repatriate the couple's remains to Poland for burial. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch has commenced a year-long probe into the incident, which saw the aircraft spiral before crashing near Shanklin, resulting in three fatalities and one serious injury. Ms. Czoska was a well-liked riding instructor, and her employer expressed deep sadness over her sudden passing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of homeowners are delisting their properties rather than reducing prices, reflecting frustration with the slow housing market, according to a Realtor.com report. Delistings surged by 38% since early 2025, creating a potential deadlock between buyers and sellers. Many homeowners, often locked into favorable mortgage rates, are unwilling to sell at prices they deem uncomfortable, choosing to wait for market improvement. Despite a post-pandemic rise in housing inventory, steep prices and high mortgage rates continue to deter potential buyers, leading to stagnant home sales and a prolonged holding pattern in the market.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump's revived threat of a 200% tariff increase on China's supply of rare earth elements underscores the critical importance of these minerals in global manufacturing and Beijing's significant leverage in international trade negotiations. Analysts interpret this as a 'key pain point' for the United States, suggesting a potential escalation in economic tensions should trade talks falter. The comments are viewed as an 'off-the-cuff warning' in anticipation of a breakdown in discussions, reinforcing China's strategic dominance in this sector. This article highlights the delicate balance of power in the ongoing trade disputes between the two economic giants.</p>

          <p>This opinion article vehemently criticizes the NFL's mandated 'social justice' end zone messages, such as 'End Racism' and 'Inspire Change,' labeling them an 'embarrassing new low' in virtue signaling. The author contrasts the current political climate in sports with a perceived non-political NFL of past decades, lamenting the league's embrace of what is described as divisive political messaging. The article specifically targets the NFL commissioner's apology regarding Colin Kaepernick and the league's commitment of millions to address systemic racism, arguing these actions are 'born out of lies.' It suggests such initiatives alienate blue-collar fans and calls for a return to the 'purity of sports' focused on merit and athleticism.</p>

          <p>Lamborghini CEO Stephan Winkelmann reveals that even the wealthiest buyers are becoming sensitive to price increases caused by tariffs, despite the brand's robust performance. The company, which reported record revenue in 2024 and boasts a large back order, remains committed to its 'made in Italy' identity. Winkelmann also indicated a potential shift in their electric vehicle strategy, considering a hybrid option for an upcoming grand touring car due to slowing EV demand. Lamborghini continues to attract a younger, more diverse global customer base with its new plug-in hybrid models and exclusive "few-offs" strategy, carefully managing supply to maintain brand exclusivity.</p>

          <p>A Maryland resident who recently traveled to El Salvador has been diagnosed with New World screwworm, marking the first reported U.S. case directly linked to travel to a country with an ongoing outbreak. This flesh-eating parasite, a fly that lays eggs in open wounds, is rare in humans but a significant concern for livestock. The individual has since recovered, and investigators found no evidence of transmission to other people or animals. Federal health officials are actively collaborating to prevent further spread, emphasizing the importance of preventing insect bites and properly covering open wounds, especially when visiting tropical areas where the parasite is endemic.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the recent US-EU 'Framework on an Agreement on Reciprocal, Fair, and Balanced Trade' signifies Europe's capitulation to Washington's China containment strategy, effectively relegating the EU to an auxiliary role. The author contends that Brussels has surrendered its sovereignty by agreeing to enforce US export controls within its jurisdiction and implement 'economic security alignment' measures, coded references to restricting China's access to Western capital and technology. This geopolitical realignment is seen as eliminating the strategic space between Washington and Brussels that Beijing previously exploited, forcing Europe into a subordinate position in global trade policy.</p>
