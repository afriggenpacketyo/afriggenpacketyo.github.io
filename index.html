          <p>Vladimir Putin hosted Russia's Victory Day parade in Red Square, commemorating the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany, with heightened security measures following Ukrainian strikes. The event saw the attendance of China's Xi Jinping and over 20 international leaders, signaling Putin's effort to project global leadership amidst Western isolation attempts. Putin addressed the military, emphasizing Russia's commitment to truth and justice while asserting support for the "special military operation" in Ukraine. Despite a unilateral ceasefire announcement, Ukraine reported numerous attacks, rejecting the event as a "theatrical show." The presence of Xi Jinping is seen as a significant achievement for Putin, highlighting the strengthening ties between Russia and China amidst geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>President Vladimir Putin of Russia presided over a large military parade in Moscow to celebrate the 80th anniversary of his countryâ€™s victory against Nazi Germany, joined by Chinaâ€™s top leader, Xi Jinping. The event aimed to project Putin as a leader of an emerging alliance of anti-Western and nonaligned states, despite Western efforts to isolate him following the invasion of Ukraine. The parade included more than 20 international dignitaries, signaling Russiaâ€™s global clout, though the military display did not reflect Russiaâ€™s record on the battlefield. After three years of war, Russia has not achieved a decisive victory in Ukraine, and its economy has been slowing due to falling oil prices and high interest rates.</p>

          <p>New Chinese government data reveals how the ongoing trade war is reshaping global trade flows. Exports from China saw a jump last month, largely due to increased trade with Southeast Asian countries, while shipments to the United States experienced a sharp slowdown because of President Trump's tariffs. Chinese shipments to the U.S. plummeted by 21% compared to the previous year, but exports to Southeast Asian countries surged by 21%. The data suggests that Chinese factories are redirecting trade to ASEAN countries to circumvent tariffs and complete orders destined for the United States. Chinese financial regulators are prepared to boost domestic demand to weather the impact of the trade war, with the central bank cutting interest rates to encourage spending.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is defending the detainment of a Georgia college student, Ximena Arias-Cristobal, who is in the U.S. illegally, after she was arrested for traffic violations. Arias-Cristobal, a 19-year-old Mexican national, was arrested for illegally turning right on red and driving without a license. DHS stated that Arias-Cristobal admitted to being in the U.S. illegally and does not have an application pending with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The agency reiterated that many people in the U.S. illegally are being given the chance to self-deport via the Customs and Border Protection Home app, which would allow them to return to America in the future through legal avenues.</p>

          <p>A deadly terrorist attack in the Pahalgam area of Indian-administered Kashmir has escalated tensions between India and Pakistan, raising concerns of war. The nuclear-armed neighbors have exchanged missiles and drone attacks, leading to heightened security measures and civilian casualties. Pakistan accuses India of killing dozens in missile attacks, while India claims to have killed 100 terrorists in Pakistani territory. The rivalry stems from a decades-old dispute over Kashmir, a region claimed by both nations, with the conflict's roots tracing back to the partition of India in 1947. The situation remains tense, with the international community watching closely for any further escalation.</p>

          <p>India is reportedly considering a trade deal with the U.S. that could involve zero tariffs on certain imports like steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals, signaling a potential shift from its protectionist stance. Recent tariffs imposed by the U.S. have seemingly prompted India to rethink its trade policies, with negotiations reportedly progressing well. Experts suggest that loosening protectionist measures and reducing regulatory burdens are crucial for India's economic growth. While some worry about the impact on domestic manufacturing, others believe that certain sectors like steel and pharmaceuticals may not be significantly affected. The U.S. remains India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $129 billion in 2024.</p>

          <p>China's exports experienced a significant surge in April, driven by a notable increase in shipments to Southeast Asian countries, effectively offsetting a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. due to prohibitive tariffs. Exports jumped by 8.1% year-on-year, surpassing estimates, while imports only slightly declined by 0.2%. The surge in overall exports may be attributed to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced. Exports to ASEAN countries surged by 20.8%, with Vietnam and Malaysia remaining key destinations, while Indonesia and Thailand saw substantial growth in shipments from China.</p>

High energy costs plague the U.S. aluminum industry, forcing cutbacks and closures, as energy costs for U.S. aluminum smelters are significantly higher than those in Canada and other regions.

          <p>Several household brands, including Pandora, Puma, and Hugo Boss, are reassessing their pricing strategies in the U.S. in response to President Trump's tariffs. The companies are considering cost optimization, altering supply chains, and revising sales forecasts amidst trade policy uncertainty. Retailers, particularly those reliant on manufacturing in Asia, are warning of potential price increases across the industry if tariffs remain in effect. Uncertainty surrounding tariffs, recession risks, and immigration policy are dampening consumer spending in the U.S., prompting companies to monitor the situation closely.</p>

          <p>Judith Robbins, who manages holiday lettings in Blackpool, faces potential bankruptcy after her properties were reclassified as "second homes," resulting in a significant council tax debt. The reclassification, under new tax rules, has increased her annual tax bill substantially, making it difficult for her to sustain her business. This change is part of a government crackdown on second homes and holiday lets, aimed at addressing housing shortages in coastal communities. The situation is affecting other business owners in Blackpool, who are considering selling their properties due to the increased financial burden.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has hinted at potential reductions in U.S. tariffs on goods from China as top trade officials prepare for talks.

Despite the positive signals, analysts caution that systemic frictions between the U.S. and China may not be resolved quickly, and any tariff cuts are likely to be minor.</p>
