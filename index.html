          <p>The Trump administration announced its withdrawal from federal oversight plans for the Minneapolis Police Department just before the five-year anniversary of George Floydâ€™s death, sparking dismay from officials and residents. The oversight aimed to end violent, racist, and unconstitutional practices within the department. Minneapolis officials oppose the withdrawal and pledge to continue the reforms outlined in the federal agreement, despite the Trump administration's decision to pull out. The Minneapolis police union welcomed the decision, stating that additional oversight is unnecessary, but acknowledged the need to rebuild community trust, with the article noting that the city had made strides in improving police practices, though challenges remain. </p>

          <p>The UK is set to sign a deal with Mauritius, granting the latter sovereignty over the Chagos Islands while allowing the UK and US to continue operating a strategically important military base on Diego Garcia for 99 years. In exchange, Mauritius will receive a multi-billion pound payment, with the UK government yet to disclose the exact cost to taxpayers. The Chagos Archipelago was separated from Mauritius in 1965, and Mauritius argues it was illegally forced to give away the islands for independence in 1968. The Labour government argues that the deal guarantees the future of the military base, which is essential to the UK's security and its relationship with the US.</p>

          <p>President Trump is pressuring conservative Republicans to support the budget package, which contains his second-term agenda, as House leaders aim for a vote despite resistance from fiscal conservatives and blue-state Republicans. House Speaker Mike Johnson described the meeting between Trump and the House Freedom Caucus as productive, though some conservatives dispute the characterization of the changes as minor.

          <p>FEMA's acting Administrator David Richardson rescinded the agency's strategic plan less than two weeks before the Atlantic hurricane season, citing that the plan's goals and objectives bear no connection to FEMA accomplishing its mission. A new strategy for 2026-2030 will be developed this summer, tying directly to FEMA executing its Mission Essential Tasks. One FEMA official described the strategic plan as the agency's "organizational backbone," and the removal of the Office of Resilience Strategy could result in FEMA operating as triage instead of mitigating future damage before it happens.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston ruled that the Trump administration violated an order barring officials from deporting people to countries not their own without adequate notice. The ruling came after eight immigrants were deported on a flight initially said to be headed to South Sudan, with officials refusing to disclose the final destination. The judge, Brian E. Murphy, found that the men were given insufficient notice and that the administration's actions violated the court's order. The flight carrying the deportees landed in Djibouti, and the judge ordered that the men be provided access to a lawyer and an interview to express fears of being sent to a dangerous country.</p>

Current efforts focus on killing mosquitoes with insecticide, but mosquitoes have become resistant, making this new method potentially more effective.</p>

          <h2>Appraisal Institute Removes Vice President After Sexual Assault Allegations</h2>

          <p>The Appraisal Institute's national board voted to remove Craig Steinley from his role as vice president following allegations of sexual assault from multiple women. The move came after a New York Times investigation revealed these allegations, including a $412,000 settlement paid by the organization to a former employee. Steinley, through his lawyer, denied the allegations and called the decision retaliatory. The Appraisal Institute is now facing multiple lawsuits related to Steinleyâ€™s alleged conduct, including wrongful termination and sexual assault claims.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 19:02:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are advocating for the UK's NHS to offer additional scans to women with very dense breasts to improve cancer detection rates. A Cambridge University-led study found that alternative scanning methods could significantly increase the number of cancers detected in this group, which is at higher risk. Traditional mammograms are less effective for dense breasts due to the similar appearance of cancers and dense tissue on x-rays. The study suggests that enhanced mammograms and fast MRI scans could identify thousands of extra cancers each year, potentially saving hundreds of lives.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration defended its tariffs before a trade court in New York, arguing that removing the levies would "completely kneecap" the president amid trade talks with China. The lawsuit challenges the legality of Trump's use of a "national emergency" under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify the tariffs. The administration argued that the president's emergency declarations are not subject to judicial review, asserting that only Congress can intervene.</p>

          <p>USC is advocating for a one-year renewal of its annual football series with Notre Dame, extending through the fall of 2026, due to uncertainty surrounding the future format of the College Football Playoff. USC's leaders want clarity on the number of automatic qualifiers guaranteed to the Big Ten before committing to a long-term extension of the rivalry. Notre Dame, however, seeks a long-term agreement. USC officials see no reason to commit long term to the Notre Dame matchup without assurances they wouldnâ€™t be punished for scheduling such a marquee nonconference matchup.</p>

          <p>After the Trump administration wrongfully deported Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man, to El Salvador, a fierce debate erupted among officials in three cabinet agencies.

The documents show how Trump officials, from the start, tried to keep Mr. Abrego Garcia out of the reach of the American judicial system.</p>

          <p>States and cities along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts are entering hurricane season with uncertainty due to significant cuts at federal agencies, which are essential for weather forecasts, emergency response, and long-term recovery.
