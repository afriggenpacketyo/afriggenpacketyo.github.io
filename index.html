          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 14:29:19 EDT</div>

          <p>President Trump announced that National Security Advisor Mike Waltz will be nominated as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, a move following scrutiny over Waltz's Signal chat mishap. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as interim National Security Advisor while continuing his role at the State Department. Sources indicate that Trump had grown frustrated with Waltz after a reporter was inadvertently added to a Signal chat where top officials discussed a U.S. military strike on Houthi rebels in Yemen. Trump defended Waltz after the incident, but the change reflects a desire for tighter control over national security communications.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas permanently barred the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans deemed criminals from the Southern District of Texas. Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr. ruled that the White House's use of the 18th-century wartime law was illegal, stating that claims about a Venezuelan gang did not constitute an "invasion." The ruling, while limited to the Southern District of Texas, could influence other cases involving the Alien Enemies Act. The American Civil Liberties Union praised the decision, emphasizing that the president cannot declare an invasion and invoke wartime authority during peacetime, which is what the judge is saying in this article.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eli Lilly reported strong first-quarter revenue and earnings, driven by high demand for its weight loss and diabetes drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. However, the company lowered its full-year profit guidance due to charges related to acquiring an oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. Eli Lilly maintained its sales guidance, which includes existing tariffs as of May 1, but not planned levies on pharmaceuticals. Shares of Eli Lilly fell after CVS Health chose Novo Nordisk's Wegovy as its preferred weight loss medication, creating a competitive challenge for Zepbound. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services redirected $500 million from research into next-generation COVID-19 vaccines to a single influenza vaccine project linked to Trump's former acting head of the National Institutes of Health.

The deal, valued at roughly $200 million, is expected to close in the third quarter. Emanuel, previously Endeavor’s CEO, became executive chairman of Endeavor’s WME Group earlier this year after the company was taken private by Silver Lake. The move reflects Endeavor's streamlining away from a broad media empire to focus on core assets, while Emanuel pursues his personal interests in the art world.</p>

          <p>At the Robotics Summit, US robot makers are hoping to beat China in the humanoid robot race, but President Trump's tariffs are a concern. While tariffs were not on the official agenda, they were a major topic of discussion, with companies looking for domestic supplies of parts to develop US-based robots for automating factories and warehouses. Elon Musk warned investors that China's restrictions on rare earth magnets will delay Tesla's Optimus robots, while some humanoid makers see potential opportunities in the geopolitical shifts.</p>

          <p>The Football Association's decision to ban transgender women from playing women's football has sparked controversy, with trans woman Washington expressing shock and concern that it effectively excludes them from the sport. She argues there are not enough transgender people to form their own leagues and that returning to men's football could be dangerous. The FA offers therapy and suggests alternative roles in the game, but this is seen as inadequate by those affected, as detailed in this article.</p>
