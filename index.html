          <p>Angela Suggs, the athletic director for Florida A&M, turned herself in to police after being accused of stealing over $24,000 from her previous employer, the Florida Sports Foundation. Suggs faces felony grand theft and scheme to defraud charges, as well as misdemeanor counts of false claims on travel vouchers. The investigation was initiated by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement following a criminal referral. Florida A&M is monitoring the situation, noting that the allegations are unrelated to her current duties. Suggs was hired by Florida A&M around the same time the investigation began and has been the CEO of the Florida Sports Foundation for the past seven years.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is deploying an additional 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles to support ICE operations and federal law enforcement. This action effectively doubles the Guard presence in the city, supplementing the 2,000 troops already mobilized and the 700 active-duty Marines activated to assist. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move as reckless and politically motivated, asserting that the initial troops remain unused in federal buildings. The deployment follows days of protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests, with the federal government accusing local authorities of insufficient action against violent clashes.</p>

          <p>A former chair of the Environment Agency has warned about the threat of toxic chemicals in sewage sludge spread on farmers' fields. The sludge, used as a cheap fertilizer, may contain cancer-linked chemicals, microplastics, and other industrial pollutants. Efforts to update regulations to include new contaminants have been continually frustrated, raising concerns about long-term soil contamination and potential harm to human health. The water industry is reportedly concerned that farmers may stop accepting the sludge due to these issues.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advises investors to wait for a pullback before buying Circle Internet stock, citing its recent surge in value. He acknowledges that Circle Internet is a solid company and its USDC stablecoin is more transparent than Tether's USDT. However, Cramer believes the stock has become too hot and is linked to the volatile crypto ecosystem (not investment advice). He warns that the IPO market is getting a little crazy and investors should be cautious.</p>
