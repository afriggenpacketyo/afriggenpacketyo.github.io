          <p>Former President Trump has endorsed Jack Ciattarelli in the Republican primary for New Jersey governor, potentially solidifying Ciattarelli's chances. Ciattarelli, who narrowly lost to the Democratic governor in 2021, has openly courted Trump's support after initially distancing himself. The endorsement could be a liability in the general election, given New Jersey's left-leaning tendencies and Trump's unpopularity in the state. Ciattarelli expressed his honor in receiving Trump's endorsement and emphasized the need to unite the party to win in November and address affordability and safety concerns in New Jersey.</p>

          <p>A new book alleges that Joe Biden's decision to stay in the 2024 presidential election race for too long negatively impacted Kamala Harris's campaign after Biden's poor debate performance. David Plouffe, a former Obama campaign aide, is quoted criticizing Biden's decision, claiming it created a "fucking nightmare" for Harris. The book details concerns about Biden's cognitive abilities and efforts to shield him from scrutiny. It also recounts attempts by prominent figures to persuade Biden to step aside, warning of the potential damage to his legacy if he lost to Trump. Ultimately, Biden endorsed Harris after stepping aside, but the authors argue it was too late to prevent Trump's return to the White House.</p>

          <p>President Trump appointed Todd Blanche, his former personal lawyer, as the acting librarian of Congress, leading to immediate resistance from staff. The staff refused access to Justice Department officials chosen by Blanche for senior positions, citing the need for congressional input. This action led to a standoff and highlighted the ongoing conflict between Congress and the White House over authority. Representative Joseph D. Morelle criticized the move as a "power-hungry assault on the legislative branch" and called for an investigation into unauthorized access to congressional data.</p>

          <p>A group of white South Africans has arrived in the US and been granted refugee status under a plan supported by President Trump, who has stated that the Afrikaner minority is facing racial discrimination and a "genocide." The South African government has denied these claims, asserting that the group does not meet the criteria for refugee status. Critics, including Human Rights Watch, have condemned the move as a racially motivated policy, pointing to the denial of refuge for many black and Afghan refugees. The Episcopal Church has announced it will no longer work with the federal government on refugee settlement due to this perceived preferential treatment.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's attempt to fire three Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) board members, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) sought to review CPB's operations. CPB leaders rejected this request, citing federal law that establishes the organization's independence from the government. These actions come amid a broader effort by the Trump administration to defund public broadcasters like PBS and NPR. Court documents reveal that a DOGE staffer requested a meeting to discuss assigning a team to the CPB, but CPB's general counsel reiterated that the executive branch has no supervisory role over the organization.</p>

          <p>A cache of secret Nazi documents seized during World War II was recently discovered in the basement of Argentina's Supreme Court. The documents, intended to promote Adolf Hitler's ideology in Argentina, arrived in 1941 aboard a Japanese steamer. Argentinian customs officials had previously warned that allowing the packages into the country without inspection could threaten Argentina's neutrality in the war. The contents of the boxes are now being scanned, digitized, and reviewed to determine what information they contain about the Holocaust and other aspects of the regime.</p>

The administration's plan to accept a luxury jet from the Qatari royal family, which would later be transferred to Trump's presidential foundation, exemplifies this trend. Other instances include Trump's meme cryptocurrency, which allows investors to enrich him, and the auctioning off of access to him through sales of the coin. Additionally, the administration has disbanded a Justice Department unit focused on cryptocurrency crimes and narrowed enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, raising further concerns about conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose and then walk back triple-digit tariffs on Chinese products highlights both the power and limitations of U.S. trade policy. While the tariffs initially brought trade to a standstill, causing companies to reroute business and shutter factories, they proved too painful for American businesses to sustain. Trade talks in Geneva resulted in an agreement to reduce levies, with Chinese imports facing a minimum tax of 30% and China lowering its import duty on American goods to 10%. However, the agreement did not generate any immediate concessions from China other than a commitment to keep talking, raising questions about the value of the trade disruptions.</p>

          <h2>Health Secretary Kennedy Targets Chemicals in Food Supply</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 18:33:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. believes toxic chemicals in food are behind the U.S. explosion in rates of obesity and a range of other chronic illnesses. He intends to rid the U.S. food supply of nine chemicals â€” all petroleum-based, synthetic food dyes â€” in as soon as 18 months. While Kennedy has faced criticism for embracing pseudoscience, concerns about chemicals in food are valid. The U.S. allows food companies to self-certify the safety of many chemicals without prior FDA approval, and safety studies often examine single chemicals in isolation, not how they might interact with one another.</p>

Al Jazeera's bureau chief noted that the broadcaster's offices would not immediately reopen due to a separate Israeli military order. Tensions between Israel and Al Jazeera have been high, particularly during the conflict in Gaza, where the broadcaster has provided extensive coverage.</p>
