          <p>The death toll from catastrophic flooding in Texas has climbed to at least 78, with dozens more people still missing. State officials confirmed the grim numbers, with Kerr County being the most severely impacted area. In response to the unfolding tragedy, President Trump has signed a major disaster declaration for the county, enabling the deployment of federal resources, including FEMA and the U.S. Coast Guard, to aid in extensive search and recovery operations. The situation remains critical as emergency crews continue their work.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Organizers at Wimbledon have issued an apology after the electronic line-calling system on Centre Court was mistakenly deactivated during a fourth-round match. The error resulted in three missed calls in a single game between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal, with one particularly crucial point having to be replayed. Pavlyuchenkova, who ultimately won the match, expressed frustration, questioning why the chair umpire did not overrule the system's failure. The All England Club attributed the incident to human error and has since reviewed its operational procedures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the relationship between Hong Kong and mainland China is hampered by a persistent lack of mutual understanding. Contrary to early assumptions, increased economic and social exchange has not necessarily led to a deeper appreciation of each other's political and cultural intricacies. The author suggests that both Beijing and Hong Kong residents have made misjudgments that have complicated the "one country, two systems" framework. The piece concludes that fully grasping this complex dynamic is essential for contemplating what has gone wrong and how to navigate the city's future.</p>

          <p>Police in the Turks and Caicos Islands discovered a man's body in a state of decomposition while conducting a search for Brian Tarrence, a 51-year-old American tourist who went missing in late June.

This comes after Canada passed a bill to speed up the approval process for major natural resource projects.

          <p>Leaders from the BRICS group of developing nations gathered in Rio de Janeiro, where they reaffirmed their commitment to multilateral diplomacy and criticized the current state of global governance. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva condemned what he called the "unparalleled collapse of multilateralism." The bloc also voiced serious concerns over the United States' "indiscriminate" tariff policies, stating they are inconsistent with WTO rules and harm global economic prospects. Notably, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin were not in physical attendance.</p>

          <p>The devastating flash floods in central Texas, which have claimed dozens of lives, underscore the difficulties of predicting such extreme weather in a changing climate. An analysis shows the rainfall intensity was a once-in-500-year event, overwhelming a region known as "flash flood alley." While the National Weather Service issued timely warnings, the sheer volume of rain surpassed initial forecasts, highlighting the limitations of current technology in pinpointing the exact location and severity of such deluges. The event serves as a stark example of a complex, compound tragedy becoming more frequent.</p>

          <p>The BRICS nations issued a joint declaration at their Rio summit condemning recent military strikes on Iran and the rise of unilateral trade tariffs, though the document carefully avoided directly naming the United States or Israel. The statement expressed "grave concern" over the attacks on Iran and called for a de-escalation of violence in the Middle East. On trade, it criticized measures that "distort trade and are inconsistent with WTO rules," a clear reference to U.S. policy. This diplomatic wording highlights the bloc's effort to present a united front while navigating sensitive geopolitical issues.</p>

          <p>A federal jury has acquitted music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs of the most serious charges he faced, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, which could have resulted in a life sentence. His lawyer reported that Combs received a standing ovation from fellow inmates upon returning to jail. The defense team successfully argued that while Combs was a flawed domestic abuser, his actions did not constitute trafficking. Combs remains incarcerated, having been convicted on lesser prostitution-related charges, and will receive credit for time served.</p>

The win came after his teammate, Oscar Piastri, who had led for much of the race, received a controversial 10-second penalty for erratic driving during a safety-car restart. The dramatic race, which featured multiple incidents and changing weather conditions, also saw Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg achieve a surprise first-ever podium finish.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has stated that countries without a trade agreement with the U.S. will see tariffs revert to their April levels on August 1. This announcement clarifies the timeline following the expiration of a 90-day pause on new tariffs, which ends this week. Bessent emphasized that this is not a new deadline but a firm date for implementation, putting pressure on trading partners to finalize negotiations. The administration will reportedly send letters to about a dozen countries, notifying them that existing tariff rates will be reinstated if deals are not reached. (not investment advice)</p>

In anonymous messages shared with the BBC, the officer described a collapse of Hamas's command structure due to months of Israeli strikes that have killed most of its leadership. He stated that a security vacuum has emerged, which is now being filled by armed clans and criminal gangs. This internal account paints a picture of disintegration, suggesting that lawlessness is rampant as Hamas's ability to govern has been severely crippled.</p>
