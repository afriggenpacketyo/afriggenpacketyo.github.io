          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called for Iran to return to the negotiating table after the US bombed nuclear sites in the country. Starmer emphasized the importance of regional stability and described Iran's nuclear program as a grave threat to international security. The US strikes targeted three nuclear facilities in Iran: Natanz, Isfahan, and Fordo, prompting international concern and calls for de-escalation. Iran's foreign minister condemned the strikes as outrageous and warned of lasting consequences, while the UN Secretary-General labeled them a dangerous escalation, raising the stakes in an already tense region. The global community is now closely watching Iran's response and the potential for further conflict. </p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that Japan is closely monitoring developments in the Middle East following US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. Ishiba emphasized the importance of de-escalating the situation and blocking Iran's nuclear development. Japan has traditionally maintained amicable ties with Iran while maintaining a strong security alliance with the United States. The Prime Minister instructed officials to closely monitor the situation and take necessary measures to ensure energy supplies are not impacted, as Japan relies heavily on the region for crude oil. The Japanese government is holding discussions to determine its official stance on the US attacks, with a focus on regional stability.</p>

          <p>Following US attacks on Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi declared that Tehran reserves all options to defend its sovereignty. Iran launched a new wave of missile and drone strikes against Israeli military targets, prompting Israel to respond with its own missile offensives in western Iran. Araghchi condemned the US attacks as having everlasting consequences and accused the US and Israel of undermining diplomatic efforts. President Trump asserted that the strikes had completely obliterated Iran's key enrichment facilities, a claim that has not been independently verified. The attacks have dramatically escalated geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, with both sides preparing for potential further conflict.</p>

          <p>David 'Syd' Lawrence, a former England and Gloucestershire fast bowler, has died at the age of 61 after being diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND) last year. Lawrence was the first British-born black cricketer to represent England and was appointed MBE in the King's Birthday Honours earlier this month for raising money and awareness of MND. During his 16-year career at Gloucestershire, he played five Test matches for England and took 625 wickets in 280 matches. Lawrence was an inspirational figure both on and off the cricket field, leaving behind a legacy of sporting achievement and advocacy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Medication abortion, involving the use of pills to terminate a pregnancy, now accounts for 63% of all abortions in the United States. The method has become more prevalent due to factors like the COVID-19 pandemic and the overturning of Roe v. Wade, leading doctors to explore safe abortion options outside of clinical settings. The FDA approved mifepristone in 2000 but with stringent guidelines that have since been relaxed, making it easier for patients to access the medication. Studies have shown that self-managed medication abortion is a safe and effective option in the first trimester, supported by organizations like the World Health Organization and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Despite increasing restrictions in some states, self-managed abortion is becoming more accessible through telehealth and informal networks, changing the landscape of abortion access in the U.S.</p>

Maryam Rajavi, president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, echoed these sentiments, asserting that Khamenei must step down.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Israel's attacks on Iran continue, speculation rises about the possibility of regime change in Tehran, but historical examples suggest such interventions often lead to disastrous outcomes. Experts warn that foreign-imposed regime change violates international law and frequently results in power vacuums, violence, and instability. The article cites Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya as cautionary tales where attempted regime changes led to prolonged conflict and instability. Eckart Woertz notes that a ground force would be required to force a change of government in Iran, and there is no strong rebel movement within Iran capable of toppling the current regime. The article emphasizes that aerial bombardment alone is unlikely to achieve regime change, and the consequences could be severe.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik's conviction for the murder of her husband Bob was overturned after she spent two decades in prison, fighting for her freedom. Working with Loyola Project for the Innocent, new DNA testing revealed that some blood-like stains in the couple's bedroom were not blood at all, and foreign male DNA was found on items such as the rope around Bob's neck. The San Diego County District Attorney's Office recommended her conviction be overturned due to the new evidence, and although they initially decided to retry her, the charges were eventually dropped. Dorotik, now free, is working to rebuild her life and advocate for other incarcerated women, hoping to address systemic issues within the legal system.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese studies have highlighted the potential of using the spleen as a hub for treating diabetes through cell transplantation. Researchers at Nanjing University found that shielding islet cells could improve their survival after being transplanted into the spleen to treat type 1 diabetes. The spleen, considered a promising long-term survival site, could be engineered into a transplant hub with the help of nanoparticles. These findings suggest that the spleen could become an ideal organ for islet transplantation, offering a new approach to managing diabetes, which affects millions worldwide.</p>

          <p>Stephanie Fagan and Jessica Pelley, separated by the tragic murder of the Pelley family in 1989, rekindled their friendship after 20 years. Stephanie grieved not only for the loss of the Pelley family but also for the loss of her friend Jessica, who was sent to live with relatives and cut off from her Indiana friends. After years of searching, Stephanie found Jessica (now Jessi Toronjo) through Facebook in 2009. The two women reconnected and discovered a shared history and deep bond, eventually realizing that Jessi had unknowingly taken flowers from the Pelley family graves that Stephanie had placed there during Jeff Pelley's trial, solidifying their connection.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the US conducted a successful bombing attack on three nuclear sites in Iran, with Israel claiming full coordination in planning the strikes. Iranian officials confirmed the strikes but denied major damage. The US bombed Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, using GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) to target Fordo's underground facility. The Iranian Atomic Energy Organization condemned the bombing as a violation of international law, while the IAEA reported no increase in radiation levels. Iran has warned of everlasting consequences and is considering its response, with potential options including doing nothing, retaliating swiftly, or retaliating later, raising concerns about regional escalation.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has taken a significant gamble by ordering US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, banking on the obliteration of these sites and Iran's inability or unwillingness to retaliate effectively. The best-case scenario would involve Iran adopting dialogue and de-escalation, reminiscent of the aftermath of Qassem Soleimani's assassination. If Iran manages to hit a US base, the situation could escalate rapidly. Trump's decision marks a dramatic shift from his campaign pledge against foreign wars, and he must now demonstrate that this was a decisive act to bring peace, with the success of this gamble depending on both military outcomes and political support.</p>
