          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered a defiant address on the nation's 34th Independence Day, vowing to continue fighting for freedom. The day was marked by celebrations in Kyiv, which included pledges of continued military and financial support from international allies like Canada, the United States, and several European nations. Simultaneously, the solemn occasion was punctuated by the realities of war, as Russia launched widespread drone attacks overnight and Ukraine reported a fire at a Russian nuclear power plant, which it attributed to a Ukrainian drone strike. The events underscore the country's struggle for sovereignty while celebrating its 1991 independence from the Soviet Union.</p>

          <p>In academic papers published ahead of China's 80th-anniversary Victory Day parade, Chinese experts have downplayed the United States' contribution to World War II while elevating the role of the Soviet Union. This narrative shift portrays Soviet support as crucial while accusing Western allies of attempting to erase the USSR's anti-fascist efforts. The critique, originating from an institution with official ties, aligns with a broader governmental push to recenter the WWII narrative around the Communist Party of China and Soviet forces. The upcoming parade in Beijing, with Russian President Vladimir Putin as a key guest, further highlights the strengthening Sino-Russian alignment.</p>

          <p>Europe's largest street party, the Notting Hill Carnival, began in west London with its vibrant children's parade, featuring musicians and dancers in elaborate costumes. The festivities officially started at dawn with the traditional J'ouvert celebration, where attendees covered the streets in bright paint and powder. Now in its 56th year, the annual event maintains its cultural and historical significance. A 72-second silence is planned for both days of the carnival to commemorate the 72 victims of the Grenfell Tower fire and others who have died in the community, including Kelso Cochrane, whose 1959 murder was a catalyst for the event's creation.</p>

          <p>Target has announced that company veteran Michael Fiddelke will succeed Brian Cornell as CEO, a move that was met with a significant stock price drop and skepticism from Wall Street. Analysts noted that investors had hoped for an external candidate with fresh perspectives to address the retailer's recent sales and profit struggles. Fiddelke, who rose from an intern to CEO over two decades, inherits a company facing numerous challenges, including the need to improve grocery pricing, overhaul its supply chain, and revitalize its brand image. His success will depend on his ability to implement swift and significant changes to a strategy that many feel is no longer working. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The head of Russia's state atomic energy corporation, Rosatom, stated that Moscow must improve its nuclear capabilities to counter what he described as "colossal threats" to the nation's existence. These comments emphasize the nuclear arsenal's role as both a "shield and a sword" for guaranteeing Russian sovereignty amid a tense geopolitical climate. The statement comes shortly after a summit between Presidents Trump and Putin, where hopes for a de-escalation in Ukraine have since faded. This rhetoric adds to global security concerns as the New START treaty, the last remaining nuclear arms control agreement between the U.S. and Russia, is set to expire in 2026.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, former EPA administrator Gina McCarthy argues that despite the Trump administration's focus on fossil fuels and disregard for climate risks, the fight against climate change is advancing robustly at other levels. She highlights that numerous states, cities, and corporations are independently pursuing clean energy goals, driven by economic benefits and public demand. Citing examples like record solar growth in Texas and Florida, McCarthy asserts that these sub-national and private sector efforts ensure the U.S. remains engaged in climate solutions. This momentum demonstrates that American leadership on climate is not solely dependent on federal policy.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the most effective application of artificial intelligence is not as a tool for full automation but as a collaborative partner that enhances human expertise. Using examples from radiology and aviation, it illustrates that prematurely automating complex jobs can lead to errors and skill decay. Instead, AI should be designed as a 'collaboration tool,' like a pilot's heads-up display, that complements human strengths such as context, intuition, and ethical judgment. This approach leverages AI's ability to process vast data while keeping human experts in control, leading to better outcomes and avoiding the pitfalls of flawed automation.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) reveals that the organization's growth is hampered by a deep internal rift between two main factions. One wing, aligned with figures like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, pursues a mass-politics strategy of electing socialists as Democrats. The other is a more radical, sectarian wing with extremist views that often rejects electoral politics and democratic norms, leading to internal conflicts over endorsements and strategy. This fundamental disagreement prevents the DSA from forming a cohesive national identity and effectively leveraging its membership to achieve significant political power on a larger scale.</p>

          <p>A personal essay explores the profound and often overlooked benefits for parents who read aloud to their infants from birth. The author recounts her experience of sharing everything from Romantic poetry to simple board books with her newborn, discovering that the practice was as much for her as for him. She argues that reading aloud becomes a tool for parents to connect with their children and interpret their earliest responses and developmental cues. This shared activity transforms the act of reading into a foundational experience, helping parents learn to 'read' their child's emerging personality while guiding them in making sense of the world.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic posits that tennis is an ideal lifetime sport due to its comprehensive health benefits that extend well into old age. The sport provides a full-body, aerobic workout that improves bone density and has been linked to a significantly longer life expectancy compared to other activities. Beyond physical advantages, tennis demands complex motor coordination, quick decision-making, and spatial awareness, which enhances cognitive functions like reaction time and balance. As a relatively safe and accessible sport, its combination of physical and mental challenges makes it uniquely effective for maintaining long-term health and well-being.</p>

          <p>A new book, "The First and Last Bank," proposes a novel approach to climate change by creating community-based carbon banks. The concept involves treating excess atmospheric carbon as a valuable, almost sacred commodity, similar to how the U.S. government hoards gold in Fort Knox. In practice, local banks would accept organic waste, convert it into a stable carbon form called biochar, and issue depositors a digital currency in exchange. This grassroots economic model aims to incentivize carbon sequestration without relying on government mandates, creating a system where environmental action has direct, localized financial value.</p>

The disaster exposed catastrophic failures in the levee system, designed by the Army Corps of Engineers, and a severely flawed government response at all levels. While a nearly $15 billion project has rebuilt the city's flood defenses, the slow recovery and incomplete repopulation serve as a stark reminder of the storm's impact. As climate change increases the frequency of extreme weather, the article questions whether the hard-learned lessons from Katrina on preparedness and federal responsibility have truly been integrated into national policy.</p>

While some retailers like Target have pledged to hold prices on certain items, economists predict that the costs will inevitably be passed on to consumers.

In response, California Governor Gavin Newsom and legislative leaders have fast-tracked a ballot measure to enact a counter-gerrymander favoring Democrats.

          <p>A new UC Berkeley IGS poll conducted for the Los Angeles Times indicates that a significant majority of California voters, 69%, disapprove of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement policies in the state. The sentiment is especially strong among Democrats, with 95% disapproving, and a majority of voters believe that recent raids have unfairly targeted Latinos. The poll highlights a deep partisan and emotional divide, with 64% of all respondents feeling rage or sadness over the enforcement actions, while 65% of Republicans reported feeling hopeful. The findings reflect the intense polarization surrounding immigration issues within the state.</p>

          <p>A small, lightning-sparked fire on the Grand Canyon's North Rim, which officials were managing as a beneficial "good fire," exploded into a massive inferno after an unexpected wind shift. The blaze, now the largest in the U.S. this year, destroyed over 70 structures, including the historic Grand Canyon Lodge. The incident has triggered intense scrutiny and investigations into the National Park Service's decision to let the fire burn during a hot, dry period. This disaster represents a significant setback for advocates of prescribed burns and modern fire science, who now fear a public and political backlash against a key ecological management tool.</p>

This grand prize now ranks as the 10th largest in the history of the lottery. While no one won the jackpot, tickets sold in Maine, Massachusetts, and South Dakota won prizes of $1 million or $2 million for matching the five white balls. The massive prize pool is the result of 36 consecutive drawings without a grand prize winner, building excitement for what could be a life-changing win for a lucky player.</p>

          <p>The Nigerian military has announced that a series of air strikes in the country's northeast, near the border with Cameroon, resulted in the deaths of 35 jihadists. The operation was conducted to preempt a planned attack by the militants on ground troops stationed in the area. This action is part of Nigeria's long-running and multifaceted conflict against extremist groups like Boko Haram and its offshoot, ISWAP. The announcement comes amid growing concerns from prominent Nigerians about "war-time levels of slaughter" in the country, highlighting the persistent and deadly security challenges facing the nation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released a list of "objectionable" artworks and content within the Smithsonian Institution, targeting pieces that explore themes of race, immigration, and sexuality. This follows a directive for several museums to submit their plans for a "comprehensive review" to align with the administration's cultural directives. Artists and scholars whose work was singled out have responded with a mix of shock and defiance, with some calling the attention a "badge of honor." Critics fear the move is a form of censorship reminiscent of authoritarian tactics and will create a chilling effect on artistic expression and museum curation.</p>

          <p>This article profiles six ordinary Americans who successfully accumulated over $1 million in their 401(k) retirement accounts, often without high-income salaries. Their shared strategies include starting to save at a young age, consistently contributing a percentage of their income, and always taking full advantage of their employer's matching funds. The stories emphasize the power of long-term, uninterrupted compounding and disciplined saving, demonstrating that achieving significant retirement wealth is possible through perseverance. A key piece of advice is to treat retirement contributions as a non-negotiable expense and to avoid tapping into the funds before retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article posits that President Trump's policy decisions, both at home and abroad, are consistently guided by his personal interests rather than a coherent ideology. His recent summit with Vladimir Putin, where he appeared to accept the Russian leader's views on U.S. elections, is cited as a prime example of this conflation. The analysis notes Trump's tendency to use foreign policy to address domestic grievances and to inject campaign-style rhetoric into diplomatic meetings, such as his criticisms of Joe Biden during a visit from Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. This approach breaks with presidential norms and blurs the lines between national security and personal validation.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that China and India are at a critical juncture where they can reset their relationship from one of rivalry to partnership. Recent constructive engagements, such as high-level visits and discussions to resume direct flights, signal a potential thaw. The author suggests that amid global uncertainties and shifting alliances, it is in Beijing's interest to adopt a pragmatic approach and view New Delhi as a collaborator in reforming the global order. Overcoming the long-standing competitive dynamic, rooted in border disputes and leadership aspirations, is crucial for both nations to maximize their interests and foster regional stability.</p>

This represents the largest-ever contingent from Taiwan to join the annual U.S. National Guard-led drills. The public disclosure of these figures marks a significant shift from the previous policy of ambiguity regarding Taiwan's involvement in American military exercises. This development is widely interpreted as a clear signal of deepening defense cooperation between Washington and Taipei, occurring despite the Trump administration's often transactional foreign policy approach.</p>

The festival organizers initially cited a no-flag policy and a "discriminatory" chant but have since apologized to the band for their handling of the situation.
