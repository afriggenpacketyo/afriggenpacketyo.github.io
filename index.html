          <p>Talks surrounding Newcastle striker Alexander Isak's potential transfer to Liverpool have stalled, with no new offers made since Liverpool's initial £110m bid was rejected nearly three weeks ago. Newcastle has publicly stated Isak is not for sale but is reportedly seeking two new strikers, a move Liverpool is watching closely before potentially increasing its offer to over £120m. The situation is complicated by a challenging market for strikers, with Newcastle struggling to find suitable and affordable replacements for both Isak and the departed Callum Wilson. As the September 1st deadline approaches, the club faces the difficult choice of selling a key player or potentially reintegrating a wantaway star.</p>

          <p>Air Force Chief of Staff General David Allvin has announced he will retire in November, just two years into his four-year term. The statement released by the Air Force did not provide a reason for his early departure, though a source indicated it was a mutual decision with Air Force Secretary Troy Meink. Allvin's exit follows a series of high-profile departures from top military positions this year under the Trump administration, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Chief of Naval Operations. Allvin, a 1986 Air Force Academy graduate, has over 4,600 flight hours and previously served as the vice chief of staff.</p>

In the youth category, Aston Villa midfielder Morgan Rogers was named the young player of the year after a breakout season that saw him earn his first senior England cap.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will expand its vetting process to include reviews of applicants' social media for "anti-American" and "anti-Semitic" ideologies. This new policy aims to deny immigration benefits to individuals who express views hostile to the United States, its government, or its founding principles. The move is part of a broader effort by the administration to tighten immigration controls and deny entry to those perceived as being against U.S. foreign policy interests. The policy builds on recent measures targeting international students and their social media activity.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has confirmed it is evaluating new products following reports that it is developing a more powerful AI chip, tentatively named B30A, for the Chinese market. This comes after the U.S. government halted sales of advanced chips to China over national security concerns, which led Nvidia to create the less powerful H20 chip specifically for that market. The potential new chip would be based on the advanced Blackwell architecture, and its sale would be subject to government approval. Recently, Nvidia and AMD agreed to give the U.S. government a 15% share of their sales in China in exchange for permission to resume some business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>All-rounder Rehan Ahmed delivered a stellar performance with both bat and ball to lead the Trent Rockets to a decisive seven-wicket victory against the Manchester Originals in The Hundred. Ahmed scored an unbeaten 45 runs after taking two key wickets for just 14 runs, complementing captain David Willey's exceptional opening spell of 3-11. The Originals were restricted to a meager 98-8, a total the Rockets chased down with 26 balls remaining, significantly boosting their net run-rate. This victory solidifies the Rockets' position at second in the league table, keeping them in strong contention for a top-three finish.</p>

The news comes as Intel's stock rallied amid reports of increased government involvement and a separate $2 billion investment from SoftBank.

Meyer contrasted Michigan's punishment, which includes a fine over $20 million and a suspension for its head coach, with the harsher sanctions Ohio State received in 2011, which included a bowl ban that affected innocent players. He argued that while the NCAA was correct not to punish current Michigan players, the ruling demonstrates that the organization "as an enforcement arm no longer exists."

For years, criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, have terrorized rural communities in northwestern and central Nigeria, conducting raids, kidnappings for ransom, and looting.

          <p>S&P Global has maintained its AA+ credit rating for U.S. sovereign debt, citing an expectation that revenue from President Trump's expanded tariffs will largely offset the fiscal impact of his recent tax-and-spending legislation. The ratings agency projects that "meaningful" tariff income will counteract the weaker revenue resulting from the bill, which the CBO estimated would increase the deficit by $3.4 trillion over a decade. However, S&P warned that a rating downgrade could occur in the next few years if deficits continue to rise due to political inability to control spending or if political instability threatens U.S. institutions.

          <p>The senior living real estate market is facing a significant supply shortage as the baby boomer generation ages, creating a surge in demand. With over 4 million boomers set to turn 80 in the next five years, occupancy rates are rising rapidly while new inventory growth has fallen to its lowest point since 2006. High interest rates and construction costs are major roadblocks to new development, creating what experts call a massive supply-demand imbalance. This situation has made the sector an attractive investment, with firms like Ventas and Harrison Street investing billions and seeing strong returns due to rising rents and occupancy.

          <p>After 78 years of operation, the last remaining sugar beet processing factory in California is shutting down, a move that will eliminate hundreds of jobs and likely end sugar beet farming in the state. The Southern Minnesota Beet Sugar Cooperative, which owns the plant in Brawley, cited escalating operational costs and broader economic challenges in the U.S. sugar industry as reasons for the closure. The company will consolidate its resources at a more profitable facility in Minnesota. The closure represents a significant economic blow to the Imperial Valley, where agriculture is a primary employer.</p>

          <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has released new immunization guidelines that recommend the COVID-19 vaccine for children as young as six months, a stance that differs from current federal guidance. This follows a decision by the Trump administration to halt universal CDC recommendations for healthy children, instead advising "shared clinical decision-making." The AAP stated its updated schedule is necessary to provide clear guidance in an "environment of misinformation," noting that the CDC's advisory committee was recently overhauled with individuals known for spreading vaccine misinformation. The divergence raises concerns about insurance coverage for the shots, which often follows CDC endorsements.</p>

However, claims that the government is violating the First Amendment by impeding confidential access between detainees and their lawyers remain a "live controversy."

In response, Israel revoked the visas of Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority.

The council argued the hotel's use constituted a breach of planning law and had become a public safety risk due to rising community tensions.

          <p>A Sheraton hotel in Louisiana, part of the Marriott chain, has reportedly been used by U.S. immigration officials to detain immigrants, including families and children. This appears to contradict a public pledge Marriott made in 2019 that its properties would not cooperate with ICE or be used as detention facilities. Evidence suggests the hotel, located near a major deportation hub, has been used for this purpose since late 2023. It is unclear if Marriott has a formal contract with ICE or is aware of the practice at its franchised location, raising questions about corporate oversight and the company's commitment to its stated policy.</p>
