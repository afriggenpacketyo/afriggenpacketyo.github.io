          <p>A train traveling from Manchester to Cardiff collided with a tractor and trailer on a level crossing in Leominster, Herefordshire, causing significant disruption to rail services. While the train did not derail, several of the 56 passengers on board sustained minor injuries, and six people were assessed by medics at the scene. The incident prompted the deployment of emergency services, including an air ambulance, land ambulances, and fire crews. An investigation is underway to determine the circumstances leading up to the crash, which occurred on a farm track used by agricultural vehicles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 4-4 decision due to Justice Barrett's recusal, upheld the Oklahoma Supreme Court's ruling blocking the state's plan to establish the nation's first religious charter school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, which would have integrated Catholic teachings into its curriculum. The deadlock means the lower court's decision stands, preventing Oklahoma from using taxpayer money for the school. The ruling sets no nationwide precedent on whether the First Amendment permits states to sponsor religious charter schools, leaving the broader question open for future consideration in other cases. The lack of a majority decision means the issue may return to the Supreme Court in the future with a case from another state. </p>

          <p>Republicans in the House of Representatives narrowly passed President Trump's tax bill, which includes provisions designed to appeal to both moderate and conservative factions.

Democrats are vehemently opposed, citing concerns about cuts to the social safety net and the bill's impact on federal deficits. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would decrease resources for the lowest income households while increasing them for the highest, and investors have shown lukewarm enthusiasm, with major indexes falling amid deficit concerns.

          <p>The UK has signed an agreement to cede the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, while leasing back a crucial military base on Diego Garcia for £101 million annually. The deal, signed virtually by Sir Keir Starmer, grants Mauritius sovereignty over the islands, allowing the US and UK to continue operating the military base for an initial 99-year period. The agreement aims to safeguard the base's long-term viability and protect the UK from potential interference, though it has faced criticism from opposition politicians who question the cost and strategic implications. The High Court dismissed a legal challenge brought by Chagossian women seeking to return to the islands, excluding Diego Garcia.</p>

          <p>California has introduced revised draft regulations for implementing SB 54, the landmark plastic waste law, after Governor Newsom rejected the initial proposal. The new regulations clarify producer obligations but include broad exemptions for single-use plastics under FDA and USDA jurisdiction, such as packaging for produce, meat, and dairy. Critics argue these exemptions and the allowance of chemical recycling undermine the law's original intent to reduce plastic waste. The Attorney General has previously sued ExxonMobil over deceptive claims regarding chemical recycling. Stakeholders express concerns that the revisions favor industry interests over environmental protection.</p>

          <h2>House Approves SALT Deduction Cap Increase</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 10:15:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House of Representatives passed a bill that includes raising the federal deduction cap for state and local taxes (SALT) to $40,000, up from the current $10,000 limit, with a phase-out for incomes over $500,000. The provision, effective in 2025, aims to provide tax relief to filers in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California. However, the bill also reduces itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, potentially lowering the benefit of the higher SALT cap. The House proposal still faces potential challenges in the Senate. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican-backed legislation approved by the House does not include President Trump's suggestion to eliminate income taxes on Social Security benefits. The exclusion stems from a prohibition on making changes to the retirement program through the reconciliation process. Instead, the bill offers an extra $4,000 deduction for filers who are 65 and older, effective from 2025 to 2029, with an income threshold. Experts caution that eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits would negatively impact the program's long-term stability and Medicare's trust fund. (not investment advice)</p>
