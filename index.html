          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in Texas's Hill Country have resulted in at least 43 fatalities, with search and rescue operations ongoing for more than two dozen people still missing from a summer camp. The Guadalupe River rose approximately 26 feet in just 45 minutes, catching residents and campers by surprise in what officials are calling a "mass casualty event." Governor Greg Abbott has expanded the disaster declaration, and federal assistance has been pledged as rescue teams have saved over 850 people, some found clinging to trees to survive the deluge. The rapid and unforeseen nature of the flood has overwhelmed local communities.</p>

          <p>The reigning champion England Lionesses began their Euro 2025 title defense with a disappointing 2-1 loss to France. Pundits and players noted that the team was "bullied" in midfield and made uncharacteristic errors, leading to two first-half goals for the French side. Despite a late goal from Keira Walsh, England struggled to create chances for most of the match. The defeat puts the Lionesses in a difficult position in their group, facing must-win games against the Netherlands and Wales to ensure they advance to the knockout stages.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid's Trent Alexander-Arnold delivered an emotional tribute to his former Liverpool teammate Diogo Jota, who tragically died in a car crash at the age of 28. After assisting a goal in a Club World Cup match, Alexander-Arnold said it was "extremely difficult" to play but felt Jota "was there with me." He remembered the Portuguese forward as a close friend who "lit up the room" and would never be forgotten. The football world has come together to mourn Jota and his brother, who also died in the accident.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing ceasefire negotiations, violence persists in the Gaza Strip, where two American aid workers were injured in an attack at a food distribution site in Khan Younis. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) and the U.S. State Department blamed Hamas for the grenade attack. Concurrently, Israeli airstrikes reportedly killed 14 people in the Muwasi area, including a Palestinian doctor and his three children, according to hospital officials. These events underscore the continued danger for both civilians and humanitarian personnel in the war-torn region as diplomatic efforts proceed.</p>

          <p>Following the deadly floods in Texas, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem acknowledged public criticism regarding the timeliness of weather warnings, stating the Trump administration is working to upgrade "ancient" and "neglected" systems at the National Weather Service and NOAA. Noem explained that while a flood watch was issued, the storm's unexpected stalling led to an unprecedented and unpredictable downpour, similar to Hurricane Harvey. She conveyed that improving warning technologies to provide families with more advance notice is a priority, addressing concerns that the existing infrastructure may have failed the community.</p>

The aircraft, spotted on the Bohai Sea, features a flying-boat hull, a large v-tail, and wingtip floats, drawing comparisons to the Soviet Union's famed "Caspian Sea Monster." Analysts suggest it could be used for logistics, search and rescue, and sea control missions in the littorals, flying low to evade radar.

To overcome this, career experts advise applicants to highlight transferable skills gained from volunteering, sports teams, or even home responsibilities. They recommend keeping CVs simple and one page long, tailoring cover letters to the specific job, and preparing thoroughly for interviews. While online applications have increased competition, experts still see value in speculatively dropping off CVs at smaller local businesses to show initiative.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis suggests that President Donald Trump is strategically employing the "Madman Theory," a political doctrine where a leader feigns irrationality to coerce adversaries and allies. This approach, characterized by contradictory statements and impulsive decisions, has reshaped U.S. foreign policy, centralizing it around Trump's personality. While this tactic has yielded some results, such as compelling NATO allies to increase defense spending, its effectiveness against adversaries like Iran and Russia remains questionable.

          <p>Tech billionaire Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party, the "America Party," aiming to provide an alternative to the two-party system. The move follows a public falling out with President Donald Trump over a massive spending bill, which Musk heavily criticized. Musk suggests the party could gain significant influence by targeting a small number of key congressional seats, thereby acting as a deciding vote on contentious legislation. This development marks a new chapter in Musk's increasing involvement in the U.S. political landscape.</p>

          <p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has met with Syria's interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, as Western nations re-engage with the country following the fall of the Assad regime.

Amid concerns over recent violent attacks on minority groups and a slide towards a new form of dictatorship, Lammy stated the UK is looking "to the future." He emphasized that Britain will use its influence and humanitarian aid to encourage an inclusive, peaceful, and stable Syria.</p>

          <p>Hamas has issued a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated ceasefire proposal, signaling a potential breakthrough in the nearly 21-month conflict, though it stated further talks are needed on implementation.

However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office deemed the changes requested by Hamas "unacceptable" but confirmed it would send a negotiating team to Qatar to continue discussions, reflecting the complex and delicate nature of the ongoing diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>The UK's Charity Commission has issued a formal warning to the Nottingham Islam Information Point and disqualified one of its trustees for three years. The action followed an "inflammatory and divisive" sermon delivered by trustee Harun Abdur Rashid Holmes just days after the October 7 Hamas attacks. The sermon contained language that the regulator found was not appropriately contextualized and stoked division, amounting to misconduct. The case is one of over 300 investigated by the commission related to the Middle East conflict, highlighting the challenge of preventing charities from being misused to promote hate.</p>

          <p>Newport Beach lifeguards had an exceptionally busy Fourth of July, rescuing 350 people from dangerous surf and strong rip currents. One particularly large "monster rip current" pulled more than 10 swimmers far from shore, requiring a major rescue effort involving a police helicopter. The National Weather Service had issued warnings for dangerous swimming conditions along the Southern California coast for the holiday weekend. The incidents serve as a stark reminder of the power of the ocean, even for experienced swimmers enjoying a holiday at the beach.</p>

The raids, part of a larger operation that has rounded up over 1,600 people for deportation, have prompted ongoing protests.

The 23-year-old says she compensates for her lack of height with exceptional speed and power, skills she has honed throughout her career. After overcoming injuries and a period of being self-funded, Kartal has seen a rapid rise in the world rankings. She will now make her Centre Court debut against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, crediting her success to hard work and self-belief.</p>
