The suspect in the attack also died during the incident, which police have described as a "mass casualty" event. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police have assured the public there is no ongoing risk but have not released further details about the motive or circumstances. This event tragically occurred on the third anniversary of a similar mass stabbing in Saskatchewan.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has publicly accused the former CDC director, Susan Monarez, of lying.

Kennedy vehemently denied this during a Senate hearing, stating he never had a private meeting with her and that witnesses could corroborate his account. Monarez's lawyers have since released a statement affirming that she stands by her claims and would repeat them under oath.</p>

MGM Resorts CEO Bill Hornbuckle acknowledged that the city let the "narrative get away from us" regarding affordability, contributing to the downturn. The slump is seen as a potential leading indicator for the entire U.S. travel industry, which faces obstacles like reduced Canadian tourism and increased U.S. visa costs. Industry leaders note that macroeconomic and socio-political uncertainty are creating significant challenges for travel sector stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James is appealing a court decision that eliminated the massive financial penalty against former President Trump in his civil fraud case. A mid-level appellate court had previously ruled the nearly half-billion-dollar fine was unconstitutional due to its excessive nature, though it upheld the finding of fraud. James's office has now filed a notice to take the case to the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, seeking to have the original penalty reinstated. Mr. Trump is simultaneously appealing the non-monetary punishments from the verdict, such as bans on his corporate leadership roles in New York.</p>

          <p>During contentious Senate testimony, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made several false claims about vaccines and clashed with Democratic senators over his policy changes. He endorsed a new vaccine panel member's statement that mRNA vaccines pose a dangerous risk, a claim contrary to extensive scientific data. Kennedy also defended his decision to fire all previous members of the CDC's vaccine advisory panel, asserting he was removing conflicts of interest. The hearing highlighted a significant schism over public health policy and the scientific consensus on vaccine safety and effectiveness.</p>

          <p>The Department of Transportation has officially dropped a proposed rule that would have mandated airlines to offer cash compensation to passengers for significant flight delays and cancellations within the carrier's control. The rule, introduced under the previous administration, faced strong opposition from airline industry groups who argued it would increase ticket prices and reduce accessibility. Airlines for America, a trade group, praised the decision, viewing it as a move away from unnecessary and burdensome regulations. This leaves existing policies, such as rebooking and vouchers for meals or lodging, as the primary recourse for affected travelers.</p>

The administration's argument relies on the "major questions doctrine," which the court's conservative justices previously used to strike down Biden-era policies of vast economic significance. The petition describes the tariffs as a multi-trillion-dollar initiative, a scale that, according to the article, should compel the court to invalidate them under its own precedent.

          <p>A three-year-old German boy has emerged as a symbol of hope after being pulled alive from the wreckage of the funicular crash in Lisbon that killed 16 people. Tragically, the boy's father was reportedly killed in the accident, and his mother was injured. Eyewitnesses described the chaos of the scene, hearing a loud crash before seeing the crumpled carriage and people attempting to escape through the windows. The incident has deeply shocked the city, with public transport operator Carris suspending all funicular services pending a full technical inspection and investigation.</p>

          <p>Stephen Miran, President Trump's nominee for an open seat on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, has stated he will take an unpaid leave of absence from his White House job rather than fully resign if confirmed.

This arrangement has fueled concerns about the central bank's independence, as it would mean a Fed governor simultaneously holds a position within the executive branch, a highly unusual situation.</p>

          <p>Ford's large, gas-powered Expedition SUV is experiencing a surge in popularity, with August sales up nearly 54% year-over-year, marking the model's best performance in 21 years. This growth is a bright spot for the automaker and suggests continued strong consumer demand for traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, even as the market shifts towards EVs. While Ford's electric vehicle sales also grew, the success of the high-profit Expedition highlights the company's strategy of maintaining a diverse portfolio that includes hybrids and gas models alongside its "Model e" electric division.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. indicated that regulations expanding access to abortion pills could be reversed, claiming the previous administration had "twisted the data" on the medication's safety. During a Senate hearing, he suggested a new review of mifepristone was underway, referencing a right-wing analysis that experts have widely debunked. This comment signals a potential major policy shift that could restrict access to abortion pills, which have become a primary method for abortion access since the overturning of Roe v.

          <p>A vascular surgeon in the UK, Neil Hopper, has been sentenced to two years and eight months in prison for fraud and possessing extreme pornography. The court heard that Hopper, who had performed hundreds of amputations, used ice to self-inflict injuries on his own legs, leading to their medical amputation. He then fraudulently claimed over £466,000 from insurers, falsely stating the amputations were necessary due to sepsis. The investigation also revealed Hopper had a sexual interest in amputation and had purchased videos of body mutilation from an illicit website.</p>

          <p>Salesforce's stock price fell by more than 5% after the company issued a weaker-than-expected revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter. While its fiscal second-quarter earnings and sales narrowly beat analyst expectations, the guidance for the third quarter fell short of projections. This has deepened the stock's decline for the year, making it one of the worst performers in large-cap tech. The slump reflects investor concerns about challenges in the company's marketing and commerce product sales, as well as broader anxieties about how the rise of AI could impact the traditional software-as-a-service industry.

          <p>Michael Schill, the president of Northwestern University, has announced his resignation after three years in the role. His departure follows a period of significant turmoil, including steep federal research funding cuts of nearly $800 million initiated by the Trump administration after criticism from Republican lawmakers. These cuts forced the university to announce the elimination of approximately 425 jobs. Schill also faced intense scrutiny from conservatives over the university's handling of campus protests related to the war in Gaza, highlighting the growing political pressures facing leaders in higher education.</p>

          <p>England's higher education regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), has proposed the idea of "differential fee levels" for universities based on the quality of their teaching. This could mean institutions with higher rankings for teaching excellence might be allowed to charge different tuition fees than those with lower rankings. While the government has the final say on fee caps, the suggestion introduces a new dynamic into the funding debate for UK higher education. University leaders have expressed concern, noting it is difficult to improve quality with dwindling resources, as many institutions already face financial deficits.</p>

The idea, which is being examined by officials who recently visited Estonia to study its system, is likely to reignite debates over privacy and civil liberties.</p>
