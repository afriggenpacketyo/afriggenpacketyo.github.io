          <p>The UK Attorney General's Office has referred a teenager's sentence to the Court of Appeal under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme. The 15-year-old boy was sentenced to seven years in custody for the manslaughter of 80-year-old Bhim Kohli, who died after a racially aggravated attack in Leicestershire. The victim's family had expressed disappointment with the initial punishment, feeling it did not reflect the crime's severity. A 13-year-old girl involved in the incident received a non-custodial sentence, which was not referred for review.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered evidence of a large-scale "fat factory" operated by Neanderthals 125,000 years ago at a site in Germany. The analysis of thousands of bone fragments and tools suggests these ancient humans systematically smashed animal bones and boiled them to extract nutrient-rich marrow and fat. This finding indicates a sophisticated understanding of nutrition, as a diet of lean meat alone can be dangerous. The organized process of hunting, storing carcasses, and rendering fat provides further proof that Neanderthals were more strategically advanced than once believed.</p>

          <p>Amid his feud with President Trump, Elon Musk has renewed calls to form a new political party, but experts say the process is incredibly challenging. Launching a national party would require navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws for ballot access, which are often biased toward the two major parties. The effort would also demand immense financial resources to fund signature-gathering campaigns and inevitable legal challenges. While Musk has the wealth, building a party with national reach would likely be a multi-year project, not an immediate alternative.</p>

The German Interior Minister has expressed openness to making direct agreements with the Taliban to facilitate deportations, reflecting a policy shift amid rising anti-immigrant sentiment in Germany.
