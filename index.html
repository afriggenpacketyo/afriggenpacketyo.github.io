          <p>General Motors exceeded first-quarter earnings projections, reporting $2.78 adjusted EPS versus the anticipated $2.74.  However, the company is reassessing its 2025 financial guidance and suspending stock buybacks due to rising costs and uncertainty surrounding President Trump's auto tariffs.  The tariffs, potentially reaching 25% on imported vehicles, present a significant challenge to GM's future profitability.  The company is awaiting clarity on the tariffs before making major adjustments to manufacturing plans.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch's judicial philosophy, particularly his advocacy for limiting executive power.  His views, aligned with the Federalist Society's goal of weakening the executive branch, were instrumental in his appointment.  The recent overruling of Chevron v. NRDC and the emergence of the major questions doctrine reflect Gorsuch's influence. The author suggests that Gorsuch's philosophy could now serve as a check on President Trump's actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals a correlation between Americans' trust in the Federal Reserve and which party controls the White House.  Historically, individuals tended to trust the Fed more under their own party's presidency.  However, this pattern deviated during President Trump's second term, with Republicans expressing less trust despite predicting lower inflation.  The study suggests that factors like inflation and skepticism toward technocracy influenced this shift.</p>

          <p>Proposed nearly 50% cuts to NASA's Science Mission Directorate have drawn sharp criticism.  The cuts, totaling $3.6 billion, would result in the closure of Goddard Space Flight Center and the cancellation of several major missions.  This would severely impact space science research and potentially harm national security.  The cuts contrast with the administration's stated commitment to a "golden age of science and discovery."</p>
