          <p>The Sports Bra, a pioneering women's sports bar in Portland, Oregon, has garnered a loyal following since opening in 2022. Founder Jenny Nguyen aimed to create a space where women's sports are prominently displayed and celebrated, fostering a sense of belonging for young girls interested in sports. Patrons praise the bar for making women's sports accessible and creating an enthusiastic environment. While viewership of women's sports is growing, inequalities persist, including online abuse and pay disparities. Nguyen hopes the bar's success will drive further investment and equality in women's sports, noting that this is just the beginning of the fight toward equity. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Water voles in Wales are nearing extinction, with a 90% decline in the last 30 years. To combat this, Nature Conservation Cymru is feeding them edible, biodegradable glitter to track their movements through their droppings. The glitter, safe for the voles, comes in different colors to distinguish families and their ranges. By understanding their territory, conservationists can remove invasive species or protect riverbanks to aid dispersal and survival. The team is testing this method on captive-bred voles, offering them glitter-covered apples to monitor consumption and tracking success, with hopes of reintroducing more voles into the wild. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Alberta, Canada, a vast dinosaur mass grave holds thousands of Pachyrhinosaurus bones, offering insights into their lives 72 million years ago. Paleontologists believe these dinosaurs were migrating in a large herd when a catastrophic flash flood wiped them out. The density of bones is remarkable, with up to 300 bones per square meter, making it one of North America's largest bone beds. Researchers are studying the bones to understand the species' biology, growth, and community structure. The site also contains bones of other dinosaurs like Edmontosaurus, helping build a picture of the ancient ecosystem and the devastating event that killed the herd. </p>

Fixed-asset investment also saw a rise of 4.0% for the first four months of the year. The urban unemployment rate eased to 5.1% in April.

          <p>An opinion piece in the New York Times argues that President Trump's policies are undermining American power and innovation, allowing China to surpass the United States in global leadership. While Trump focuses on trade skirmishes, China invests heavily in cutting-edge technologies and expands its manufacturing dominance. The author contends that tariffs and cuts to research funding endanger U.S. companies and push talent abroad. China, in contrast, is projected to account for nearly half of global manufacturing by 2030 and is making significant strides in AI, drug discovery, and semiconductor technology. The article warns that without a change in course, the U.S. risks becoming a diminished nation sheltered behind tariff walls. </p>

          <p>A downgrade by Moodyâ€™s of the U.S. credit rating, coupled with concerns over government debt, threatens the stability of financial markets. The downgrade reflects worries about President Trump's fiscal policies, including proposed tax cuts that could increase federal debt. This has led to declines in stock futures and a weakening of the U.S. dollar. Analysts fear the downgrade could shake the safe-haven status of Treasury bonds, potentially leading to higher premiums for U.S. debt.

          <p>An unfolding corruption investigation involving the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) has led to multiple detentions. The investigation concerns irregularities in contracts for ammunition and drones, with allegations of information being passed to defense contractors.

As NATO countries increase defense spending, managing corruption risks becomes critical.

The vote signals a temporary resolution to a revolt from hard-liners who initially opposed the bill. While the conservatives secured commitments for changes, including speeding up Medicaid work requirements and curtailing clean energy tax credits, they still believe the bill falls short. The legislation would make Trumpâ€™s 2017 tax cuts permanent, raise military spending, and cut Medicaid and clean energy subsidies. </p>

          <p>Satellite imagery reveals that Russian forces are increasing their military presence near the Finnish border, a new NATO member. The buildup includes new tents, warehouses, and renovations to fighter jet shelters. While this is not similar to the buildup before the Ukraine invasion, the moves reflect Moscow's perception of a threat. Military analysts predict the border could become a hot spot, especially in the Arctic Circle. American and Finnish troops recently held Arctic war games in the region. </p>
