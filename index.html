          <p>In a complex game of diplomatic brinkmanship, President Zelenskyy has challenged President Putin to meet face-to-face in Istanbul for peace talks. This move follows Putin's demand for negotiations and aims to involve President Trump in the process. The situation remains uncertain, with questions surrounding the likelihood of Putin's attendance and the potential for meaningful progress. Both Russia and Ukraine appear to be vying for Trump's support, adding another layer of complexity to the already tense situation.</p>

          <p>The US President Trump has made an exception for white South Africans amid his efforts to limit immigration, citing racist policies against them. However, observers argue that white South Africans are not persecuted and that the claim of land theft is unfounded. The decision has sparked controversy, with critics suggesting it is based on false narratives and serves to position Trump as a savior of white privilege. This move has also strained relations between Pretoria and Washington, particularly after South Africa's lawsuit against Israel at the International Court of Justice.</p>
