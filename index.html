          <p>China has confirmed that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will join Russian President Vladimir Putin at a significant military parade in Beijing, marking Kim's first visit in over six years. The event, commemorating the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender in WWII, is seen as a major diplomatic opportunity for Chinese leader Xi Jinping to assert influence. This gathering occurs as the U.S. attempts to broker a peace deal in Ukraine, allowing Xi to project a united front with leaders from Pyongyang and Moscow.</p>

The protest was organized by the group 'No Azure for Apartheid,' which demands that Microsoft cease its support for Israel amid the conflict in Gaza. The company stated the terminations were due to serious breaches of policy and unlawful entry into executive offices. This action follows a report that the Israeli military used Microsoft's Azure cloud infrastructure to store data related to Palestinians.</p>

          <p>A significant leadership crisis has emerged at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) after its director, Susan Monarez, refused to resign under pressure from the Trump administration. While her lawyers stated she would remain in her post, the White House announced her termination, citing a misalignment with the president's agenda. The confrontation, reportedly stemming from disagreements over vaccine policy changes, has prompted the resignation of at least four other senior CDC officials in protest of what they describe as the politicization of public health.</p>

          <p>Financial markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded mixed as investors analyzed the Bank of Korea's decision to maintain its policy rate at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting. While South Korea's Kospi saw modest gains, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index declined, and mainland China's CSI 300 also slipped. The BOK's decision was widely expected by economists, but markets remain cautious due to an uncertain trade environment, including the impact of U.S. tariffs on Indian exports, which took effect this week.

          <p>Hollywood producer David Brown has been indicted on 21 federal counts, including wire fraud and money laundering, for allegedly defrauding film and business partners out of more than $12 million. Prosecutors claim Brown siphoned funds intended for film projects into his own accounts to finance a lavish lifestyle, including luxury cars, home renovations, and even surrogacy payments. The indictment alleges he ran a "Ponzi-like scheme," using new investor money to repay previous victims while working on films like "The Fallout" and "The Apprentice."</p>

          <p>A new NATO report indicates that for the first time, all 32 member states are projected to meet the alliance's long-standing defense spending target of 2% of their GDP this year. This milestone follows substantial spending increases by previously lagging countries, spurred by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and pressure from the U.S. However, the report also reveals that only three nations—Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia—are currently meeting the new, more ambitious target of 3.5% of GDP, which was agreed upon in June.</p>

          <p>In response to a surge in threats against members of Congress, a new pilot program has been launched to bolster lawmaker security. The initiative provides a temporary increase of up to $20,000 for security upgrades at their homes and an additional $5,000 per month for hiring personal security. This move follows a series of politically motivated violent events and a U.S. Capitol Police report of nearly 9,500 threats against Congress in 2024. The program will be evaluated at the end of the fiscal year to determine its future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The market for pre-owned Tesla Cybertrucks is experiencing a significant downturn, with average prices falling nearly 30% over the past year to just over $84,000. This trend is part of a broader decline in the value of all used Tesla vehicles and a drop in new car sales for the company in 2025. Some experts attribute the slump to public perception of CEO Elon Musk and the vehicle's failure to meet initial price point expectations, which were teased at under $40,000 before its 2023 release.

          <p>Nvidia reported quarterly earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, forecasting continued strong sales growth driven by sustained demand for its artificial intelligence hardware. Despite the positive overall results and a ninth consecutive quarter of over 50% revenue growth, the company's stock declined in after-hours trading. This dip was attributed to its data center revenue falling slightly short of analyst estimates for the second consecutive period, raising some investor concerns about its primary growth engine.
