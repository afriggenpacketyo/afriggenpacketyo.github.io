          <p>A 15-year-old boy's seven-year sentence for the manslaughter of 80-year-old Bhim Kohli in Leicestershire is being referred to the Court of Appeal for being potentially too lenient. The boy subjected Kohli to a prolonged period of racial abuse and physical assault, which resulted in fatal spinal injuries. The attack, which was filmed by a 13-year-old girl, has prompted the Solicitor General to act after the victim's family expressed disappointment with the initial punishment. The girl's sentence will not be reviewed.</p>

          <p>Tyler Webb, 23, has been sentenced to a nine-year hybrid order for encouraging a vulnerable woman to self-harm and attempt suicide for his sexual gratification.

The victim, who provided extensive evidence, described his actions as "calculated psychological violence."

          <p>A powerful explosion at a gas station in southeastern Rome has injured at least 25 people, including ten first responders who were investigating a reported gas leak. The blast, which sent a massive fireball into the sky, caused widespread damage to nearby vehicles and buildings. Authorities believe the quick evacuation of a nearby sports center, where dozens of children were expected for a summer camp, prevented a much greater tragedy. An investigation into the cause of the explosion is now underway.</p>

          <p>A 90-day freeze on sweeping U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, creating economic uncertainty for businesses and consumers. If new bilateral trade agreements are not finalized, many imports will face a baseline 10% duty plus additional country-specific reciprocal rates. While the Trump administration has announced deals with China, the U.K., and Vietnam, the status of negotiations with many other nations remains unclear. Experts suggest the deadline may be extended for some countries, but the ongoing threat of tariffs continues to hinder long-term economic planning and investment. (not investment advice)</p>

However, economists and trade experts are questioning how Vietnam will enforce the distinction between locally made products and transshipped goods.

          <p>This opinion article draws a parallel between the current deployment of federal troops in U.S. cities and the British actions that precipitated the American Revolution. The author argues that it was not the initial taxes but the imposition of martial law through the 1774 Coercive Acts that transformed colonial resistance into a full-scale rebellion. By dissolving local governance and deploying an occupying army in Boston, Britain escalated the conflict, leading to events like the Lexington Green confrontation. The piece serves as a historical warning about the dangers of military overreach in domestic affairs.</p>

Analysis of thousands of bone fragments and tools suggests these ancient humans systematically hunted large animals, smashed their bones, and boiled them to extract nutritious fat. This process, likely done to avoid protein poisoning from a lean-meat diet, indicates sophisticated planning, resource management, and a deep understanding of nutrition. The findings add to a growing body of evidence challenging the outdated stereotype of Neanderthals as unintelligent.</p>

          <p>Mark Sanfratello, 72, has been indicted for the 1983 murder of his former girlfriend, Teresa Peroni, after advancements in DNA technology provided a crucial breakthrough. Peroni was 27 when she disappeared after an argument with Sanfratello at a party in Oregon. The case went cold for years until a human skull was found in 1997, which was only recently confirmed to be Peroni's through new DNA analysis. Sanfratello was arrested in California and is awaiting extradition to Josephine County to face the murder charge.</p>

          <p>In response to recent US and Israeli airstrikes targeting its nuclear facilities, Iran has announced it is suspending cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The move raises questions about the future of international monitoring and whether Iran will remain in the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Experts worry the attacks, conducted while the sites were under IAEA safeguards, could push Tehran to pursue a nuclear weapon for defensive purposes. Iran's nuclear program is now at a critical juncture, with officials stating they have the capacity to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels.</p>

          <p>Amid his public feud with President Trump over a new spending bill, Elon Musk has renewed his suggestion of forming a new political party, potentially called the "America Party." Musk stated that if the "insane spending bill passes," the new party would be formed to provide an alternative to the "Democrat-Republican uniparty." However, experts note that creating a new national political party is an extremely difficult and expensive undertaking, involving navigating complex state-by-state ballot access laws and facing legal challenges from established parties. Musk's immense wealth could theoretically fund such an effort.</p>

          <p>The United Nations Human Rights Office has criticized Germany's proposal to resume deportations to Afghanistan, stating that it is "not appropriate" to return people to the country under Taliban rule. A UN spokesperson cited ongoing, documented human rights violations and confirmed that a "non-return advisory" remains in place for Afghanistan. The push for deportations comes from Germany's conservative-led government, which has taken a harder line on immigration. Germany, which does not officially recognize the Taliban government, had stopped deportations in 2021 when the group seized power.</p>

          <p>A US-brokered peace agreement aimed at ending the conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has been signed by the DRC and Rwanda, but it faces significant skepticism. The deal includes commitments to cease hostilities and neutralize armed groups, but key rebel factions like the M23 were not included and have rejected its terms. Observers warn that without the inclusion of all armed groups and clear mechanisms for justice, the deal's ambitious 90-day implementation plan is unlikely to succeed. Critics also fear the deal could legitimize the plundering of the DRC's vast mineral resources.</p>

          <p>A series of massive explosions at a fireworks warehouse in Yolo County, California, has left seven people unaccounted for and two others injured. The blast occurred at a facility operated by Devastating Pyrotechnics, which public records show is connected to a county sheriff's lieutenant and a local volunteer firefighter. The company was found to be operating without the required local licenses for storing fireworks on the agricultural property. Federal and state agencies are investigating the incident, which sparked an 80-acre grass fire and prompted evacuations.</p>

          <p>Christopher Killick has been sentenced to three years in prison for harassing Emily Hunt, a former UK government rape advisor, marking a significant moment in her ten-year fight for justice. Killick had previously pleaded guilty to voyeurism for filming Hunt while she was unconscious in 2015 but avoided jail time. He repeatedly breached a restraining order by tweeting about her, leading to the eventual prison sentence. Hunt, who waived her anonymity to campaign for changes in the justice system, expressed relief that she will feel safe while he is imprisoned.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have detected 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, but have confirmed it poses no danger to Earth. The comet, estimated to be about 20 km wide, will make its closest approach in October at a distance of about 240 million km. Scientists are still gathering data on its trajectory and composition, but its discovery highlights the increasing capability of telescopes to spot such rare visitors. This provides a valuable opportunity to study material from outside our own solar system, offering clues about the galaxy.</p>

The proposed 60-day truce would involve another hostage-for-prisoner exchange.

          <h2>Proposed NASA Budget Cuts Threaten US Leadership in Space Science</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis article argues that the Trump administration's proposed budget, which slashes NASA's funding by nearly a quarter, is an "extinction-level event" for American space science. The cuts would force the cancellation of 19 active missions and gut funding for future projects like the Habitable Worlds Observatory, designed to search for life on exoplanets. The author warns that this will cause the U.S. to lose a generation of scientific talent and cede its leadership in space exploration to other nations. The piece contends that American space science has paid enormous dividends and its decline would be a major national loss. (not investment advice)</p>
