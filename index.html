          <p>The British government has reportedly reached a trade deal with the United States, offering relief amid growing global trade uncertainty. President Trump announced the 'full and comprehensive' agreement, which is expected to benefit sectors like the British auto industry, particularly luxury car manufacturers. The agreement is anticipated to boost consumer and business confidence, although its overall impact on the British economy may be limited due to the focus on services, which were not heavily affected by the tariffs.

          <p>President Trump indicated that new trade agreements could be announced soon, as his administration faces pressure to secure deals before a tariff pause ends in July. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the U.S. is actively negotiating with several countries and expects substantial tariff reductions. The Trump administration has engaged in trade discussions with Canada, Italy, India, Japan, and the United Kingdom. China is currently not involved in active trade talks with the U.S., but a meeting between Bessent and a Chinese delegation is scheduled in Switzerland.</p>

          <p>Grandparents are playing an increasingly significant role in American family life due to demographic shifts and economic pressures. As birth rates decline and life expectancy increases, grandparents are spending more time with fewer grandchildren. They provide emotional support, financial assistance, and childcare, often stepping in to fill gaps in the child care system. While this involvement offers numerous benefits, it also places additional burdens on grandparents, highlighting the need for policy solutions that support both parents and grandparents.</p>

          <p>BBC presenter Naga Munchetty is speaking out against medical misogyny after enduring years of dismissed symptoms related to her condition, adenomyosis. Munchetty's experience, where her severe pain was often minimized or ignored, has led her to explore the systemic failures of doctors in taking women's health concerns seriously. She is advocating for more research and education in women's health, encouraging women to push for diagnosis and treatment when they feel something is wrong. Munchetty's new book addresses medical misogyny and the importance of listening to women's health concerns.</p>

          <p>New York City's financial watchdog, Brad Lander, warns that the Trump administration's cuts to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) will create an 'open season' for scammers. The reduction in the CFPB's oversight and regulatory powers will leave consumers vulnerable to fraud and predatory lending. Lander calls on state and local governments to compensate for the gap in oversight. The cuts have already impacted borrowers, particularly those with student loans, as the CFPB has abandoned lawsuits and corrective actions against companies.</p>
