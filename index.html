          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer urged investors to consider the market's recent narrative over government shutdown headlines, suggesting that while third-quarter stock winners might experience continued, incremental gains, the year's most substantial rallies could be behind us. He pointed to top performers like AppLovin, Western Digital, Seagate, Warner Bros. Discovery, Teradyne, Intel, and Invesco, crediting their strong showing to factors such as surging AI demand, balance sheet improvements, and M&A speculation. Cramer explained that fund managers often acquire these successful Q3 stocks in the fourth quarter to showcase favorable portfolios to clients, potentially driving further, yet smaller, upward movements.

Professor Nita Forouhi from the University of Cambridge explains that oils such as sunflower and vegetable oil are beneficial due to their low saturated fat and high healthier mono- and polyunsaturated fats, dispelling claims of them causing inflammation. The article also clarifies that extra virgin olive oil, despite its antioxidants, is better for dressings given its low smoke point, recommending vegetable or sunflower oil for deep frying. Ultimately, it stresses that no single oil is universally superior for health.</p>

          <p>Cool Patch Pumpkins in northern California, home to a massive 40-acre corn maze, encourages visitors to rediscover the simple pleasure of getting lost. Owner Taylor Cooley emphasizes the unique disorientation offered by the maze, a stark contrast to a GPS-reliant world, where the uniform corn stalks create an immersive experience until elevated bridges provide perspective. The maze, a two-time Guinness World Record holder, features elaborate designs, with this year's theme celebrating farmers. Visitors from across the country enjoy the challenge, with some lightheartedly suggesting they'd resort to eating corn if truly stranded, making it a cherished fall tradition.</p>

          <p>Despite the ongoing US government shutdown, the stock market closed at record highs, indicating that investors remain largely unfazed by the political gridlock. Historical data from 22 previous shutdowns since 1976 suggests a modest impact on financial markets, with the S&P 500 rising an average of 0.3% during these periods and achieving a 13% average gain in the 12 months following. Experts propose that much of the economic activity is merely delayed, not lost. However, this article cautions that a prolonged shutdown could heighten market uncertainty, disrupt the release of critical economic data, and potentially cause companies to defer investments, which might eventually depress stock prices.

          <p>Ahead of the government shutdown, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) website prominently displayed a partisan banner blaming the "Radical Left" for the impasse, immediately sparking allegations of a "blatant violation" of the Hatch Act. Public Citizen, an ethics advocacy group, filed a formal complaint, asserting the message was overtly partisan and aimed to "idolize the Trump administration" while utilizing taxpayer funds. The Hatch Act specifically limits federal employees' political activities to ensure nonpartisan program administration. This article highlights the ensuing controversy, with the White House defending the message and questioning media focus, while ethics experts voice concern over the perceived weakening of enforcement offices.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's aggressive crackdown on "sanctuary" cities and states, which limit cooperation with federal immigration officials, has yielded few tangible results despite numerous lawsuits and threats of funding cuts. Eight months into the administration, most legal challenges remain unresolved, and local Democratic leaders largely continue to uphold their policies. Federal courts have actively blocked attempts to withhold funds from these jurisdictions, with only Louisville, Kentucky, abandoning its sanctuary policies after a written warning. This article details the ongoing legal battles and the limited success of the administration's efforts to compel compliance, underscoring the constitutional arguments put forth by the targeted jurisdictions.</p>

          <p>This opinion article asserts that the global community must acknowledge the escalating threat posed by North Korea's modernized military, urging a shift beyond an exclusive focus on its nuclear program. Leader Kim Jong-un has signaled a fundamental strategic change, aiming to simultaneously upgrade conventional armed forces, likely with Russian assistance, alongside its atomic arsenal. The ongoing Ukraine conflict has reportedly influenced Kim's understanding that robust conventional capabilities are crucial for achieving victory in actual warfare.

          <p>The UK government is planning significant changes to its asylum system, which will extend the waiting period for refugees to apply for permanent settlement beyond the current five years. Furthermore, the route that previously allowed refugees to automatically bring close relatives to the UK, which was temporarily suspended, is set to be permanently abolished. These proposed alterations, mirroring those for legal visa holders who face a 10-year waiting period, aim to ensure that "settlement must be earned by contributing to the country." This article highlights criticisms from the Refugee Council, which argues that these new rules will not deter illegal migration but rather compel more desperate individuals towards smugglers.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approval ratings are reportedly declining among Latino voters, primarily attributed to economic concerns such as high grocery and housing prices, despite his historically high 48% support in 2024. Recent polls indicate significant disapproval of his economic management, with many Latinos expressing fear of deportation amidst intensified immigration enforcement actions. However, this article highlights that while Trump's support is eroding, Democrats have not yet made substantial gains among these voters, suggesting a critical need for Democrats to articulate clearer benefits for the Latino community. Upcoming off-year elections in New Jersey and Virginia will serve as key tests for these shifting political dynamics.</p>

Senator Adam Schiff defended the fight as "very necessary" to prevent skyrocketing health insurance premiums for millions of Americans. However, the shutdown has already empowered the Trump administration to threaten mass layoffs and cancel billions in funding for projects in Democratic-majority states, framing these actions as politically targeted.

While the National Weather Service and FEMA are largely deemed essential, FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund is critically low, and its replenishment necessitates congressional approval.

The film, directed by Waleed Eltayeb, emphasizes the profound power of collective action, education, and discussion as primary interventions, rather than relying on vaccines or medication.
