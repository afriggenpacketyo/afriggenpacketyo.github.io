          <p>A DeKalb County police officer was fatally shot while responding to reports of an active shooter near the campuses of the CDC and Emory University in Atlanta. The suspect was later found deceased from a gunshot wound, which authorities believe may have been self-inflicted. The incident prompted a lockdown and shelter-in-place order, and while no civilians were shot, several windows at the CDC building were struck by gunfire. The fallen officer, David Rose, was remembered for his courage and leaves behind a pregnant wife and two children.</p>

          <p>A wildfire, named the Canyon Fire, has rapidly spread to nearly 5,400 acres northwest of Los Angeles, leading to evacuation orders for thousands of residents. Fueled by extreme heat and dry conditions, the blaze grew from just 30 acres in a single day, though firefighters have achieved partial containment. A firefighter sustained major injuries when their truck overturned on a hillside while battling the flames. While favorable weather has recently aided suppression efforts, authorities urge continued vigilance as high temperatures are forecast to persist in the coming days.</p>

          <p>In a highly anticipated matchup between two future Hall of Fame pitchers, Clayton Kershaw led the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 5-1 victory over Max Scherzer and the Toronto Blue Jays. Both veteran aces delivered strong performances, with Kershaw allowing only one run over six innings while navigating several threats. The game remained a tight duel until the fifth inning when a Mookie Betts two-run homer gave the Dodgers a lead they would not relinquish. The game highlighted the enduring skill of two of baseball's most decorated pitchers, even in the later stages of their careers.</p>

          <p>A year after a catastrophic landfill landslide in Kiteezi, Uganda, killed 34 people and left over 200 homeless, residents are still awaiting compensation and live in fear of another collapse. The disaster has highlighted the country's broader waste management challenges, as the city of Kampala struggles to handle 2,000 tonnes of daily garbage. While the old landfill is now closed and undergoing stabilization with Japanese aid, the new site in Buyala is controversial, with claims it is located in a protected forest reserve. This article details the lingering trauma for survivors and the complex environmental and legal issues surrounding the city's waste.</p>

          <p>The European Union has sanctioned an Indian refinery for processing discounted Russian crude oil, raising questions about the future of a potential EU-India free trade agreement. However, experts believe this move is largely symbolic and will not significantly impact trade negotiations, which are a priority for both sides seeking economic stability. The article suggests that the greater pressure on India comes from the threat of US tariffs, which could paradoxically push New Delhi closer to securing a deal with the EU. This dynamic highlights the complex interplay of global trade relationships amid geopolitical tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has reformed its prestigious civil service summer internship program to exclusively target applicants from lower socio-economic backgrounds, sparking a divided reaction among students. The policy aims to make the civil service more representative of society, with some students from working-class families now feeling encouraged to apply. However, other students, who also consider themselves from modest backgrounds but do not meet the strict new criteria, feel unfairly excluded from a key career pathway. This article explores these differing perspectives on a measure intended to improve social mobility within government.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully created high-purity hexagonal diamonds in a laboratory, a significant breakthrough in materials science. This rare form of diamond, first discovered in an Arizona meteorite in 1967, has a different atomic structure from common cubic diamonds and is believed to form under immense heat and pressure. Previous attempts by global research teams had struggled to produce pure samples of this material, known as lonsdaleite. The achievement provides definitive proof of the material's macroscopic existence and opens new possibilities for its study and application.</p>

          <p>China's consumer price index (CPI) showed no change in July compared to the previous year, while producer prices continued to fall, signaling persistent weak demand in the nation's economy. The flat CPI reading was slightly better than the anticipated decline, with a minor month-over-month increase attributed to policies aimed at boosting domestic demand. However, the data reflects ongoing economic challenges, as falling food prices offset modest gains in services and other goods. These figures indicate that deflationary pressures remain a significant concern for the world's second-largest economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Walmart has agreed to a $5.6 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit filed by several California district attorneys' offices alleging the retailer overcharged customers. The lawsuit claimed that Walmart sold products, particularly items sold by weight like produce and baked goods, for prices higher than advertised or for less than their labeled weight. As part of the settlement, the company will pay $5.5 million in civil penalties and has agreed to implement measures to ensure accurate pricing in its California stores. The case was brought forward to enforce the state's false advertising and unfair competition laws.</p>

          <p>A Fremont man has been federally charged with stealing rare Chinese manuscripts, valued at over $216,000, from the UCLA library in a sophisticated, multi-year scheme. The suspect, Jeffrey Ying, allegedly used fake aliases and a library system loophole to check out valuable antique books, some dating to the 13th century. He would then return "dummy books" with forged labels in their place, taking the originals. FBI officials believe he traveled to China after the thefts, and he was arrested while attempting to check out more books before a planned flight out of the country.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the recent settlement between actress Gina Carano and Disney, arguing that the resolution was the "right thing to do" rather than an example of corporate capitulation to political pressure. Carano was fired from "The Mandalorian" in 2021 over controversial social media posts, a move the author deems an overreaction and an example of pandering to a "hashtag campaign." The settlement, which was financially backed by Elon Musk and includes a statement from Lucasfilm hoping for future collaboration, is framed as a correction to an extreme initial decision, separate from broader trends of "cancel culture."</p>

          <p>Dozens of Democratic lawmakers have fled Texas to break quorum and block a Republican-led effort to redraw the state's congressional map, a move that has escalated into a national political showdown. As the absentee Democrats face threats of arrest and removal from office in Texas, they have found a powerful ally in California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has vowed to counter the Texas plan with a retaliatory map of his own. The Texas Attorney General has now sued to vacate the seats of 13 lawmakers and is also suing Beto O'Rourke's PAC for funding their travel.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to BTIG's chief market technician, the stock market has shown a key technical signal that suggests a pullback from its all-time highs is imminent. The strategist predicts the S&P 500 could experience a 5% sell-off, potentially dropping to the 6,100 level, which previously acted as a resistance point. Four warning signs are cited: weakness in consumer-focused stocks, a potential lag in the semiconductor sector, the possibility of widening credit spreads, and signs of profit-taking in mega-cap tech stocks despite strong earnings. This suggests an opportunity to buy may emerge after the correction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent advertising bans against major UK retailers like Zara and M&S have highlighted a growing concern over the use of models who appear "unhealthily thin," sparking fears of a return to the "heroin chic" aesthetic of the 1990s. The UK's Advertising Standards Authority reports a notable increase in complaints about this issue, though it notes that posing and lighting often contribute to the models' appearance. The debate is polarizing, with some activists seeing a harmful trend, while others caution against shaming naturally slim women and connect the trend to the cultural rise of weight-loss drugs.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15 to discuss a potential ceasefire in the Ukraine war. Trump stated that a deal is getting closer and suggested it would involve "some swapping of territories," a condition Ukraine has repeatedly rejected. The announcement follows reports that Putin offered a ceasefire in exchange for Kyiv's withdrawal from the Donbass region. The Kremlin confirmed the summit, which some analysts view as a diplomatic victory for Moscow, allowing it to negotiate over Ukraine's head.</p>
