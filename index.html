            <p>In a first-of-its-kind event, humanoid robots joined thousands of human runners in a half-marathon in Beijing, showcasing China's advancements in cutting-edge technology. The Yizhuang half-marathon, held in a state-backed hi-tech manufacturing hub, aimed to test the capabilities of bipedal robots in real-world conditions. While some robots experienced challenges, such as falling over, the event highlighted China's ambition to lead the global race in robotics and AI. The race allowed for both manually and fully autonomous robots to compete, testing their AI systems and battery life.</p>

            <p>A cable car crash near Naples, Italy, resulted in the deaths of four people, including a British couple identified as Elaine Margaret Winn and Graeme Derek Winn. The accident occurred when a cable supporting the car snapped, causing it to plunge to the ground. Italian authorities have launched a criminal investigation into the incident, despite the cable car operator stating that a safety inspection had been passed just two weeks prior. Sixteen people were rescued from another cabin on the same line, and the Italian Prime Minister expressed condolences to the families of the victims.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court issued a temporary halt to the deportation of Venezuelans detained in north Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. This action came in response to an ACLU lawsuit arguing that the detainees were not given adequate notice or opportunity to challenge their designation as gang members before being deported to El Salvador. The Trump administration had invoked the Alien Enemies Act, claiming the Venezuelans were members of the Tren de Aragua gang and posed a threat. The ACLU argued that the deportations violated due process rights.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Economists are concerned that Donald Trump's proposed tariffs could lead to corporate profiteering, as companies may use them as justification to raise prices beyond what is necessary to cover the tariff costs. This could result in consumers paying more for goods, even those not directly affected by the tariffs. Some analysts have pointed to Sony's recent price increase on the PlayStation 5 as a possible example of this behavior, though the company cited a "challenging economic environment" as the reason. Experts warn that the inflationary risks are most significant for U.S. consumers.</p>

            <p>Former Congresswoman Barbara Lee has surged into the lead in the race to become Oakland's next mayor, according to recent vote results. She is now ahead of her primary challenger, Loren Taylor, with 53% of the vote. Oakland uses ranked-choice elections, which could take weeks to finalize the count. Lee's campaign has released a statement calling the latest results "encouraging." If elected, Lee would replace ousted Mayor Sheng Thao and address the city's challenges with crime, homelessness, and financial stability.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen reported that Kilmar Ábrego García, a man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, has been moved from the notorious Cecot prison to a detention center with better conditions. Van Hollen met with Ábrego García and said he was "traumatized" after facing threats in the Cecot facility. He also accused El Salvador's government of staging a photo opportunity to make it appear as if they were enjoying a leisurely cocktail. The case has sparked a legal showdown over immigration policy.</p>

            <p>The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, deported to El Salvador, has sparked a legal battle over immigration policy. Despite court rulings for his return, the White House alleges he is an MS-13 member, which he denies. Police identified him as an MS-13 member based on clothing and a "reliable source," but his lawyers argue the "westerns clique" is in New York, where he never lived. He has no criminal convictions and was granted a "withholding of removal" order based on fear of persecution by a rival gang.</p>
