          <p>A Pentagon official stated that the deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles, in response to ongoing immigration-enforcement protests, is estimated to cost $134 million. Acting Pentagon Comptroller Bryn Woollacott MacDonnell attributed the cost primarily to housing, travel, and food expenses for the deployed personnel. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the deployment as necessary to ensure community safety and enable ICE agents to perform their duties without obstruction. The deployment includes 4,000 members of the California National Guard and approximately 700 Marines, funded through the military's Operation & Maintenance accounts.</p>

          <p>BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink believes that the company's acquisition of Preqin, a provider of alternative asset data, could be its most significant deal of 2024, despite being the smallest at $3.2 billion. Preqin's data is being integrated into BlackRock platforms like Aladdin and eFront, providing clients with greater visibility into private markets such as infrastructure and private equity. Fink likened Preqin's role to Zillow's in the housing market, bringing transparency to an otherwise opaque investment landscape. This move could diversify BlackRock's revenue streams and potentially allow for the creation of private-market benchmarks and more accessible private index products (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) budget proposal for the 2026 fiscal year seeks to consolidate 28 divisions into 15, establishing a new agency called the Administration for a Healthy America (AHA). This new agency, with a $20.6 billion budget, aims to support Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" agenda. The proposal includes significantly reducing funds for the CDC's chronic disease and global health centers, shifting some of those funds to AHA, and cutting the NIH budget by about 40%.

Hegseth's testimony followed the deployment of approximately 4,800 National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests, with the Pentagon estimating the deployment's cost at $134 million.

          <p>The film *Ballerina*, a spin-off from the *John Wick* franchise, initially struggles to capture the stylistic flair of its predecessors, focusing on a generic revenge plot. Eve Macarro, played by Ana de Armas, seeks vengeance for her father's death and undergoes training similar to John Wick's. The film finds its stride when it shifts its focus to expanding the Wick universe, introducing a cultish village in the Austrian Alps where every inhabitant is a potential threat. Despite a somewhat underwhelming box office opening, *Ballerina* ultimately succeeds by embracing the bizarre and darkly cartoonish world that made the *John Wick* films popular.</p>

          <p>California has requested a temporary restraining order from a federal court to block the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard forces and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles. The request was filed as part of a federal lawsuit alleging that Trump exceeded his authority by sending military forces into an American city without the state's approval. California Attorney General Rob Bonta argues that the deployments are unnecessary and are only adding to tensions sparked by immigration detentions. Governor Newsom echoed Bonta's concerns, stating that the federal government is turning the military against American citizens.</p>

          <p>A major international study involving nearly 300,000 children has found a two-way relationship between screen time and emotional well-being. Children spending more time on devices like TVs, tablets, and gaming consoles face a higher risk of developing aggression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Conversely, children with existing social or emotional challenges tend to spend more time on screens. Gaming consoles were particularly linked to increased issues, regardless of the specific type of game played, according to the study.</p>

          <p>Hummingbird feeders, while intended to help these birds, can be harmful or even deadly if not properly maintained. Sugar water left out too long can spoil and attract harmful microbes, leading to infections like candida, which can swell a hummingbird's tongue and make it difficult to eat. Experts recommend cleaning feeders every two to three days in spring and fall, and daily or every other day in the summer. The solution is to mix one part refined white sugar with four parts water, and to regularly clean the feeder with hot water or a vinegar and water mixture.</p>
