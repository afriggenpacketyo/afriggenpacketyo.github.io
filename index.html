          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered National Guard personnel in Washington D.C. to be armed as part of the Trump administration's crime crackdown, reversing a previous decision. President Trump, who took control of the city's police force, declared the mission a "total safety" success and suggested expanding it to Chicago, despite local opposition and polls showing deep unpopularity among D.C. residents. Mayor Muriel Bowser previously cited a "huge decrease in crime," questioning the federal intervention.</p>

          <p>Up to 1,700 National Guardsmen are mobilizing in 19 states to support President Trump's nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration and crime, assisting the Department of Homeland Security. These service members will primarily handle case management, transportation, and clerical functions, operating under Title 32 authority, which bypasses Posse Comitatus Act limitations. The deployment expands on the Washington D.C. operation, with Trump hinting at further expansion to cities like Chicago and New York, aiming to protect territorial integrity and enforce immigration policies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced over 700 arrests in Washington D.C. as part of its crime crackdown, with U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro pledging aggressive prosecution. However, criminal justice experts caution that arrest numbers are not reliable indicators of public safety, as they often don't lead to charges or convictions and can result from "flooding the zone" tactics. The increased law enforcement presence, while intended to deter crime, also carries risks of heightened police-public interactions and potential uses of force, according to policing experts.</p>

This blaze is part of a series of wildfires across the American West, fueled by a multi-day heatwave causing record-breaking temperatures and exceptionally high fire risks. With dry conditions, low humidity, and potential for lightning, more fires are anticipated, exacerbating an already busy fire year and posing significant public health threats from prolonged heat exposure.</p>

          <p>The FBI's search of former National Security Adviser John Bolton's home and office, publicly announced by Kash Patel, is perceived by many as political retribution for Bolton's criticism of President Trump. This event follows a series of other actions, including Defense Secretary Hegseth's firing of DIA director Jeffrey Kruse over an Iran assessment and DNI Tulsi Gabbard revoking security clearances for numerous national-security officials. These combined actions suggest a broader campaign against the "deep state," causing panic and a chilling effect within the intelligence community.</p>

          <p>A Colorado judge rejected a 20-year plea agreement for Jon Hallford, a funeral home owner who admitted to abusing 191 corpses, after emotional testimony from victims' families demanded a harsher sentence.

The judge's decision, influenced by the families' pain and the state's weak funeral home regulations, means Hallford could face a trial or a more severe sentence.</p>

This development comes as Apple has struggled to define its own AI strategy, while Google's Gemini models consistently lead benchmarks. The reported talks also carry implications for Google's lucrative search deals with Apple, which are currently under antitrust scrutiny, as the Department of Justice recommends eliminating exclusionary agreements.

Critics argue this represents a "culture war" attack on American values, despite the company stating its core values remain unchanged, highlighting how trivial corporate decisions can become fodder for broader political grievances.</p>
