          <p>President Trump's new tariffs have created a significant trade barrier, potentially costing the U.S. economy over a trillion dollars. The tariffs impact various sectors, particularly those reliant on imports, like apparel and footwear, where the U.S. lacks sufficient domestic manufacturing capacity.  Supply chain disruptions and increased inflation are anticipated, along with potential retaliatory measures from other countries.  CEOs from critical sectors, including medical device companies, are heading to Capitol Hill to lobby against the tariffs.</p>
