ASML continues to benefit from the AI boom, which fueled substantial third-quarter orders, and plans to offer a more detailed outlook in January.

          <p>Team GB track cyclist Jack Carlin, a multiple Olympic medalist, has announced his retirement from the sport at age 28. Carlin, who secured silver and bronze medals in both the Paris and Tokyo Games, cited a lack of renewed motivation after a severe crash in his final Olympic event. Despite taking time off, he found he could not reignite his passion to compete at 100% and felt it would be a disservice to continue. He expressed contentment with his achievements over a decade at the top and is now exploring new opportunities, including a rediscovered love for golf, as he transitions from his athletic career.</p>

          <p>A devastating fire at a garment factory in Dhaka, Bangladesh, has resulted in the deaths of at least 16 people, with officials cautioning that the toll could still rise. The victims' bodies were severely burned, necessitating DNA testing for identification before being released to their distraught families. The blaze, which began at midday and was extinguished after three hours, also spread to an adjacent chemical warehouse that continued to burn. Authorities suspect toxic gas inhalation and a locked roof door contributed to the fatalities, highlighting ongoing concerns about lax safety standards and poor infrastructure in the region.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's recent trip to Israel and Egypt was framed as a victory lap following his decisive role in brokering a Gaza ceasefire and hostage exchange deal. While Trump can legitimately claim credit for pushing the agreement forward, experts caution that this deal is not a peace agreement nor the start of a broader peace process for the Middle East. Significant details of his 20-point plan, including demilitarization and governance, still require extensive work and political will. The ceasefire remains fragile, with early violations and disputes over hostage bodies and aid flow, indicating deep-seated challenges persist.</p>

          <p>Royal Mail has been hit with a £21 million fine by communications watchdog Ofcom for consistently failing to meet its delivery targets for first and second-class post in the 2024/25 financial year. This marks the third significant fine for the company in recent years, following penalties in 2023 and 2024. Ofcom stated that the fine was reduced from £30 million due to Royal Mail's admission of its shortcomings, but warned that further fines are likely without a credible improvement plan. The regulator emphasized the harm caused to customers by late mail and urged the company to rebuild public confidence through actual service improvements.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to hear an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, effectively upholding the $1.4 billion defamation judgment against him. The judgment stems from Jones' false claims that the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax. Jones had argued that he was wrongly found liable without a trial on the merits, but the justices rejected his appeal without comment. This decision ensures accountability for the Infowars host, who had filed for bankruptcy and faces a separate $49 million judgment in Texas, bringing some closure to the victims' families.</p>

Altman explained that previous versions were highly restrictive due to mental health concerns, but new safety tools allow for relaxing these limitations for adults.

          <p>Two illegal immigrants from Venezuela were arrested in Chicago after allegedly ramming a Border Patrol vehicle during an immigration enforcement operation, leading to a violent clash with protesters. The Department of Homeland Security reported that the suspects attempted to flee on foot after the collision but were apprehended. A hostile crowd gathered, prompting federal agents to deploy tear gas, which affected 13 Chicago police officers. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker criticized the use of tear gas, while attorneys claimed a 15-year-old American citizen was also detained for five hours without parental contact, raising concerns about law enforcement tactics.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets showed gains on Wednesday, diverging from Wall Street's declines, amidst a rekindled US-China trade dispute. US President Donald Trump criticized China for not purchasing soybeans and threatened retaliatory measures, including a cooking oil embargo. This renewed tension follows a period of elevated volatility in the strained relationship between the two economic powers. Meanwhile, China's consumer prices unexpectedly fell in September, with persistent producer price deflation, signaling sluggish domestic demand. The market performance reflects complex global economic factors, including trade disputes and internal economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

While core CPI, excluding volatile food and energy, showed a slight increase, experts caution it's too early to declare an end to deflation.

          <p>IonQ CEO Niccolò De Masi has made a bold statement challenging Nvidia's current dominance in the AI sector, asserting that quantum computing will eventually replace GPUs. De Masi views quantum processors (QPUs) as the next natural evolution in computing, poised to take the lead as they become more powerful and energy-efficient. This perspective comes as the quantum computing market experiences significant investor enthusiasm, with companies like IonQ seeing substantial stock returns. McKinsey estimates the quantum industry's long-term market could reach $198 billion by 2040, signaling a potential shift in the technological landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has seized approximately $15 billion worth of Bitcoin, the largest forfeiture action in its history, from a massive 'pig butchering' fraud operation based in Cambodia. Chen Zhi, the alleged mastermind and founder of Prince Holding Group, a multinational conglomerate, has been indicted on wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges. Prosecutors assert that Zhi directed one of history's largest investment fraud operations, using forced-labor scam compounds to dupe victims worldwide into transferring cryptocurrency. The Treasury Department has also sanctioned Prince Group, labeling it a transnational criminal organization responsible for billions in losses and human suffering.</p>

          <p>The State Department has revoked the visas of six individuals from various countries for making incendiary social media comments regarding the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The unnamed individuals, from Argentina, South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, and Paraguay, reportedly made statements suggesting Kirk deserved to be killed. This action is part of a broader crackdown on comments that celebrate or mock Kirk's death, with the State Department asserting it has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death upon Americans. The move raises questions about the government's legal authority to revoke visas based on speech.</p>

          <p>The Labour government is under increasing pressure from the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats to release evidence submitted in the recently collapsed case against two individuals accused of spying for China. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has clarified it would not impede ministers from making the evidence public, despite earlier government suggestions to the contrary. The case against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, charged under the Official Secrets Act, fell apart because crucial evidence regarding China being a national security threat could not be obtained from the government. This situation sparks calls for transparency and raises questions about national security policy.</p>

          <p>The Manhattan District Attorney's office is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene in the retrial of Pedro Hernandez, convicted of murdering Etan Patz. A federal appeals court had ordered a retrial or release for Hernandez due to an error by the original trial judge concerning jury instructions on coerced confessions. Patz's 1979 disappearance was pivotal in changing how missing children cases are handled nationally. Prosecutors are requesting 90 days to decide on a new trial, while defense attorneys argue for a 30-day limit, highlighting the ongoing legal complexities in this decades-old case.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed several key health bills aimed at making the artificial intelligence and social media landscape safer, particularly for minors. New laws will require AI companies to implement guardrails against self-harm discussions and alert minors every three hours that chatbots are not human. Additionally, a bill removes a civil legal defense for AI developers, holding them more accountable for harm caused by their products. Other legislation increases penalties for AI pornography deepfakes and mandates warning labels on social media platforms for minors, reflecting a proactive stance against tech-related mental health issues and online exploitation.</p>
