          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has entered its second week after the Senate repeatedly failed to pass competing funding bills, leaving many agencies closed and hundreds of thousands of employees furloughed or working without pay. Democrats are demanding healthcare-related concessions, specifically the extension of Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, as a condition for restoring government funding. Despite President Trump's public suggestion of negotiating on ACA subsidies, Democratic leaders denied any active discussions, indicating a persistent impasse. The prolonged shutdown raises concerns about potential federal workforce layoffs and the depletion of funds for critical programs, with both sides blaming the other for the stalemate.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a financial aid package exceeding $10 billion to support U.S. farmers, particularly soybean producers, who have been significantly impacted by China's boycott of American soybeans. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett confirmed ongoing discussions, promising substantial measures soon to address the current oversupply and lack of Chinese purchases. President Trump previously suggested that revenue from tariffs could fund this relief, aiming to sustain farmers until trade policies yield positive outcomes. This initiative highlights the administration's efforts to mitigate economic strain on a crucial agricultural sector, acknowledging the challenges faced during harvest season with full silos.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker accused the Trump administration of a "military-style invasion" of Chicago, alleging federal immigration agents used Black Hawk helicopters and tactical gear during raids, striking fear in residents. Pritzker's lawsuit seeks to block federal deployment of the National Guard, arguing the state is targeted due to political disfavor and that no insurrection exists. President Trump, while not yet seeing the need, stated he would invoke the Insurrection Act if courts or governors obstructed his efforts to ensure city safety. White House officials, meanwhile, characterized protests against federal agents as "domestic terrorism."</p>

          <p>A federal special agent involved in deportations criticized Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson's executive order establishing "ICE-free zones," arguing that such sanctuary policies complicate operations and endanger agents. The agent explained that being barred from using city property forces agents to prepare for missions in public, increasing exposure to anti-ICE activists who track and publicize their movements. The White House condemned the order as a "disgusting betrayal," claiming it shields "criminal illegal alien killers, rapists, and gangbangers" from justice. This article highlights the operational challenges and heightened risks faced by federal agents due to local sanctuary policies.</p>

          <p>For the first time, renewable energy, including nuclear power, collectively surpassed coal as the world's leading source of electricity in the first half of this year, according to Ember. While global electricity demand grew, strong solar and wind expansion met 100% of this increase, even slightly reducing fossil fuel use. This article notes a mixed global picture, with developing countries like China leading the clean energy charge, while some developed nations increased reliance on fossil fuels. Despite regional disparities, experts consider this a "crucial turning point" in the global energy transition.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Oregon, Karin Immergut, temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying any National Guard units to the state, including those from California and Texas, after previously denying the use of Oregon's own Guard. Judge Immergut, a Trump appointee, questioned the administration's attempt to circumvent her initial order, stating that conditions in Portland did not justify federalized forces. This article highlights the ongoing legal battles over the president's authority to deploy military assets to cities against the wishes of state governors. California's governor, Gavin Newsom, also criticized the deployment as an "abuse of power."</p>

          <p>The Conservatives in England and Wales have pledged to abolish the Sentencing Council, aiming to give ministers direct power over sentencing policy. Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick argues the council is "not fit for purpose," creating a "two-tier nightmare" where sentences are inconsistent. This article notes the move follows a dispute between the council and the government over pre-sentence reports, and existing legislation already grants the justice secretary veto power over new guidelines. The Conservatives' proposal seeks to further centralize control, asserting that sentencing policy should be set by parliamentarians accountable to the public.</p>

          <p>A career federal prosecutor in Virginia, Elizabeth Yusi, reportedly believes there is no probable cause to file criminal mortgage fraud charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James, despite pressure from Trump allies. This article highlights a high-profile confrontation between the Justice Department and President Trump, who has previously fired attorneys for refusing to prosecute his perceived enemies. The case involves a criminal referral alleging James misrepresented her primary residence for a mortgage. Multiple prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia have been fired or resigned amid increased pressure from the Trump administration to pursue such cases.</p>

          <p>China's decision to relinquish its "developing country" status at the WTO, which granted special and differential treatment, is viewed as a strategic retreat rather than capitulation. This article argues that by conceding these privileges, China removes a key talking point for the U.S. and E.U. while losing little substance, as it had already conceded some benefits. The move aligns with Mao Zedong's theory of protracted war, emphasizing a strategic defensive to reposition politically and outlast stronger adversaries. Beijing aims to strengthen its alignment with the Global South by claiming peer status with genuinely developing nations. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts view it as further validation of AI's critical role in the geopolitical competition between the U.S. and China, especially with Chinese rivals like DeepSeek innovating with domestically made chips.

This article details how subway ads for the AI pendant have been extensively vandalized with critical messages, which Schiffmann claims was part of a deliberate "provocation" to generate attention. The 22-year-old CEO, known for viral software during past crises, defends his AI "friend" as a new category of relationship, likening it to a therapist or even a "god." Despite serious flaws and an unclear path to profitability, Schiffmann prioritizes "mindshare" and views the public's "inchoate rage" as social commentary on the broader AI industry.</p>

The investigation began when a victim tracked a stolen iPhone to a warehouse near Heathrow.

The gang primarily targeted Apple products due to high profitability overseas, with stolen phones reportedly selling for up to £4,000 each in China.

This article notes that the company reported a net income of $466 million, a significant turnaround from a loss the previous year, despite a 15% drop in net sales. The lowered outlook, initially announced in September, reflects a challenging socioeconomic environment that has dampened consumer demand.
