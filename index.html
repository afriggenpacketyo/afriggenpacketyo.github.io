          <p>Former investment banker and Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Austin Beutner is reportedly laying the groundwork for a mayoral campaign against incumbent Karen Bass in the 2026 election. Social media accounts briefly featured "AUSTIN for LA MAYOR" banners, which were quickly removed, fueling widespread speculation in political circles. Beutner, who previously served as first deputy mayor and publisher of the Los Angeles Times, would emerge as the most significant challenger to Bass. Mayor Bass has recently faced substantial criticism regarding the city's response to the Palisades fire, a billion-dollar budget shortfall, and federal immigration crackdowns. Beutner's diverse background, including his leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic at LAUSD, positions him as a formidable potential candidate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary block on the deployment of National Guard troops to the Chicago area, which the Trump administration intended to use against ongoing protests at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's decision denying the deployment request but allowed the troops to remain under federal control via an administrative stay. This legal standoff, similar to one in Portland, involves approximately 500 federalized National Guard soldiers from Texas and Illinois. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul lauded the decision as a victory for state and local law enforcement, emphasizing their understanding of community needs and rights. This legal dispute highlights broader tensions over federal intervention in local affairs.</p>

          <p>China is currently in the process of drafting its 15th five-year plan, a comprehensive blueprint that will guide the nation's development over the next half-decade. This upcoming iteration is expected to significantly influence infrastructure spending and investment, shifting towards more technologically advanced and people-centric projects. While previous plans, like the 2009 stimulus package, spurred immense economic growth, they also contributed to the persistent issue of local government debt. Despite these concerns, officials and economists remain optimistic about the scale of future infrastructure investment. The focus will likely be on leveraging innovation to meet the evolving demands of a new era, ensuring sustainable and efficient development across the country.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate María Corina Machado has vehemently criticized President Nicolás Maduro's authoritarian regime, advocating for his immediate removal and describing her country as being in "profound, total chaos." Speaking from hiding within Venezuela, Machado asserted that the Venezuelan people decisively mandated a regime change in the 2024 elections, which she contends Maduro's administration rigged. She accused Maduro of leading a criminal structure that actively destabilizes the region and undermines U.S. institutions by transforming Venezuela into a sanctuary for various adversarial groups. Machado expressed significant gratitude for U.S. President Trump's recognition of the severe threat Maduro poses, underscoring her commitment to achieving freedom through strength.</p>

West Yorkshire Police have arrested two men, aged 25 and 43, on suspicion of murder. Watkins, 48, was serving a 29-year sentence at HMP Wakefield for a string of horrific child sexual assault offenses, including the attempted sexual assault of a baby. The incident comes less than two weeks after a report highlighted a "markedly" increased level of violence at the facility, where many prisoners, particularly older men convicted of sexual offenses, felt unsafe.

          <p>The Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva, Israel, is meticulously preparing to receive the first group of 20 hostages released by Hamas, developing a novel approach dubbed "captivity medicine." Dr. Michal Steinman, head of nursing, emphasized the profound privilege of reuniting families and the critical lessons learned from previous hostage releases. Medical teams must act as "detectives" to comprehend the complex physical and psychological impacts of prolonged captivity, acknowledging that symptoms may manifest weeks later. The unit offers private rooms designed with hotel-like comforts, facilitating a delicate balance of medical care and personal space for recuperation and family reunification, prioritizing the emotional and physical well-being of the returning individuals.</p>

          <p>Roei Shalev, an Israeli survivor of the horrific 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on the Nova musical festival, has tragically died by suicide two years after the traumatic event. Shalev, who witnessed his girlfriend's murder and survived by playing dead for hours, had recently posted a poignant message online expressing his profound desire for "this suffering to end." His death, which followed his mother's suicide two weeks after the attack, starkly underscores the severe and enduring mental health impact on survivors of such violence.

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old British army horse, has been officially retired to The Horse Trust sanctuary in rural Buckinghamshire after sustaining a broken bone and serious bleeding during a dramatic runaway incident in London last year. Quaker was one of five Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment horses that were spooked by construction noise, leading them to gallop through the city streets. The incident resulted in injuries to five soldiers and four civilians, with two horses famously photographed bleeding in the capital. Major Thomas Stewart confirmed that Quaker was unable to return to active duties due to ongoing veterinary care, making retirement the most compassionate decision for his long-term welfare and stability.</p>

          <p>All Smithsonian museums, its research centers, and the National Zoo are scheduled to close starting Sunday, as the ongoing government shutdown exhausts their available prior-year funds. The Smithsonian, which relies on federal funding for approximately 62% of its operations, reassured the public that all animals at the zoo and its conservation institute would continue to receive essential care and be fed. However, popular features like the zoo's animal cams are deemed nonessential and will be turned off for the duration of the shutdown. This widespread closure highlights the escalating impact of the federal government funding dispute, with other national parks also being forced to cease operations and furlough staff.</p>

Organized by the Palestine Coalition, demonstrators carried a sea of Palestinian flags and placards featuring slogans such as "stop arming Israel" and "free Palestine." While speakers at the rally acknowledged the US-brokered ceasefire as a positive development, they characterized it as "precarious" and insufficient, emphasizing that protests would continue until Palestinians achieve full freedom. Metropolitan Police reported 14 arrests for various offenses, including breaches of Public Order Act conditions and supporting a proscribed group, following minor scuffles with counter-protesters.</p>

          <p>Charter airline Verijet has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, leading to the immediate and complete cancellation of all its flights. The Vero Beach, Florida-based company, which experienced rapid expansion since its founding in 2020, had accumulated over $38.7 million in liabilities and was facing numerous lawsuits following the sudden death of its founder. Filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy signifies liquidation rather than restructuring, meaning that jet card customers, aircraft lessors, and other creditors are unlikely to receive refunds. This event marks another instance of an airline ceasing operations due to significant financial difficulties within the past year, causing considerable disruption for its clientele and the broader travel industry.

With its flagship ChatGPT chatbot now boasting 800 million weekly users, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is forging massive infrastructure deals with industry giants like Nvidia and Oracle, while simultaneously rolling out innovative products such as the Sora AI video app and Codex software agent.

Swinney emphasized this approach as the most realistic and historically grounded path to independence, citing a clear precedent from the 2014 referendum. Despite UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's firm opposition to another independence vote, Swinney expressed strong confidence that the SNP would "win big" at the polls and ultimately deliver Scotland's choice for independence. This endorsement solidifies Swinney's leadership and reaffirms the party's unwavering commitment to its core objective of Scottish statehood.</p>
