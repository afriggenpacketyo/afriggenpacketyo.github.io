        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's remarks regarding U.S. mediation efforts between India and Pakistan over Kashmir have stirred political sensitivities in India. Despite the U.S. playing a role in de-escalating military clashes, India is wary of being perceived as yielding to outside pressure. Trump's statements, which included offering increased trade as an incentive for peace, were directly contradicted by Indian officials, who emphasized that trade was never part of the discussions. This incident has led some Indian analysts to question the country's growing alignment with the U.S. and whether Trump's comments represent indifference or a lack of awareness of Indian concerns.</p>

          <p>State Farm will be allowed to temporarily increase homeowners' insurance rates by 17% in California, following a decision by the state's insurance commissioner. This decision comes after the insurer requested an increase, citing financial strain from recent wildfires. Consumer advocates criticize the move, alleging that State Farm has been unfairly denying or undervaluing claims from wildfire victims, adding insult to injury. The interim rate increase, which goes into effect June 1, is viewed as a difficult compromise amidst a statewide insurance crisis, with a future hearing planned to address State Farm's financial health and recovery plan. </p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has stated his openness to discussing the potential deployment of France's nuclear weapons in other European countries, under specific conditions. Macron emphasized that France's own defense capabilities must remain intact and that ultimate control over the weapons would remain with the French president. While Macron proposed talks with European allies, he also made it clear that France would not pay for the security of others. Germany has expressed interest in hosting French nuclear weapons, but stressed that this would not replace the nuclear guarantee from the United States.</p>

          <p>A House committee session to consider Medicaid cuts and other key aspects of President Trump's domestic policy bill was marked by disruptions and intense debate. Protesters were removed from the hearing room after shouting against the proposed Medicaid cuts, while lawmakers engaged in heated arguments over the bill's provisions. Democrats attempted to extend tax credits for Obamacare marketplaces, but their efforts were unsuccessful. The proposed Medicaid reductions, estimated to cut federal spending by $912 billion and leave 8.6 million uninsured, have become a major point of contention, with Republicans arguing the cuts target waste and abuse in the program.</p>

          <p>Despite public dismissals of extreme food shortages, an internal Israeli analysis concludes that Gaza faces widespread starvation unless aid deliveries are restored within weeks. Israeli military officials have privately warned their commanders that many areas of Gaza will likely run out of food to meet minimum daily nutritional needs if the blockade isn't lifted quickly. This analysis contrasts with Israel's public stance, which has maintained that the blockade did not pose a major threat to civilian life, even as aid agencies warned of an impending famine. The UN Security Council is addressing the crisis, with most members calling on Israel to immediately allow aid into Gaza.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, a significant step towards their potential release after more than three decades for the murder of their parents. Judge Michael V. Jesic cited their rehabilitation efforts inside prison and the support of corrections officials as key factors in his decision. The brothers appeared remotely from prison, taking responsibility for their crimes and apologizing to their relatives. While the decision makes them immediately eligible for parole, the final determination rests with the state parole board and Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>

          <p>A new book alleging that Joe Biden's aides covered up his "physical deterioration" during his ill-fated re-election campaign has drawn criticism from a Biden aide. The book, *Original Sin*, claims Biden's condition was so poor that aides discussed putting him in a wheelchair. A spokesperson for Biden dismissed the claims, stating that "evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity." The book cites anonymous sources, with one exception: David Plouffe, who worked on Vice-President Harris's campaign, is quoted as saying, "We got so screwed by Biden as a party."</p>

Jackson was banned for his role in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. The Hall of Fame has stated it will consider the candidacy of those affected by the ruling.</p>
