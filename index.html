          <p>The UK government announced that the morning-after pill will be made available for free at pharmacies across England later this year.  This aims to improve access to emergency contraception, particularly for women in disadvantaged communities and reduce the burden on GP appointments.  A potential bias is the government's focus on positive aspects without addressing potential logistical challenges for pharmacies.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce legislation overriding independent sentencing guidelines concerning pre-sentence reports for ethnic minority offenders. The Justice Secretary argues the guidelines create a "two-tier" system, while the Sentencing Council defends them as addressing sentencing disparities.
