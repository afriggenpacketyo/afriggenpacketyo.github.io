          <p>The European Commission's proposal to phase out Russian gas, nuclear energy, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports by the end of 2027 has met resistance from Eastern European nations, particularly Slovakia and Hungary. These countries, traditionally reliant on cheaper Russian energy supplies, view the plan as "economic suicide" and a threat to regional energy security. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico voiced concerns about the economic implications of cutting off Russian energy imports entirely, warning of higher energy prices for consumers. Despite the EU's strategic goal to reduce energy dependence on third countries, these nations maintain warm ties with Moscow and express reservations about the feasibility and impact of the proposed ban.</p>

          <p>Two men have been arrested after breaking into an elementary school in Tachikawa, a suburb of Tokyo, resulting in minor injuries to five teachers. The suspects, aged 31 and 47, were apprehended at Daisan Elementary School on suspicion of assault after a parent who was at the school for a consultation reportedly summoned them. While there were no immediate reports of injuries to the approximately 520 enrolled children, the incident prompted a police investigation.

Timpson acknowledges the ongoing crisis in prisons, marked by overcrowding and violence, and stresses the importance of rehabilitating offenders to reduce re-offending rates, while also addressing issues such as drug addiction and mental health problems.</p>

This threat is particularly alarming in Britain, where Hollywood blockbusters are a critical part of the industry.

The operation, targeting militants in cities like Jenin and Tulkarm, has involved demolishing homes and expanding roads, undermining the authority of the Palestinian Authority. While Israel claims the actions are necessary to restore security, Palestinians fear a second nakba and the loss of their homes and future. The extended military presence and the views of hard-line Israeli ministers advocating annexation have fueled these anxieties.</p>

          <p>Agatha Christie has been digitally resurrected using AI to teach an online writing course for BBC Maestro, raising ethical questions about the use of AI to recreate deceased figures. While Christie's estate has approved the project, stipulating that only her own words be used, some experts argue that the reanimation, even with consent, is still a form of deepfake that blurs the lines between reality and representation. Others contend that as long as the AI is used to educate and entertain using the artist's own material, there is little risk of harming their reputation.</p>

          <p>In the Karen Read trial, a second smartphone forensics expert, Jessica Hyde, testified that Jennifer McCabe's Google search about hypothermia occurred after John O'Keefe's remains were found, contradicting the defense's claim. Hyde stated with scientific certainty that McCabe's search happened at 6:24 a.m., not 2:27 a.m., as the defense argued, supporting earlier testimony from another expert. The defense questioned Hyde's reliability, but the judge restricted their ability to reference a previous case. Hyde also testified that O'Keefe's phone was not secured following established practices after it was recovered from the scene.</p>
