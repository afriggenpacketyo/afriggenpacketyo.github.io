          <p>A Russian overnight strike on Kyiv has resulted in the deaths of 14 people and injuries to over 100, according to Ukrainian officials. The attack involved hundreds of drones and missiles, with Ukrainian air defenses reportedly neutralizing a significant portion of the incoming ordinance. Impacts were reported across multiple regions, including Odesa, Zaporizhzhia, and Chernihiv, with Kyiv bearing the brunt of the strikes. President Zelenskyy condemned the attacks as terrorism, urging international partners to respond decisively, while also suggesting that President Trump is not doing enough to bring an end to the war. The attacks coincided with the G7 leaders' summit in Canada, where the ongoing conflict in Ukraine is a key topic of discussion. </p>

          <p>This Fox News opinion piece asserts that President Trump has skillfully managed international events, particularly in the Iran-Israel conflict. According to the author, Trump gave a tacit green light to Prime Minister Netanyahu to strike Iran after Iran failed to negotiate on its nuclear program. The author draws parallels between Trump's approach and historical figures known for "masterful inactivity." The article also claims Trump is effectively messaging on various issues, including border security and military strength, while criticizing the Democratic Party. </p>

          <p>Al-Hilal's chief executive stated that a loan move for Cristiano Ronaldo before the Club World Cup would have been counter-intuitive, given Ronaldo's affiliation with their rival club, Al-Nassr. Despite being linked to the move due to a FIFA transfer window, Al-Hilal ultimately decided against it, prioritizing long-term team decisions over short-term gains. The executive also mentioned difficulties in reinforcing the team due to players' holiday mindsets and high salary demands. Al-Hilal remains ambitious about reinforcing the team during the traditional transfer window after the tournament. </p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs analysts indicate that China's private enterprises are experiencing a resurgence due to the lifting of regulatory restrictions. The private sector's "animal spirits" are returning, driven by increased capital expenditure, overseas expansion, R&D spending, and fundraising. The sustainability of this rebound depends on predictable policies, macroeconomic stimulus, and stable US-China relations. China's private sector accounts for a significant portion of the country's GDP, urban employment, and tax revenue, but has been disproportionately affected by recent economic challenges. </p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an order to bring into force parts of a trade deal agreed between the UK and US last month, reducing tariffs on UK cars being shipped to the US. The deal includes a 10% levy on most UK goods, including cars, and did not address the expected removal of charges on steel imports. The UK government hopes the pact will shield British businesses from the impact of Trump's tariffs. The US will allow up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the 25% import tax imposed on all car imports earlier this year. </p>

          <p>President Trump cut short his trip to Canada for the G7 summit, citing "what's going on in the Middle East" as the reason for his early return to Washington. He clarified that his departure was not related to ceasefire talks between Israel and Iran, stating the situation was "much bigger than that." The U.S. is not joining Israel's military offensive, but has assisted in intercepting Iranian missiles. Trump urged Iran to sign a deal limiting its nuclear program, while the Israeli Prime Minister said that his plan would not escalate the conflict, but end it. </p>

His comments have been ambiguous, ranging from full support for Israel to distancing himself from the attacks. His options include escalating the conflict by bowing to pressure from Netanyahu, holding the course by reiterating that the US is not involved, or pulling back by listening to Maga voices who reject traditional support for Israel. Trump's domestic support and his desire to win the Nobel Peace Prize are key factors influencing his decisions. </p>
