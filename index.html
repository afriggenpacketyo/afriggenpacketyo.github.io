          <p>A tragic tour bus accident on the New York State Thruway near Pembroke has resulted in the deaths of five passengers. The bus, carrying 54 people on a return trip from Niagara Falls to New York City, reportedly lost control and rolled over into a ditch. Numerous other passengers sustained injuries, with dozens transported to various regional hospitals, some in critical condition. State police are investigating the cause of the crash but have ruled out mechanical failure and operator impairment, noting the driver has been cooperative. The incident caused major highway closures and a large-scale emergency response.</p>

          <p>A new Czech documentary, "The Great Patriotic Trip," examines the persistence of pro-Russian conspiracy theories by taking three Czech citizens who doubt mainstream media narratives to the frontlines in Ukraine. Director Robin Kvapil filmed their reactions as they visited sites of Russian war crimes, such as the mass graves in Izium and bombed-out neighborhoods in Kharkiv. Despite witnessing the devastation firsthand, the participants largely held on to their beliefs, attributing the destruction to Ukrainian propaganda. The film has sparked intense debate within the Czech Republic about Russian influence and societal division.</p>

          <p>A restaurant owner who had lost movement in his left arm and leg following a stroke has experienced significant recovery thanks to a novel medical technology. The Vivistim System, an FDA-approved implant, uses vagus nerve stimulation during physical therapy to enhance the brain's neuroplasticity and improve motor function. After his progress with traditional rehabilitation plateaued, the patient received the implant at the Cleveland Clinic and has since made remarkable strides, regaining movement and eliminating chronic pain. This technology represents a promising new frontier for stroke recovery, offering hope to patients with long-term deficits.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Lobito Atlantic Railway (LAR) has clarified that a major rail project in Angola is a commercial venture and not intended to counter China's influence in the region. The project, which includes a planned railway link to Zambia and Tanzania, will create a transcontinental connection between the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Despite U.S. involvement and framing of the project as a strategic corridor, the CEO emphasized that his company maintains strong business ties with Chinese-owned mining companies and relies on Chinese manufacturing. He asserted that the logistics-focused operation has no geopolitical motivations whatsoever.</p>

          <p>Students and faculty are returning to U.S. universities amidst what many describe as an unprecedented assault on higher education by the Trump administration. Policies targeting diversity initiatives, threatening federal research funding over pro-Palestinian activism, and creating new barriers for international students have created a chilling effect on campuses. Several universities have entered into costly settlements with the government to protect their funding, surrendering significant autonomy in the process. Academics and advocates warn these actions stifle free inquiry, weaken innovation, and could have lasting negative effects on the entire sector.</p>

          <p>As older generations prepare to pass down trillions of dollars in assets, wealth advisors are highlighting the financial and emotional complexities of transferring real estate. To avoid family conflicts and minimize tax burdens, experts suggest several strategies for wealthy parents. These include transferring property through a will or trust at death to take advantage of a stepped-up cost basis, which reduces capital gains taxes for heirs. Using Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) can shield the property from lawsuits and creditors, while detailed operating agreements can preemptively solve disputes over usage, maintenance costs, and potential buyouts among siblings.

This comes as the show's parent company, Paramount, navigates a politically sensitive environment.

          <p>This opinion piece critiques California Governor Gavin Newsom's strategy of using a government social media account to parody former President Donald Trump's online rhetoric. The author argues that this approach, which mimics Trump's all-caps style and self-aggrandizement, is a throwback to the ineffective "resistance" comedy of 2017. While acknowledging Newsom's substantive policy responses to the right, the article contends that parodying Trump only reinforces his dominance of the political discourse. The author suggests Democrats must develop a coherent and relatable message of their own rather than simply mirroring their opponent's style.</p>

After a previous, more combative meeting where Zelenskyy's casual attire was criticized, he opted for a more formal black blazer and collared shirt for the latest discussion. This change in appearance is interpreted as a strategic move to signal a more serious and diplomatic tone, which appeared to contribute to a more positive and productive meeting. The article draws parallels to historical examples, like Winston Churchill's wartime attire, to illustrate how clothing can convey powerful political messages.</p>

Kalluk, a 24-year-old polar bear, and Nicky, a 28-year-old giraffe considered the oldest in North America, were both euthanized due to declining health. Days later, Maka, a 30-year-old Western lowland gorilla, died suddenly from a cardiac event during a medical exam. Zoo staff expressed their heartbreak over the series of losses, which has prompted an outpouring of support from the public.</p>

          <h2>Dermatologists Highlight Tinted Sunscreen's Unique Protection Against Visible Light</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While standard sunscreens protect against UV radiation, experts note they often fail to block visible light, which can worsen hyperpigmentation and melasma, conditions more common in people with darker skin. Tinted sunscreens, however, contain ingredients like iron oxide that effectively block this part of the light spectrum. A recent review of research confirms that tinted products outperform non-tinted ones in providing protection from visible light damage. Dermatologists recommend looking for iron oxide on the label, though they acknowledge that the current range of available tints does not yet cover the full diversity of skin tones.</p>

          <p>Thousands of impoverished South Africans, known as zama zamas, are risking their lives in the dangerous world of illegal, small-scale coal mining in the province of Mpumalanga. Working in abandoned, unrehabilitated mines, they face constant threats from tunnel collapses, toxic gas, and long-term health issues from coal dust. Despite providing an essential fuel source for local communities, they are considered criminals by the government, which has launched crackdowns leading to arrests and violent confrontations. This article highlights their struggle for survival amid a legacy of industrial mining that has left local communities marginalized.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed its eruption, with its north vent shooting fountains of lava up to 100 feet into the air within its summit crater. This latest activity is part of an ongoing eruption series that began in December and is contained within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, posing no threat to homes. Scientists at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory are monitoring the activity, which is driven by magma rising from deep within the earth. For Native Hawaiians, the eruption is a culturally significant event connected to the volcano goddess Pele.</p>

In the interviews, Maxwell stated that Trump was never inappropriate in her presence and described him as a "gentleman." She also denied introducing Prince Andrew to Epstein, claiming it was likely his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, and asserted that a famous photo of the prince with accuser Virginia Giuffre was fake. Maxwell also stated her belief that Epstein did not die by suicide but dismissed theories that he was murdered.</p>

          <p>Utility bills are rising across the United States, with electricity costs up 5.5% and natural gas up 13.8% over the past year. Experts attribute the price hikes largely to a surge in energy demand driven by AI data centers, electrification, and post-pandemic economic activity. A major bottleneck is the lack of transmission infrastructure to connect new, cheaper renewable energy sources to the grid. Concurrently, Trump administration policies are gutting renewable energy development, bolstering more expensive fossil fuels, and ordering uneconomic coal plants to remain open, with the costs passed on to consumers.

          <p>Japan is actively broadening its defense cooperation with various international partners, highlighted by a recent multinational naval exercise in the Philippine Sea. During the exercise, both British and U.S. F-35B fighter jets conducted landing and launch drills from the Japanese destroyer-carrier JS Kaga for the first time. This event, involving ships and aircraft from six nations, demonstrates a significant show of allied strength in the Indo-Pacific. Analysts suggest these moves are driven by a need to build a network of security partners to counter potential threats, particularly from China, and to ensure regional stability.</p>

          <p>Applications for the T visa, a form of legal status for immigrant survivors of human trafficking, have sharply increased, but applicants now face longer processing times and greater risks. The visa allows survivors to remain in the U.S. if they assist law enforcement, but median wait times have grown from six months to nearly 20 months. Policy changes have also made denied applicants more vulnerable to deportation proceedings, creating fear within immigrant communities. Despite a new process intended to give applicants earlier access to benefits, the delays and risks highlight the politicized and precarious nature of this humanitarian protection.</p>

This opinion article suggests that while creative issues caused delays, the changed political climate and the network's potential fear of backlash from the Trump administration likely played a significant role in the final decision to scrap the project, prioritizing business over controversy.</p>
