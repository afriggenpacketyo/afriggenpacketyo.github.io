          <p>New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, a Democratic mayoral candidate, was arrested at an immigration court in Manhattan while observing proceedings. Lander's office stated he was taken into custody by ICE agents after requesting a judicial warrant in a specific case. Homeland Security claims Lander assaulted law enforcement and impeded a federal officer, while video footage shows him being handcuffed. Lander's wife and other advocates held a news conference alleging that people with pending asylum cases are being tricked into immediate removal upon leaving the courtroom. The incident has sparked outrage and calls for Lander's release, with fellow mayoral candidates and other officials condemning the arrest. Optimism remains low considering the circumstances surrounding the arrest and the implications for due process. </p>

          <p>California Senator Alex Padilla spoke emotionally on the Senate floor about being forcibly removed from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's press conference in Los Angeles. Padilla described being escorted into the conference by a National Guard member and an FBI agent, then physically forced out despite identifying himself as a senator and asking a question. He recounted being pushed to the ground, handcuffed, and marched down a hallway while repeatedly asking why he was being detained. Padilla warned about the precedent set by the Trump administration's deployment of military forces to suppress rights.

          <p>A review by House Judiciary Democrats found that President Trump's pardons have cost crime victims and taxpayers approximately $1.3 billion in restitution and payments. The pardons absolved convicted criminals from having to pay for damages and restitution caused by their crimes, including millions owed for the January 6th Capitol assault. The report cited several multi-million dollar restitution payments that were cancelled by Trump's pardons, benefiting corporate fraudsters and tax evaders. A White House spokesman defended the pardons as "righting the wrongs of political prosecutions," while Democrats criticized the move as damaging to victims and the system of presidential pardons. </p>

Greenberg's departure further weakens the agency as the U.S. enters its busiest season for extreme weather disasters, exacerbated by climate change.

          <p>Oil prices rose more than 3% after President Trump threatened Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and called for Iran's unconditional surrender. The U.S. crude oil contract for July delivery increased to $74.20 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent for August rose to $75.75. Trump warned that U.S. patience was wearing thin and demanded the evacuation of Tehran, reiterating that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.

          <p>Lawyers for R. Kelly claim the singer was taken to the hospital after suffering an "overdose" caused by officials at a North Carolina prison. However, sources indicate that R.

Kelly is currently serving a 30-year prison sentence for racketeering and violating sex trafficking laws. His attorneys allege mismanagement by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons and claim he was denied surgery by prison officers. </p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have proposed a tax break for tipped workers as part of their tax cut package, similar to a House GOP provision. Both versions offer a deduction on qualified tips, defined as cash, charged, or shared tips, available from 2025 through 2028. However, the Senate proposal caps the deduction at $25,000 per year, unlike the uncapped House bill, and features different income limits for eligibility. While the concept has bipartisan appeal, experts suggest the tax break would not benefit many workers due to its limitations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>JetBlue Airways is implementing further cost cuts, including reducing off-peak flights and unprofitable routes, as weaker-than-expected travel demand makes a break-even operating margin in 2025 "unlikely." The airline will pause plans to retrofit older Airbus A320 jets and is assessing hiring plans. The carrier is also considering combining leadership roles and reducing travel spending. These measures are being taken as the airline relies on borrowed cash to maintain operations. </p>

          <p>Amid escalating tensions, Israel has not yet struck Iran's secretive Fordo nuclear facility, a site of significant concern to international monitors. Buried deep in a mountain, Fordo is suspected of housing clandestine efforts to develop nuclear weapons. While U.S. intelligence agencies have stated they do not believe Iran is building a nuclear weapon, Israel claims Iran is "racing towards a nuclear bomb." Fordo's well-fortified location and advanced machinery make it a potential target. </p>
