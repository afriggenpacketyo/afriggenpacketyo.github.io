          <p>Japan and the United States are engaged in ongoing trade negotiations aimed at reaching a mutually beneficial tariff agreement by mid-June, though they have "yet to find common ground" on key tariff issues. Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's minister for economic revitalization, held talks with U.S. officials in Washington, reiterating Japan's stance on removing additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Prime Minister Ishiba and President Trump are expected to meet soon to discuss the progress of the negotiations.</p>
