            <h2>IDF Inquiry Blames 'Operational Misunderstanding' for Gaza Medics' Deaths</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 14:45:28 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>An Israeli military inquiry has attributed the killing of 15 Palestinian medics in Gaza last month to an 'operational misunderstanding' and breaches of orders. The investigation found that troops opened fire believing they were facing a threat, exacerbated by poor night visibility, but video evidence later contradicted initial claims that the ambulances lacked proper markings. A deputy commander has been dismissed for providing an incomplete report, though the IDF maintains there was no evidence of summary executions. The Red Crescent and other international organizations had previously called for an independent investigation into the incident, which occurred in a 'hostile and dangerous combat zone'.</p>

            <p>Manchester United's manager, Ruben Amorim, voiced his concerns about the team's struggles to score goals after a 1-0 defeat to Wolves, highlighting striker Rasmus Hojlund's lack of confidence and the team's overall offensive struggles. Amorim emphasized the need to work with Hojlund and provide him with opportunities to score, while also acknowledging that the team's goal-scoring issues extend beyond a single player. United have lost a club-record 15 league games this season, and their season hinges on their Europa League campaign, where they face Athletic Bilbao in the semi-final. Amorim also praised the performances of young players Tyler Fredricson and Harry Amass.</p>

            <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri emerged victorious at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, propelled to the lead after a penalty was levied against Red Bull's Max Verstappen. Verstappen received a five-second penalty for an off-track incident while defending his lead from Piastri but still managed to maintain second place. Lando Norris, also from McLaren, recovered from a tenth-place start to finish fourth, behind Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. Piastri's win places him atop the championship standings, ahead of Norris and Verstappen, as McLaren demonstrates strong performance early in the season.</p>

            <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee suggests that President Trump's tariffs could lead to an 'artificially high' level of economic activity initially, followed by a slowdown in the summer. Businesses and consumers are preemptively stocking up on inventory in anticipation of the tariffs, which could inflate economic activity in April but cause a drop-off later. Goolsbee expressed optimism about the longer-term economic outlook, noting that data coming into April was 'pretty good,' with steady full employment and inflation coming down. He also notes the uncertainty surrounding the size of the tariffs after the 90-day pause expires.</p>

            <p>A draft executive order from the Trump administration proposes significant changes to the U.S. State Department, including shuttering embassies in Southern Africa and eliminating bureaus focused on democracy, human rights, and international organizations. The order also details an overhaul of the process for selecting and training U.S. diplomats, emphasizing alignment with the president's foreign policy vision. Regional bureaus would be consolidated into four 'regional corps,' and America's diplomatic presence in Canada would be drastically reduced. The White House has not yet commented on the draft order, and Secretary of State Rubio has dismissed the report as 'fake news'.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen emphasized his trip to El Salvador was to support Kilmar Ábrego García’s right to due process, arguing that denying it threatens everyone’s constitutional rights. The White House claims Ábrego García is an MS-13 member, though he hasn't been charged with related crimes, and the Supreme Court ordered his return to the US be facilitated. Van Hollen accused administration officials of lying to distract from questions about rights violations and said an immigration judge previously ruled Ábrego García shouldn't be deported to El Salvador due to safety concerns.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump is reportedly considering expanding the sale of citizenship, aiming to attract wealthy immigrants to the United States. While many find the concept of commodifying national belonging distasteful, numerous countries, including the U.S., already offer residency or citizenship in exchange for investment. Trump's proposal aligns with a market-driven approach to immigration, focusing on attracting capital and high-net-worth individuals. This strategy reflects his broader economic policies and desire to boost the U.S. economy through foreign investment.</p>

            <p>As President Trump approaches his 100th day in office, Utah voters are divided on his job performance, with 54% approving and 42% disapproving, according to a Deseret News/Hinckley Institute poll. While Trump enjoys strong support among Republicans, with 8 in 10 approving, independents and Democrats disapprove in high numbers. Utahns are generally wary of Trump's funding cuts and his ideas regarding Canada and Greenland, but these moves are well-received among Republicans. Experts suggest Trump needs to find a popular set of policies to rally the public and avoid increasing unpopularity.</p>
