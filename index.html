          <p>The United States and South Korea announced significant new agreements, including multibillion-dollar investments and a record $50 billion in aviation purchases by Korean Air from US manufacturers, alongside expanded energy cooperation. These deals follow a recent trade agreement that lowered US tariffs on South Korean exports, strengthening bilateral economic ties. During their meeting, President Trump also expressed his intent to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un again this year, highlighting their positive relationship. The discussions underscored mutual economic benefits while addressing regional security concerns, including Pyongyang's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared the firing of Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, citing allegations of false statements on mortgage applications, an unprecedented move that challenges the central bank's independence. Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, immediately asserted that Trump lacks the legal authority to dismiss her "for cause" and affirmed her refusal to resign. The Department of Justice is investigating Cook based on the claims, and the legality of Trump's action is expected to be challenged in federal court. This dramatic event could significantly reshape the Fed's governing board and intensifies the conflict between the administration and the Fed over monetary policy decisions.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have reportedly achieved a breakthrough in making airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft signals exceptionally resistant to interception and geolocation, effectively rendering them "invisible" to adversaries. This innovation utilizes frequency diverse array (FDA) technology, which assigns each antenna a minutely varied frequency, making the signal chaotic and obscuring its directional origin from a distance. This development represents a "paradigm shift" from traditional phased array radars, enhancing the survivability of these critical command nodes in modern warfare. The new method could significantly impact future air defense strategies.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor shares experienced a notable drop after Mercedes-Benz announced its intention to offload its 3.8% holding in the Japanese automaker, valued at approximately $346 million. This divestment, described as a portfolio cleanup, adds further pressure to Nissan's stock, which has already been affected by US tariffs, declining sales, and intense global competition in the electric vehicle market. The company recently underwent restructuring, including job cuts and plant closures, and its shares have fallen over 29% this year. (not investment advice)</p>

This action follows earlier federal funding suspensions for UCLA and raises questions about potential violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.

          <p>SpaceX's highly anticipated 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket was scrubbed twice, first due to an oxygen leak and then because of adverse weather conditions. This mission is critical for testing fixes and upgrades following three previous failures, and for advancing toward key goals like autonomous in-space propellant transfers. These transfers are essential for NASA's Artemis moon landing program, slated for as early as 2027, and for future Mars missions. Despite the delays and 'thousands of engineering challenges,' SpaceX founder Elon Musk and NASA officials remain optimistic about the company's ability to overcome these hurdles, drawing on its rapid development pace with other rockets.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to restore over $6.8 billion in congressionally allocated education funding, including for after-school programs, teacher training, and support for English-learners, following a multi-state lawsuit. The funds were previously withheld without clear explanation, though a White House spokesperson cited concerns about federal money subsidizing a 'radical left-wing agenda.' States, led by California's attorney general, accused the administration of illegally impounding funds designated by Congress. The restoration ensures vital programs, many benefiting low-income families, can continue after facing uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Fire Department crews successfully halted a brush fire that scorched approximately nine acres in Sherman Oaks, near Haskell Creek. No injuries were reported, and firefighters worked on the ground and in the air to contain the blaze. Full containment, however, will require heavy equipment and extended operations into the evening to extinguish burned material along control lines. Officials warned of potential traffic delays on the 405 Freeway, which is also undergoing a major repavement project with scheduled overnight lane closures.</p>

          <p>The Pickett Fire, the largest wildfire in the San Francisco Bay Area this year, is threatening Napa Valley vineyards not only with flames but also with damaging smoke taint to grape crops. A winery owner, who previously lost two vintages to smoke, described the wine as tasting 'like licking an ashtray,' highlighting the significant economic impact even without direct fire damage. The increasing frequency of wildfires, exacerbated by hot and dry weather, poses a severe challenge to the region's wine industry. Over 2,000 firefighters are battling the blaze, which has burned about 10 square miles.</p>

          <h2>Kilmar Abrego Garcia Case Highlights Trump Administration's Aggressive Deportation Policies</h2>

          <p>The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador due to an 'administrative error' and now faces another deportation, has become a flashpoint in the Trump administration's hardline immigration efforts. Garcia, who denies gang affiliations despite official claims, was held in a maximum-security facility in El Salvador before being returned to the US, only to be detained again on new criminal charges. His lawyers argue the evidence against him is weak, and the incident underscores the administration's aggressive stance on immigration, which has led to increased arrests and protests.</p>

          <p>The first human case of New World Screwworm infestation linked to travel has been confirmed in the U.S., detected in a patient returning from El Salvador. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) investigated the case, noting that while the risk to U.S. public health is 'very low,' the parasitic fly larvae feed on live tissue and can cause serious damage. New World Screwworm myiasis is typically found in South America and the Caribbean, infesting livestock, pets, wildlife, and rarely, humans. There is currently no medication to treat this painful condition.</p>

The match also highlighted the ongoing uncertainty surrounding striker Alexander Isak, who remains absent from the team amid transfer speculation. Manager Eddie Howe expressed pride in his players' commitment, but acknowledged the need for a resolution to the Isak saga before the transfer window closes.</p>
