          <p>A judge found Apple and its Vice President of Finance Alex Roman in contempt of court, stating they willfully violated a 2021 decision from the Epic Games case. The judge accused Roman of lying under oath about when Apple decided to levy a 27% fee on some App Store purchases and said Apple withheld documentation about compliance with the 2021 court order. The court ordered Apple to immediately stop imposing commissions on purchases made for iPhone apps through web links inside an app, accusing them of anticompetitive behavior. The judge has referred the matter to U.S. attorneys to investigate potential criminal contempt proceedings against Roman and Apple.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick released a statement addressing the scrutiny generated by his recent "CBS Sunday Morning" interview, particularly regarding his relationship with his girlfriend, Jordon Hudson. Belichick stated that he had communicated that the interview should focus solely on his new book, "The Art of Winning," but unrelated topics were introduced. He defended Hudson, saying she intervened to keep the conversation on track and that some clips misrepresented her actions. Belichick clarified that they have been open about meeting on a flight to Palm Beach in 2021 and that the final segment did not accurately reflect the productive conversation they had.</p>

          <p>A Senate effort to block President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs failed, with Republicans largely opposing the measure amid concerns about the tariffs' impact on the U.S. economy. The resolution, led by Senators Ron Wyden and Rand Paul, aimed to terminate the national emergency used to impose the tariffs, but it fell short of the necessary votes. House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed limited openness to stepping in on the tariff policy, suggesting the executive branch has broad authority on trade. Anxieties persist over the economic consequences of the tariffs, especially after a report indicated slowed economic growth in the first quarter of 2025.</p>

          <p>President Trump's second term has seen a rapid implementation of his "America First" policy, sparking conflict and uncertainty in international relations. Trade wars have intensified, with increased tariffs on China and threats against other nations, creating economic unease. The administration's ambitions extend beyond tariffs, including desires to control territories like the Panama Canal and Greenland, driven by concerns about foreign interference and resource competition. While seeking peace in conflicts like the Russia-Ukraine war, the approach has faced criticism for failing to hold the Kremlin accountable, leading to eroded trust with European allies.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's recent Women's Super League title win, while impressive, showcases a different dynamic compared to previous seasons. While they scored 54 goals in 20 games, their goal-to-game ratio is lower than in past years, and they've had to grind out results more often. Unlike last season's dominant wins, many of their victories this time were by a single goal, with a significant portion of their goals scored in the final 15 minutes of matches. Comebacks have also been a notable feature, with the Blues securing eight points from losing positions.</p>

The article describes an interview where Trump refused to acknowledge that the "MS-13" text was photoshopped onto the picture, reflecting the administration's effort to portray the man as a criminal. This incident highlights the administration's strategy of using public opinion to justify its actions, even when faced with legal scrutiny.

Finn notes that England's current attitude toward franchise cricket is more accepting, acknowledging the lucrative opportunities it offers players. He also observes that a single impressive performance can now lead to an England call-up, a shift from his time as an international cricketer.</p>

          <p>Following his historic election victory, Mark Carney faces a divided Canada, including a generational divide with younger voters coalescing around the Conservatives due to concerns about housing, crime, and the cost of living. This marks a reversal from 2015 when young voters helped sweep Justin Trudeau to power. The Liberals managed to gain seats, but the Conservatives also made significant gains, preventing the Liberals from forming a decisive majority government. A key challenge for Carney will be winning back the confidence of younger voters who feel let down and frustrated.</p>
