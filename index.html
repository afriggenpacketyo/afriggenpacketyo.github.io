          <p>Air Canada has suspended all its flights, disrupting travel for an estimated 130,000 passengers daily, as a 72-hour strike by over 10,000 flight attendants commenced. The union is demanding higher salaries and compensation for ground time, such as during boarding and pre-flight preparations. The airline stated it had offered a 38% total compensation increase over four years, but the union rejected it as being below inflation and market value. The industrial action is causing widespread cancellations, with the airline advising affected passengers not to go to airports.</p>

          <p>Chinese investors have significantly altered the landscape of Athens by purchasing thousands of apartments to qualify for Greece's investor residency scheme, known as the "golden visa." As of June 2025, Chinese citizens constitute nearly half of all first-time permit holders and over 60% of those who have renewed their visas, making them the largest participating nationality by a wide margin. This influx of investment has had both visible and subtle effects on the Greek capital's economy and real estate market.

          <p>A high-stakes meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska concluded without a formal agreement to end the war in Ukraine. While Trump claimed "great progress" was made, he acknowledged that key sticking points remain unresolved. Putin reiterated his position that the "root causes of the conflict" must be addressed, implying demands for Ukraine to cede territory and abandon its NATO aspirations. Following the talks, Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is scheduled to visit Washington.</p>

          <p>Germany's coalition government has agreed to create a National Security Council (NSR) to centralize intelligence and improve the country's ability to act decisively during crises. The new body, chaired by the chancellor, aims to end decades of slower, more deliberative security policy-making, a process often hampered by coalition politics. The NSR will consolidate information from various ministries to enable faster, more coordinated responses to security threats, such as the war in Ukraine. It will also handle strategic forecasting, crisis simulations, and replace the existing Federal Security Council.</p>

          <p>The meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska concluded with no concrete deal on Ukraine, but with Putin appearing to successfully advance Russia's narrative. The Russian leader framed the conflict as a response to provocations and a matter of Russia's security, a version of events that observers fear Trump may adopt. Trump's brief and vague statements, contrasted with Putin's detailed remarks, suggested a deferential posture. The article notes that the lack of a clear outcome leaves the next steps uncertain, with Trump stating it is now up to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to negotiate with Moscow.</p>

          <p>Bob Simpson, a former Australian Test cricket captain and transformative national coach, has passed away at the age of 89. Simpson had a distinguished playing career between 1957 and 1978, noted for his batting, leg-spin bowling, and exceptional slip fielding. He famously came out of retirement at age 41 to captain the team during the World Series Cricket era. As a coach starting in 1986, he revitalized a struggling Australian side, leading them to a 1987 World Cup victory and laying the groundwork for an era of global dominance.</p>

          <p>Researchers from the Bank of China have expressed increasing concern about the sustainability of the expanding U.S. national debt, prompting calls for Beijing to reduce its exposure to dollar-denominated assets. China has already been trimming its holdings of U.S. Treasuries, which are at their lowest level since 2009. The researchers suggest that while a U.S. default is not imminent, the current trajectory is unsustainable. They recommend that China gradually adjust its reserves, potentially increasing holdings of gold and other strategic resources to mitigate risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska yielded several important observations despite the lack of a concrete peace deal. Firstly, the summit marked Putin's return to the world stage, complete with a red-carpet welcome on U.S. soil. Secondly, the talks ended earlier than expected with vague statements, where Putin emphasized eliminating the "root causes" of the conflict, signaling no change in his maximalist demands. The article also notes the unusual brevity and lack of detail in Trump's remarks, particularly his failure to mention a ceasefire, and concludes with Putin's unscripted invitation to meet next in Moscow.</p>

Putin appeared to control the narrative, reiterating his maximalist demands for Ukraine's submission, while Trump's vague and deferential performance left allies guessing.
