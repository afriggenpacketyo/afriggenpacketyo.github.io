          <p>This article previews England's main rivals for the Rugby World Cup, offering detailed insights into the strategies and key players of New Zealand, Canada, and France. New Zealand's "mentality weapon" and remarkable comeback from a losing streak are highlighted, showcasing their collective belief fostered by coach Allan Bunting. Canada emerges as a strong contender, with half its squad contracted to PWR clubs and key players like Sophie de Goede returning. France, despite a recent warm-up loss to England, views itself as an "ambitious outsider" with a young squad aiming to find rhythm in a weaker pool, hoping a recent setback will propel them forward in the tournament.</p>

          <p>This article reports on a significant consolidation trend within the UK's Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) sector, driven by previously undervalued assets. It highlights the recent battle for Assura, a healthcare property company, where Primary Health Properties successfully outbid KKR, becoming the largest publicly traded healthcare landlord. The trend extends to logistics and student housing, with major players like Tritax Big Box REIT and LondonMetric Property actively acquiring smaller REITs. Investors are increasingly favoring scale and focus in niche property areas, raising questions for traditional diversified giants like Landsec and British Land. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SoftBank Group shares plunged over 9% as Asian technology stocks broadly declined, mirroring losses in U.S. peers following SoftBank's $2 billion investment in Intel. Major Japanese, South Korean, Taiwanese, and Hong Kong tech firms, including Advantest, Renesas, and TSMC, experienced significant drops, influenced by Nvidia's performance and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's consideration of federal equity stakes in CHIPS Act-funded semiconductor companies. This downturn signals a challenging period for the Asian tech sector, which is closely tracking global market shifts and policy developments. The volatility underscores investor concerns about the future of the semiconductor industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Councils across England are considering legal action to remove asylum seekers from hotels, following a High Court injunction granted to Epping Forest District Council that blocked lodging at The Bell Hotel. This precedent has prompted Reform UK and some Conservative councils to explore similar actions, citing safety concerns and alleged breaches of planning law, particularly after an asylum seeker faced sexual assault charges. While the government aims to close all asylum hotels, critics advocate for the Rwanda deterrent. The situation has fueled protests, some turning violent, underscoring the contentious and complex nature of the UK's asylum accommodation policy.</p>

Although the immediate risk is "quite low," consumers are advised to discard or return the affected products for a full refund. The agency is actively investigating the Indonesian supplier to determine the root cause of the contamination.</p>

A weaker U.S. dollar is redirecting American tourists to regions like Latin America and Southeast Asia, while European destinations like Greece and Turkey remain popular despite seasonal wildfire headlines. There's a growing trend towards "coolcations" in cooler climates such as Iceland and Norway, as well as a shift towards off-peak travel. Travelers are becoming more intentional in their planning, prioritizing destinations that align with their specific needs and values rather than simply avoiding certain areas.</p>

          <p>As GCSE results day approaches, this article explores the ongoing debate about whether parental rewards, such as jewelry, cash, or even cars, effectively motivate teenagers to achieve better exam grades. While some parents believe incentives like a £50 reward can encourage extra study, students like Imogen Farmer suggest that intrinsic ambition and parental support for hard work are more significant. Psychologists, including Natasha Tiwari, argue that rewarding effort rather than just grades is a more sustainable long-term strategy, cautioning that transactional rewards might undermine intrinsic motivation and create social tensions among peers.</p>

          <p>A tragic traffic accident in western Afghanistan resulted in the deaths of 73 people, including 17 children, most of whom were Afghan migrants forcibly deported from Iran. The bus, en route to Kabul, collided with a truck and motorcycle in Herat province, catching fire due to the bus driver's excessive speed and negligence. This devastating incident underscores the perilous journeys faced by undocumented Afghans returning from Iran, which has intensified deportations amidst rising anti-Afghan sentiment and national security concerns. Experts warn Afghanistan lacks the capacity to absorb the growing influx of returnees, exacerbating an already strained humanitarian situation.</p>

          <p>A leaked government report indicates a severe shortage of approximately 10,000 probation staff in the UK, crucial for managing offenders released into the community and ensuring public safety. This significant deficit exacerbates pressures on the service, particularly following the early release of thousands of offenders to ease prison overcrowding. Probation officers report overwhelming workloads, raising serious concerns about increased reoffending rates and the risk of individuals going unsupervised. The Ministry of Justice acknowledges the burden and has pledged increased funding and recruitment, though staff warn of the lengthy training period required to fill these critical gaps.</p>

European leaders and Zelenskyy support the idea of a bilateral meeting, hoping to secure "iron-clad security guarantees" for Ukraine. The situation highlights the complexities of the conflict, with Russia currently holding an advantage on the front line and Putin viewing Zelenskyy as illegitimate, complicating prospects for a swift peace deal.</p>

          <p>A South Lake Tahoe resident has tested positive for the plague, believed to have been contracted from an infected flea while camping in the area. While rare, the disease is serious but treatable with readily available antibiotics, and the patient is now recovering at home. Health officials emphasize precautions for individuals and pets when outdoors, especially near wild rodents, as the bacterium Yersinia pestis is naturally present in parts of California. This marks the first reported plague case in El Dorado County since 2020, prompting renewed warnings for residents and visitors to avoid contact with rodents and use insect repellent.</p>

          <p>Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen announced plans for a new immigration detention center, dubbed the "Cornhusker Clink," in McCook, to support President Trump's expanded deportation efforts. The facility, an existing minimum-security prison work camp, will house low-to-medium risk detainees and be federally funded, with capacity to expand. The plan also includes National Guard support and State Patrol assistance for arrests, aiming to "remove the worst of the worst." This initiative has drawn criticism from state Senator Megan Hunt and activists over transparency, human rights concerns, and the state's priorities, sparking protests outside the governor's office.</p>

          <p>Texas Democrats are protesting new "permission slips" requiring police escorts for leaving the House chamber, imposed by the Republican speaker to ensure attendance for a controversial congressional redistricting vote. State Representative Nicole Collier initiated a sit-in, refusing to sign the "demeaning" protocol, while other Democrats joined in solidarity. This escalation follows a two-week quorum break and highlights the intensifying partisan battle over redrawing districts to favor Republicans. Democrats view the measure as an attack on their dignity and an attempt to control their movements, vowing legal challenges against the new maps once passed.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old Reseda high school student, Benjamin Guerrero-Cruz, detained by immigration agents, alleges he overheard them bragging about receiving $1,500 for his arrest. His former teacher, Lizette Becerra, relayed the claim, prompting activists and educators to rally for his immediate release. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security denies using "bounty hunters" or improper conduct, stating Guerrero-Cruz overstayed his visa and was responsible for his arrest. The incident highlights ongoing concerns about agent practices, detention conditions, and the impact of expanded immigration enforcement on vulnerable communities, particularly students.</p>

          <p>India and China are reportedly making headway on border delimitation and boosting trade and investment flows, a development occurring as the Trump administration intensifies tariff pressure on India. Experts suggest this thawing relationship indicates the Asian powers' intent to push back against Washington and explore alternative partnerships, especially within the BRICS framework. The two sides plan to create an "expert group" to address boundary issues with an "early harvest" approach and have pledged concrete steps to enhance economic ties. This signals a potential shift in regional geopolitical dynamics, driven by external pressures.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced plans to paint the entire U.S.-Mexico border wall black, a measure "specifically at the request" of President Trump to make it hotter and deter illegal climbing. Noem stated the black paint would significantly increase the metal's temperature in hot climates, making it harder for individuals to climb, and would also help prevent rust. This initiative is part of the administration's broader efforts to fortify the southern border, backed by new funding from Congress. The department is also working on "water-borne infrastructure" along sections of the Rio Grande River.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to expand his "woke" ideology crusade from the Smithsonian Institution to museums nationwide, alleging they portray a negative view of American history. He instructed attorneys to initiate a process similar to efforts in universities, aiming to remove "improper ideology" from exhibits. This move follows his previous attempts to influence Smithsonian leadership and content, including the resignation of a director after the Board of Regents opened the door to changes. Other museums and alliances are ringing alarm bells, warning against censorship and the "erasure of history" that could undermine public trust and open inquiry in cultural institutions.</p>

While the motive remains unclear, the region is known for fuel smuggling, or "huachicolea," a lucrative illegal activity.

          <p>A significant outbreak of leptospirosis, a bacterial kidney disease, is currently killing California sea lions, primarily in Central and Northern California. The disease, transmissible to humans and potentially fatal in dogs, is contracted through water or soil contaminated by infected animal urine. Historically, outbreaks occurred every 3-5 years, but they have become more frequent since 2018, coinciding with a "warm weather blob" in Pacific waters. Officials urge precautions for beachgoers and pet owners, as most affected sea lions do not survive, and the disease can spread among species.</p>
