            <p>China has escalated the trade war with the United States by raising tariffs on U.S. goods to 84%, a significant increase from the previously announced 34%. This action comes in response to President Trump's imposition of import duties on Chinese goods, which have reached a total tariff rate of 104%. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has condemned Trump's actions as "unilateralism, protectionism, and economic bullying," and has added American companies to an "unreliable entities" list. The trade war is expected to impact American consumers through higher prices and could lead to further economic instability. Optimism score: 35</p>

            <p>President Trump's announcement of reciprocal tariffs on imports from approximately 90 nations has ignited fears of a global trade war, with economists predicting potential recessions in the U.S. and other countries. The tariffs, which range from a baseline of 10% to as high as 104% for China, are intended to address trade deficits and boost domestic manufacturing. However, countries like China are retaliating with their own tariffs, and the European Union is considering counter-measures. The tariffs went into effect on April 9, adding to existing trade tensions and market volatility. Optimism score: 25</p>

            <p>Amid the escalating trade war and concerns about the U.S. dollar, investors are fleeing to German bonds, causing a sell-off in U.S. Treasury yields. Germany's 10-year bund is seen as a safe haven, contrasting with the volatile geopolitical climate affecting U.S. Treasuries. Experts suggest that structural holders of debt, like reserve managers in China, may be moving away from Treasuries in response to U.S. policy moves. The spike in U.S. government borrowing costs is likened to the U.K.'s 2022 "mini budget" crisis, raising concerns about potential financial instability. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is resigning due to a disagreement over the Treasury Department's decision to share immigrants' tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The plan aims to identify and deport undocumented immigrants, raising concerns about privacy violations. Several other IRS officials are also departing, citing the data-sharing agreement as a factor. Advocates argue that the agreement violates privacy laws and diminishes the privacy of all Americans, while the Treasury Department defends it as a means to protect law-abiding citizens and pursue criminals.

            <p>Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has stated that a "commercial solution" for British Steel is "within reach," as the government considers nationalizing the Chinese-owned business. British Steel, which employs 2,700 people, is facing potential raw material shortages and concerns over the viability of its blast furnaces. The company has been impacted by 25% tariffs on exports to the U.S., and has rejected the government's offer of £500m to partly fund a switch from blast furnaces to more energy efficient electric arc furnaces. The government is now considering all options, including nationalization, to secure the future of British Steel. Optimism score: 50</p>

Typically, investors would flock to bonds as a safe haven during economic downturns, but this has not been the case, suggesting a loss of confidence in the traditional role of bonds.
