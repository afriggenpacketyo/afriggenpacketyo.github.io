          <p>A major power outage impacted southeastern France, causing disruptions at the Cannes Film Festival, as the festival prepared for its closing ceremony. About 160,000 households were affected after a high-voltage line fell, following a fire at an electrical substation near Cannes. The festival's main venue switched to an independent power supply, ensuring scheduled events continued. Police are investigating the possibility of arson as the cause of the initial fire, and traffic and train services were disrupted in Cannes and Antibes, with authorities urging caution during travel.</p>

          <p>Swiss brand On is emerging as a global challenger in the sportswear market, reporting a 40% increase in net sales for the first quarter of 2025. Analysts attribute On's success to its innovative shoe aesthetic and timing, as it captured market share during periods of decline for Nike and Adidas. While Nike and Adidas still hold a combined 58% of the global market, On's growth rate has outpaced both companies. However, On faces potential headwinds from Nike's turnaround plan and uncertainty regarding tariffs, as 90% of its sneakers are manufactured in Vietnam.</p>

O'Hara focuses on implementing changes to reduce crime and build community trust, acknowledging Floyd's death as an "open wound" in the city. While shootings are trending down, violent crime remains a challenge, exacerbated by officer shortages. O'Hara is working to restore pride in the profession, change the department's culture, adjust arrest tactics, and enhance community engagement and officer training, even as federal oversight ends.</p>

          <p>The Catholic archbishop of New Orleans, Gregory Aymond, made a rare court appearance during the archdiocese's bankruptcy case, which involves claims from hundreds of clergy sexual abuse survivors. Aymond stated he was concerned for the survivors and wanted to expedite negotiations, as the bankruptcy has prevented abuse survivors from being compensated. Attorneys representing some of the claimants criticized a proposed settlement plan, deeming it inadequate compared to similar cases. The settlement involves cash, insurance, and potential church property sales, but faces opposition from survivors seeking individual lawsuits against the church.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office reports a record number of Americans applying for British citizenship or indefinite leave to remain, with over 6,000 applications in the year leading up to March.

While the UK government aims to reduce immigration, some applicants may qualify more swiftly based on their contributions.
