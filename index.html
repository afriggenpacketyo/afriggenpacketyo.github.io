          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly pressured Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to cut interest rates following a weak ADP jobs report. The ADP report indicated that private sector jobs increased by only 37,000 in May, significantly lower than the expected 110,000. Trump expressed his frustration on Truth Social, stating that Powell must lower the rate and criticizing the Fed's actions compared to Europe. This comes ahead of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' nonfarm payrolls report, which economists anticipate will show an increase of 125,000 jobs for May. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A forthcoming documentary, "The Dying Trade," highlights the mental and emotional toll on slaughterhouse workers, detailing instances of improperly stunned animals being butchered alive. Workers often cope with the rapid, hectic pace and the violence they witness by dissociating, abusing alcohol, or using drugs. Psychology researchers have difficulty accessing slaughterhouse worker populations, leading to a lack of comprehensive data on mental health conditions in this field. Studies indicate high rates of anxiety, depression, and perpetration-induced traumatic stress (PITS) among slaughterhouse workers, suggesting a need for greater awareness and support.</p>

          <p>Two federal courts have ruled that President Trump lacks the authority to impose tariffs, but the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has temporarily paused those decisions. This litigation is shaping up as a major separation-of-powers controversy, reminiscent of the 1952 "steel seizure" case. The core issue is whether a 50-year-old statute, the International Economic Emergency Powers Act of 1977, grants the president the power to set tariffs, despite the Constitution explicitly assigning that authority to Congress. The Supreme Court may ultimately decide the extent of presidential power in this area. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A conservative student newspaper at Brown University is facing disciplinary hearings after publishing DOGE-style questions about the work of university staff. The newspaper's writers were summoned to these hearings following their satirical take on university administration. The incident has sparked debate about free speech and the boundaries of student journalism on college campuses. The university has yet to release a formal statement regarding the disciplinary actions.</p>

          <p>An inquiry by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) has found that train passengers are unfairly penalized for minor ticketing mistakes due to the complexity of Britain's fare system. The ORR urges rail firms to cease taking disproportionate action against travelers. Cases cited include passengers threatened with court action for using the wrong railcard discount or mistakenly getting off at the wrong station. The Rail Delivery Group acknowledges the need for more consistency but emphasizes that fare evasion costs the industry Â£400 million annually.</p>

          <p>Marcus Arduini Monzo is on trial for allegedly carrying out a series of attacks with a sword in Hainault, London, resulting in the death of 14-year-old Daniel Anjorin and injuries to five others. Prosecutors claim Monzo deliberately drove his van into a pedestrian before attacking him with the sword, and then fatally attacked Anjorin as he walked to school. The defense argues that Monzo was suffering from a psychotic episode induced by drug use. The court heard that Monzo allegedly shouted "do you believe in God?" during the attacks.</p>
