            <p>Pakistan has deported over 19,500 Afghans this month, part of a larger expulsion of undocumented Afghans and those with temporary permission, citing national security risks and strain on public services.

This action has raised concerns from the Taliban and the UN, particularly regarding the future of Afghan girls' education, which is restricted under Taliban rule, and the displacement of families who have lived in Pakistan for generations.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's administration is moving to reclassify approximately 50,000 federal workers as "at-will" employees, stripping them of civil service protections. This new classification, termed "Schedule Policy/Career," aims to hold these employees to higher standards of conduct and performance, with the potential for easier termination if they don't align with the President's policy interests. Critics worry this could lead to political interference and a less stable federal workforce, while supporters argue it will improve accountability.</p>
