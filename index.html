          <h2>Co-pilot Error Suspected in Air India Crash</h2>

          <p>Aviation expert Steve Scheibner suggests co-pilot error may have caused the Air India Flight AI171 crash.  He speculates the co-pilot may have raised the flaps instead of retracting the landing gear.  Investigators are analyzing the black box and interviewing crew.  Other theories include mechanical failure, though pilot error is currently the leading theory.</p>
