          <p>Entertainer Michael Feinstein reflects on his five-decade career dedicated to performing and preserving the Great American Songbook. He recounts his early life as a self-taught pianist, his formative years working for Ira Gershwin, and his eventual rise to fame. Feinstein has since established the Great American Songbook Foundation in Indiana, which includes a museum and a music academy for young performers. He believes the songbook is an evolving tradition, encompassing not only classics by Gershwin but also the works of modern artists like Carole King and Billy Joel, ensuring its legacy continues to resonate with new audiences.</p>

          <p>A mass stabbing at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, has left eleven people hospitalized, with six reported in critical condition and five in serious condition. The suspect, a 42-year-old man, was apprehended at the scene after allegedly attacking shoppers at random near the checkout area with a folding knife. Authorities, who arrived within three minutes of the first 911 call, credited citizen involvement in helping to subdue the attacker and prevent further harm. The incident has been described by Michigan's governor as a 'brutal act of violence,' prompting a large-scale investigation involving local and federal law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns General Manager Andrew Berry publicly admonished rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders for receiving two significant speeding tickets during the offseason. Sanders was cited for driving 91 mph in a 65-mph zone and later 101 mph in a 60-mph zone. Berry labeled the actions as 'not smart' and dangerous, emphasizing the risk to others. Sanders, who has since acknowledged his 'wrong choices,' is currently competing for a position on the team after an unexpected slide in the NFL Draft, where he was selected in the fifth round.</p>

          <p>White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought discussed the administration's fiscal policies, including its criticism of the Federal Reserve and plans for spending. Vought stated the President seeks a new Fed chair who will lower interest rates more quickly and criticized the current chair for being 'too late' on inflation. He also defended the administration's review and delay of congressionally approved funds for education and health, stating it was to prevent misuse by 'left wing organizations.' Vought acknowledged the administration is considering a rescissions package to claw back funds, raising concerns among some senators about executive overreach and a potential government shutdown.</p>

          <p>Actress Kristin Scott Thomas has directed her first film, 'My Mother's Wedding,' drawing inspiration from her own childhood tragedies. The film, starring Scarlett Johansson and Sienna Miller, centers on three daughters grappling with loss as their mother prepares for her third marriage. Scott Thomas lost her father, a Royal Navy pilot, at age five, and her stepfather died in a similar accident five years later, experiences that profoundly shaped the film's narrative.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent global trials of a four-day, 32-hour workweek reveal that increased employee happiness stems from more than just additional free time. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, a significant factor is that employees feel more effective and productive at their jobs. To fit their work into a shorter timeframe, teams are forced to eliminate inefficiencies, streamline processes, and focus on high-priority tasks, leading to a greater sense of accomplishment. This boost in work-related self-esteem and reduced stress contributes substantially to overall well-being, fostering better work-life balance and even improved team spirit among colleagues working toward a common goal.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has initiated a daily 10-hour 'tactical pause' in fighting in parts of Gaza to allow humanitarian aid to reach the population amid a worsening hunger crisis.

The move comes as international pressure mounts over warnings of famine and images of malnourished children. While the U.N. welcomed the step, it reiterated that a broader ceasefire is necessary to address the humanitarian catastrophe affecting the entire Gaza Strip.</p>

The announcement comes as resident doctors engage in a five-day strike over pay disputes with the British Medical Association (BMA). Badenoch accused the BMA of becoming 'more and more militant' and stated the move is necessary to protect patients and public finances, a proposal that would significantly curtail doctors' current rights.</p>

Nevelson, who passed away in 1988, was renowned for her large-scale assemblages created from found objects, often discarded wood she collected from the streets of New York. Despite facing early anti-Semitism upon immigrating from Ukraine to Maine, she fiercely pursued her artistic vision, gaining widespread recognition late in her career.

          <p>French companies are being forced to recalibrate their strategies in Africa as France's long-standing sphere of influence, known as 'Francafrique,' collapses, particularly in the Sahel region. Growing anti-French sentiment and political instability have challenged Paris's military and economic presence, with nations like Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso rejecting former colonial ties. This shift has diminished the preferential treatment French businesses once enjoyed, with their market share in French-speaking Africa dropping significantly in the face of competition from China. Companies like nuclear corporation Orano have faced operational suspensions and revoked licenses, prompting a broader pivot toward new partnerships and markets elsewhere on the continent.</p>

The piece posits that Trump's obsession with tariffs and his ventures into cryptocurrency are methods to control outcomes and enrich himself, bypassing the impersonal and measurable nature of free markets.

The proposed agreement reportedly centers on a 15% baseline tariff on EU goods, significantly higher than pre-Trump rates but seen as a necessary compromise to restore stability. With global financial markets watching closely, the outcome of this high-stakes meeting remains uncertain, with Trump himself stating the chances of a deal are '50/50.'</p>

          <p>Shi Yongxin, the abbot of the world-renowned Shaolin Temple in China, is under criminal investigation for allegedly violating Buddhist precepts. The temple, famous as the birthplace of Zen Buddhism and Shaolin kung fu, has also accused the 60-year-old monk of maintaining improper relationships with multiple women and fathering illegitimate children. Shi, who became abbot in 1999, is known as the 'CEO monk' for his extensive commercialization of the temple's heritage, a practice that has drawn criticism for years. The temple has promised to release more details about the investigation as it proceeds.</p>

          <p>A persistent scam in Bogotá, Colombia, involves saboteurs on motorcycles, known as 'pinchallantas,' who deliberately puncture car tires on busy streets. These individuals spread sharp objects on the road and then approach the stranded motorists, directing them to nearby mechanics who are allegedly part of the scheme. At the repair shops, victims report that mechanics often create additional holes in the tire to inflate the repair costs, sometimes charging prices equivalent to a new set of tires. Despite a recent crackdown by authorities, the fast-moving nature of the crime makes it difficult to catch the perpetrators in the act.</p>

          <p>Former England rugby player Matt Dawson argues that for the current British and Irish Lions squad to be remembered as a truly legendary team, they must complete a 3-0 series whitewash against Australia. While celebrating the series win, Dawson suggests that the team's legacy depends on achieving this rare feat, last accomplished on a major tour nearly a century ago. He contrasts the current squad's public ambition for a clean sweep with his own 1997 Lions team, which won the series 2-0 but lost the final test in South Africa. Dawson believes the current team's superior fitness and Australia's relative weakness make a 3-0 victory an achievable and necessary goal.</p>

The signs, placed near struggling or closed facilities, argue that Trump's deep cuts to Medicaid are devastating rural healthcare. The campaign highlights the over $1 trillion cut from the program under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which is projected to cause nearly 12 million people to lose coverage and place hundreds of rural hospitals at risk of closure.

          <p>Oakland's Chinatown, one of the oldest in the U.S., is facing a new economic challenge from tariffs on Chinese goods, even after surviving the pandemic and anti-Asian violence. Local merchants report that while customer traffic remains steady, consumer spending has dropped significantly on imported items like traditional foods, teas, and furniture. One supermarket owner noted that costs for imported goods have risen by an average of 50%, forcing customers to cut back on their purchases. This economic pressure threatens the vitality of the historic district, which serves as a cultural and commercial hub for the wider San Francisco Bay Area community.</p>

          <p>This analytical article posits that Donald Trump's presidency has unintentionally fueled a resurgence of interest in socialism among Americans, particularly the younger generation. The author argues that Trump's 'ersatz capitalism,' characterized by cronyism, self-enrichment, and attacks on free trade, discredits market economics in the eyes of many. By portraying the economic system as rigged and exploitative, his administration's actions and rhetoric validate the critiques of capitalism's staunchest opponents. This disillusionment, combined with economic anxieties, has created an opening for politicians promoting socialist ideas, which were once considered politically marginal, to gain significant traction and influence in contemporary American politics.</p>

The fires have caused injuries to firefighters, destroyed property, and burned significant forest areas, prompting Greece to request assistance from the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay reflects on the near-disappearance of comprehensive arts and music event listings from publications like The New Yorker and The New York Times. The author argues that these listings were vital for cultural discovery, guiding audiences to a wide array of performances and helping to nurture robust subcultures. Their decline, driven by shifts in journalism and the rise of algorithm-driven social media, has created a feedback loop where only what is already popular receives coverage. This trend not only makes it harder for emerging artists to find an audience but also impoverishes the broader cultural ecosystem, which relies on the cross-pollination of ideas between niche and mainstream art forms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The practice of tipping in the United States is rooted in the post-Civil War era, where it was used as a way for employers to avoid paying wages to formerly enslaved Black workers in service jobs. This system was later codified by the creation of a 'tipped minimum wage,' currently $2.13 an hour at the federal level, which allows employers to pay workers less than the standard minimum wage with the expectation that tips will make up the difference. According to the Economic Policy Institute, this structure is a direct legacy of racial discrimination and is perpetuated by powerful lobbying from groups like the National Restaurant Association, which fights to keep labor costs low.</p>
