          <p>Lyon, a prominent French football club, has been relegated to Ligue 2 due to significant financial difficulties, a decision made by the DNGC, the organization overseeing French football club finances. Despite attempts to improve their financial situation through player sales and releasing high earners, Lyon failed to convince the DNGC of sufficient improvement. The club's owner, John Textor, expressed incomprehension at the decision, emphasizing the club's proven funds and sporting success, and confirmed plans to appeal the ruling. If the relegation stands, Reims will replace Lyon in the top flight, marking a significant setback for the seven-time French champions who have not played in the second tier since 1989. The club asserts they possess the necessary financial resources for the 2025-26 season due to capital injections and the sale of Crystal Palace.</p>

          <p>FedEx reported strong quarterly earnings and revenue, surpassing analysts' estimates, and announced achieving its $4 billion cost-cutting goal while aiming for an additional $1 billion in savings next fiscal year. CEO Raj Subramaniam highlighted the company's successful structural cost reduction amid ongoing challenges, expressing confidence in transformation initiatives focused on network integration and cost reduction. Despite the positive results, FedEx stock experienced a slight drop in after-hours trading due to current-quarter profit guidance that fell slightly short of Wall Street expectations. The company's fiscal 2026 guidance includes further cost-cutting reductions, and FedEx is proceeding with plans to spin off its Freight division into two publicly traded companies.</p>

          <p>Anthropic, an AI company, secured a legal victory in a copyright case, with a judge ruling that using legally purchased books to train its AI model, Claude, did not violate U.S. copyright law. The judge determined that this use of copyrighted books was "quintessentially transformative" and aligned with "fair use" doctrine, likening it to a reader aspiring to be a writer. However, the court found that Anthropic may have infringed copyright laws by downloading millions of pirated books, leading to a separate trial scheduled for December. This ruling sets a potentially important precedent for similar disputes involving AI companies and copyright infringement.</p>

          <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer voiced strong disapproval over the Trump administration's postponement of a classified briefing on the Iran-Israel conflict, labeling it "outrageous," "evasive," and "derelict." Schumer emphasized the administration's legal obligation to inform Congress about critical details of the conflict, including the impact of recent strikes and long-term strategies to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. The postponement was attributed to the desire to include Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who were attending a NATO conference, but Schumer insisted on hearing from the original briefers as well. The delay occurred amidst conflicting intelligence assessments regarding the effectiveness of the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>An initial classified US assessment indicates that recent strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities by the Trump administration had limited impact, failing to destroy two of the sites and likely setting back the nuclear program by only a few months. The report, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, concluded that key components of the nuclear program could be restarted relatively quickly. The White House disputed the assessment, but the report suggests that President Trump's claims about the sites being "obliterated" may have been overstated. The report further indicates that much of Iranâ€™s stockpile of highly enriched uranium may have been moved prior to the strikes.</p>

This relationship is crucial for Iran's survival, as China's support helps prevent the country from returning to a closer relationship with the United States. China's reliance on Iranian oil is facilitated by a "dark fleet" of ships that evade sanctions by transferring and relabeling the oil.</p>
