        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shaquille O'Neal has voiced skepticism about the recent Blue Origin space flight, suggesting it may have involved green screen technology. During a discussion with comedian David Spade, O'Neal pointed to discrepancies in a video released by Blue Origin, such as the luxurious hair of the all-female crew, including Katy Perry and Lauren Sanchez, not moving in space. He also noted that the key Jeff Bezos used to open the hatch upon landing seemed unnecessary. O'Neal stated his belief that Bezos wouldn't risk sending his fiancée, Lauren Sanchez, into actual space, implying the event was staged. Optimism surrounding this topic is middling as it neither threatens nor promises the stability of our society.</p>

          <p>An internal review reveals that FEMA may not be fully prepared for the upcoming hurricane season. Acting FEMA Administrator David Richardson acknowledged the agency is only "80 or 85% there" with its hurricane plan. The document highlighted staffing limitations, hiring issues, and a lack of coordination with states as contributing factors. Richardson emphasized the president's intent to reduce FEMA's footprint and empower states to respond to disasters, but morale within FEMA has reportedly declined since the announcement of potential agency elimination.

          <p>New York University (NYU) has withheld the diploma of Logan Rozos, a graduate who used his commencement speech to condemn the Gaza war and accuse the U.S. of supporting "genocide." The university administration denounced Rozos' remarks, stating that he abused his privilege to express personal political views. Rozos, who identified as an actor, artist, and gay Black trans man, criticized the U.S.'s political and military support for the conflict in remarks that lasted about two-and-a-half minutes. NYU is currently under investigation by the Trump administration's antisemitism taskforce for incidents on campus since the Israel-Gaza war began.

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers are on the brink of striking due to stalled negotiations over pay raises, potentially impacting over 300,000 commuters. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) says its members haven't received a raise in five years. NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri asserts he wants a fair wage agreement but must also consider costs to fare riders and taxpayers.

          <p>U.S. Supreme Court justices have raised concerns about President Trump's attempt to limit birthright citizenship through an executive order, which would deny citizenship to babies born on American soil if their parents are not citizens or permanent residents. The court is also considering whether federal judges should be able to issue nationwide injunctions that restrict the president's power. The plan is likely to be struck down because it contradicts the 14th amendment, which grants citizenship to "all persons born or naturalized in the United States".

For years now, scientific advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been debating whether to continue to recommend that Americans 6 months of age and older be immunized, or to switch to a so-called risk-based strategy targeting only the most vulnerable, as is the practice now in most other countries. The advisers are expected to decide on a way forward at a meeting in June. But the debate may have become irrelevant.

          <p>President Trump's announcement that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on Syria came as a surprise to senior officials inside the Treasury Department. The announcement was also short on specifics, including which measures would be rolled back, and at what pace. The lack of clarity sent senior officials at Treasury scrambling to understand what he meant.

          <p>Japan's economy shrank for the first time in a year, contracting 0.2% in the March quarter as exports declined sharply, preliminary government data showed Friday. The gross domestic product data was poorer compared to the 0.1% contraction expected by economists polled by Reuters. Exports fell 0.6% quarter-on-quarter, shedding 0.8 percentage points off the GDP as uncertainties caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies affected Japan's export-heavy economy.
