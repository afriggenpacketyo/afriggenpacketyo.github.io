          <p>Elon Musk publicly stated that he regrets some of his recent social media posts directed at Donald Trump, admitting that they "went too far." This comes after a public dispute between the two figures, which had caused market concerns regarding Musk's companies, Tesla and SpaceX.

Musk had also accused Trump of being mentioned in the "files" of the late Jeffrey Epstein, an allegation the White House disputed.

          <p>Asia is increasingly moving away from reliance on the U.S. dollar, driven by geopolitical uncertainties, monetary shifts, and currency hedging strategies. ASEAN has committed to boosting the use of local currencies in trade and investment to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations. This trend is part of a broader global move to reduce dependence on the dollar, which has seen its share in global foreign exchange reserves decline. Experts suggest that the dollar's potential use as leverage in trade negotiations has prompted this reevaluation. The article emphasizes the growing sentiment among Asian economies to reduce FX risks by using their own currencies for trade. (not investment advice)</p>
