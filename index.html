          <p>The U.S. Justice Department, under new leadership, has reportedly fired at least three federal prosecutors who were handling cases related to the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack. According to sources, the dismissals included two supervisory attorneys and a line prosecutor from the U.S. attorneyâ€™s office in Washington, D.C. The termination letters did not provide a specific cause, citing only the executive branch's constitutional authority over personnel. This action follows President Trump's previous pardons of individuals connected to the event and a broader personnel reshuffling within the department aimed at aligning with the administration's agenda.</p>

          <p>Jens Spahn, Germany's former health minister, is under investigation for the potential misuse of public funds related to large-scale face mask orders during the COVID-19 pandemic. A parliamentary budget committee is questioning his decision to order masks at inflated prices and then fail to accept or pay for them, potentially costing the government â‚¬2.3 billion in lawsuits. A report indicated Spahn acted against the advice of his own specialized departments. The controversy has led to calls for a broader inquiry commission to review the government's entire pandemic response to rebuild public trust and prepare for future crises.</p>

          <p>A settlement has been reached in the civil lawsuit filed by three crew members of the movie "Rust" against the film's producers, including Alec Baldwin. The plaintiffs alleged negligence and sought compensation for emotional distress following the fatal on-set shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins in 2021. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. This civil case is separate from the criminal proceedings, which saw armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Baldwin, who was holding the firearm when it discharged, has consistently maintained that the shooting was a tragic accident.</p>

          <p>A 70-year-old Egyptian man has pleaded guilty to harming a law enforcement animal after he kicked a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) beagle at Washington Dulles International Airport. The incident occurred when the 5-year-old detector dog, named Freddie, alerted his handler to the man's luggage. The man kicked the dog with enough force to lift it off the ground, causing contusions. Authorities discovered over 100 pounds of undeclared and prohibited agricultural products in his bags. The man was ordered to pay the dog's veterinary bills and was subsequently removed from the United States.</p>

Norris's exceptional lap provides a crucial boost as he seeks to close the 22-point gap to his teammate in the championship standings.

          <p>A coalition of over 70 authors, including prominent names like Dennis Lehane and Lauren Groff, has published an open letter demanding that major publishing houses commit to not releasing books created by artificial intelligence. The letter, addressed to the "big five" publishers, also requests safeguards against replacing human employees with AI and using AI for audiobook narration. This direct appeal to publishers marks a new strategy for authors, who have previously focused on lawsuits against AI companies for copyright infringement. The authors argue that while AI is a powerful tool, the replacement of human art and artists is not a societal benefit.</p>

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated that conditions in Haiti have improved enough for citizens to return, a conclusion that contrasts with the State Department's Level 4 "Do Not Travel" advisory for the country due to crime and civil unrest.

The measure, proposed by Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, was defeated in a 53-47 vote, falling short of the simple majority needed. The vote occurred after U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and the subsequent announcement of a fragile ceasefire. Proponents of the resolution argued it was necessary to reassert Congress's constitutional role in authorizing war, while opponents felt it was not needed at this time.</p>

A year later, the Democratic party is still grappling with its direction, marked by internal divisions between its progressive and moderate wings.

          <p>Republican Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska, a moderate who has at times been critical of Donald Trump, will not seek re-election in 2026. His retirement opens up a competitive seat in his Omaha-based swing district, which voted for Kamala Harris in the last presidential election. Democrats view this as a prime opportunity to flip a seat in their effort to regain a House majority. Bacon, a retired Air Force brigadier general, has recently criticized members of the Trump administration and taken stances at odds with his party, reflecting the politically divided nature of his district.</p>

          <p>Israel's ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, has confirmed he will attend the August peace ceremony in Nagasaki marking the 80th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing. The city did not invite Israel to the 2024 ceremony due to the conflict in Gaza, a decision which prompted other G7 ambassadors to withdraw in protest. For this year's event, Nagasaki's government has adopted a more inclusive approach, inviting all diplomatic missions in Japan. The move signals a step towards de-escalating the diplomatic friction from the previous year's event and focusing on the shared message of peace.</p>

Negotiations for a pause in the 21-month-long war have been intermittent, with the latest proposal involving a 60-day ceasefire in exchange for the release of hostages and prisoners.

          <p>The victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary has drawn varied reactions from conservatives. While some, like Donald Trump, labeled him an extremist, others at a recent conservative conference expressed a grudging respect for his effective grassroots campaign that defeated establishment candidate Andrew Cuomo. Many attendees viewed his win as a phenomenon specific to New York's liberal political landscape and not indicative of a national trend. The result has nonetheless fueled discussions about the direction of the Democratic party and the potential for progressive figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in future national elections.</p>

          <p>According to a veteran Chinese expert on the Middle East, Iran may seek military support from China amid its escalating conflicts with Israel and the United States, but Beijing is likely to respond with caution. China's primary interests lie in maintaining a delicate balance in the region, which includes its relationships with Israel and other Western-aligned Gulf states. The expert, Pan Guang, noted that while the direct Iran-Israel conflict is unlikely to become a full-scale war, retaliatory actions could continue. China's cautious approach reflects its complex economic and strategic interests, which temper its partnership with Tehran.</p>

          <p>A real estate broker with a decade of experience suggests that prospective homebuyers use the "80-10-10 Rule" to determine if a property is the right fit, as no house is ever perfect. According to this industry guideline, the ideal home should have 80% of the features you love and cannot change, such as location and architectural style. Another 10% should consist of elements you can improve over time, like paint or fixtures. The final 10% represents things you can live with, such as a neighbor's fence, which shouldn't be deal-breakers.</p>

          <p>The European Union has formally proposed imposing global export restrictions on all eel species, a move that faces strong opposition from Japan, a major consumer. The proposal, submitted under an international treaty on endangered species, would require proof of legal capture and an export permit for all international eel trade. If adopted, the measure aims to combat the decline in eel populations worldwide, which are threatened by overfishing and habitat loss. The restrictions would significantly impact the global seafood market, particularly Japan's culinary industry, where unagi (freshwater eel) is a prized delicacy.</p>

          <p>Petroleum analysts are forecasting that U.S. consumers could see the lowest summer gas prices since 2021, with the national average potentially dropping below $3 per gallon by September. A recent spike in oil prices, attributed to the conflict between Israel and Iran, is expected to be temporary following a ceasefire agreement. The anticipated price drop follows typical summer trends, where increased refinery production and a leveling-off of consumer demand contribute to a slow decline. According to experts, when adjusted for inflation, current gas prices are already near a 20-year low. (not investment advice)</p>
