          <p>President Trump refuted claims he backs down on tariff threats, a strategy dubbed "Trump Always Chickens Out" (TACO). He asserted his tariff announcements have led to productive trade negotiations, citing the EU's willingness to meet after his tariff threats. Trump defended delaying a 50% tariff on EU goods, framing it as a negotiation tactic that jumpstarted trade talks. He criticized the question as "nasty" while maintaining that his moves have helped the U.S. gain ground in trade negotiations. Optimism score is based on the fact that he believes that his tactics are effective.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve officials expressed concerns that tariffs could worsen inflation, creating difficult choices for interest rate policy, according to recently released minutes.

The article explains that since the meeting, the U.S. and China eased tariff tensions, and Trump has pressured the Fed to lower rates, but Chair Powell has resisted political influence.

Kennedy Jr.'s decision to halt routine Covid-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women has triggered outrage in the scientific and medical communities.

          <p>A German court dismissed a climate lawsuit filed by a Peruvian farmer against a German energy company, RWE, but affirmed that German civil law could hold companies accountable for their emissions' global effects. The plaintiff, SaÃºl Luciano Lliuya, argued that his city faced inundation from melting glaciers and RWE should contribute to containment costs. Although the court ruled against the plaintiff due to a low probability of flood risk to his property, the decision established a legal foundation for corporate climate liability.
