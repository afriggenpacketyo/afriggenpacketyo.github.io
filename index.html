          <p>The trial of healthcare workers involved in Diego Maradona's death faces potential disruption after a judge, Julieta Makintach, stepped down due to her involvement in a documentary about the case. Makintach's participation in the "Divine Justice" miniseries raised concerns about impartiality, especially after a trailer showed courtroom footage, potentially violating court rules. The prosecution accused her of acting like an actress rather than a judge, leading to her recusal. The remaining judges will decide whether to proceed with the trial or order a new one, impacting the proceedings against seven medical team members charged with negligent homicide in Maradona's death. The events leading up to Maradona's death are now being scrutinized once again. The optimism score is not related to this summary.</p>

Carturan, who escaped and alerted authorities, was reportedly targeted for his Bitcoin wallet password, with the attackers subjecting him to physical abuse and threats.

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's upcoming IPO is notable for an unusual aspect: existing shareholders are selling more shares than the company itself. In its updated prospectus, Circle stated it would sell 9.6 million shares, while existing shareholders would sell 14.4 million shares, a trend seen previously with Facebook's IPO in 2012. While Circle didn't provide a reason, the high amount of insider sales likely reflects venture capital firms' need for liquidity after a period of meager returns. This move highlights the pressure on Silicon Valley's tech investors to secure exits and distribute funds back to their own investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The State Department has directed U.S. embassies to temporarily suspend scheduling new student visa appointments as the Trump administration plans to expand social media screenings for applicants. This pause, expected to last until further guidance is issued, is due to an anticipated "expansion of required social media screening and vetting." The Department of Homeland Security also plans to screen some visa applicants for "antisemitic activity on social media." These measures are part of a broader effort to control international students, though some actions have faced legal challenges, including a blocked policy against Harvard University. The measures are seen as part of wider slate of controls aimed at international students.</p>

Musk stated that the bill undermines the work his DOGE team is doing to cut government waste. The legislation is projected to add $3 trillion or more to federal budget deficits over the next decade through tax cuts that are only partially offset by spending reductions. Musk's criticism is notable given his close ties to the president and his role in identifying areas for government savings, even as real-time federal data shows the government spending more than it did last year.</p>

The mission also flew a booster that had been used for an earlier test flight, marking progress toward reusability.

          <p>SpaceX's Starship rocket experienced an uncontrolled reentry after losing contact with mission control during its ninth uncrewed test flight. The spacecraft, intended for interplanetary travel, leaked fuel, spun out of control, and likely disintegrated over the Indian Ocean. SpaceX confirmed that Starship suffered from "a rapid unscheduled disassembly," attributing the loss of attitude control to a propellant leak or engine failure in the upper stage. The company emphasized that the test would help improve Starship's reliability, despite the previous two attempts also ending in explosions. The uncontrolled reentry highlights the ongoing challenges in developing the Starship for future missions.</p>

          <h2>Unemployment Rising Among Recent College Graduates, Study Finds</h2>

          <p>A new report from Oxford Economics reveals that recent college graduates are facing increasing difficulty finding employment, contributing to a rise in the national unemployment rate. Unemployed recent graduates account for 12% of the increase in unemployment since mid-2023, despite making up only 5% of the labor force. The report attributes this trend to a slowdown in hiring in previously strong sectors, particularly in the tech industry, where there is an oversupply of graduates. Economic uncertainty, driven by trade policies, is also contributing to the slowdown, leading businesses to pause on growth and investment. The report also notes the effect of "underemployment" where college graduates take jobs for which their degree is not necessary.</p>

While Judge Wilson rejected the plea deal, he granted the prosecution's motion to lessen the charges, meaning Kirk could still face jail time. The case stems from a 2023 incident where Kirk pepper-sprayed and assaulted an unarmed woman, Jacey Houseton, during a purported robbery investigation.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists claim to have found a solution to a critical flaw in hyperloop technology, potentially improving the comfort of ultra-high-speed ground travel. A study published in the Journal of Railway Science and Engineering indicates that minor imperfections in tracks and electromagnetic resonance can cause violent low-frequency vibrations in maglev cars traveling at 1,000 km/h. Researchers at China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) say they have developed a method to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, making the ride less unpleasant. The team used supercomputer simulations and scaled-down prototype tests to achieve these results, offering a potential path forward for Elon Musk’s Hyperloop concept.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship successfully reached orbit during its ninth test flight, marking a significant milestone, but the mission ended with the spacecraft experiencing an uncontrolled reentry and disassembly. An apparent propellant leak caused a loss of attitude control, leading to the spacecraft spinning and mission control losing the ability to steer it. The spacecraft re-entered Earth's atmosphere at a suboptimal angle, resulting in its expected burn-up over the Indian Ocean. SpaceX said that the test was an important learning opportunity and that they will continue to improve Starship's reliability for future missions.
