          <p>Two men in their 60s were hospitalized in Poland after a World War II artillery shell, which one had found in a forest and brought home, unexpectedly exploded in their apartment while they were drinking. Police, responding to reports of a blown-out window, evacuated residents from the building and surrounding houses, discovering both men under the influence of alcohol. While the men sustained non-life-threatening injuries, officers located another unexploded WWII-era mine on the premises, which was subsequently secured and neutralized. Prosecutors have launched an investigation into the dangerous incident, prompting authorities to issue a stark warning against touching or moving any discovered unexploded ordnance.</p>

          <p>Intel snapped a streak of six quarterly losses, returning to profitability in its third quarter, fueled by robust demand for chips, particularly in client computing and AI PCs. The company significantly bolstered its cash position and liquidity, securing substantial investments from the U.S. government and Softbank, with more expected from a deal with Nvidia. While Intel's foundry business continues to seek a major customer and saw a 2% revenue drop, the company reported steady progress on its advanced 18A nodes. An unexpected positive was the strong, continued sales of older chipmaking processes, indicating customer preference for proven technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mortgage interest rates are experiencing daily fluctuations influenced by various market conditions, including the government shutdown, inflation, and upcoming Federal Reserve policy decisions. The average 30-year mortgage rate currently stands at 6.19%, a notable decrease from 7.04% in mid-January, offering potential savings for buyers and refinancers. With a high probability of a Fed rate cut at its October 29 meeting, further minor reductions in mortgage rates are anticipated, though many lenders may have already priced this in. The article advises consumers to check credit reports and shop for lenders to make informed decisions in this evolving climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dahbia Benkired, 27, has been handed a rare whole-life sentence in France for the sexual assault and murder of 12-year-old Lola Daviet, a case that deeply shocked the nation in October 2022. The court imposed the country's harshest possible penalty, citing the "extreme cruelty of the criminal acts" and the "unspeakable psychological damage" to the victim's family. Benkired, an Algerian immigrant who was under orders to leave France, confessed to the crime and expressed remorse during the trial. The tragic incident sparked political debate regarding immigration policies, which Lola's parents publicly denounced for exploiting their child's name.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon announced the deployment of the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group to waters off Latin America, significantly escalating U.S. efforts to counter narcotics traffickers. This major buildup will dramatically increase the number of service members and ships dedicated to disrupting illicit activities in the Caribbean Sea, Central, and South America. The decision follows recent U.S. strikes against alleged drug trafficking vessels, including one operated by a Venezuelan gang, which resulted in multiple fatalities. This enhanced force presence underscores the Trump administration's intensified campaign against drug cartels in the Western Hemisphere.</p>

Republicans are pushing for a short-term spending extension to negotiate a longer-term deal, while Democrats insist on including COVID-19 pandemic-era enhanced Obamacare subsidies.

Allegations include a player manipulating his own performance for prop bets and a coach participating in rigged poker games with organized crime figures.

Despite frequent fumarolic activity, Taftan has not experienced a major eruption in recorded history, and its remote location means it is not closely monitored.

It highlights the historical significance of the East Wing as a functional workspace for First Ladies since Rosalynn Carter.

Recent incidents, including NBA and MLB investigations, highlight how this temptation has become "irresistible" for some athletes.
