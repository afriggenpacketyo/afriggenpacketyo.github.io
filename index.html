          <p>A Christian girls' summer camp in Texas, Camp Mystic, has become the center of a tragic story following one of the state's deadliest recent flood disasters. The camp, located on the Guadalupe River, was inundated by sudden, massive floodwaters, resulting in the deaths of multiple young campers, including eight-year-old Renee Smajstrla. The aftermath reveals a scene of devastation, with mud-caked, destroyed belongings scattered where children had gathered for summer activities. As search and rescue operations continue for the missing, questions are being raised about the safety of situating numerous youth camps so close to the flood-prone river.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal was marred by a significant failure in the new electronic line-calling system. Play was halted when the system failed to call a clear out-ball from Kartal, a point that would have given Pavlyuchenkova the lead in a crucial game. After a delay, the umpire, unable to make a retroactive call, ordered the point to be replayed, which Kartal subsequently won. Pavlyuchenkova, who ultimately won the match, expressed deep frustration, stating a game was "stolen" and called for video review systems similar to those in other sports to prevent such errors.</p>

          <p>Formerly known as Tropical Storm Chantal, the system has been downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina. Its maximum sustained winds have decreased to 35 mph as it moves north, with all tropical storm warnings being discontinued. Despite weakening, the system is still expected to bring heavy rainfall, with up to 6 inches in some areas, prompting flood watches across inland portions of North and South Carolina through Monday. The storm is forecast to continue losing strength and is expected to dissipate completely by Monday.</p>

          <p>A multi-vehicle crash in Herriman, Utah, led to a dramatic explosion after an SUV struck a Domino's Pizza, rupturing a gas line. Two individuals were rescued from the SUV by courageous bystanders just minutes before the vehicle and the building were engulfed in a massive fireball. The explosion completely destroyed the Domino's and caused significant damage to adjacent businesses, but no one was inside the building at the time of the crash. Multiple people involved in the initial accident were hospitalized, but miraculously, no injuries were reported from the subsequent blast itself.</p>

          <p>The death toll from catastrophic flooding in Texas has risen to at least 70 people, including 21 children, with dozens still missing. In response to the crisis, President Trump has signed a major disaster declaration for the hard-hit Kerr County, enabling the deployment of federal resources, including FEMA and the U.S. Coast Guard, to aid in search and rescue efforts. The majority of the child fatalities occurred at Camp Mystic, a summer camp located along the Guadalupe River. Officials have stressed that search operations are ongoing as they work to locate all unaccounted for individuals.</p>

Speaking on CNN, Bessent, an ally of President Trump, referenced the unpopularity of the 'Doge' government efficiency department that Musk briefly headed. He speculated that the boards of directors at companies like Tesla and SpaceX would prefer Musk to concentrate on his business responsibilities rather than political ventures. The comments highlight a growing rift between Musk and the Trump administration, which escalated after Musk criticized the president's major tax and spending bill.</p>

He mentioned that countries where deals are not yet finalized will receive letters outlining the administration's terms, suggesting a push to conclude talks. Hassett also touted the administration's strategy, claiming the threat of tariffs is successfully encouraging companies to move production to the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's cricket coach, Brendon McCullum, has conceded that the team likely made a mistake by choosing to bowl first in their second Test match against India at Edgbaston. The decision allowed India to bat first on a favorable pitch, where they amassed a commanding total of 587 runs, ultimately leading to a 336-run victory over England. Captain Ben Stokes typically prefers to chase in the fourth innings, a strategy that has often been successful, but McCullum admitted they misjudged how the wicket would play. Stokes, however, focused on the team's inability to dismiss India's lower-order batsmen rather than the toss.</p>

The author contends that while the policies aim to spur economic growth, they neglect critical social and environmental issues, such as the lingering effects of the city's water crisis. The piece highlights that the administration is lifting environmental controls and cutting health monitoring programs, which could worsen public health and impede revitalization efforts. It concludes that sustainable recovery for Rust Belt cities requires investment in social and public health infrastructure, not just economic incentives. (not investment advice)</p>

While National Weather Service forecasters did issue a series of alerts, including a top-level flash flood emergency, the article notes that staffing shortages and funding cuts under the Trump administration have hampered efforts to improve forecasting models.

          <p>During the BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro, Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva announced a partnership to apply artificial intelligence to agriculture. The two leaders agreed to establish a joint center focused on improving farming techniques, particularly for family farms in semi-arid regions. One of the first initiatives will be an AI laboratory developed by Brazil’s National Semi-arid Institute and the China Agricultural University. This collaboration aims to connect AI with common farm machinery to enhance environmental monitoring and improve soil quality in both nations.</p>

          <p>Following a public fallout with President Donald Trump over a major spending bill, Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party called the "America Party." Musk, who had been a staunch Trump supporter, heavily criticized the president's new law, calling it a form of "debt slavery." The announcement on his social media platform X drew apparent interest from fellow billionaires Mark Cuban and Anthony Scaramucci. Musk suggested the party could aim to win a small number of key seats in Congress to act as a deciding vote on contentious legislation, breaking the two-party hold.</p>

          <p>Two years after a car crashed into an end-of-term tea party at a London school, the parents of the two eight-year-old girls killed are still fighting for answers. Nuria Sajjad and Selena Lau died in the 2023 incident at The Study Preparatory School in Wimbledon. At a remembrance event, Nuria's mother expressed frustration over the long wait to uncover the truth. The driver, who claimed to have no memory of the event due to an epileptic seizure, was initially not charged but was re-arrested in January after police reviewed the investigation, which parents hope will finally provide accountability.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has deported a group of eight men to South Sudan following a contentious legal battle that culminated in a favorable Supreme Court ruling for the Trump administration. The men, convicted of various crimes, were flown to the unstable nation after their home countries reportedly refused to accept them. This action is part of a broader administration effort to expand deportations to third countries. A district judge had initially blocked the removal, ruling that the men required due process hearings, but the Supreme Court overturned this decision, allowing the deportations to proceed.</p>

          <p>Republicans may face significant political backlash in the upcoming midterm elections over the deep cuts to Medicaid included in President Trump's recently passed megabill. The legislation, which could cause nearly 12 million people to lose insurance coverage, has already prompted one vulnerable GOP senator to retire and has drawn opposition from others. Democrats are preparing to weaponize the issue, similar to their successful 2018 strategy against the attempted repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Republican lawmakers in swing districts are now tasked with defending the unpopular cuts to voters, many of whom rely on the program.</p>

According to its finance minister, Thailand aims to reduce its $46 billion trade surplus with the U.S. by 70% within five years, with a goal of reaching a balance in seven to eight years. The proposal comes as a July 9 deadline looms, after which a 90-day pause on tariff hikes will expire. Thailand's government is hoping to secure a baseline tariff rate of 10% but would find a rate between 10% and 20% acceptable to avoid the more damaging levy. (not investment advice)</p>
