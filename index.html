The workers, represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, are responsible for building F-15 fighter jets and other military aircraft. This labor action marks the first strike at Boeing's defense unit since 1996 and adds to the challenges facing the aviation giant, which has been grappling with safety issues and other production disruptions.

          <p>China's largest electric vehicle manufacturer, BYD, reported its first monthly decline in deliveries for the year, signaling the impact of a fierce price war in the country's competitive EV market. The company shipped over 341,000 units in July, a drop from the previous month, while rivals like Li Auto and Nio also saw declines. In contrast, competitors such as Xpeng and Leapmotor reported record or growing sales, highlighting a shifting landscape as automakers slash prices to attract customers. This intense competition has drawn the attention of Chinese policymakers, who have warned against excessive price-cutting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Billionaire hotelier Ong Beng Seng has pleaded guilty to abetting the obstruction of justice in a major corruption case involving Singapore's former transport minister, S. Iswaran. Ong admitted to helping the minister cover up evidence related to expensive gifts, including a private jet trip, that he had provided while they were engaged in official business. Due to Ong's poor health from a rare bone marrow cancer, prosecutors have recommended a fine instead of a jail sentence, citing the need for "judicial mercy." The case is a rare high-profile corruption scandal in Singapore, a country known for its low tolerance for graft.</p>

          <p>Manchester City's hiring of Pep Lijnders, a key figure in Jurgen Klopp's successful Liverpool era, is being interpreted as a sign of a potential major tactical evolution under manager Pep Guardiola. The article suggests Guardiola may be adapting his famous 'positional play' philosophy to incorporate more direct, high-energy, transition-focused football, a style championed by Klopp and Lijnders. This shift is also reflected in City's recent signings, who are skilled at carrying the ball and driving attacks, pointing towards a more dynamic and less rigidly controlled approach for the upcoming season.</p>

The propaganda broadcasts have long been a source of mutual irritation, and Pyongyang had previously halted its own broadcasts in response to Seoul's initial suspension of the practice.

This dynamic leads to a volatile status quo of escalating public anger and impotent government, as seen in both the UK and the US.

          <h2>Chinese Biotech Firms Innovent and BeOne on Track for First Profits in 2025</h2>

          <p>In a significant milestone for China's biotechnology sector, start-ups Innovent and BeOne are projected to achieve their first full-year profits in 2025. This marks a turning point for the industry, as many of these firms were able to go public in Hong Kong under a special listing regime that did not require prior profitability. The success of these companies, partly driven by new products like Innovent's weight-loss drug, suggests a maturation of the market and a reduced reliance on investor funding. Analysts see this as a sign that Chinese biotechs are creating significant value for patients and the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A riot at the Taxpan prison in the Mexican state of Veracruz has resulted in the deaths of seven inmates and left eleven others injured. According to authorities, the unrest broke out after inmates protested alleged extortion and abuse by members of the Grupo Sombra criminal organization within the facility. The incident, which saw fires set on the prison grounds, highlights the persistent and severe issues plaguing Mexico's prison system. These problems include control by criminal gangs, widespread corruption, and dangerous overcrowding.</p>

          <p>China has firmly rejected demands from the United States to stop purchasing oil from Iran and Russia, asserting that it will protect its national sovereignty and energy interests. The issue has become a major point of contention in broader trade negotiations between the two global powers. While Washington seeks to cripple the economies of its adversaries by restricting their oil revenue, Beijing has stated that "coercion and pressuring will not achieve anything." This defiant stance underscores a key area of strategic and economic conflict between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Propose Drone Upgrade Inspired by Ukraine War</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drawing lessons from the conflict in Ukraine, a group of Chinese defense researchers has proposed a significant upgrade to enhance the survivability of combat drones. The concept involves equipping small or medium-sized drones with compact, side-mounted rocket boosters. These boosters would allow the drone to perform instantaneous, high-G evasive maneuvers in the final seconds before an enemy missile impact. Digital simulations suggest this "terminal evasion" system could dramatically increase a drone's survival rate to nearly 90%, making it far more resilient against sophisticated air defense systems.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed a disturbing international network, with members in the UK, that creates, shares, and sells videos of cats and kittens being tortured and killed. Operating in groups on encrypted messaging apps, thousands of members participate in this extreme form of animal cruelty, with some UK-based members reportedly discussing adopting kittens from shelters for the purpose of mutilation. The report details the horrific nature of the videos, which include cats being drowned and electrocuted. The findings have prompted calls for action and highlight links to real-world animal abuse cases.</p>

          <p>An international team of biologists has begun a mission to save the endangered Polymita tree snails of Cuba, often called the world's most beautiful snails. Their vibrant, multi-colored shells have ironically made them a target for the illegal shell trade, which is pushing them toward extinction. Researchers from Cuba and the University of Nottingham in the UK are collaborating to study the snails' unique genetics and establish a captive breeding program. The project aims to provide crucial information for conservation efforts to protect the six known species from habitat loss and illegal collection.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed a compensation scheme for millions of motorists affected by the mis-selling of car finance. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that found some hidden commission deals, which incentivized dealers to charge higher interest rates, were unfair. The FCA will consult on the details of the payout scheme, which could cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion. This action aims to provide redress to consumers who were overcharged on their car loans due to these now-banned discretionary commission arrangements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The CEO of Doctors Without Borders USA, Avril Benoit, was left stunned during an ABC News interview after describing the catastrophic starvation crisis in Gaza. Following her harrowing account of third-degree burns and children with devastating injuries, the host pivoted to ask if Hamas releasing a video of a malnourished Israeli hostage constituted a war crime. Benoit paused before reminding the host that Israel's control over aid affects everyone, including hostages. The exchange highlighted a stark disconnect in media framing of the dire humanitarian situation unfolding in the Palestinian territory.</p>
