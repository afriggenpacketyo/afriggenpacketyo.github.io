          <p>Following the recent 12-day war with Israel, Iran has accelerated a domestic crackdown, executing six men on charges of collaborating with Israel's Mossad agency. Human rights activists argue the accused were denied fair trials and had no access to classified information. The regime has also arrested over 700 people and implemented a new "Espionage Law" to monitor citizens' online activities, creating an atmosphere of fear. This wave of repression is seen by many Iranians and activists as a way for the regime to reassert control and punish dissent after suffering significant military losses.</p>

          <p>Through a personal audio diary, 28-year-old Hanya Aljamal provides a poignant look at life in Deir al-Balah, in the middle of the Gaza war zone. A former teacher now displaced and living with her family, she describes the psychological toll of constant explosions, buzzing drones, and the loss of her former life and identity. The diary captures small acts of resistance and hope, like a neighbor tending his garden amidst the ruins, contrasted with the daily realities of malnourishment and the ever-present danger.

          <p>A team of astronomers has discovered mysterious, ancient radio signals that traveled for 10 billion years to reach Earth from a distant galaxy cluster known as SpARCS1049. The signals originate from a "mini-halo," a vast cloud of high-energy particles and magnetic fields, which has never been detected so far back in the universe's history. This finding, made using the LOFAR radio telescope, suggests that processes like supermassive black hole activity were shaping galaxies much earlier than previously thought. The discovery opens a new window into understanding the evolution of the early universe.</p>

          <p>In his third start of the season, Shohei Ohtani delivered his most impressive pitching performance yet, despite the Los Angeles Dodgers ultimately losing 9-5 to the Kansas City Royals. Ohtani pitched two scoreless innings, throwing the fastest pitch of his MLB career at 101.7 mph to escape a first-inning jam. Although his workload remains limited as he recovers from Tommy John surgery, his dominant display of high-velocity fastballs and sharp breaking pitches was a major positive. The Dodgers' bullpen struggled after his departure, and the offense couldn't overcome an early deficit.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is preparing for a crucial procedural vote on a sprawling tax and spending package championed by President Trump.

The White House has intensified pressure, calling failure to pass the bill an "ultimate betrayal." While some wavering senators like Josh Hawley have indicated they will vote to proceed, others remain opposed, making the outcome of the vote highly uncertain in the narrowly divided chamber.</p>

Speaking at a summit, Shum noted that the gap in chip production is a major challenge for Chinese firms. However, he highlighted that companies like DeepSeek are achieving results comparable to top US competitors using far less computing power, demonstrating a strong focus on algorithmic breakthroughs.

The findings revealed that while family members were buried together, genetic connections were primarily through the female line, indicating a matrilineal system where husbands likely moved into their wife's household. This is further supported by evidence of preferential treatment, with females receiving five times more grave goods than males.</p>

          <p>Two men involved in a human smuggling operation that resulted in the deaths of 53 migrants in an abandoned tractor-trailer have been sentenced to prison. A federal judge sentenced Felipe Orduna-Torres to life in prison and Armando Gonzales-Garcia to 83 years for their roles in the 2022 tragedy. The 64 migrants were locked in the back of the truck in the Texas summer heat with a broken air conditioner and no water. The sentences conclude a case that highlighted the extreme dangers migrants face when attempting to cross the U.S. border.</p>
