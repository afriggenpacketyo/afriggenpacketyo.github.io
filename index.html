          <p>A suspect identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman has been arrested and charged with multiple felonies, including the use of an incendiary device, following an attack on a pro-Israel demonstration in Boulder, Colorado. The FBI is investigating the incident as a "targeted terror attack" motivated by ideology, with Soliman allegedly yelling "Free Palestine" during the assault. Eight people were hospitalized with burns, ranging in age from 52 to 88, with one victim in critical condition. The attack occurred during a Run for Their Lives walk, an event aimed at raising awareness about hostages in Gaza, leading to the cancellation of all upcoming events. The victims included four women and four men, one of whom was a Holocaust refugee. The seriousness of the incident and the alleged motivation behind it highlight the ongoing tensions and violence surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The attack is considered to be a heinous act of terror and is part of a horrific and escalating wave of violence targeting Jews and their supporters simply for being Jewish or standing up for Jewish lives. The suspect's bond is set at $10,000,000.00. </p>

          <p>Nottinghamshire Police have initiated a corporate manslaughter investigation into the Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust, focusing on failures that led to numerous baby deaths and injuries. The investigation aims to determine if the maternity care provided by the trust was grossly negligent, examining about 2,500 cases of neonatal deaths, stillbirths, and harm to mothers and babies. The inquiry will center on two maternity units managed by the trust, with police expecting to review approximately 2,500 referred cases. Campaigners and parents of affected children have emphasized the need for individual accountability alongside penalizing the trust, highlighting that many responsible individuals are still employed. The trust has expressed deep sorrow and committed to full cooperation with the police investigation and independent review led by Donna Ockenden. The investigation is a serious criminal offense and seeks to determine if the overall responsibility lies with the organization rather than specific individuals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a right-wing conservative historian and euroskeptic, narrowly won the Polish presidential runoff against liberal-conservative Rafal Trzaskowski. Nawrocki's victory is a significant setback for Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-European government, as Nawrocki is expected to obstruct government reforms and align with the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party. During his campaign, Nawrocki opposed Ukraine joining NATO and favored conditional EU accession, advocating for reliance on the US for security and seeking war reparations from Germany. His win raises concerns about Poland distancing itself from Europe, similar to Hungary under Viktor Orban, potentially leading to a PiS return to power in 2027. Despite facing accusations of ties to criminal elements and scandals, Nawrocki united the "patriotic camp" and secured support from ultranationalist and antisemitic factions. The election result is a political earthquake that will lead to heightened divisions within Poland.</p>

          <p>Mount Etna, Europe's most active volcano located in Sicily, Italy, has erupted, spewing hot ash and lava in a pyroclastic flow. The nation's volcano monitoring body, INGV Vulcani, reported "explosions of increasing intensity" and noted that the activity from the Southeast Crater had become a lava fountain. Infrared images captured the flow of lava down the mountain's face, accompanied by a massive plume of smoke and ash rising into the sky. While Etna frequently erupts, causing occasional dust coverings in nearby towns, there were no immediate reports of risks to the local population or air travel. The volcano had a significant eruption just over a year ago, and it has erupted at least once every year for the past several years. The volcano is considered the most active stratovolcano in the world.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has launched a series of attacks on airfields in Russia, aiming for both strategic and symbolic impact. While the full extent of the damage remains unknown, the operation demonstrates Kyiv's ability to adapt and evolve its strategies throughout the war by utilizing drones. The attacks targeted Russia's strategic bomber fleet, which has been used to attack Ukrainian cities throughout the full-scale invasion. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed to have hit more than 40 military aircraft in the attacks, targeting multiple air bases thousands of miles from Ukrainian-controlled territory. These attacks come as peace talks between Russia and Ukraine are set to resume in Istanbul, Turkey, indicating a complex dynamic between military action and diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian and Russian delegations are set to meet in Istanbul for another round of peace talks brokered by the U.S., amidst heightened tensions following a Ukrainian drone attack on Russia's strategic bomber fleet. Ukraine seeks a full 30-day ceasefire for negotiations, while Russia insists on maximalist war goals, including annexation of Ukrainian regions and demilitarization. President Zelenskyy outlined Ukraine's goals, including a ceasefire, prisoner release, and the return of abducted children, while accusing Putin of sabotaging peace talks. The talks occur after Ukraine launched a stunning drone attack on Russian air bases, claiming to have hit over 40 military aircraft, while Russia reported shooting down 162 Ukrainian drones over nine regions. The success of these talks remains uncertain due to the conflicting demands and ongoing military actions.</p>

          <p>Maintaining a romantic relationship requires effort, but knowing when that effort becomes excessive is crucial for individual well-being. While all relationships need maintenance, modern culture often encourages individuals to abandon relationships that demand significant conflict resolution or compromise. Research suggests that couples who invest effort into their relationships are happier in the long term, engaging in activities such as showing compassion, spending time together, and discussing problems. However, it's important to recognize when one partner is carrying most of the burden, leading to resentment and burnout, and to consider personal needs and goals before deciding when enough is enough.</p>

          <p>China has refuted accusations from Washington that it violated the Geneva trade agreement, asserting that the U.S. is undermining the deal's terms. This escalation follows a meeting between U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart, He Lifeng, which initially led to a 90-day suspension of most tariffs. China's commerce department criticized the Trump administration for increasing export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals, as well as revoking visas for Chinese students. A Chinese spokesperson vowed to take measures to protect China's rights and benefits if the U.S. continues actions that damage its interests, and has maintained strict control over rare earth exports. This is happening after President Trump accused China of violating its preliminary trade agreement with the U.S. The trade friction signals a potential worsening of relations between the world's two largest economies.</p>

          <p>Major steel stocks experienced a significant surge following President Donald Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel imports. Shares of Cleveland-Cliffs, Steel Dynamics, and Nucor all jumped substantially in premarket trading. Trump announced he would increase tariffs on steel imports to 50% from 25%, a move that has reignited trade tensions and drawn criticism from global partners. This decision is expected to further secure the steel industry in the United States, according to Trump. The VanEck Steel ETF (SLX) also saw gains, reflecting overall positive market sentiment towards steel companies following the tariff announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to modernize flight paths, potentially leading to shorter journey times, fewer delays, and increased flight capacity. The UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) will redesign flight routes, many of which were established 70 years ago, to allow planes to climb quicker during takeoff and descend more smoothly. The changes also aim to reduce aviation's climate impact and accommodate new technologies like flying taxis. However, some residents fear new flight paths could increase noise pollution over currently unaffected areas, and environmental groups stress the need to prioritize environmental impacts and community well-being. Changes to London airspace are not expected until the 2030s, but some route adjustments outside London could occur sooner. The changes would allow the largest re-design of UK airspace since it was first formed in the 1950s.</p>

Seven officers were injured, and five police cars were damaged as Azarbonyad attempted an emergency stop, going from 119 mph to a standstill in a matter of meters.

          <p>A new Social Security Administration (SSA) policy requiring nearly 2 million additional beneficiaries to visit agency offices annually to change direct deposit information is raising concerns about accessibility for seniors. A Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis reveals that nearly one-quarter of seniors live more than an hour away from their local Social Security field office, potentially leading to over 1 million hours of travel per year. The SSA claims the policy aims to curb fraud, citing a rise in direct deposit fraud allegations, while advocates argue the change is an overreaction. This change disproportionately affects seniors without internet access or those with mobility issues, as they must now make in-person visits to verify their identity. The policy change is occurring as the Social Security Administration has moved to cut its work force by about 7,000 employees.</p>

Scientific research on the moon aims to make space travel safer and easier, with the long-term goal of using lunar bases as staging posts for more distant space travel.</p>

          <p>Sri Lanka's customs authorities arrested a Thai woman for attempting to smuggle nearly 10 kilograms of cocaine, concealed within three plush toys, through Bandaranaike International Airport. This seizure marks the largest cocaine haul ever detected at the airport, with the cocaine stuffed into over 500 plastic capsules, estimated to have a street value of $1.72 million. The arrest follows three other recent seizures of synthetic cannabis, resulting in the arrests of three foreign nationals. All four suspects face potential life imprisonment if convicted, reflecting the strict penalties for drug-related offenses in Sri Lanka. This incident underscores Sri Lanka's role as a potential transit hub for narcotics destined for other locations.</p>

The plan aims to lift the federal debt limit, but faces challenges due to competing demands among senators. Meanwhile, authorities are investigating an attack in Boulder, Colorado, where a man allegedly yelled "free Palestine" before using a makeshift flame-thrower on participants in a walk and vigil for Israeli hostages, resulting in multiple hospitalizations. Additionally, a new round of Russian-Ukrainian peace talks is scheduled in Istanbul, Turkey, following a series of remote drone strikes by Ukraine on Russian military air bases.</p>

          <p>A restaurant consultant shares insights on proper dining etiquette, emphasizing the importance of avoiding "one-timing" servers by placing orders all at once and using polite methods to get their attention, such as making eye contact and waving. The consultant advises customers to be understanding if an order is incorrect, acknowledging the potential for errors in the kitchen. The consultant also notes that appropriate dining time ranges from two to two-and-a-half hours for fine dining and an hour to an hour and 45 minutes for casual dining. It is courteous to place your first order shortly after being seated, and appetizer orders should be taken within 10 to 15 minutes, with entrees arriving within 20 to 25 minutes.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The pursuit of perfect self-knowledge is often encouraged but remains unattainable due to limitations in human self-perception. Unconscious behaviors, biases, and the capacity for change all complicate the ability to see oneself clearly and accurately. Overly intense introspection can lead to rumination and undermine well-being, while the belief in a fixed "true self" can hinder personal growth. Instead of seeking a definitive truth about oneself, it is more beneficial to construct a positive, reality-based narrative that allows for flexibility and surprise. The notion that each person has one real, abiding self buried within, waiting to be discovered, is both widespread and difficult for many people to shake.</p>

          <p>Anti-feminist sentiments have significantly impacted South Korean politics, contributing to a contentious environment surrounding women's rights. Opposition to women's rights has fueled authoritarian movements in various countries, including South Korea, where it has placed women's issues at the forefront of political debates. The rise of anti-feminism has been used to capitalize on men's grievances, blaming women and feminists for societal problems like housing crises and declining birth rates. The upcoming presidential election highlights the struggle between candidates who either support or oppose feminist agendas, reflecting a broader societal conflict over gender equality. The election will show whether South Korean democracy will be preserved not by appeasing anti-feminists, but by devising solutions to real problems, such as the cost-of-living and urban-housing crises, that gave an opening to demagogues.</p>

          <p>The bond market is expressing concern over the increasing U.S. debt, potentially undermining President Trump's economic policies. The market's reaction, reflected in rising interest rates, could significantly increase the cost of the proposed reconciliation bill, making it more expensive for the government and the economy. High interest rates could impact various sectors, including mortgages, credit card debt, and business loans, hindering economic growth. While political factors may still drive Congress to pass the bill, the bond market's influence could force more budget cuts and shape the legislation's final form. The increasing debt is causing investors to demand more interest to compensate for the risk of default. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>First-time buyers are increasingly opting for longer mortgage terms, averaging 31 years, due to the challenges of home affordability. This trend contrasts with a decade ago when the average mortgage term was 28 years, as higher mortgage rates have pushed buyers to extend their repayment periods to lower monthly payments. Lenders are offering mortgage terms up to 40 years, particularly popular among first-time buyers in their 30s, although many may choose shorter terms later if their financial situation improves. Despite recent decreases in mortgage rates, affordability remains strained due to rising house prices, with many new mortgages requiring repayments into retirement. Even as interest rates have come down, this measure of affordability has not eased significantly, with rising house prices largely offsetting any lowering of payments through falling rates.</p>

However, the political case for abundance policies rests on their real-world effects, not their rhetorical appeal, and Democrats can pursue both agendas simultaneously.
