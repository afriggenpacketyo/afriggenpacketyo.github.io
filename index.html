        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study found that 60% of workers in Singapore are now living paycheck to paycheck, a figure higher than many of its regional peers. Experts attribute this trend to a combination of macroeconomic factors, including high inflation, expensive housing, and rising import costs that have eroded real wage growth since the pandemic. The article also points to cultural shifts, such as a greater emphasis on experiential spending and aspirational lifestyles, which are contributing to lower savings rates, particularly among middle-income earners.</p>

          <p>The trial concerning President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles has concluded, with the presiding U.S. District Judge expressing significant skepticism about the government's legal arguments. The judge questioned the Justice Department's claim that the Posse Comitatus Act does not apply and raised concerns about an apparent "absence of any limits to a national police force." California's lawsuit seeks an injunction to limit the military's role to protecting federal property, arguing its use for immigration enforcement is an unlawful overreach of presidential power.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has planned a significant deployment of federalized National Guard troops to the National Mall in Washington, D.C., as part of an effort to address crime in the city. The plan involves activating 800 Guard members to provide a visible military presence, primarily offering logistical and administrative support to local law enforcement. This extraordinary measure, typically reserved for major crises or events, is intended to serve as a show of force, though its practical purpose in a relatively safe tourist area has been questioned.</p>

The incident occurred shortly after Farthing and his mother collected a $167.3 million prize, and the article notes he was on parole at the time and has a lengthy criminal history.</p>

          <p>A legal challenge against an immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, brought by environmental groups and the Miccosukee tribe, has concluded its hearing phase. The lawsuit argues that the facility's construction violated federal law by proceeding without a proper environmental impact assessment, posing a threat to the fragile ecosystem and endangered species like the Florida panther. A key point of contention in court was determining whether the state of Florida or the federal government is ultimately in control of the facility's operations.</p>

          <p>A coalition of over 100 humanitarian organizations, including Oxfam and Médecins Sans Frontières, has issued a joint letter calling on Israel to stop what they describe as the "weaponisation of aid" into Gaza. The groups claim that new, stricter Israeli regulations introduced in March have effectively blocked them from delivering lifesaving supplies, leading to deepening starvation and a severe health crisis. Israel maintains the rules are necessary to ensure aid aligns with its national interests and to prevent supplies from being diverted by Hamas.</p>

          <p>According to a new Gallup poll, the percentage of Americans who consume alcohol has fallen to 54%, a record low since the firm began tracking the data in 1939. This decline coincides with a growing belief, especially among young adults, that even moderate drinking is harmful to one's health. Experts suggest this shift is driven by increased public knowledge of alcohol's risks, the rising popularity of non-alcoholic alternatives, and changing social norms around drinking.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a high-stakes summit between the U.S. and Russian presidents, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has stated that there is a "viable chance" for a ceasefire in Ukraine. Starmer stressed that any potential peace agreement must protect Ukraine's territorial integrity and be supported by robust security guarantees from a coalition of allied nations. His comments came after European leaders held a joint call with President Trump to coordinate their stance before his meeting with President Putin.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled in favor of the Trump administration, allowing it to continue freezing or terminating billions of dollars in foreign aid that Congress had previously allocated. In a 2-to-1 decision, the court determined that the plaintiffs, a group of international aid organizations, lacked the legal standing to bring the lawsuit. This ruling overturns a lower court's preliminary injunction that had temporarily blocked the administration's move to halt the funds.</p>

          <p>Recent viral photos showing rabbits in Colorado with black, horn-like growths have been explained by state wildlife officials as a result of the Shope Papilloma Virus. The disease, which is not transmissible to humans or other pets, causes these keratinous tumors to grow on the rabbits' faces. While visually disturbing, the virus is typically harmless to the animals unless the growths interfere with their ability to eat, and it is believed to be the origin of the mythical jackalope.</p>

Scientists are working with the London Fire Brigade to predict when conditions are ripe for these events, which can quickly overwhelm emergency services.</p>
