          <p>In the Karen Read trial, the defense presented an expert witness who questioned the prosecution's theory that Read fatally struck John O'Keefe with her Lexus. Dr. Andrew Rentschler, a biomechanist, testified that a 15 mph collision between a car and a person would not have caused the skull fracture O'Keefe sustained. This testimony supports the defense's argument that O'Keefe's injuries were inconsistent with a car collision. Read has stated she will not testify in her own defense, making Rentschler the last witness her team plans to call. </p>
