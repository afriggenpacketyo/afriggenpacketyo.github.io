        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Michelle Goldberg's article discusses the Democratic Party's initial reluctance to acknowledge concerns about President Biden's age and cognitive fitness. Goldberg reflects on her own early columns questioning Biden's ability to run for re-election, noting that many Democrats publicly dismissed these concerns. The article suggests that this denial stemmed from groupthink, risk aversion, and the perceived advantages of incumbency. Ultimately, Goldberg argues that Democrats must confront their missteps to regain credibility and prepare for future elections, rather than simply blaming Biden or his inner circle for the situation. The article provides a critical look at the party's internal dynamics and decision-making processes in the face of evident challenges. </p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under scrutiny after posting an Instagram photo of seashells arranged to spell '8647,' which some interpreted as a coded assassination threat against President Trump.

          <p>Moody's has downgraded the United States' credit rating, citing concerns over rising debt levels and persistent political gridlock in Washington. This downgrade means that all three major credit rating agencies no longer give the U.S. their highest rating. The agency pointed to the failure of both Democrats and Republicans to address the growing national debt, which now exceeds $36 trillion. Moody's also highlighted the uncertainty surrounding potential tax cuts and the long-term underfunding of programs like Social Security and Medicare. This action could potentially lead to higher borrowing costs for consumers and the government. </p>

While acknowledging the US's economic strengths, Moody's projects federal debt to increase significantly by 2035. The White House responded by blaming the previous administration for the fiscal situation.

After attempting to check-in online and then at a self-service booth at London Heathrow Airport, she ended up at a check-in desk and after checking in her bag, a British Airways staff member handed her a boarding pass. Admittedly she didn't read the pass in any detail, but headed off to get processed in the security area as normal. At the gate, she was among the first passengers to board flight BA7055 departing at 10:50 on 23 April, operated by BA's Spanish partner carrier Iberia, as she was in row six. Dutifully, she handed her passport and boarding pass to a member of BA ground crew, who glanced at them both and waved her through. She was a no-show on the outbound flight because the name on her boarding pass was not hers, it was a man called Huw H. The BBC is not using Huw H's full name, which was printed on the pass. His name was also printed on her luggage tags. </p>

          <p>A state environmental oversight board voted unanimously to rescind a controversial proposal that would have permitted California municipal landfills to accept contaminated soil that is currently required to be dumped at sites specifically designated and approved for hazardous waste. Environmental advocates and community members expressed concerns that the rollback could result in toxic dust blowing into communities near local landfills or dangerous chemicals leaching into groundwater. Heavily polluting industries have tainted soil across California. More than 560,000 tons of hazardous soil are produced each year in California as environmental regulators endeavor to prevent residents from coming in contact with chemical-laced soil and developers build on land in industrial corridors. </p>
