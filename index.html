            <p>Max Verstappen received a five-second penalty for cutting a chicane after the start, which he strongly disapproved of, leading to radio messages that he was told to keep to himself. Christian Horner, Red Bull's team principal, considered the penalty "very harsh," questioning the abandonment of the "let them race on the first lap" principle. Oscar Piastri, who ultimately won the race, believed he had earned the corner and that the stewards made the correct decision. Piastri's win included a bold maneuver around Lewis Hamilton, allowing him to control the race despite Verstappen's strong early pace.</p>

            <p>Despite a 30-hour "Easter truce" announced by Vladimir Putin, Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of breaching the ceasefire, with each side claiming numerous violations by the other. Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported thousands of instances of Russian shelling, while Russia's defense ministry claimed to have repelled Ukrainian assaults. Trump stated that he hoped Russia and Ukraine would reach a deal this week, but he did not provide any further details on his claim. The BBC has not independently verified either side's claims, but the failure of the truce underscores the deep-seated conflict.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen stated that the El Salvadorian government initially tried to prevent him from seeing Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national mistakenly deported from Maryland.

Abrego Garcia has since been moved to a different facility, but the White House maintains it will not bring him back despite court orders. Van Hollen emphasized that the case is about protecting the constitutional rights of all Americans.</p>

            <p>Joe Rogan and comedian Ron White joked about President Donald Trump's leadership style on "The Joe Rogan Experience," portraying him as casual and perhaps more focused on leisure than on serious economic matters. They mocked the idea of Trump playing golf and casually negotiating with world leaders, suggesting a lack of a grand plan behind his actions. Their comments coincided with Trump's latest round of tariffs, which caused market uncertainty and fears of a potential recession. Rogan has endorsed Trump in the 2024 presidential elections, despite mocking and criticizing Trump over the years.</p>

            <p>Tyler Glasnow left Sunday's game against the Texas Rangers after four innings due to lower leg cramping, raising concerns for the Dodgers. Glasnow had been pitching well, but his departure added to the team's injury worries, with Blake Snell already on the injured list. The Dodgers won the game 1-0, but Glasnow's health remains a key concern, given his history of injuries. The team will assess the severity of the cramping, but they are hopeful it is not a serious issue.</p>
