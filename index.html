            <p>The stock market experienced a significant downturn, with the Dow Jones dropping over 1,000 points, as President Trump intensified his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, labeling him a "major loser." This occurred amidst ongoing concerns about tariff uncertainties and ahead of major U.S. tech companies' earnings reports. Trump's pressure on Powell to lower interest rates, despite the Fed's concerns about inflation, has fueled investor unease, with experts warning about the potential for further market volatility and the erosion of the Fed's independence. Investors are also closely watching the earnings reports of major tech companies. Optimism for the market as a whole is low. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump has voiced his support for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth following reports of a second Signal chat leak involving sensitive military information. The leak revealed details about an imminent attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen shared within a group chat that included Hegseth's wife and brother. Trump dismissed the reports as a "waste of time," while Hegseth blamed disgruntled former employees and the media for the "anonymous smears." The Pentagon's inspector general is currently reviewing Hegseth's use of Signal to discuss military actions. This incident raises questions about the security of sensitive communications within the Defense Department.</p>

Trump argued that there is virtually no inflation in the U.S. and that lower rates are necessary to prevent an economic slowdown. This latest criticism comes as Trump's administration is reportedly exploring options to potentially remove Powell before his term expires in 2026.

He also points to Trump's declining approval ratings and the uncertainty created by his governing style as factors that could lead to a further decline in public support.

            <p>A survey by Renmin University indicates that enterprises are increasingly using the yuan for international payments, driven by concerns about the safety and credibility of US assets. Economists suggest that the weakening dominance of the US dollar, partly due to policies from the new US administration, has created an opportunity for the yuan's internationalization. The survey reveals a consistent rise in the percentage of enterprises planning to increase yuan settlements, with about 68% using the currency for cross-border trade settlements. This trend is seen as a response to the recent volatility in the US Treasury market. The global market is shifting.</p>

            <p>A delegation of House Democrats has traveled to El Salvador to advocate for the release of Kilmar Ábrego García, an immigrant mistakenly deported by the Trump administration. The lawmakers are challenging the administration's refusal to comply with a court order to facilitate his return to the United States. They plan to meet with officials at the U.S. embassy and seek a meeting with Ábrego García, who is currently detained in El Salvador. The case has become a point of contention between the Trump administration and the supreme court, raising concerns about due process and the rights of immigrants. The situation is shaky.</p>

            <p>Following the death of Pope Francis, the Vatican will initiate a centuries-old process that includes rituals, traditions, and the election of a new pontiff. The Cardinal Camerlengo will formally pronounce the Pope dead, break the Fisherman's ring, and seal the papal apartment. A nine-day mourning period, called Novemdiales, will follow, with cardinals gathering in Rome to discuss the future of the Church. The Cardinal Electors will then isolate themselves in the Sistine Chapel to elect the next Pope, signaling their decision with white smoke. The event is a global one.</p>
