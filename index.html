            <p>Roki Sasaki, the Dodgers' pitching prospect, delivered a six-inning, two-run start against the Texas Rangers, showing signs of progress despite a drop in fastball velocity. However, veteran reliever Kirby Yates blew the save in the ninth, giving up a two-run home run. The Dodgers lost the game 4-3. Despite the loss, Sasaki's performance was encouraging, as he effectively used his splitter and slider to keep the Rangers' lineup off balance. Optimism score: 55</p>
