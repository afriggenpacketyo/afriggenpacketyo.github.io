          <p>Hundreds of thousands gathered in Tehran for the state funeral of top military commanders and nuclear scientists killed during a recent 12-day conflict with Israel. The ceremony honored figures like Revolutionary Guard chief Gen. Hossein Salami, with crowds expressing defiance and mourning. The conflict, which Israel stated was aimed at dismantling Iran's nuclear program, resulted in over 1,000 deaths in Iran and 28 in Israel before a ceasefire was declared. This event marks the first major public funeral for the high-ranking officials since the cessation of hostilities, highlighting a period of national mourning and heightened political tension in the region.</p>

          <p>A funeral for former Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, drew hundreds of mourners, including former President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Governor Tim Walz delivered a eulogy remembering Hortman as a highly effective and consequential leader dedicated to public service. The couple was killed in their home two weeks ago by a man who also seriously wounded another state senator and his wife in a separate attack. The service honored the Hortmans' legacy of bipartisan collaboration and their deep commitment to improving the lives of Minnesotans, set against the backdrop of a shocking act of political violence.</p>

          <p>A significant tax and spending bill, central to President Donald Trump's second-term agenda, faces a precarious future in the Senate as Republican leadership struggles to secure enough votes for passage. With at least three Republican senatorsâ€”Ron Johnson, Rand Paul, and Thom Tillisâ€”publicly stating their opposition, the party's slim majority is under threat. The 940-page legislation, which extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts and introduces new spending cuts, has been revised to appease moderates, including changes to the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap and funding for rural hospitals. The White House is pressuring for a vote, but its success remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old woman sustained minor injuries after likely being bitten by a juvenile shark while swimming in waist-deep water at Jones Beach State Park, New York. State officials reported that the woman received non-life-threatening cuts to her leg and foot. Although she did not see the creature, experts analyzed the bite marks and concluded they were most likely from a young sand tiger shark. Following the incident, swimming was temporarily suspended, but the beach reopened the next day after drone and lifeguard surveillance of the water found no further signs of dangerous marine life in the area.</p>

          <p>The British government has strongly criticized the BBC for broadcasting a performance by rap-punk duo Bob Vylan at the Glastonbury Festival, during which the artists led chants calling for "death to the IDF." Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy sought an urgent explanation from the BBC, which called the comments "deeply offensive" and confirmed the set would not be available on its iPlayer service. The performance occurred on the same stage as the controversial Irish rap group Kneecap. Avon and Somerset Police are now reviewing footage from both acts to determine if any criminal offenses were committed during their sets.</p>

          <p>The Senate's version of a major spending bill, championed by President Trump, includes a host of provisions with significant financial implications for Americans and various industries. Key elements include extensions of the 2017 tax cuts and new breaks for tip income and overtime pay, though many are temporary. A contentious proposal to cap the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction would be raised to $40,000 for some households. The bill also contains deep cuts to Medicaid, including new work requirements, and eliminates the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles, reflecting intense negotiations and targeted benefits for specific interest groups.

          <p>A severe mudslide triggered by heavy rains caused a complete shutdown of the northbound West Virginia Turnpike, leaving thousands of motorists stranded in their vehicles for over eight hours. The incident, which occurred about 20 miles south of Charleston, created a 12-mile traffic backup with no detours offered. The West Virginia Parkways Authority has since taken full responsibility for the failure to reroute traffic, calling the situation unacceptable and promising to revise its emergency closure policies. While no injuries were reported, the event drew criticism for the lack of communication and support provided to the stranded drivers.</p>

          <p>Forecasters are set to lose a crucial tool for hurricane prediction as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced the permanent termination of data from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS). This system is vital because it uses microwaves to see through clouds and analyze a storm's internal structure, which is not possible with standard infrared satellites, especially at night. The SSMIS accounts for nearly half of all microwave instruments, and its loss could significantly degrade the accuracy of weather models. Scientists warn this could hamper the ability to track dangerous cyclones and predict rapid intensification, posing a risk to coastal communities.</p>

          <p>Anti-government protests in Belgrade, Serbia, escalated into clashes with police as demonstrators demanded snap parliamentary elections and an end to President Aleksandar Vucic's rule. Officers in riot gear deployed pepper spray after some protesters, who had marched toward a rival pro-government rally, threw flares. The demonstrations, largely driven by students, were sparked by a deadly train station collapse last year blamed on government negligence. President Vucic has rejected the calls for an early vote, which is not scheduled until 2027, and has accused foreign powers of instigating the unrest, creating a tense political standoff.</p>

The plaintiffs sued Trump in October, alleging he defamed them during a presidential debate by falsely claiming they had killed someone and confessed.

Although their legal battle was initially unsuccessful in the state's highest court, their public campaign helped build momentum that led to Maryland legalizing marriage equality in 2012, two years before the Supreme Court's landmark decision.

Hurn was in court for arraignment on numerous charges, including fentanyl trafficking and wanton endangerment of a police officer.</p>

          <p>Phoenix police officers rescued an infant who had been left alone for several days in an apartment after the child's mother had died. The rescue occurred after a neighbor, concerned about not hearing from the woman, called for a welfare check. Bodycam footage shows officers forcing entry into the apartment and finding the baby, described as "visibly emaciated," on a bed. The infant was immediately transported to a hospital for lifesaving medical care and is now expected to make a full recovery. The cause of the mother's death is currently under investigation by the medical examiner's office.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes closed at record highs, capping a week that began with significant geopolitical uncertainty following U.S. military action in Iran. Initial market fears subsided as the conflict did not escalate, and a sharp drop in oil prices helped fuel the rally. Investors also grew more optimistic about potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts later this year, despite new data showing core inflation was slightly hotter than expected in May. Gains were led by technology stocks, particularly Nvidia, and financials, which benefited from a proposed easing of bank capital requirements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recently concluded Supreme Court term delivered significant victories for conservative states and bolstered President Trump's claims of executive authority, according to a new analysis. While lacking the blockbuster rulings of previous years, the court's 6-3 conservative majority sided with GOP-led states on issues like restricting transgender medical treatments and denying Medicaid funds to Planned Parenthood. The court also issued procedural rulings that rein in the power of lower court judges to block presidential policies nationwide. These decisions reflect a states-rights brand of conservatism and have so far favored the executive branch's assertions of broad power without ruling directly on their constitutionality.</p>

This brings the total number of arrests to six. The incident, for which the group Palestine Action claimed responsibility, involved activists spraying paint into the jet engine of an Airbus Voyager. Following the security breach, the UK government announced its intention to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization, which would make it illegal to be a member or supporter of the group.

          <p>New research on skeletons from the ancient city of Ã‡atalhÃ¶yÃ¼k in Turkey suggests it may have been a matriarchal society ruled by females over 9,000 years ago. By analyzing the DNA of more than 130 individuals buried under the city's homes, scientists discovered that genetic connections within households were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that men likely moved into their wives' households upon marriage and that female offspring tended to remain in their family homes. The findings, published in the journal Science, challenge traditional assumptions about patrilineal structures in ancient societies and point to the central role of women at this well-preserved Neolithic settlement.</p>

Grossi called for a return to diplomacy and for IAEA inspectors to regain access to verify the status of Iran's nuclear material and activities.

Officials later appeared to shift the mission's primary goal from destroying the nuclear program to achieving a ceasefire between Iran and Israel.

          <p>Following the primary victory of Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race, Republican leaders are using his ascent to frame the national Democratic party as radical and out of touch. At the Faith and Freedom Coalition summit, prominent Republicans, including Donald Trump, portrayed Mamdani's win as evidence of a broader shift towards socialism within the Democratic party. This emerging line of attack aims to energize conservative voters and defend GOP congressional majorities. In response, some Democrats have defended Mamdani against what they call Islamophobic attacks while others have distanced themselves from his more progressive policies.</p>

          <p>McLaren driver Lando Norris secured a stunning pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix, outpacing the field by more than half a second. Norris described his qualifying lap as nearly perfect and said he felt a return to form after a season marked by qualifying mistakes. The strong performance was aided by recent car upgrades, including a revised front suspension designed to give him a better feel for the vehicle. His championship-leading teammate, Oscar Piastri, will start in third, while their closest rival, Red Bull's Max Verstappen, had a difficult session and qualified in seventh place.</p>

          <h2>Jeff Bezos's Lavish Venice Wedding Sparks Both Glamour and Protest</h2>

          <p>The wedding celebration of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice has created a stark contrast between high-profile glamour and local protest. While A-list celebrity guests attended the lavish events, some Venetians and activists marched to protest issues like over-tourism, climate change, and capitalism, hanging a "no space for Bezos" banner from the Rialto bridge. City officials defended the event as the kind of "high-quality tourism" Venice needs, and Bezos reportedly made a multi-million euro donation to local conservation groups. The event highlights the ongoing tensions in the historic city as it grapples with its identity and economic future.</p>
