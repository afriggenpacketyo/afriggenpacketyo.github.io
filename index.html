          <p>Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband were fatally shot, while State Senator John Hoffman and his wife were wounded in targeted shootings at their respective homes. Authorities have arrested 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter in connection with the attacks, who was found hiding in the woods after a two-day manhunt. Investigators are exploring whether Boelter, who served on a state board with Hoffman, knew the lawmakers personally, and a search of his vehicle revealed a list of potential targets, including other officials and abortion rights advocates. Governor Tim Walz condemned the shootings as politically motivated violence, while officials across the political spectrum denounced the attacks as an assault on democracy.</p>

          <p>The stands of several major Israeli defense firms were blocked off to attendees at the Paris Air Show, reportedly due to an order from the French government following a disagreement over the displays. Israel's Defense Ministry stated that exhibition organizers, acting on behalf of the French government, demanded the removal of offensive weapons systems from Israeli pavilions. The ministry rejected the demand, leading to the erection of black walls overnight, effectively blocking the pavilions. Israel's Defense Ministry called the decision outrageous and unprecedented, suggesting policy-driven and commercial motivations behind the exclusion of Israeli offensive weapons.</p>

The Conservancy of Southwest Florida's team has shattered previous records for a single-season haul, showcasing progress in reversing the snakes' takeover, though complete eradication is unlikely. Experts emphasize that each python removed is beneficial, leading to demographic shifts and fewer large pythons in certain areas. The conservancy focuses on tracking and removing females during breeding season using tagged male "scout" snakes, preventing an estimated 20,000 eggs from hatching since 2013.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans are introducing a bill to halt housing grants to sanctuary cities, like Los Angeles, that do not comply with federal immigration law and authorities. The bill targets federal housing grants provided by the Community Development Block Grant program, arguing that cities encouraging illegal immigration should not be rewarded with federal subsidies. The measure comes amid a broader push by President Trump to crack down on sanctuary cities, with threats of revoking federal funding to those that impede the sharing of information about individuals' immigration status or block compliance with DHS requests. The bill outlines that any sanctuary jurisdiction with such policies would see federal grant funding revoked.</p>

The ants often colonize in undisturbed forest areas and can disrupt natural ecosystems, but they are not especially dangerous.</p>

          <p>Congestion pricing in New York City, implemented in January, has shown early success in reducing traffic and raising funds for public transit, but faces opposition from the Trump administration. The policy charges drivers entering lower Manhattan a $9 toll, and has resulted in fewer vehicles in the congestion zone and faster bus routes. However, the Trump administration is seeking to revoke federal approval for the program, leading to a legal battle and uncertainty about its future. If the program is terminated, it would create a significant budget gap for the MTA and raise questions about states' rights.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's restrictive measures targeting higher education and international students are putting the US at risk of losing talent. US universities should cultivate new pipelines of students, especially from under-explored countries on the African continent, in order to strengthen their resilience.

This can be low-hanging fruit, not least because the American degree is still much sought after.</p>

The plane that turned around on Monday was a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, as was the Air India flight that crashed into buildings in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad on Thursday morning. Air India said the plane landed back in Hong Kong safely and was undergoing checks "as a matter of abundant precaution."</p>
