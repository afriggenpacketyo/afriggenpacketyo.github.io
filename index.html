          <p>Samsung Electronics has projected its second-quarter operating profit will fall by 56%, a steeper decline than analysts had estimated. The company is struggling to compete in the high-demand market for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are essential for artificial intelligence applications. Samsung has reportedly faced delays in getting its advanced HBM chips certified by industry leader Nvidia, ceding ground to competitors like SK Hynix and Micron. This setback, combined with ongoing weakness in its chip foundry business, is significantly impacting its financial performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met at the White House, presenting a united front after recent joint strikes against Iran. However, the meeting was underscored by the urgent need to address the 21-month war in Gaza, with Trump keen on securing a ceasefire agreement. While both leaders celebrated the Iran strikes as a victory, significant hurdles remain in peace negotiations, as Hamas demands a permanent end to the war, a condition Netanyahu has so far rejected. The discussions also touched on expanding the Abraham Accords, with an end to the Gaza conflict seen as key to regional stability.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in Texas Hill Country, which have killed more than 100 people, were caused by an immense and rapid downpour over the holiday weekend. Preliminary data shows that some areas, such as Bertram and Liberty Hill, received upwards of 20 inches of rain. This extreme rainfall caused the Guadalupe River to rise an astonishing 26 feet in just 45 minutes during the predawn hours, catching sleeping residents and campers completely off guard. Forecasters have warned that the devastated region could see several more inches of rain, prolonging the flood risk.</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have announced they will not initiate legal proceedings against the thousands who participated in the city's banned Pride parade in late June. Despite the government's prohibition, organizers, including Budapest's mayor, declared it an official municipal event, creating legal ambiguity that the police cited in their decision. This development comes amid an increasingly restrictive anti-LGBTQ+ agenda from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, which had threatened participants with significant fines.</p>

          <p>Dr. Kevin O’Connor, who served as former President Joe Biden’s physician, has requested to delay his testimony before the House Oversight Committee, citing the need to protect doctor-patient confidentiality. The Republican-led committee, which is investigating Biden's health and mental fitness during his term, has subpoenaed the doctor to testify. O'Connor's lawyer is seeking an accommodation to protect privileged medical information, setting up a conflict with the committee over the scope and rules of its inquiry.</p>

          <p>The government of El Salvador has informed the United Nations that the United States holds exclusive legal responsibility for the hundreds of migrants sent to its CECOT mega-prison. This claim contradicts the Trump administration's position that it cannot return the migrants because they are under Salvadoran authority. The migrants were deported under the Alien Enemies Act as part of a deal where the U.S. paid El Salvador to house them, but El Salvador's report clarifies its role was merely providing prison infrastructure.</p>

          <p>On the six-month anniversary of major Southern California wildfires, Governor Gavin Newsom called for $40 billion in federal recovery aid while sharply criticizing the Trump administration's recent immigration raids in Los Angeles. Newsom highlighted the state's rapid debris removal efforts but stressed that long-term federal funding is still needed and should be a bipartisan priority. He condemned the timing of the immigration raids, noting their potential to disrupt the state's construction workforce, which is foundational to rebuilding the fire-ravaged communities.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats have introduced an amendment to the UK's Football Governance Bill that would require at least 10 Premier League soccer matches per season to be broadcast on free-to-air television. The proposal aims to tear down the "expensive paywall" that currently limits access to top-flight football for many fans across the country. If the amendment is passed, it would mandate the new independent football regulator to ensure these games, along with several key playoff finals, are publicly accessible without a subscription.</p>

          <p>An Australian jury has found Erin Patterson guilty of murdering three of her former in-laws and attempting to murder a fourth by serving them a meal containing toxic death cap mushrooms. The verdict concluded a 10-week trial that garnered global attention and deeply affected the small Victorian towns where the victims lived. Patterson had maintained that the 2023 poisoning was accidental, but the jury rejected her account, bringing a sense of closure to a case that has been described as a local tragedy turned into pop culture.</p>

A concerned Sinner assisted his tearful friend and competitor off the court, later stating that he could not accept the progression as a true win and expressing his sympathy for Dimitrov, who has been plagued by injuries at recent Grand Slams.</p>
