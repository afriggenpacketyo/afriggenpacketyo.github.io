        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has issued a warning to its trading partners, demanding new trade agreements be finalized by August 1 or face the reinstatement of significant tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that letters are being sent to notify countries of the impending deadline, emphasizing a "maximum pressure" strategy to expedite negotiations. While deals have been secured with the UK and Vietnam, ongoing talks with major partners like the European Union continue under the threat of duties up to 50% on their goods. The administration anticipates several major announcements soon, though the EU has indicated it is prepared to retaliate if no agreement is reached.</p>

          <p>The death of Daniel Park, accused of conspiring in the bombing of a California fertility clinic, is being investigated as a suicide, closing the sole prosecution in the case. Park died in custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles, a facility already under scrutiny for its conditions. His alleged co-conspirator was killed in the May 17 bombing, which injured four people and was reportedly motivated by anti-natalist extremist ideology. Park's death has intensified concerns from attorneys and a 2024 Inspector General report about unmet medical needs and "inhumane" conditions within the Bureau of Prisons system.</p>

          <p>The death toll from catastrophic flash floods in Texas Hill Country has climbed to at least 79, with 41 people still reported missing across the state. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, devastating communities and a children's summer camp, Camp Mystic, where at least 10 campers and a counselor remain unaccounted for. Kerr County has been the hardest hit, with 68 fatalities. President Trump has signed a major disaster declaration for the county as massive search and rescue operations, involving over 160 air rescues, continue around the clock to locate survivors amidst the wreckage.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys wide receiver and Pro Bowl return specialist KaVontae Turpin was arrested in Collin County, Texas, on misdemeanor charges for possession of marijuana and unlawful carrying of a weapon. He was booked on Saturday and released from jail the following day. This incident marks another off-the-field legal issue for Turpin, who previously faced assault charges during his college career at TCU. The arrest comes just weeks before the Cowboys are scheduled to begin their training camp, and it remains unclear if he will face disciplinary action from the team or the NFL.</p>

          <p>Following the devastating and deadly flash floods in Texas, a disagreement has emerged between state officials and the National Weather Service (NWS) over the accuracy of the forecasts provided. While local officials, like Kerr County's judge, claim they "didn't know this kind of flood was coming," the NWS insists it issued appropriate flood watches and flash flood warnings, including a rare "flash flood emergency" alert. Meteorologists note the extreme difficulty in predicting the precise location and intensity of such historic rainfall. The debate also highlights potential impacts of recent NWS staffing cuts on communication with emergency managers during critical events.</p>

          <p>Denis Simon, a leading expert on US-China relations, describes the Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement (STA) as a foundational element of the bilateral relationship since its inception in 1979. Originally a symbol of peaceful engagement, the agreement fostered trust and collaboration in fields like health, energy, and agriculture. However, in the current geopolitical climate, the STA is now a point of contention, entangled with national security concerns, economic competition in tech sectors like AI and semiconductors, and rising techno-nationalism. Simon argues that the future of this agreement will serve as a bellwether for the broader direction of US-China ties.</p>

          <p>While tragedy struck one summer camp along the Guadalupe River, another, the Presbyterian Mo-Ranch Assembly, successfully avoided catastrophe through the quick actions of its staff. After observing the rising river and monitoring weather reports around 1 a.m. Friday, camp leaders evacuated about 70 children and adults to higher ground without any official warning from local authorities. This decisive action prevented any loss of life at their facility, a stark contrast to the devastation at nearby Camp Mystic. The story highlights the self-reliance of some residents and raises further questions about the effectiveness of the official emergency alert system.</p>

          <p>Wimbledon organizers have issued an apology after the electronic line-calling system on Centre Court was mistakenly deactivated for an entire game, resulting in three missed calls. The error occurred during the fourth-round match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal, with one particularly crucial missed call on a point that would have given Pavlyuchenkova the game. The chair umpire, unaware of the system failure, ordered a replay of the point, which Kartal then won. While Pavlyuchenkova ultimately won the match, the incident has sparked debate about the reliance on technology and the role of umpires.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression on Sunday after making landfall near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina. While tropical storm warnings have been canceled, the system is still expected to bring heavy rainfall to the Carolinas through Monday. Forecasters predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with localized amounts up to 6 inches, raising concerns about the potential for flash flooding as the storm moves across central and eastern North Carolina. The system is expected to continue weakening as it moves further inland and turns toward the northeast.</p>

          <p>An SUV crashed into a commercial building in Herriman, Utah, rupturing a gas line and causing a massive explosion that destroyed a Domino's Pizza restaurant. The driver and a passenger were rescued from the vehicle by two bystanders just minutes before it was engulfed in flames and the building exploded. No one was inside the Domino's or adjacent businesses at the time of the crash, and no firefighters were injured by the subsequent blast. Multiple people involved in the three-vehicle accident that led to the crash were hospitalized.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A provision within the new "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is being called a significant victory for the anti-abortion movement. The measure will bar Planned Parenthood from receiving any Medicaid reimbursements, impacting not just abortion services but all healthcare they provide, including vaccinations, prenatal care, and cancer screenings. Experts like Professor Michele Goodwin warn this will have a devastating effect on reproductive healthcare, particularly in underserved communities where Planned Parenthood is the only provider. Activists argue this represents a more subtle, coordinated effort to restrict healthcare access beyond direct abortion bans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FBI reports that homeowners in New Hampshire lost over $4 million to quit claim deed fraud between 2019 and 2023. In this scam, criminals forge documents to transfer a property's title without the owner's knowledge, often targeting vacant land, vacation homes, or properties owned by out-of-state residents. The fraudsters, or 'title pirates,' then sell the property or take out a mortgage on it. Authorities are urging homeowners to be vigilant, suggesting they register for county alerts on filings, have neighbors check on vacant properties, and consider a specific type of title insurance.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party, the "America Party," following a public feud with President Trump over the new tax and spending bill. Musk, a former White House adviser, called the bill an act of "bankrupting our country" and is positioning his new party as an alternative to the two-party system. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed the move, suggesting Musk's time in government was unpopular and that his companies' boards would prefer he focus on business. The feud marks a significant reversal in the relationship between the two.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Texas highlight the severe limitations of forecasting extreme weather events, which are becoming more frequent due to the climate crisis. While the National Weather Service (NWS) did issue a series of watches and warnings, including a top-level Flash Flood Emergency, the sheer volume of rainfall—exceeding a 1-in-500-year event—was difficult to pinpoint with precision. The disaster underscores the challenge of predicting exactly where and when such historic downpours will occur. This event was intensified by near-record moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, a hallmark of a warming climate.</p>
