          <p>Nintendo has reported record-breaking sales of its new Switch 2 console, with over 3.5 million units sold in the first four days after its launch. This performance puts the company on track to meet its fiscal year sales target of 15 million units by March 2026. The Switch 2 has garnered significant enthusiasm from fans globally, resulting in long lines at midnight release events. Despite the positive sales figures, Nintendo's shares experienced a slight dip, but have otherwise seen substantial growth since the original Switch debuted in 2017. </p>

          <p>Ballymena, County Antrim, saw a second night of unrest as petrol bombs, masonry, and fireworks were thrown at police, who responded with baton rounds and a water cannon. The violence, described by police as "racially motivated," resulted in burning barricades and damage to homes and businesses, with some residents displaying signs indicating their nationality. The disturbances followed a peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault in the town, with politicians condemning the violence and urging reflection. The unrest underscores deep-seated tensions within the community and has prompted criticism of political figures for potentially exacerbating the situation.</p>

          <p>Two adaptations of Johann Sebastian Bach's St. John Passion explore themes of violence against LGBTQ+ individuals and the impact of war and displacement in the Middle East. Thomas Höft's "QueerPassion" incorporates stories of queer individuals facing discrimination, while Vladimir Ivanoff's "Arabian Passion" integrates Middle Eastern instruments and Arabic vocals, reflecting on the suffering in the Middle East. Both versions transform Bach's original work to address contemporary issues and bridge cultural divides, with the "Arabian Passion" even performing in Hezbollah-held areas. These adaptations are part of the Bachfest in Leipzig, which focuses on transformation.</p>

          <p>The Group of Seven countries is planning to establish a task force to review tax exemptions on cross-border e-commerce involving small parcels, according to a Japanese government source. This initiative aims to address the issue of retailers flooding G7 markets with cheap goods, which is impacting domestic industries. The matter is expected to be discussed at the upcoming G7 summit in Canada, with Canada having already consulted Japan about participating in the task force. The review seeks to level the playing field and ensure fair competition among businesses in member nations.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' ex-girlfriend testified in his federal trial for sex crimes, providing details about his personal life and alleged behavior. While her testimony painted a picture of Combs as a "sexual deviant," legal experts suggest it may not directly prove the charges he faces, which hinge on coercion versus consent. The defense is attempting to portray Combs as a drug addict seeking sympathy from the jury, while the prosecution aims to demonstrate a pattern of controlling behavior. The trial is expected to conclude by July 4, with Combs maintaining his innocence.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles experienced a relatively quiet night following a week of protests against the Trump administration's immigration raids, due to a city-wide curfew and appeals from faith leaders for nonviolent resistance. Mayor Karen Bass implemented the curfew in downtown Los Angeles, an area that has been the site of intense protests and arrests. Prior to the curfew, faith leaders led a march toward a federal building, advocating for nonviolent resistance to President Trump's immigration policies. While the march was peaceful, police activity increased as the curfew took effect, resulting in further arrests.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department under the Trump administration has issued a legal opinion asserting that the president has the authority to abolish national monuments, reversing a previous determination that monuments created under the Antiquities Act cannot be revoked.

The opinion specifically mentions two monuments designated by President Biden, arguing that their protections are not warranted and are unrelated to the protection of scientific or historical monuments. Environmental groups have criticized the opinion, arguing that it does not give the president the authority to shrink monuments at will.</p>

          <p>The United States' defense sector heavily relies on critical minerals, particularly rare earths, for its advanced weapon systems, with China dominating the global supply chain. Beijing's control over these minerals, including processing and refining, has become a negotiating point in trade disputes and a potential vulnerability for the U.S. defense industry. The dependence on China for these elements, which are essential for various American weapon systems, poses a risk to military readiness and supply chain security, especially as China tightens export restrictions.</p>

Weaver had the opportunity to practice alongside Brooks Koepka, who offered advice on managing the challenging course, emphasizing the importance of avoiding double bogeys. Members of the Links Club in Newmarket, where Weaver developed his game, have raised money to support him. Weaver hopes to make the cut and compete, while also cherishing the chance to spend time with his family.</p>

          <p>The UK chancellor's Spending Review promises increased spending for Scotland on defense, computing, and carbon-capture technology. The review allocates £250m for the Royal Navy's nuclear submarine base on the Clyde, £750m to bring a powerful supercomputer to Edinburgh, and funding for the Acorn Project in St Fergus. The review aims to balance spending priorities, with increased funding for defense and the NHS, while other areas may face cuts. The decisions will affect Holyrood's budget, with changes to day-to-day spending impacting the block grant passed from the Treasury to Holyrood.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers effectively forfeited a game against the San Diego Padres by allowing a minor league call-up to pitch through a nine-run outing and then sending a position player to the mound in the sixth inning. Manager Dave Roberts cited the team's limited healthy starting pitchers and overworked bullpen as reasons for the decision. The Dodgers removed key players from the game early, shifting their focus to the next game in the series. The unusual move reflects the team's prioritization of long-term health over a single game, though it resulted in an embarrassing loss.</p>

Elbegdorj, who successfully terminated capital punishment in Mongolia in 2017, suggested that the Japanese government should provide more information about the death penalty to encourage open debate. He argued that the death penalty goes against democratic principles and carries the risk of executing wrongly convicted individuals.</p>
