          <p>ABC has taken "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air indefinitely after host Jimmy Kimmel linked the alleged killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to Donald Trump's MAGA movement. The decision followed pressure from FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr and a pre-emptive cancellation by Nexstar Media Group, a major owner of ABC affiliate stations. While Kimmel has not been fired, Disney executives reportedly plan to discuss his future on-air comments, sparking a debate on free speech and corporate responsibility in media.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines CEO Dave Davis has informed employees that the struggling carrier will implement significant flight reductions and more job cuts to lower costs. The airline plans to slash its November schedule by 25% compared to the previous year, focusing on its most profitable markets as it navigates its second bankruptcy in under a year. This move follows a failed acquisition by JetBlue and is part of a broader strategy to shrink the airline to achieve financial stability.</p>

          <p>Following the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, analysts anticipate that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) will proceed with only moderate easing measures for the remainder of the year. The Fed's move provides China with more policy flexibility, but the PBOC is expected to act cautiously to support the yuan and manage capital outflow pressures. This measured approach is intended to balance economic support with currency stability in the face of global monetary policy shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Research Finds Wild Chimpanzees Regularly Consume Alcohol Through Fermented Fruit</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume the equivalent of nearly two human alcoholic beverages per day by eating naturally fermented fruit. Researchers measured the alcohol content in figs and plums favored by the primates, finding it to be low but significant given the large quantities consumed. This research provides direct chemical evidence supporting the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in primate fruit-eating habits.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has recommended that individual care plans for children with special educational needs, known as EHCPs, should not be eliminated. In a new report, the Education Select Committee also called for national minimum standards for support in schools and increased teacher training. The recommendation comes as the government prepares to announce reforms for the special educational needs and disabilities (Send) system, which has faced criticism for being financially unsustainable and inconsistent.</p>

          <p>A new report from the California Budget and Policy Center reveals that California, tied with Louisiana, continues to have the highest poverty rate in the nation at 17.7%. The rate has shown little improvement since surging after the expiration of pandemic-era aid programs, which had briefly lowered it to a historic low. The report highlights that people of color, renters, and children are disproportionately affected and warns that recent state and federal budget cuts could exacerbate the problem.</p>
