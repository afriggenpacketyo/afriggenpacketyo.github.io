          <p>The Trump administration brokered a peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda to end the conflict in eastern DRC, driven by mineral wealth. The agreement, initialed in Washington, aims to end fighting and potentially bring billions in American investment to the region rich in minerals like coltan and cobalt. Critics are skeptical, as the M23 rebel group, believed to be backed by Rwanda, was not a signatory. The deal's success hinges on M23's adherence to its terms, amidst concerns about Rwanda's increasing mineral exports since M23's territorial gains.

          <p>Wales will ban the supply of plastic wet wipes to consumers starting in December 2026, aiming to reduce environmental harm from plastic and microplastic pollution. The ban, passed by the Senedd, includes an exemption for medical-grade wipes and does not extend to business-to-business transactions. This move makes Wales the first UK nation to implement such a ban. The 18-month transition period allows manufacturers time to adapt, with hopes for innovation in reusable and non-plastic alternatives. The optimism score is not applicable for this article.</p>

          <p>An analyst close to the Iranian regime admitted that Iran's power in the region has been weakened by recent Israeli strikes. However, he insisted that the Iranian government remains strong and that Iranians are united against Israel. He downplayed the possibility of internal unrest, claiming that only a small percentage of Iranians would actively oppose the government. This assessment contrasts with previous surveys indicating widespread discontent with the cleric-led regime, particularly following the 2022 protests.

          <p>President Trump has granted a third extension to the enforcement of a law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. unless it severs ties with its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. Citing national security concerns, Congress passed the law last year, but Trump has repeatedly delayed its implementation. TikTok expressed gratitude for the extension, while lawmakers voiced concerns about the lack of enforcement. The optimism score is not applicable for this article.</p>

Global investment saw modest growth early in the year, but trade tensions have led to downward revisions in GDP, exports, and investor sentiment. Manufacturing investments, which previously showed a positive trend, have stalled due to tariffs. The agency is also concerned about a drop in investment aligned with sustainable development goals.

Understanding the neurological and psychological mechanisms behind taking offense can help control responses. Strategies for reducing offense-taking include laughing it off, activating the prefrontal cortex, and tuning out offense-making machines. The optimism score is not applicable for this article.</p>
