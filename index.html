          <p>Best Buy has revised its full-year sales and profit projections downward, citing the increasing costs of consumer electronics due to higher tariffs. The retailer now anticipates revenue between $41.1 billion and $41.9 billion, a decrease from the initial range of $41.4 billion to $42.2 billion. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $6.15 to $6.30, compared to the previous guidance of $6.20 to $6.60. CFO Matt Bilunas stated that the company's outlook assumes current tariff levels will persist without significant changes in consumer behavior. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing scrutiny for its proposal to significantly cut funding for the U.S. Geological Survey, potentially eliminating the Ecosystems Mission Area, a crucial program for monitoring wildlife health and environmental contaminants. This program plays a vital role in tracking threats to species like bats, which are essential for controlling insect pests and supporting agriculture. Critics argue that these cuts could have severe consequences for the environment, economy, and even human health, as the program provides critical data for managing wildlife and preventing ecological disasters. The article suggests the administration may be targeting the program due to its climate science research and monitoring of species that may require federal protection.</p>

          <p>Thailand is considering tightening regulations on cannabis use, potentially restricting it to medicinal purposes only, reversing its 2022 decriminalization. A new medical bill would allow dispensaries to sell cannabis only to licensed shops or customers with medical prescriptions. Activists estimate this could lead to a 90% reduction in licensed cannabis shops.

          <p>The article discusses the changing nature of the filibuster in the U.S. Senate, noting how both parties have weakened it over time. A recent maneuver by Republicans to bypass the 60-vote threshold for a measure striking down a California air pollution law has reignited debate over its future. With Republicans preparing to consider a sweeping spending and tax-cut package, similar pressure to bypass the filibuster could arise, potentially leading to its further erosion or even abolishment. The article analyzes the potential consequences of these changes on the balance of power in the Senate.</p>

          <p>UK car manufacturing has experienced a sharp decline, reaching its lowest April output in over 70 years, primarily due to US tariffs and the timing of Easter. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) also attributed the drop to industry-wide shifts towards electric vehicles. While a US court blocked many of Trump's tariffs, the ruling does not apply to tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars.
