          <p>California Rep. Robert Garcia recently traveled to El Salvador with other Democratic lawmakers to advocate for the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident currently detained in a maximum-security prison. The delegation met with U.S. Embassy officials, Abrego Garcia's family, and human rights advocates, but were denied access to Abrego Garcia himself. Garcia criticized the Trump administration's refusal to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, deeming it a constitutional crisis and accusing the administration of instilling fear in immigrant communities. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national with legal status barring deportation, was mistakenly deported in March, sparking a legal battle for his return.</p>

          <p>A town hall hosted by Florida Rep. Byron Donalds became contentious as audience members repeatedly interrupted him, leading to the removal of two protesters. The interruptions focused on topics including Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and the Israel-Hamas war. Donalds defended Musk's cost-cutting efforts, which drew mixed reactions from the audience. The event reflects a broader trend of raucous town halls dominated by protests against President Trump and Musk's policies, leading some lawmakers to reconsider in-person events.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell was convicted in Arizona of conspiring to murder her estranged husband, Charles Vallow, who was fatally shot by her brother, Alex Cox, in 2019. Vallow Daybell is already serving life sentences in Idaho for the murders of her two children and conspiring to murder her then-boyfriend Chad Daybell's wife. Prosecutors argued that Vallow Daybell and Cox planned Vallow's murder to collect life insurance money and marry Daybell, an author of religious novels. Vallow Daybell, representing herself, claimed the death was a tragedy, but the jury deliberated only three hours before finding her guilty; she now faces another life sentence.</p>

          <p>Six major policy groups representing the U.S. automotive industry have joined forces to lobby the Trump administration against upcoming 25% tariffs on auto parts. The groups argue that the tariffs could jeopardize U.S. automotive production, as many suppliers are already in financial distress and unable to absorb additional cost increases. They represent the country's largest manufacturing sector, supporting 10 million American jobs and contributing $1.2 trillion to the economy. The letter urges the administration to reconsider the tariffs, similar to relief recently approved for consumer electronics and semiconductors.</p>

Tesla's sales have also been affected, with the company's vehicles becoming a symbol of the Trump administration, repelling some consumers.

The UK economy is expected to grow less than previously predicted, at 1.1% in 2025 instead of 1.6%, due to global fallout from US trade tariffs.

          <p>A comprehensive study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health has revealed a significant correlation between social media usage and heightened rates of body image dissatisfaction and eating disorders, particularly among young women and girls. The study found that exposure to idealized and often unrealistic portrayals of beauty on platforms like Instagram and TikTok can contribute to feelings of inadequacy, self-consciousness, and a relentless pursuit of physical perfection. Researchers emphasized the importance of promoting media literacy and critical thinking skills to help young people navigate social media environments more mindfully, while also advocating for greater regulation of content that promotes harmful beauty standards and unrealistic body ideals.
