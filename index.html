          <p>In an excerpt from her new memoir, "Listening to the Law," Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett reflects on the profound personal and familial challenges she faced when nominated by President Trump in 2020. She describes the intense public scrutiny and loss of privacy during a previous consideration for a seat, which made her hesitant to accept the nomination. Ultimately, she and her husband decided to "burn the boats," fully committing to the public service role despite the significant sacrifices required, such as relocating their family to Washington, D.C. and enduring the difficult confirmation process.</p>

          <p>John Alford, known for his roles in "London's Burning" and "Grange Hill," has been found guilty of sexually assaulting two teenage girls at a friend's house in 2022. A jury at St Albans Crown Court convicted the 53-year-old actor on multiple counts involving a 14-year-old and a 15-year-old, who were both intoxicated at the time of the attacks. Alford, who denied the charges and claimed he was the victim of an extortion plot, reacted with distress in the courtroom as the verdict was read. The court was also informed of his previous convictions for non-sexual offenses.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has swelled to an estimated $1.7 billion, the third-largest in U.S. history, creating a frenzy of ticket sales that has significantly benefited DraftKings. The company's lottery courier app, Jackpocket, has seen a massive increase in activity, with 15 million tickets ordered during the current run and daily sales jumping 130%. This surge highlights the business potential of lottery courier services, which DraftKings acquired to cross-sell customers to its sports betting and iGaming platforms. The company anticipates the Jackpocket acquisition will contribute hundreds of millions in incremental revenue by 2026.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a period of significant stock market gains, financial analysts are advising investors to consider defensive strategies to protect their portfolios. Despite a weak August jobs report increasing expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut, concerns about a slowing labor market and broader economic trouble persist. Experts caution against over-concentration in mega-cap tech stocks, which dominate major indices, and suggest re-evaluating exposure to these historically strong performers. They recommend shifting some capital toward value and defensive sectors that have been overlooked during the recent rally, thereby broadening exposure and insulating returns from potential downturns.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shortly before the release of the August jobs report, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick predicted that the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics would become more accurate. He attributed this anticipated improvement to President Trump's recent firing of former BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, who was appointed during the previous administration. Lutnick suggested that "holdovers" were "rooting against America and against Donald Trump," and that the agency would now be more aligned with the administration's goal of producing correct numbers.

          <p>American music artist Post Malone has postponed two major stadium shows in London originally scheduled for this weekend due to upcoming strikes on the London Underground. Promoters Live Nation announced that the concerts at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium will now take place on September 20 and 21, as the lack of public transport made it impossible to ensure attendees could travel safely. This follows a similar decision by the band Coldplay, which also had to move concert dates because of the industrial action by the RMT union. Fans have expressed frustration over the timing of the announcements.</p>

          <p>Advice centers in Germany for those unwilling to perform military service are reporting a significant increase in inquiries, reflecting public anxiety over the potential reintroduction of the draft. The government recently passed a law requiring young men to complete a questionnaire about their willingness to join the army, a move seen as a precursor to reinstating conscription, which was suspended in 2011. While polls show majority support for military service among the general population, younger Germans are more opposed, citing concerns about increasing militarization and a lack of say in decisions that impact their lives. Peace organizations are now training new advisors to handle the surge in requests.</p>

          <h2>Review of "Snowy Day and Other Stories" Explores Filmmaker Lee Chang-dong's Literary Roots</h2>

          <p>A newly translated collection of stories by acclaimed South Korean filmmaker Lee Chang-dong, titled "Snowy Day and Other Stories," reveals the literary origins of his cinematic style. The review highlights how Lee's early fiction, written during the repressive political climate of 1980s South Korea, uses evocative imagery and suspenseful plots to communicate feeling rather than explicit explanation. Lee's writing, much like his films such as "Burning," focuses on creating atmosphere and exploring the ineffable losses and humiliations of life under an authoritarian regime. The stories demonstrate a sophisticated use of visual detail, particularly the interplay of light and dark, to convey complex emotional and political themes.</p>

          <p>Along India's coastlines, a heartwarming conservation effort is helping protect the vulnerable olive ridley sea turtle population. Activists collect turtle eggs from the beach to safeguard them from predators and incubate them in protected hatcheries. After hatching, the tiny turtles are carefully released onto the sand, where conservationists and sometimes tourists watch over them. These volunteers protect the hatchlings from crabs and birds during their crucial first journey to the sea, creating a moment of shared celebration as the small creatures reach the waves and begin their lives.</p>

          <p>Angela Rayner has resigned from her positions as UK Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary after an investigation found she breached the ministerial code by underpaying tax on a property. The prime minister's ethics adviser concluded that while she acted with integrity, she failed to meet the highest standards by not seeking expert tax advice on the purchase of her flat in Hove. In her resignation letter, Rayner accepted full responsibility for the error, which stemmed from complex arrangements regarding a trust for her son. Her departure leaves a significant vacancy in the government and is expected to trigger a new deputy leadership election for the Labour Party.</p>

          <p>The city of Chicago is bracing for the arrival of federal law enforcement agents, a move initiated by President Donald Trump to address violence and homelessness. This follows the deployment of National Guard troops to Washington D.C. after the president declared a national crime emergency. Despite Chicago's violent crime rates being at historic lows, the Trump administration is proceeding with the deployment, a decision local leaders like Mayor Brandon Johnson and Governor JB Pritzker have opposed. In response, the city has passed an executive order to limit federal influence, while community organizations are preparing residents with "Know Your Rights" campaigns.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is sending ten F-35 stealth fighter jets to Puerto Rico to intensify military operations against drug cartels in the Caribbean. This deployment follows a recent deadly U.S. missile strike on a boat alleged to be carrying Venezuelan drug traffickers, with officials warning more such attacks will occur. The move marks a significant escalation in the administration's crackdown, which also includes the presence of at least eight warships in the region. The Pentagon has also accused Venezuela of a "highly provocative" act for buzzing a U.S. warship, further heightening tensions in the area.</p>

          <p>As the Israeli military intensifies its offensive and claims control of nearly half of Gaza City, a severe humanitarian crisis is unfolding for the civilian population. The military has declared the entire city a "dangerous combat zone," but residents, many of whom are already displaced and starving, have no safe place to go. UN aid agencies and international governments are urging a halt to the assault, warning of a catastrophe, as famine has already been declared in the city due to aid restrictions. The International Committee of the Red Cross has stated that a safe and dignified evacuation is "unfeasible," as no area in Gaza can support an influx of more people.</p>

          <p>Broadcom's stock price jumped 15% after the company revealed it has secured a new $10 billion order for custom artificial intelligence chips from a fourth major customer. While Broadcom did not name the client, analysts at multiple firms widely believe it to be the AI startup OpenAI. The order for what the company calls XPUs (custom processors) has led Broadcom to increase its AI revenue forecast for next year, when shipments are expected to begin. This development further solidifies Broadcom's position, alongside Nvidia, as a key hardware provider for the rapidly growing AI industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted a massive raid on the construction site of a Hyundai and LG electric vehicle battery plant in Georgia, detaining hundreds of workers. The operation, part of an investigation into unlawful employment practices, halted construction on what is considered the largest economic development project in the state's history. The South Korean government expressed "concern and regret" over the raid, as many of the detained workers are South Korean nationals, and urged that the rights of its citizens not be violated. A separate, smaller ICE raid also took place at a manufacturing facility in upstate New York on the same day.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board is asking shareholders to approve a colossal new pay package for CEO Elon Musk that could be valued at up to $1 trillion over the next decade. The plan would award Musk approximately 423 million shares if the company achieves ambitious milestones, including reaching a market capitalization of $8.5 trillion and delivering 20 million vehicles annually. This proposal comes after a Delaware judge voided his previous $56 billion pay package from 2018 following a shareholder lawsuit. The board argues the new award is essential to retain Musk and incentivize his leadership through a pivotal growth period for the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article profiles the career of Angela Rayner, whose journey from a working-class upbringing in poverty to becoming UK Deputy Prime Minister marked a remarkable rise in British politics. It details her early life caring for her mother, leaving school with no qualifications, and her start as a care worker and trade union official before being elected to Parliament in 2015. Rayner became a prominent and combative figure in the Labour Party, often seen as a political asset who could connect with a broad electorate. Her spectacular fall from power, resigning over a tax issue, marks a premature end to a significant political career.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Morningstar report reveals that actively managed investment funds struggled significantly to beat their passive index fund counterparts in the year ending June 2025. Only 33% of active funds delivered higher returns after fees, a notable drop from the previous year. This underperformance occurred despite market volatility from elections and tariffs, periods when active managers often claim an advantage. Over a ten-year period, the success rate is even lower, with just 21% of active strategies surviving and outperforming their benchmarks. The primary driver of this trend is the fee differential, as the higher costs of active management erode investor returns. (not investment advice)</p>
