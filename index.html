          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 04:58:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thousands of energy customers are set to receive payouts, potentially up to £1,000, and may have debts written off due to the scandal involving the forced fitting of prepayment meters. Energy companies are allocating over £70m in compensation and financial support following a review by Ofgem, the energy regulator. The review found that suppliers often switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without their consent after they fell behind on bills, leading to inappropriate installations. A new code of practice with stricter conditions is now in place, and Ofgem is continuing enforcement investigations for British Gas, Utilita, and Ovo. </p>

          <p>Tesco has introduced AI technology at some self-checkouts, featuring overhead cameras that identify when shoppers fail to scan items properly, displaying a live-action replay. The supermarket aims to reduce shoplifting, which has hit a record high in the UK in 2024, with this technology. While some customers mocked the new tech, comparing it to VAR in football, others expressed concerns about increased surveillance. One Tesco worker welcomed the technology, citing the challenges of monitoring multiple self-checkouts simultaneously and dealing with customers attempting to steal or con the system.</p>

          <p>Planned Parenthood in Missouri has ceased performing abortions after the state's Supreme Court mandated new rulings on the legality of a ban previously overturned by voters. The court instructed a lower court to reevaluate the case, considering potential harms from allowing abortions to resume. The state argues that Planned Parenthood did not sufficiently prove women would be harmed without restrictions on abortion services. Lawmakers have approved another ballot measure for 2026 that could reimpose a ban with exceptions for pregnancies caused by sexual assault or incest.</p>

          <p>Senior police and security leaders, including the head of the Met Police and an MI5 boss, have voiced concerns regarding government proposals to release some prisoners early to ease overcrowding. In a letter to the Ministry of Justice, they argued the plans "could be of net detriment to public safety". Their concerns include the costs of electronic tagging and repeat offenders avoiding jail if there is a move away from short sentences. The government maintains that the proposals address many of these concerns, and terrorists will not be eligible for earlier release.</p>

          <p>A report backed by the London mayor recommends decriminalising possession of small quantities of cannabis for personal use, suggesting its removal from the Misuse of Drugs Act. The London Drugs Commission, led by Lord Falconer, argues that current laws disproportionately affect ethnic communities and fail to address medicinal use. While the Metropolitan Police acknowledge the need to adapt if laws change, they express concerns about the link between drug dealing and violence. The report also suggests improving public health services for cannabis-related harm and enhancing cannabis education.</p>

          <p>A German court in Hamm dismissed a climate case brought by a Peruvian farmer against energy giant RWE, who sought financial assistance for flood defenses due to melting glaciers. Saul Luciano Lluiya argued that RWE should contribute to protecting his town from the increasing risk of flooding caused by rising temperatures. The court stated that no appeal is possible. Despite the dismissal, the environmental NGO Germanwatch, which supported the plaintiff, views the case as a historic landmark ruling that could be invoked by affected communities worldwide, acknowledging the transboundary effects of climate change.</p>

Thames Water, facing criticism over sewage discharges and a £20bn debt, secured an emergency £3bn in March to avoid collapse.

          <p>Southern California Edison (SCE) has agreed to pay the federal government $82.5 million for damages caused by the 2020 Bobcat Fire, which burned extensively in the Angeles National Forest. The settlement stems from a 2023 lawsuit filed by federal prosecutors on behalf of the U.S. Forest Service. The government alleged the fire started when trees, not properly maintained by the utility and its contractor, contacted electrical wires. The funds will help rehabilitate burned areas, restore wildlife habitats, and strengthen forest resilience against future wildfires.</p>

          <p>Japan's bond market is raising concerns about capital flight from the U.S. and a potential carry trade unwind as long-dated yields rise. Higher yields could prompt Japanese investors to repatriate funds from the U.S., potentially triggering global financial market instability. Analysts warn that a stronger yen, driven by capital returning home, could impact domestic appetite to invest abroad, particularly in U.S. tech stocks. However, some analysts believe the impact may not be as severe as last year, citing a smaller gap between U.S. and Japanese interest rates and a depreciating dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship experienced a "rapid unscheduled disassembly" during its ninth flight test, despite successfully reaching orbit. An apparent propellant leak caused a loss of attitude control, leading to an uncontrolled reentry and likely disintegration over the Indian Ocean. SpaceX said the mission will help improve Starship's reliability for future flights. The company is taking an iterative approach to engineering, applying learnings from each flight test to future vehicles and missions.</p>
