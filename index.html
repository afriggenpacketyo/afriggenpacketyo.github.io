          <p>An assisted living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, experienced a devastating fire, resulting in nine deaths and over 30 injuries. The fire, which broke out on a Sunday night, quickly filled the three-story Gabriel House with smoke, trapping residents, many of whom were immobile. Fire Chief Jeffrey Bacon described it as an "unfathomable tragedy," noting that emergency responders rescued dozens from the blaze. The cause remains under investigation, but authorities emphasize the deadliness of smoke.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump announced a plan to send "top-of-the-line weapons" to Ukraine via NATO countries, with European nations funding the initiative. Following a meeting with NATO chief Mark Rutte, Trump also threatened Russia with 100% secondary tariffs on its trade partners if a peace deal in Ukraine isn't reached within 50 days. This move marks a shift in Trump's stance, indicating growing frustration with the ongoing conflict and a desire for action beyond diplomatic talks. The tariffs aim to hobble Russia's economy by making trade with it prohibitively expensive for other nations.</p>

          <h2>Ancient Rice Remains Discovered in Guam, Earliest Evidence in Remote Oceania</h2>

          <p>Archaeologists in Guam have unearthed 3,500-year-old rice remains at the Ritidian Site Complex, marking the earliest known evidence of rice in Remote Oceania. The remnants, found as phytoliths on ancient earthenware pottery, suggest rice played a role in rituals within a cave that also contained fine pottery and burial pits. This discovery indicates the first settlers of Guam transported and successfully cultivated rice after their record-setting ocean migration. The findings offer a unique glimpse into the cultural practices and agricultural achievements of these early inhabitants.</p>

          <p>A wildfire near the Grand Canyon's North Rim, known as the Dragon Bravo Fire, has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and over 70 other structures, including administrative buildings and visitor facilities. The blaze, fueled by strong winds, also caused a chlorine gas leak, forcing firefighters to evacuate critical zones. While no injuries or loss of life have been reported, the incident has sparked calls for an investigation into the fire's handling.

          <p>A 54-year-old woman suffered a heart attack and collapsed during an ICE arrest while selling tamales outside a Lowe's store in Los Angeles. Matilde, who declined to give her last name due to her immigration status, reported agents grabbing her forcefully, making it hard to breathe, and ignoring her pleas about chest pain. This incident, captured on video, highlights chaotic methods used in recent immigration sweeps, which a federal judge later ruled violated the Fourth Amendment due to racial profiling. Matilde spent five days hospitalized, now suffering from anxiety and physical injuries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's attempt to debunk "chemtrails" conspiracy theories through new EPA webpages has drawn criticism from experts who accuse the administration of simultaneously spreading climate misinformation. While the EPA's site clarifies contrails are normal, critics argue the administration's broader stance on climate change, including funding cuts and denialist rhetoric, fosters an environment of distrust. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. previously suggested the conspiracy was real, adding to the confusion. This initiative is seen by some as a distraction from addressing the climate crisis, which exacerbates events like the recent Texas floods.</p>

Ramaphosa, who pledged to end endemic corruption, aims for initial findings within three months.

He also argued that countries with trade deficits absorb the tariff costs. Critics, however, note that some major tariff plans were pulled back, and importers stockpiled goods, while other data suggests imported goods prices have indeed risen since March.
