Tafoya, speaking on an OutKick show, called the player vote "insanity" and "childish," dismissing arguments that it was due to Clark's recent performance or injuries.

          <p>A Los Angeles Times column explores the public falling-out between Elon Musk and President Trump, framing it as a lesson in the treacherous nature of aligning with a "bully." The analysis suggests Trump turned on Musk after the billionaire threatened the president's political power. The columnist warns that Trump's subsequent threats to deport Musk set a chilling precedent for weaponizing the denaturalization process against any political opponent. The article argues this tactic could silence dissent among the 25 million naturalized citizens in the U.S. who might fear losing their citizenship for opposing the administration.</p>

          <p>British number one Jack Draper advanced to the second round of Wimbledon after his opponent, Sebastian Baez, was forced to retire due to an injury. Draper was comfortably leading the match 6-2 6-2 2-1 when Baez, who had slipped on the baseline earlier, could not continue. As the host nation's best hope for success following Andy Murray's retirement, Draper delivered a confident and commanding performance on Court One. He will next face Marin Cilic, the 2017 runner-up, in what is expected to be a more challenging match.</p>

          <h2>Cloudflare to Block AI Data Scraping by Default to Protect Website Publishers</h2>

          <p>Internet infrastructure giant Cloudflare announced it will now block AI crawlers from scraping website data by default, a significant move to protect content creators. Website owners using Cloudflare's services will now have to opt-in to allow their data to be used for training AI models. The company argues that AI firms have been taking content without limit, depriving publishers of traffic and revenue. This change could impact the ability of AI developers like OpenAI and Google to easily access the vast amounts of data needed to train their large language models.</p>
