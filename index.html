          <p>Hurricane Erick, the fifth named storm of the Eastern Pacific hurricane season, is rapidly intensifying as it heads toward Mexico. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that Erick could reach major hurricane strength, potentially Category 3, before making landfall. Expected to approach southern Mexico, the storm is predicted to bring between 8 and 16 inches of rain, with maximum totals of 20 inches in Oaxaca and Guerrero, causing life-threatening flooding and mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain. Dangerous storm surges are also expected, creating coastal flooding and large, destructive waves.</p>

          <p>In Nairobi, Kenya, a police officer shot and killed an unarmed civilian named Jonah Kariuki during a protest, sparking outrage and concerns about increasing lawlessness. The protests, initially peaceful, were calling for an end to police brutality. Police vehicles and officers appeared as vendors hastily packed up their stalls. One of the officers pointed his gun in the direction of protesters, then ran with a colleague to a vendor named Jonah Kariuki. The officer who shot Kariuki has been arrested, and activists are calling for him to be charged.</p>

          <p>A person from Yorkshire, UK, has died from rabies after being in contact with a stray dog while on holiday in Morocco. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) stated that there is no risk to the wider public, as rabies is not typically transmitted between people. Close contacts of the deceased and health workers are being assessed and offered vaccinations as a precaution. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of rabies prevention and awareness when traveling to certain regions.</p>

          <p>Smugglers are using "taxi boats" to collect migrants off the French coast as they attempt to reach the UK, adapting to increased police presence. These boats pick up migrants waiting in the sea, out of reach of the police, who are often hesitant to intervene due to safety concerns. French authorities are considering revising their rules to allow more forceful intervention in shallow waters. This new tactic gives smugglers more control over the process, but also potentially disadvantages women and children who struggle to board from the sea.</p>

The new warranty comes as vehicles have grown more expensive, resulting in longer financing periods, and Ram aims to provide better protection for its customers' investments.

          <p>British lawmakers voted to decriminalize abortion in England and Wales, approving an amendment to a crime bill that would prevent women from being criminally punished for ending a pregnancy. The amendment was introduced because police have investigated over 100 women for suspected illegal abortions in the past five years. Under current law, doctors can legally carry out abortions up to 24 weeks, but changes during the COVID-19 pandemic allowed women to receive abortion pills through the mail, leading to prosecutions for illegal abortions after 24 weeks.</p>
