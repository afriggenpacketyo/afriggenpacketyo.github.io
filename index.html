          <p>A 34-year-old Wyandotte County sheriff's deputy was shot and killed in Kansas City, Kansas, while responding to a domestic violence call. The nine-year veteran, Elijah Ming, was assisting a woman in moving out of a residence when a man inside opened fire without warning. The suspect, who also fired on other responding officers, was wounded in a subsequent gunfight and taken into custody after a brief standoff. The Kansas Bureau of Investigation is now leading the inquiry into the tragic incident, which has prompted calls for community prayers from local officials.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review of over 50 studies suggests that walking 7,000 steps per day, rather than the commonly cited 10,000, provides substantial health benefits. Researchers found this benchmark was linked to a 47% reduced risk of death and significant reductions in the risk of dementia and type 2 diabetes. The study, published in The Lancet Public Health, emphasizes that even modest increases in daily steps provide health gains. Experts note that everyday movements count and recommend incorporating strength and mobility training for more complete fitness.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and the European Union have reached a trade agreement, narrowly avoiding a looming tariff deadline. The deal establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods imported into the U.S., a rate lower than the 30% previously threatened by President Trump. As part of the accord, the EU has also committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and investing an additional $600 billion in the United States. European leaders expressed that the agreement brings stability and predictability to the transatlantic trading relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tom Lehrer, the influential American musician, satirist, and Harvard-trained mathematician, has passed away at the age of 97. Known for his darkly humorous and politically charged songs that gained popularity in the 1950s and 1960s, Lehrer was a unique figure who spent most of his life in academia despite his musical success. His enduring works include "The Elements," which sets the periodic table to music, and the morbidly witty "The Masochism Tango." His clever and biting style has been cited as a major influence by modern comedians and musical satirists like 'Weird Al' Yankovic.</p>

          <p>A passenger train derailment in southwestern Germany has resulted in the deaths of at least three people, with several others sustaining serious injuries. The train, operated by Deutsche Bahn, was traveling between Sigmaringen and Ulm with approximately 100 people on board when at least two carriages crashed in a forested area near Riedlingen. While the exact cause remains unknown, reports indicate a storm had passed through the area shortly before the incident.

          <p>CBS's decision to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in 2026 has ignited a debate about the viability of the traditional late-night television format. While Paramount cited purely financial reasons, noting annual losses of around $40 million amid declining linear TV ad revenue, some speculate about other factors. The move puts a spotlight on the entire genre, which faces rising production costs and shifting viewer habits toward streaming and digital clips. The future of ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live," whose contract expires in 2026, is now seen as the next major test for the format.</p>

This approach, which uses the Impoundment Control Act to delay or cancel spending, is viewed by some lawmakers in both parties as an infringement on Congress's constitutional power of the purse.

          <p>An analysis by Ezra Klein suggests that Donald Trump faces a unique political dilemma with the Jeffrey Epstein controversy, as his attempts to deflect and distract only deepen public suspicion. Having built a political brand by promoting conspiracy theories about a corrupt "deep state," he now presides over that state and its secrets, creating a credibility challenge with his base. The article argues that Trump's control over the unreleased information puts him in a difficult position, as any action or inaction fuels the very conspiratorial thinking he has long encouraged, potentially damaging him politically.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's recent move to weaken his country's anti-corruption agencies reflects a broader shift in global governance, influenced by the Trump administration's foreign policy. The author contends that the U.S. has dismantled its own apparatus for promoting democracy and fighting kleptocracy abroad, sending a signal that pressure for such reforms is off. Zelensky's actions, which he later reversed after public protest, are presented as evidence of this new paradigm, where even previously praised leaders feel empowered to protect allies from scrutiny in a world less policed by American ideals.</p>

They urge the administration to resume support for established U.N. aid mechanisms, arguing that blurring the lines between aid and security operations shatters international humanitarian norms.</p>
