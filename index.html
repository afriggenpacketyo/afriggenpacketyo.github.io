          <p>President Trump met with Ksenia Karelina, a freed U.S.-Russian dual citizen, and made a "sports announcement" after facing questions about his understanding of the Constitution. Over the weekend, Trump stated he relies on his lawyers to follow the law, sparking debate about his commitment to upholding the Constitution. He emphasized his trust in his legal team to adhere to Supreme Court rulings, but this statement has raised eyebrows among legal experts and political commentators alike. The meeting with Karelina highlights ongoing diplomatic efforts, while the sports announcement remains undisclosed. Optimism surrounding this article is moderate given the mixed signals and potential constitutional uncertainties.</p>

          <p>This article explores the history and challenges of implementing the REAL ID Act, a law passed in 2005 following the 9/11 Commission's recommendations to improve identification security. The deadline for REAL ID enforcement has been repeatedly extended due to various concerns, including privacy issues and logistical difficulties. Critics initially worried about the creation of a national ID card and the potential for identity theft. While some concerns have been addressed, the author, who initially opposed REAL ID, now has one but still believes the federal government should repeal the law, emphasizing the importance of individual choice.

The decision to raise output by 411,000 barrels per day in June has raised concerns about an oversupplied market. Coupled with fears of a recession due to President Trump's tariffs, the increased production has led to a decline in oil prices. The article notes that investment in exploration and production is expected to decline due to the weak price environment, impacting oilfield service firms.

          <p>This article discusses the difficulties the U.S. faces in curbing Iran's oil exports to China, which provide a vital economic lifeline to Tehran. Despite U.S. sanctions, Iran continues to export an estimated 1.2 to 1.5 million barrels of crude per day, primarily to China. The article explains how Iran relies on a "shadow fleet" of tankers to evade detection and the challenges in tracking these shipments. The author argues that the US has lost leverage over China due to trade tariffs, making the threat of oil-related penalties less effective.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical companies are cautioning that Americans would bear the brunt of potential tariffs on imported medications, leading to increased costs and reduced affordability. A 25% tariff could raise drug costs by nearly $51 billion annually in the U.S. While some companies are investing in domestic production, generic drugmakers face greater challenges due to tighter profit margins. Experts warn that tariffs could exacerbate existing drug shortages and disrupt global supply chains. Gareth Sheridan, CEO of Nutriband, warned that lives could be lost if tariffs are imposed on medicines.</p>
