          <p>A Mexican Navy training ship, the Cuauhtémoc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City, resulting in injuries to at least 22 people, with three in serious condition. The ship's masts were damaged as they struck the bridge, causing parts to fall onto the deck, injuring crew members. New York City's Emergency Management (NYCEM) responded to the incident, and Mayor Eric Adams was briefed at the scene, with authorities urging residents to avoid the area due to heavy traffic and emergency vehicles. An investigation into the incident has been launched by the Mexican Navy to determine the cause of the collision, which occurred during a goodwill visit to New York City. </p>

          <p>CBS's "48 Hours" previews its upcoming episode, "The Footprint," which focuses on the 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs in Minneapolis and the rare clue of bloody, bare footprints left at the crime scene. Investigators initially compared the footprints to multiple people, including Arthur Gray, who lived with Childs, but he had a solid alibi. Decades later, forensic scientist Andrea Feia identified an unknown DNA profile that kept repeating itself on multiple items at the crime scene, leading investigators to genetic genealogy and a potential match to two brothers in Minnesota, one of whom was Jerry Westrom. The episode will delve into the forensic analysis and the subsequent investigation that led to Westrom's arrest. </p>

          <p>President Trump scolded Walmart after the retail giant warned that tariffs would force it to raise prices, suggesting the company should absorb the costs instead of passing them on to consumers. Walmart, in response, stated it would do its best to keep prices low despite the pressure from tariffs, with about a third of its products coming from abroad. Economists note that businesses cannot indefinitely absorb tariff costs and will eventually need to raise prices or lay off workers, and the article notes that Walmart is more insulated than other retailers due to its sourcing of groceries from the United States. The President's attempt to influence Walmart's pricing comes as he seeks to prevent inflation amid his trade policies.</p>

          <p>Severe storms and tornadoes swept across the U.S. Midwest and South, resulting in at least 26 fatalities, with Kentucky being the hardest hit, and Missouri and Virginia also experiencing casualties.

The storms caused significant destruction, including collapsed buildings, downed trees, and power outages, and prompted emergency responses and the establishment of shelters for displaced residents. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem offered federal resources to the affected states, emphasizing that emergency management is best led by local authorities. </p>

          <p>An explosion outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, has been declared an "intentional act of terrorism" by the FBI, resulting in one death and at least four injuries. The explosion, which occurred in or near a vehicle, caused damage across several blocks, with shattered windows in nearby buildings, and authorities have identified a person of interest but have not released their name. The clinic, American Reproductive Centers, reported that its staff and sensitive medical materials were unharmed, and Planned Parenthood clinics in the area closed as a precaution. The bombing has heightened concerns over the politicization of in vitro fertilization and reproductive rights. </p>

Despite the lack of physical evidence and Tarr's claims of being set up, he was found guilty of first-degree murder and attempted murder, and Smith has been recovering since the shooting, though with lasting physical and emotional challenges. </p>

This follows weeks after similar storms caused deadly destruction in the region, and forecasters confirmed 26 tornadoes in a preliminary count, with concerns over staffing shortages at the National Weather Service.

The event was attributed to exceptionally dry soil conditions in central Illinois, and officials noted the dust storm's intensity was reminiscent of the Dust Bowl era.

The staging, while camp and fun, lacked the scale and impact of other performances, and some felt it was too busy. The UK's music industry isn't well integrated with Europe, and the band's performance did not resonate enough with the public to accrue momentum, resulting in another disappointing result. </p>

          <p>Two prominent far-right figures, David Clews and Mark Collett, have announced plans to infiltrate Reform UK and push the party towards extremist views, including a "pro-white" and anti-immigration agenda. Clews claimed that sympathizers are already active within Reform, and the pair have signed a "declaration of intent" to "drag Reform to the right". A Reform spokesman said the far-right would never be welcome in the party and a "stringent vetting process" was in place, and Collett said Reform's success was helping to shift what was considered acceptable for political debate. Collett and Clews hope to make part of Reform's platform policies such as "ensuring the indigenous people of the British Isles remain a super majority by reducing immigration and beginning the process of mass deportations". </p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Walmart for blaming tariffs for potential price increases and insisted the company should "eat the tariffs" instead of passing the costs on to consumers. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon stated that higher tariffs would result in higher prices, and a Walmart spokesperson said the company would keep prices as low as possible, while the president stated that Walmart should sacrifice its profits for the sake of his economic agenda. Trump's actions reflect the challenges many American companies face as a result of his tariffs, and Walmart chief financial officer John David Rainey estimated that $350 car seats made in China could soon cost an additional $100. </p>

          <p>This article humorously outlines the challenges of taking a break from social media, from announcing the break to inevitably finding substitutes like LinkedIn, WhatsApp groups, and Goodreads. The author explores the difficulty of defining what counts as social media and the constant urge to check in on others' lives, eventually leading to a relapse and the creation of an article about the experience. It's a satirical take on the pervasive nature of social media and the struggle to disconnect. </p>

DragonForce, which recently rebranded as a cartel, provides various services including customer support and ransomware negotiation tools, and the group's darknet website was recently hacked by a rival gang called RansomHub.

          <p>Journalism, ridden by Umberto Rispoli, won the 150th running of the Preakness Stakes, edging out Gosger in a come-from-behind victory. Trained by Michael McCarthy, Journalism overcame a bump near the quarter pole to secure the win, marking Rispoli's first victory in a Triple Crown race and McCarthy's second. The race was held at Pimlico Race Course for the last time before its planned reconstruction, and Sovereignty, the Kentucky Derby winner, did not participate. The win was especially meaningful for co-owner Aaron Wellman, and the next Preakness is set to be held at nearby Laurel Park before returning to the new Pimlico in 2027. </p>

          <p>Michael Gove stated that a second Scottish independence referendum could occur if there is "overwhelming support" for one, and this aligns with SNP leader John Swinney's view of securing "demonstrable support" for independence. Gove emphasized the importance of continually demonstrating that the union is working and warned against complacency, while Swinney compared this to the 1997 referendum for a Scottish parliament. Gove was part of a government that rejected requests from the Scottish government for a second referendum, but he now suggests that the likelihood of a second independence vote was linked to the SNP's ability to improve public services. Gove insisted that the Section 35 provision must remain a "fail safe power" that is "used sparingly". </p>
