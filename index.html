            <p>The Trump administration is freezing $2.2 billion in federal funds to Harvard University after the institution refused to comply with demands regarding antisemitism policies, diversity programs, and academic freedom. Harvard's president, Alan Garber, stated that the university would not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights in response to the administration's conditions. The Trump administration's demands included reforms to governance, admissions, and viewpoint diversity, as well as an end to DEI policies. This action has sparked debate over academic freedom and government overreach, with some alumni and Barack Obama supporting Harvard's stance.</p>

            <p>A severe sandstorm in Iraq has led to over a thousand people seeking medical attention for respiratory issues. The storm, which blanketed central and southern Iraq, reduced visibility and caused power cuts in several regions. Health officials reported numerous cases of suffocation, particularly in Muthanna province. While dust storms are common in Iraq, experts suggest that climate change is increasing their frequency, exacerbating health concerns and disrupting daily life.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration announced a freeze on $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard University after the university rejected demands to alter its policies on antisemitism and diversity.

This move underscores the increasing competition among EV makers to develop advanced autonomous driving capabilities.

            <p>Research indicates a significant drop in the number of plays and musicals staged by UK subsidized theaters over the past decade, primarily due to funding cuts and rising costs. Many venues have reduced their homegrown shows, impacting opportunities for emerging artists. While some theaters are co-producing larger-scale productions, smaller, riskier shows are often squeezed out. The decline raises concerns about the future of British theater and its ability to nurture talent.</p>

            <p>A CNBC Supply Chain Survey indicates that President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to lead to a significant reshoring of supply chains to the United States. Most companies surveyed believe the cost of reshoring would be prohibitive, leading them to seek lower-tariffed countries instead. The survey also reveals concerns about the administration's trade policies and their impact on consumer spending. The findings suggest that automation will play a major role in any potential return of manufacturing to the U.S.</p>
