          <p>Crypto founder Justin Sun has announced his intention to purchase an additional $100 million of the $TRUMP memecoin, effectively doubling his investment in the Donald Trump-affiliated digital asset. This move comes as political tokens face scrutiny, with proposed legislation aiming to restrict elected officials from endorsing such assets. The $TRUMP coin, which has experienced significant price volatility since its launch, generates revenue for its creators through transaction fees. Sun's substantial investment underscores the growing entanglement of high-profile crypto figures and speculative, politically-themed digital currencies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A lightning-sparked wildfire, named the White Sage Fire, is burning uncontrollably northwest of Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona, having scorched thousands of acres. The blaze has forced the complete closure of the park's North Rim and triggered evacuation orders for nearby communities like Jacob Lake. Dangerous conditions, including extreme heat warnings with temperatures up to 115°F and gusty winds, are severely hampering containment efforts by emergency crews. This incident coincides with other lightning-caused fires, highlighting a widespread and dangerous wildfire threat across the western U.S.</p>

          <p>Shares of the financial services platform Robinhood reached an all-time high, marking a more than 160% increase this year, despite facing multiple significant challenges. The company is under investigation by Florida's Attorney General for allegedly deceptive marketing regarding its crypto trading costs. Additionally, Robinhood faces user backlash over a new 25% fee on crypto staking rewards and public objections from OpenAI regarding its tokenized stock offerings in Europe. These obstacles highlight the growing regulatory and operational pressures on the fintech firm even as its market valuation soars. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Officials in Pennsylvania have confirmed that the state is experiencing intermittent outages of its 911 emergency call system. The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency acknowledged the issue and stated that efforts are underway to restore full service. In Philadelphia, police confirmed that while some calls are still connecting, the system is unreliable, and they have advised residents to call local police districts directly if they cannot reach 911. Authorities are urging the public to use the system only for genuine emergencies and not for testing its functionality.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military is escalating its development of "loyal wingman" technology by conducting advanced coordination tests between crewed fighter jets and uncrewed drones. In a recent exercise, pilots in an F-16 and an F-15E each controlled two semi-autonomous XQ-58A Valkyrie drones, testing real-time integration in a simulated combat environment. This initiative is part of a broader strategy by the U.S. Air Force to achieve air supremacy through seamless collaboration between human pilots and AI-driven aircraft. The developments are seen as a key part of the technological race for air dominance with nations like China.</p>

          <p>A preliminary investigation into the fatal Air India crash that killed 270 people indicates that the fuel supply to both of the plane's engines was shut off just moments after the aircraft became airborne.

          <p>Millions of people in the United Kingdom are facing hosepipe bans as the country endures its third major heatwave of the year, with temperatures soaring past 34°C (94.5°F). Water companies in Yorkshire and the South East have implemented restrictions on water use due to record-level demand and extended dry conditions. The UK Health Security Agency has issued amber heat health alerts for much of England, warning of risks to the entire population. Meanwhile, fire services in Scotland and Northern Ireland have issued extreme wildfire warnings, urging the public to be cautious.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated a major reduction-in-force, laying off 1,353 civil and foreign service employees as part of a sweeping reorganization under the Trump administration. The move, which aims to cut the department's domestic workforce by about 15%, also involves closing or merging numerous U.S.-based offices. Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the indiscriminate cuts undermine national security and diplomatic readiness. The layoffs are based on an employee's assigned office on a specific date, a method the foreign service union has criticized as being untethered from merit or mission.</p>

          <p>Emil Bove, a former defense attorney for Donald Trump nominated for a lifetime federal judgeship, has drawn criticism for his responses to a Senate Judiciary Committee questionnaire. Bove declined to denounce the January 6th Capitol attack, calling its characterization a matter of "significant political debate," and also avoided answering whether the Constitution permits a president to serve a third term. Democrats have accused Bove of politicizing his current role at the Justice Department, and his non-committal answers on these key issues are expected to be a focus of his confirmation process.</p>

          <p>Following his straight-sets loss to Jannik Sinner in the Wimbledon semi-finals, Novak Djokovic candidly spoke about the physical challenges of competing at age 38. Djokovic stated that the "wear and tear of the body" and the reality of his age are hitting him "like never before." He noted that while he can still play at a high level when fit, competing in long, best-of-five-set tournaments against younger, sharper players like Sinner and Alcaraz is a significant struggle. Despite the humbling defeat, Djokovic affirmed his plan to return to Wimbledon at least one more time.</p>

The SEC alleges Frost's firm, First Liberty Building and Loan, used new investor money to pay earlier ones while he personally siphoned off millions.</p>

          <p>A farmworker in Southern California has died from injuries sustained during a federal immigration raid on a large cannabis operation, according to an advocacy group. The worker reportedly fell 30 feet from a building during the chaotic raid on Glass House Farms, which resulted in the arrest of approximately 200 people suspected of being in the country illegally. The United Farm Workers union condemned the "violent and cruel federal actions," alleging that agents used tear gas and that some detained U.S. citizens were only released after deleting footage of the raid from their phones.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new record high on Friday, briefly trading above $118,000 before settling slightly lower. This significant rally was primarily driven by a massive influx of institutional capital into cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which saw their largest single day of inflows for the year, totaling $1.18 billion. The upward price movement was further amplified by a wave of short liquidations and broader market optimism that the Federal Reserve may adopt a more dovish stance on interest rates. This price action continues a powerful trend of institutional investment pouring into the crypto space. (not investment advice)</p>

While asserting the "American way" is immigrant-friendly, Cain argued for limits on immigration and suggested Gunn's political commentary could hurt the film's box office performance.

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, allowing the case to move forward. The lawsuit alleges that the social media giant intentionally uses manipulative and "addictive design features" to exploit its younger users for commercial gain. The state's Attorney General argues these features are designed to keep children engaged on the app longer, exposing them to more ads and prompting purchases. The judge ruled the state's claims were not about user-generated content, which is federally protected, but about the app's allegedly dangerous design features.</p>

Experts note that while the overall job market is not collapsing for graduates, there are "early warning signs" of AI-driven job displacement for the least experienced workers. This trend is redefining the skills needed for entry-level positions, with a growing emphasis on an applicant's ability to utilize AI tools effectively.</p>
