          <h2>Trump Administration Reconsiders Removing Tariffs on Chinese Goods</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump stated he is not willing to remove the United States' tariffs on China, ahead of planned trade talks between U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart. This announcement was made during a swearing-in ceremony for the new U.S. ambassador to China, former U.S. Senator David Perdue. The decision comes amid ongoing trade tensions and negotiations between the two countries, with China expressing its firm opposition to the tariff hikes. Trump stated that the U.S. was losing a trillion dollars a year, but now it is not losing anything.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve announced it would hold its benchmark interest rate unchanged, maintaining the federal funds rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. This decision comes as policymakers assess the economic impact of President Trump's trade policies, with the Fed noting rising economic risks and increased uncertainty about the economic outlook. The central bank acknowledged the potential for both higher unemployment and higher inflation. The Fed's decision to hold steady comes amid pressure from Trump to cut interest rates, though the central bank signaled it would remain patient and assess incoming data before considering any changes to monetary policy.</p>

          <p>A closely watched index for used vehicle pricing, the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, jumped to its highest level since October 2023, increasing 4.9% year-over-year. The surge in used car prices is attributed to consumers rushing to make purchases amid fears of price hikes due to auto tariffs. Cox Automotive's Jeremy Robb noted that the 'spring bounce' in prices extended throughout April, with wholesale appreciation trends being much stronger than typically observed, reflecting the expected response to the tariffs. The index also marked a 2.7% increase from March.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security presented a State Department memo stating her visa was revoked due to involvement with associations that may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization.</p>

          <p>With average home equity levels high, a $100,000 home equity line of credit (HELOC) may be accessible for many homeowners, but strategic planning is crucial. First, HELOCs are currently the cheapest way to borrow home equity. Second, they are likely to become less expensive in the coming months as interest rates may decline. Third, volatility must be priced in, considering that HELOC rates are variable. Borrowers should calculate repayments against various realistic interest rate scenarios.</p>

          <p>With the federal funds rate paused, prospective home equity borrowers face the decision of choosing between a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC). In today's climate, a HELOC is arguably better due to its lower average interest rate and the likelihood of further rate cuts. HELOCs have also dropped more in percentage points since September 2024, with the ability to adjust payments with the variable rate. Borrowers should still compare both home equity loans and HELOCs.</p>

          <p>WeightWatchers has filed for bankruptcy in the US due to struggles with debt and competition from weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro. The bankruptcy process aims to write off $1.15 billion of the diet brand's debt and establish new repayment terms with lenders. The company has stated that it will remain fully operational during the restructuring process. The bankruptcy filing follows the increasing popularity of weight loss injections, which has changed the weight management landscape.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates unchanged, despite continuous pressure from President Donald Trump to lower borrowing costs. This decision marks the third consecutive announcement without any action on interest rates. The Fed warned that “the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen” and emphasized the increased uncertainty about the economic outlook. The US economy shrank in the first three months of the year, and the central bank stated it would be guided by data, not politics.</p>

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson has dropped a plan to cut Medicaid costs, bowing to pressure from moderate Republicans and highlighting deep party divisions. This decision has drawn criticism from ultraconservative Republicans, who are demanding significant spending cuts. House Republicans are aiming to identify roughly $2 trillion in spending cuts to offset tax cuts. Johnson's challenge is to find Medicaid cuts that meet spending targets and secure enough votes to pass, as any failure could jeopardize the entire package.</p>
