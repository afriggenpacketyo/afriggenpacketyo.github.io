          <p>Newly released footage shows Jihad Al-Shamie, the man responsible for a terror attack at a Manchester synagogue, moments before he drove his car into worshippers on Yom Kippur. The attack resulted in the deaths of two men, Melvin Cravitz and Adrian Daulby, who were hailed as heroes for protecting others inside. This article provides an update on the investigation, noting that four people remain in custody and that Al-Shamie was on police bail for a sexual assault allegation at the time of the attack. The new video evidence helps piece together the timeline of the tragic event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago have initiated legal action to block the Trump administration's plan to deploy National Guard troops, labeling the move an unconstitutional occupation. In the lawsuit, officials argue that the deployment is a politically motivated power grab that would sow chaos and undermine local law enforcement. Governor J.B. Pritzker and Attorney General Kwame Raoul stated they will use every available tool to resist what they call an "invasion" by federal forces. A federal judge has given the administration until Wednesday to respond to the suit.</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma jumped 7% after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman showcased its integration with ChatGPT at the annual DevDay conference. Altman demonstrated how users could verbally instruct ChatGPT to create a workable diagram within Figma, streamlining the design process. This integration is part of OpenAI's new Apps SDK, which allows third-party applications to connect directly with the popular AI assistant. The partnership highlights a growing trend of embedding generative AI tools into established software platforms to enhance functionality and user experience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is set to begin a new term featuring several cases that could significantly reshape the boundaries of presidential power under Donald Trump. Key issues on the docket include the president's authority to deploy the National Guard domestically against state objections, control independent agencies like the Federal Reserve, and unilaterally impose tariffs. Legal scholars anticipate a contentious term, as the court's conservative majority will be forced to issue detailed rulings on executive power, unlike its more opaque "shadow docket" orders. These decisions will have profound implications for the balance of power in the U.S. government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the potential returns of placing $10,000 in either a Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account, considering recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. It calculates that while current returns over various short-term periods are quite similar, a CD offers a guaranteed fixed rate, whereas the variable rate on a savings account is likely to decline further. The analysis suggests that a strategic approach of splitting funds between both account types could balance the benefits of guaranteed returns with the need for financial flexibility.

          <p>OpenAI has struck a major deal to deploy billions of dollars worth of AMD's AI chips over several years, marking a significant strategic partnership. As part of the agreement, OpenAI received a warrant that, if fully exercised, could give it approximately 10% ownership in the chipmaker. This move is designed to secure the immense computing power OpenAI needs for its advanced AI models and reduces its heavy reliance on a single supplier. The partnership underscores the increasingly interconnected and capital-intensive economy surrounding the development of artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>Two prominent psychiatry organizations are publicly calling for the removal of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. The groups accuse the health secretary of increasing stigma around mental illness, spreading fear about psychiatric medications, and harming access to addiction care by dismantling key programs. They specifically criticize his efforts to shutter the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which they argue has been effective in reducing overdose deaths. An HHS spokesperson responded that Secretary Kennedy remains committed to his agenda of reforming health institutions.</p>

This article breaks down the potential monthly cost of a $150,000 HELOC, noting that payments are becoming more affordable due to recent and anticipated interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Currently, monthly payments would range from approximately $1,424 for a 15-year term to $1,811 for a 10-year term. Because HELOCs have variable rates, they are positioned to become even less expensive as the Fed continues its policy of rate reduction. (not investment advice)</p>

According to Goldman Sachs economists, this date is a major "forcing event" that could lead to at least a temporary continuing resolution to reopen the government.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For senior homeowners looking to supplement their retirement income, a reverse mortgage can be an attractive option, but it comes with specific equity requirements. Lenders typically require homeowners to have at least 50% to 60% equity in their property to qualify for the most common type of reverse mortgage, a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM). The actual amount that can be borrowed depends on factors such as the borrower's age, current interest rates, and federal lending limits. If a homeowner falls short of the equity threshold, options include paying down the existing mortgage or downsizing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for Virginia's attorney general, is facing widespread condemnation after 2022 text messages resurfaced in which he used violent and inflammatory language about a Republican colleague. In the texts, Jones mused about shooting former House Speaker Todd Gilbert, prompting backlash from both Republicans and Democrats, including his gubernatorial running mate, Abigail Spanberger. Jones has issued a public apology, calling the remarks "embarrassing" and "shameful." The controversy has become a significant issue in Virginia's highly competitive election cycle, with opponents calling for him to withdraw from the race.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has convicted Ali Muhammad Ali Abd–Al-Rahman, a notorious leader of Sudan's Janjaweed militia, on 27 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The verdict is the first from the ICC for atrocities committed during the Darfur genocide over 20 years ago, where he was found to have personally participated in mass killings, torture, and sexual violence. Abd–Al-Rahman, who faces a maximum sentence of life in prison, turned himself in in 2020. The conviction is a landmark moment for international justice, though warrants for other key figures, including former president Omar al-Bashir, remain outstanding.</p>

          <p>First-year resident doctors in England have voted overwhelmingly in favor of strike action due to a severe shortage of specialty training positions available after they complete their initial two years. The British Medical Association (BMA) reports that this year there were 30,000 applicants for only 10,000 available jobs, leaving thousands of qualified doctors in career uncertainty. The union blames poor workforce planning, where medical school enrollment has expanded without a corresponding increase in NHS training posts. This mandate for industrial action adds a new point of leverage in ongoing negotiations with the government over pay and working conditions.</p>
