          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has requested a federal judge to swiftly block the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard members and Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests against immigration raids, arguing that the deployment poses an imminent threat to state sovereignty and escalates civil unrest. State Attorney General Rob Bonta emphasized the need for a temporary restraining order to prevent immediate harm. Trump defended the deployment, claiming it was necessary to prevent Los Angeles from burning, while Newsom countered that Trump was behaving like a tyrant and stoking more civil unrest through these actions, leading to a lawsuit against Trump, the Defense Secretary, and the Pentagon. The legal challenge underscores the escalating tensions between California and the federal government regarding immigration enforcement and the use of military force within the state. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has warned that any protesters at the military parade in Washington, D.C., will be "met with heavy force," coinciding with the Army's 250th anniversary and his own birthday. Trump defended the planned display of military vehicles and aircraft, stating it would be an "incredible" celebration of the U.S. military's victories, while also addressing the deployment of National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles to quell protests there. Despite the warning, officials indicated they were tracking nine small protests and did not anticipate violence, although progressive groups planned demonstrations outside of Washington, D.C. The comments have sparked concerns about the administration's approach to dissent and the militarization of public spaces. </p>

          <p>Approximately 700 active-duty Marines have arrived in the Los Angeles area to support National Guard troops responding to protests against federal immigration enforcement. California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a lawsuit seeking to block the deployment of troops for law enforcement purposes, arguing it is causing irreparable damage. The state seeks to prevent the use of federalized National Guard and active-duty Marines for law enforcement purposes on the streets of a civilian city, but does not seek to prevent those forces from protecting the safety of federal buildings. The deployment has drawn criticism from local officials who believe the city's police force can manage the protests, while the Trump administration insists it is necessary to protect federal property and ICE agents. </p>

          <p>This article discusses the importance of maintaining clean hummingbird feeders to prevent harm or death to the birds. While hummingbird feeders can provide a supplementary food source, especially when natural wildflowers are scarce, dirty feeders can harbor harmful microbes that cause infections in hummingbirds. These infections, such as candida, can lead to swollen tongues and difficulty feeding, potentially causing starvation. The solution involves regularly cleaning feeders every two to three days with hot water or a vinegar and water solution, and refilling them with a mixture of one part refined white sugar to four parts water, avoiding red food coloring and distilled water. </p>

          <p>BlackRock's $3.2 billion acquisition of Preqin, an alternative asset data provider, is viewed by CEO Larry Fink as potentially the most consequential deal for expanding the firm's presence in private markets. Preqin's data integration into BlackRock platforms like Aladdin and eFront aims to bring transparency to private markets, similar to what Zillow did for housing, by providing valuation and performance data on numerous funds and managers. This move could diversify BlackRock's revenue streams beyond the volatility of the stock market and allow the creation of private-market benchmarks. While Moody's warns of potential risks in offering private market investments to retail investors, BlackRock aims to innovate and make these markets more accessible and less risky.
