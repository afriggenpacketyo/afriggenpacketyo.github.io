          <p>President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate whether individuals working for former President Biden concealed his cognitive decline by abusing the power of presidential signatures through an autopen. Trump alleges that Biden's aides restricted his media appearances and scripted conversations to cover up his inability to discharge his duties. The investigation aims to determine if there was a conspiracy to deceive the American public about Biden's mental and physical health, and who directed the autopen's use on policy documents. House Republicans, led by Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, have also launched an investigation into Biden's mental fitness to authorize the autopen's use.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a proclamation immediately blocking Harvard University from enrolling new international students or exchange visitors, citing national security threats and links with foreign countries, particularly China. The administration accuses Harvard of maintaining connections that could allow foreign adversaries to steal technical information, exploit research, and spread false information. The proclamation, effective for at least six months, directs the State Department to review current foreign enrollments and potentially revoke visas. Harvard has responded, calling the action "yet another illegal retaliatory step" and vowing to protect its international students.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has signed a proclamation suspending travel to the U.S. for citizens from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, citing national security interests. The proclamation states these countries lack sufficient vetting processes to detect potential safety or terrorism threats. Additionally, partial restrictions are imposed on nationals from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. The policy mirrors a similar travel ban from 2017 and takes effect on Monday, June 9, with exceptions for U.S. permanent residents, athletes attending major sporting events, and immediate family members with clear evidence of identity and relationship.</p>

          <p>A lawyer representing families of victims from the 2018 Lion Air crash has criticized a deal between Boeing and the U.S. Justice Department as "morally repugnant," allowing Boeing to avoid true criminal accountability. The deal involves Boeing paying $1.1 billion to avoid prosecution over two fatal 737 Max crashes that killed 346 people, including $444.5 million to the families. Boeing will also allocate $455 million towards improving compliance, safety, and quality programs, and pay a criminal penalty of $487.2 million. The crashes were linked to faulty flight control systems, and victims' families will have the chance to appeal the deal when it is considered by a federal judge.</p>

          <p>Tech billionaire Elon Musk has called on US citizens to push lawmakers to vote down President Donald Trump's key tax and spending bill, arguing that it would increase the deficit and accelerate national debt. Musk, who recently stepped down from a role in cutting federal spending with the Trump administration, has labeled the bill a "disgusting abomination" and warned lawmakers of potential backlash in the 2026 midterm elections. House Speaker Mike Johnson has questioned Musk's motives, suggesting the bill could negatively impact Tesla.

          <p>Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into Joe Biden's actions as president, alleging top aides masked his predecessor's "cognitive decline." The investigation will focus on Biden's use of an autopen and whether his aides usurped presidential authority. Biden dismissed the idea of a cover-up as "ridiculous," asserting he made all decisions during his presidency. Republican lawmakers are seeking testimony from Biden's top aides about his mental and physical faculties, while a separate inquiry is launched into clemencies Biden issued. Concerns about Biden's cognitive abilities have intensified following a disastrous debate performance and revelations about his health.</p>

          <p>High-stakes negotiations over Iran's nuclear program are uncertain as the U.S. and Iran clash over the terms of an interim agreement proposed by the Trump administration. Iran's supreme leader rejected the proposal, stating Iran would not agree to halt uranium enrichment. President Trump has asserted that any agreement would prohibit uranium enrichment, contradicting statements from U.S. officials. Russia has offered to play a role in negotiations, but optimism has cooled among both U.S. and Iranian officials, with Iran seeking relief from sanctions and guarantees regarding their removal.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of feather fossils found trapped in Burmese amber has shed new light on the evolution of flight feathers, an essential step that allowed early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. Researchers conducted a detailed structural study of feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period. They found that an essential feature of the evolution of birds was the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift. Modern birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs, though most feathered dinosaurs did not have the same ability to fly.</p>
