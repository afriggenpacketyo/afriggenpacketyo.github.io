            <p>A former partner of Kevin Booth, a millionaire horse racing tipster, has come forward with allegations of torture and abuse, warning that someone could die if he is not stopped. Booth, who was previously convicted for caning children, allegedly abused women in an underground chamber at his home and in hotel rooms, filming the abuse. A former maid also claimed Booth subjected her to physical punishment. Booth denies the allegations, but a civil court has issued a travel ban against him, describing his conduct as "trafficking and exploitation."</p>

            <p>Analysts caution that Donald Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs for most nations doesn't signal a shift in his overall trade objectives. Tariffs on Chinese imports were raised to 125%, intensifying the trade war between the world's two largest economies. Experts express concern about the impact on global supply chains and the potential for economic disruption. An ING report suggests the current tariffs could generate significant tax revenue, but this would disappear if China stopped exporting.</p>

            <p>A Meta whistleblower, Sarah Wynn-Williams, testified before US senators that the company undermined national security to build a business in China. She alleged that Meta worked with the Chinese Communist Party to censor critics, specifically deleting the Facebook account of Chinese dissident Guo Wengui. Meta denies the allegations, stating it does not operate its services in China. The company also claims Wynn-Williams is violating a separation agreement and could face financial penalties for speaking out.</p>

            <p>China analyst Gordon Chang predicts that other countries will follow President Donald Trump’s lead in imposing steep tariffs on Chinese imports. Chang argues that Trump’s tariffs will close off the U.S. market, forcing China to sell its products elsewhere, which will decimate other countries' industrial sectors unless they protect their markets. He also suggests relocating manufacturing from China to Central America to stabilize those societies and reduce migration pressures.</p>

The MPs are concerned that the rise of streaming platforms is crowding out independent British producers and threatening the creation of distinctly British content. Industry representatives are debating whether the levy will hurt or help production.</p>
