          <p>China's Commerce Ministry has designated Canadian semiconductor research firm TechInsights as an "unreliable entity," prohibiting Chinese entities from sharing data with it. This action follows TechInsights' report revealing that Huawei's latest AI chips contained components sourced from outside mainland China, including from companies under U.S. export controls. Beijing's move highlights ongoing efforts to achieve self-sufficiency in its semiconductor supply chain amidst global trade restrictions. The blacklisting could further obscure China's chip industry and raises questions about the effectiveness of U.S. export controls.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Virginia on charges of bank fraud and false statements related to a 2020 mortgage. The indictment, presented by a prosecutor appointed by President Donald Trump, alleges James misrepresented her use of a Norfolk home as a secondary residence rather than a rental property. James vehemently denies the charges, calling them "baseless" and a "weaponization of our justice system" driven by Trump's political retribution after her successful civil fraud case against him. The case has drawn criticism from Democratic leaders, who view it as a grave attack on the rule of law.</p>

          <p>A woman whose body was found on a Dutch beach in 2004 has finally been identified as 35-year-old German citizen Eva Maria Pommer, 21 years later. Her identity was confirmed following a crucial tip-off received through Operation Identify Me, an international police campaign to name unidentified female victims. Ms. Pommer's case, known as "the woman with the German keys," had remained a mystery despite unusual clothing and a key linking her to Germany.

          <p>The White House has claimed a "more than 1,000 percent" increase in assaults on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, but public evidence does not support this dramatic spike. An analysis of court records indicates a roughly 25 percent rise in charges for assault against federal officers, far below the administration's figures. Despite requests, the Department of Homeland Security has not provided data to justify its claims, raising concerns about government credibility. Critics, including a former FBI agent, warn that exaggerating such statistics can erode public trust in the criminal justice system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists from China and Spain have made a breakthrough, discovering that adding salt to ice enables it to generate electricity when bent. This finding opens new possibilities for harnessing clean power, particularly in cold environments. The team found that salt-doped ice produced an electrical response comparable to high-performing ceramic materials. This innovative approach leverages flexoelectricity, where an electrical charge is generated under non-uniform strain, potentially leading to low-cost energy sources.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi's victory in Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership race marks a significant ideological shift, positioning her as the country's first female prime minister-in-waiting. Known for her arch-conservative and nationalist views, her ascent signals a potential departure from the centrist pragmatism of previous administrations. Takaichi's vision combines fiscal expansionism with protectionist policies, prioritizing state-led industrial revival and strategic investment in defense and technology. This approach aims to reduce reliance on China and strengthen security autonomy, with mixed implications for Japan's domestic economy, foreign policy, and engagement with Southeast Asian partners.</p>

          <p>"Battlefield 6," the latest installment in the military shooter series, is poised to challenge "Call of Duty" in the competitive video game market, despite being a significant gamble for publisher Electronic Arts (EA). Developed by four studios, the game is touted as "unbeatable" by its general manager, with a restored single-player campaign and positive community feedback from early playtests. The project, reportedly costing hundreds of millions, faces pressure to succeed after its predecessor's negative reception. Its success will depend on attracting and retaining players against established rivals, with developers cautiously optimistic about its potential.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a package of bills aimed at strengthening the California FAIR Plan, the state's insurer of last resort, following significant losses from January's wildfires. The legislation seeks to alleviate the FAIR Plan's financial strain and increase legislative oversight over the carrier, which provides coverage when private insurers withdraw. Key measures include enabling the plan to issue bonds for catastrophic claims and appointing legislative members to its governing committee. These reforms are a response to the growing climate-fueled firestorms and aim to stabilize California's insurance market.</p>

          <p>UK universities have announced over 12,000 job cuts in the past year, with additional cost savings equivalent to 3,000 more jobs, according to a University and College Union (UCU) analysis. This deepening financial crisis sees four in ten English universities in deficit, prompting difficult decisions like redundancies and restructures. The UCU criticizes these "brutal" cuts, citing demoralized staff and negatively impacted students, while employers state the cuts are a "prudent option" given the financial challenges. This situation highlights a significant crisis in the higher education sector, affecting both staff and student experiences.</p>

          <p>Libby Adame, known as "the butt lady," has been convicted of second-degree murder after a second client, a TV actor, died from illegal silicone injections she administered. Adame was previously convicted of involuntary manslaughter for a similar death in 2019 but continued performing unauthorized procedures. Prosecutors argued she was aware of the dangers, citing a judge's warning and a prior incident where she fled after a client's death. This conviction carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years, underscoring the severe risks of unapproved cosmetic procedures.</p>

          <p>The war in Ukraine is witnessing a new AI arms race, with both Russian and Ukrainian forces deploying AI-assisted technologies that are transforming the battlefield. Ukrainian defense consultant Serhiy Beskrestnov discovered a Russian drone that could autonomously find and attack targets without signals, making it unjammable. Ukrainian forces are also using AI-based software for drones to lock onto targets and fly autonomously for the final stages of missions. This shift towards autonomous weapons raises concerns about avoiding civilian harm and adherence to rules of war, prompting calls for global regulations on military AI.</p>

          <p>A congressional stalemate threatens the expiration of Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance subsidies by the end of 2025, potentially jeopardizing coverage for millions of Americans. Democrats insist on extending these subsidies, which have doubled ACA marketplace enrollments to over 24 million, while Republicans demand a "clean" bill to reopen the government first. Without these tax credits, the average ACA premium could more than double, making health insurance unaffordable for an estimated 3.8 million people by 2035.

          <p>Robert Roberson, convicted of capital murder in his 2-year-old daughter Nikki's 2002 death, has been granted a stay of execution by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, just one week before it was scheduled. Roberson's defense argues he is innocent, claiming Nikki died from pneumonia and medications, not shaken baby syndrome, a diagnosis now considered unsound by new medical research. The ruling orders a review of his arguments under Texas' "junk science" law, potentially paving the way for a new trial. This decision offers a chance for re-evaluation in a case where undiagnosed autism was also a factor.</p>
