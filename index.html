          <p>SoFi CEO Anthony Noto announced that the fintech bank plans to re-enter the cryptocurrency investment business this year, reversing its 2023 decision to drop crypto offerings.

SoFi aims to provide comprehensive blockchain capabilities across its product areas, signaling a broader push into digital assets.

          <p>The article explores the trend of one-size-fits-all fitness advice, particularly within the context of social media and the "bro-ification" of wellness. It critiques the idea of universal fitness goals, arguing that individual needs and circumstances vary significantly. The piece highlights the influence of figures like Andrew Huberman and the adoption of male-dominated fitness routines by women. It also touches on the potential for these trends to contribute to body-negative attitudes and marginalize those who cannot adhere to strict regimens.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has amassed significant power in the Trump administration as the leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), spearheading efforts to cut federal spending and reduce the workforce. Despite promising substantial cost savings, DOGE's achievements have fallen short of initial targets, and some savings claims have been questioned. Musk's influence has drawn criticism from Democrats and concerns from Tesla investors, but he maintains support from Republican voters and President Trump. DOGE has been involved in dismantling agencies, accessing federal data, and implementing controversial policies, often facing legal challenges.</p>

          <p>PayPal reported better-than-expected earnings for the first quarter, but missed on revenue and reaffirmed its guidance for 2025 due to macro uncertainty. The company's key profitability measure, transaction margin dollars, grew 7%. While sales increased just 1% from $7.7 billion a year earlier, PayPal said the results reflect a strategy to prioritize profitability over volume, rolling off lower-margin revenue streams.  For the second quarter, PayPal issued better-than-expected guidance, forecasting adjusted earnings per share of $1.29 to $1.31, above the average analyst estimate of $1.21.
