          <p>Tesla reported a 12% revenue increase in Q3 2025, ending two quarters of decline, but its stock fell 3% as earnings per share missed analyst estimates. The profit drop was attributed to lower EV prices and a 50% rise in operating expenses, partly due to AI and R&D projects. The article notes a sales slump in Europe due to consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk and increased competition. Despite a record 497,099 vehicle deliveries, year-to-date deliveries are down 6% compared to 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. military carried out its eighth strike on an alleged drug vessel since September 2, targeting a boat in international waters off Colombia, resulting in two fatalities. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated the vessel was operated by a designated terrorist organization involved in narco-trafficking. Democratic Senator Mark Kelly questioned the legal rationale and constitutionality of these strikes, noting that previous actions have killed at least 34 people.

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has issued a memo requiring formal approval for nearly all Department of Defense correspondence and interactions with Congress. This new policy mandates that most offices, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff and military department secretaries, coordinate legislative affairs activities through the assistant secretary for legislative affairs. The memo states that "unauthorized engagements" could undermine departmental priorities. The article highlights concerns about transparency and the ability of Congress to conduct oversight, with a carve-out only for the Office of the Inspector General.</p>

          <p>New data reveals that traditional savings accounts offer negligible interest rates, averaging 0.40%, effectively causing savers to lose money to inflation. In contrast, high-yield savings accounts currently provide competitive rates typically ranging from 4.20% to 4.30%, with potential for higher returns online. The article illustrates how various deposit amounts can accrue significant interest over time, even with variable rates. It also suggests considering Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts for fixed rates that protect against future rate cuts, offering stability for long-term savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wholesale turkey prices are projected to increase by 40% to $1.32 per pound this Thanksgiving, primarily due to reduced supply caused by weakened demand and avian flu outbreaks.

Despite the wholesale surge, retailers like Walmart and Aldi are offering discounted turkey deals, aiming to attract budget-conscious consumers.

          <p>An Oxford Economics analysis predicts many Americans could receive larger tax refunds next year, totaling an additional $50 billion, due to new provisions in the Republicans' "one big, beautiful bill" act. The law, signed by President Trump, retroactively extended tax reductions and introduced new breaks, such as eliminating taxes on some overtime and tipped income. While the IRS hasn't updated withholding tables, leading to overpayment for many, the article notes that a "disproportionate share" of these benefits, particularly from the lifted SALT cap, will accrue to higher-income households.
