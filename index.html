          <p>In a provocative move, California's Assembly Republicans have proposed a resolution to split the state into two, separating the coastal region from the more rural inland areas. This "two-state solution" is considered a political nonstarter but serves as a messaging strategy against a Democratic-led initiative to redraw congressional districts. Republicans argue the current system silences rural voices, while Democrats have dismissed the proposal as a political stunt and a form of gerrymandering itself.</p>

          <p>Denmark's government has summoned the senior U.S. diplomat in response to reports of a covert American operation aimed at promoting Greenland's secession. The operation allegedly sought to infiltrate society and build support for joining the U.S., exacerbating diplomatic tensions over the territory's future. This incident follows previous friction, including President Trump's stated desire to annex the semi-autonomous Danish territory, which has shocked the traditionally pro-American nation.</p>

          <p>Susan Monarez has been ousted as the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention less than a month after her Senate confirmation. Her removal coincides with the resignations of at least three other senior CDC leaders, who cited the "weaponizing of public health" and political interference as reasons for their departure. The shakeup occurs amidst broader turmoil at the agency, including budget cuts and the firing of an independent vaccine advisory panel by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>

          <p>President Trump recently targeted late-night host Seth Meyers on social media, questioning NBC's decision to extend his contract through 2028 and calling him one of the "least talented" hosts. The post follows a long history of criticism between the two, notably stemming from Meyers' jokes at the 2011 White House Correspondents’ Dinner. The article frames this as part of a broader trend where late-night television serves as a prominent platform for challenging the administration's policies.</p>

          <p>The pastor and his wife who lead the "His Way Spirit Led Assemblies" religious group in Hemet, California, have been arrested on illegal weapons charges. The arrests are part of an investigation into the suspicious disappearance of two former members, one in 2023 and another in 2017. Police seized automatic weapons and unserialized "ghost guns" during searches related to the case of Emilio Ghanem, who vanished after leaving the group and starting a rival business.</p>

          <p>Universities across the United States are experiencing a significant drop in new international student enrollment as the fall semester begins, with some institutions reporting declines of 15% or more. The decrease is attributed to a clampdown on student visas by the Trump administration, which has created long delays and prevented many accepted students from securing appointments. This trend could have a multi-billion dollar negative impact on the U.S. economy and affects the cultural diversity and financial stability of many campuses.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates in September, savers are advised to act strategically to lock in favorable Certificate of Deposit (CD) rates. Recommendations include shopping at online banks, which typically offer higher returns, and choosing the longest-term CD that fits one's financial situation to maximize earnings over time. As a rate cut will likely lead to lower yields on savings products, acting proactively can help secure better returns before they decline. (not investment advice)</p>
