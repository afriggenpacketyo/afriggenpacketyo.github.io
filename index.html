            <p>The resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted in 1989 for the murder of their parents, was delayed until May 9th after a contentious court session. The hearing was meant to decide if they should receive a new sentence that could potentially lead to their release after three decades in prison. The delay was caused by a request from prosecutors to review a risk assessment report ordered by Gov. Gavin Newsom regarding their potential clemency. The defense attorney also declared he would seek the recusal of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office due to alleged bias, further complicating the timeline for a decision on the brothers' fate.</p>

            <p>Chinese scientists at Fudan University have developed “Poxiao,” a new flash memory technology capable of erasing and rewriting data in 400 picoseconds, potentially revolutionizing data storage speeds. The prototype holds kilobytes of data, but its design overcomes limitations of current memory technologies by offering a speed increase of 100,000 times compared to traditional flash storage. This innovation aims to bridge the gap between fast volatile memory and persistent non-volatile memory, potentially enhancing AI computing power. The breakthrough involves addressing speed limitations in flash memory while retaining its advantages of high capacity and low power consumption.</p>

Belichick's staff has been actively building their roster through the transfer portal, also adding linebacker Mikai Gbayor and three former Washington Huskies defensive players. The Tar Heels are expected to continue looking for talent in the portal, with quarterback being a key position to upgrade for the upcoming season.</p>

            <p>With local elections approaching, Reform UK and the Green Party are seeking to capitalize on voter disenchantment with Labour and the Conservatives. In Hull and East Yorkshire, Reform UK's candidate Luke Campbell hopes to mirror Donald Trump's success by appealing to disillusioned voters, while Labour faces challenges due to recent policy decisions. In the West of England region, the Green Party sees an opportunity to challenge Labour, especially amid allegations against the incumbent mayor. Overall, political disengagement and low turnout are creating a volatile landscape, potentially handing power to smaller, driven groups of voters.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration announced new fees on Chinese-built vessels docking at U.S. ports, following a USTR investigation concluding China's shipbuilding industry unfairly burdens U.S. commerce. The fees, initially proposed under the Biden administration, will be phased in over several years, starting with $0 per net ton initially and increasing to $140 per net ton by 2028 for Chinese vessel operators. Vessel owners can receive a remission of fees by providing proof of a U.S. shipbuilding order. The move aims to reverse Chinese dominance in shipbuilding and encourage the use of U.S.-built ships.

While still in its early stages, the project aims to determine if removing carbon from seawater can be a cost-effective way to reduce greenhouse gases.

            <p>Canada faces a severe housing affordability crisis, with home prices far exceeding average incomes, especially in major cities like Vancouver and Toronto. This issue is a key concern for voters in the upcoming federal election. The crisis is driven by a supply shortage failing to keep pace with population growth, leading to high costs for both buyers and renters. Major parties have proposed plans to increase housing construction, but some experts argue that addressing the wealth generated by older homeowners off the housing crisis is also necessary.</p>

            <p>Bin workers in Birmingham are on strike due to the removal of Waste Recycling and Collection Officers (WRCO) roles, which could lead to pay cuts for some workers. The union claims some workers could face pay cuts of up to £8,000, while the council estimates the maximum loss would be just over £6,000. The council argues that keeping the higher-paid WRCO role could lead to equal pay claims, as refuse collection is predominantly performed by men. A consultation on compulsory redundancies affecting up to 72 refuse staff has begun.</p>
