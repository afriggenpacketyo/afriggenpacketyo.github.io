          <p>A student suspect involved in a shooting at Evergreen High School in Colorado has died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The incident, which occurred Wednesday afternoon, resulted in two other students being hospitalized, one in critical condition and another stable. Authorities confirmed the suspect's death and are continuing their investigation, seeking warrants for the student's home and locker. The event prompted widespread condemnation, including from Colorado's governor, and a large-scale law enforcement response to secure the campus.</p>

          <p>NASA's Perseverance rover has discovered rock samples in a dried river channel on Mars that contain potential signs of ancient microbial life. Scientists emphasize that while the findings are compelling, the samples must be returned to Earth for conclusive analysis to rule out non-biological origins. The discovery, involving organic carbon and specific iron compounds, represents a significant step in the search for extraterrestrial life. However, the ambitious sample-return mission is currently on hold as NASA explores more cost-effective options.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index achieved a new record high, driven by a nearly 10% surge in SoftBank Group's shares. This rally followed reports of a major cloud-computing deal between Oracle and OpenAI, which has a connection to SoftBank through the U.S. "Stargate" AI initiative. The broader market optimism in Japan mirrored gains on Wall Street, which were fueled by positive inflation data and hopes for a Federal Reserve rate cut. While the Nikkei and tech stocks soared, other Asian markets showed mixed results. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has drawn widespread condemnation from across the political spectrum, with leaders including President Trump and former Presidents Biden, Obama, Bush, and Clinton denouncing the act of violence. While there was unity in mourning, political tensions surfaced on the House floor during an attempt to hold a moment of silence. Many officials emphasized the need to lower political temperatures and reject violence, regardless of ideological differences. President Trump ordered flags to be flown at half-staff in Kirk's honor.</p>

          <p>A home in the Fairfax District of Los Angeles, surrounded by large piles of garbage bags, has once again become the subject of neighborhood debate. While some view the property as a public health and fire hazard, many neighbors and friends are defending the homeowner, a 71-year-old Vietnam veteran. They describe his actions not as hoarding but as a meticulous, one-man recycling operation that provides his income. Advocates for the homeowner are calling for understanding and compassion, arguing that media attention and city pressure are exacerbating the situation for a private individual.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, communities across the United States held vigils to mourn his death and stand against political violence. Events were organized by Turning Point USA campus chapters, churches, and other community groups, calling for prayer and national healing. Tributes also came from outside the political sphere, with the New York Yankees holding a moment of silence before their game. These gatherings reflect a widespread public response to the assassination, uniting many in grief and a call for peace.</p>

          <p>China has opened the Changtai Yangtze River Bridge, the world's longest cable-stayed bridge, in the eastern Jiangsu province. The 10.3-kilometer structure is a multi-functional crossing, uniquely designed to carry an expressway, a local road, and an intercity railway on the same deck. Its innovative asymmetrical design, placing the heavier railway alongside the road, represents a significant engineering feat. The bridge dramatically reduces travel time between the cities of Changzhou and Taizhou from over an hour to just 20 minutes.</p>

The judge had previously stated that Cook's removal could violate the Federal Reserve Act, which requires legal "cause" for such an action, and that maintaining Fed independence was in the public interest. President Trump sought to remove Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, based on allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies.

The Royal College of Radiologists states that the cumbersome process for securing funding is stifling innovation and leading to inequities, with cutting-edge therapies like SABR radiotherapy often available only at larger, better-funded centers. This disparity means some patients are missing out on potentially life-saving care. The government is expected to address these issues in a new cancer strategy later this year.</p>

          <p>A long-standing perk for California drivers of electric and other low-emission vehicles is ending, as the federal program authorizing solo access to carpool lanes was not renewed. Starting October 1, vehicles with Clean Air Vehicle decals will no longer be permitted in high-occupancy vehicle lanes without meeting the passenger requirements. The program, which has been in place for over two decades and includes about half a million active decals, was designed to incentivize the purchase of cleaner cars. State officials criticized the federal government's failure to extend the popular and successful initiative.</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, who died at 31 after being shot in Utah, was a transformative figure in modern conservative politics. He founded Turning Point USA at age 18, building it into a powerful organization that mobilized young voters and countered liberal dominance on college campuses. A staunch ally of President Trump, Kirk played a significant role in the MAGA movement and the 2024 election, focusing on the economic anxieties of younger generations. His death leaves a major void in the conservative youth movement he helped to create and lead.</p>

The Swedish "buy now, pay later" company saw its shares open above the expected range, reflecting strong investor interest in the booming IPO market. Cramer noted that while the company is not yet profitable due to recent investments in growth, its improving fundamentals, strong revenue streams, and impressive underwriting standards make it an attractive option.

          <p>State lawmakers have introduced a bill to significantly reform Measure ULA, the "mansion tax" in Los Angeles, in an effort to encourage more housing development. The proposal would reduce the tax rate on sales of recently built apartment buildings and commercial properties, which critics claim have been stifled by the current law. The legislation is also part of a political strategy to dissuade support for a separate statewide ballot initiative that would nullify Measure ULA entirely. Supporters of the original measure are alarmed, arguing it overrides the will of L.A. voters and will cut crucial funding for homelessness programs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of traditional "stand and stir" cooking shows on television has plummeted, with commissions for food programs dropping 44% in a year across British TV. This decline is attributed to a massive shift in audience preference towards online platforms like YouTube and TikTok, where food influencers offer more authentic, nimble, and direct content. Unlike the slow, heavily regulated production of television, online creators can react instantly to trends and build direct relationships with their communities. This cultural shift highlights a broader crisis for traditional broadcasting as viewers increasingly favor the "rough and ready" style of online video.</p>

In some cases, children's identities were changed, making it nearly impossible for parents to trace them after the regime's fall, leaving thousands of families searching for answers.</p>

          <p>Reflecting on the 30th anniversary of CNBC's "Squawk Box," financial analyst Jim Cramer recalled the show's early days and the widespread investor enthusiasm for individual stocks. He noted that this optimism faded after the dot-com bubble burst, leading to a long period where safer index funds were favored. However, Cramer suggests the current market environment feels similar to the 1990s, with a renewed excitement and awareness of the potential rewards from investing in single, high-performing stocks like those in the data center sector.

The adviser noted that the gap between the U.S. and China has closed significantly since 2020.
