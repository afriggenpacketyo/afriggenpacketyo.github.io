          <p>Russian strikes on Kyiv have resulted in at least 15 deaths and dozens of injuries, marking one of the largest bombardments of the Ukrainian capital since the start of the full-scale invasion. Ukrainian officials reported that Russia launched 440 drones and 32 missiles at the country, with Kyiv being heavily targeted. Rescue teams are working to free people trapped under rubble after a missile hit a nine-story apartment building, and the strikes, lasting over nine hours, prompted residents to seek shelter. The intensification of Russian air attacks against Ukrainian cities reflects a tactic of overwhelming Ukrainian air defenses with large waves of drones and decoys.</p>

          <p>Investigators in India are analyzing the black boxes recovered from the wreckage of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner to determine the cause of last week's plane crash, which resulted in at least 270 fatalities. The black boxes contain cockpit conversations and data related to the plane's engine and control settings, which are crucial for piecing together the sequence of events leading to the disaster. The Air India aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, killing 241 people on board and 29 on the ground, with experts from India, the U.K., and the U.S. assisting in the investigation. Authorities are also inspecting Air India's entire fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliners to prevent future incidents, as the investigation is expected to be a lengthy process due to the extensive damage to the aircraft.</p>

Trump also posted on social media urging Iranian civilians to evacuate Tehran, signaling a potential escalation of the conflict, and his early return raised concerns about the ongoing crisis.

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order confirming parts of a trade deal between the UK and the US, reducing tariffs on UK cars being shipped to the US. The agreement allows up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the 25% import tax imposed earlier in the year, and it also removes tariffs on certain aerospace products. While the deal is seen as a positive step, it does not address the expected removal of charges on steel imports, and the UK government is continuing to work towards 0% tariffs on core steel products. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders expressed reassurance about the deal, which is expected to provide a competitive edge for UK manufacturers.</p>

          <p>China's dominance in the rare earth minerals market presents significant challenges for the United States and its allies, with 96% of rare earth minerals sourced from China. Despite efforts to diversify sources and revive domestic production, China's control over dysprosium and terbium, essential for high-temperature actuators, poses a major obstacle. Alternative sources in Australia, Ukraine, and Greenland face various challenges, and even if new projects are realized, competing with China's cost-competitive marketplace remains difficult. The article explores potential solutions such as tariffs and government subsidies, but emphasizes the need for technological advancements and improved processes to achieve competitiveness.</p>

          <p>Israel has claimed responsibility for killing an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general, coinciding with reports of missile attacks and explosions across Israel, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv, and Israeli state radio reported a "rain of missiles" from Iran targeting the country. The Israeli military lifted instructions for the population to remain in shelters after issuing warnings of ongoing attacks, and the Israeli police reported that missiles and shrapnel fell in the Tel Aviv area, causing material damage but no injuries. The situation remains tense as both sides exchange attacks and claims of responsibility.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong and Shanghai are set to strengthen their financial ties through a new agreement at the Lujiazui Forum, aiming to enhance collaboration and withstand geopolitical tensions. Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po will attend the signing of an action plan for collaborative development between the two cities, outlining a blueprint for cooperation in multiple areas. Speculation suggests that Shanghai and Hong Kong will expand the "connect" schemes for cross-border trading and initiate trials of financial derivative products involving foreign currencies and commodities. The agreement is expected to mark the most significant cooperation between the cities since the launch of the Stock Connect scheme in 2014.</p>

          <p>Fans attending the Club World Cup match at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, described the conditions as "dangerous" due to high heat, lack of water access, and tightly packed crowds. Attendees reported having to dispose of full water bottles before entering, long lines for water that was for sale, and overcrowded misting stations, with temperatures reaching at least 31C/88F in the stadium. The Rose Bowl typically allows sealed water bottles but did not for this event, and some fans expressed reluctance to attend future events, including the World Cup, due to the poorly managed experience. FIFA and the Rose Bowl Stadium organization have been approached for comment.</p>

          <p>A Russian missile and drone barrage in Kyiv resulted in at least 15 deaths and 75 injuries, including a U.S. citizen, marking one of the deadliest attacks on the Ukrainian capital in recent months. Local officials reported that the attack hollowed out a nine-story residential building and destroyed dozens of apartments, with emergency workers rescuing people from under the rubble. President Zelenskyy condemned the attacks as pure terrorism, and the attack occurred as world leaders convened at the Group of Seven meeting in Canada, where Zelenskyy was expected to meet with President Trump. The attack lasted nearly nine hours and is the latest in a series of mass drone and missile attacks on Kyiv.</p>

          <p>The Leipzig Bach Festival features contemporary arrangements of Johann Sebastian Bach's masterpieces that address oppression and conflict, including the "Queer Passion" and the "Arabian Passion." The "Queer Passion," with a new libretto by Thomas HÃ¶ft, focuses on the suffering of LGBTQ people, particularly in Russia and the USA, while the "Arabian Passion," arranged by Vladimir Ivanoff, promotes peace between the West and the East. This year's festival theme is "transformation," and it includes a digital concert featuring Bach as an avatar, and the Bach Archive is celebrating its 75th anniversary with a new collection of letters and writings from Bach's sons. The festival attracts visitors from over 50 countries and showcases Bach's works in their original venues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Europe has largely filled the gap in aid to Ukraine after the US stopped supplying new packages in January, with a few countries like the UK and the Nordics leading the surge. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy found that the monthly average amount of all aid to Ukraine increased by 2.4 billion euros in the first four months of 2025, compared to previous averages. The UK spent 4.5 billion euros on Ukraine, while the Nordics boosted their aid allocation to a combined 5.8 billion euros, resulting in Europe surpassing the US in total military aid. However, several of Europe's biggest economies barely increased their contributions, and there is no long-term plan outlined to continue supporting Ukraine.</p>

          <p>President Trump has requested funding from Congress for a "Golden Dome for America," a missile defense system inspired by Israel's Iron Dome. The Iron Dome is a network of interceptor missiles stationed across Israel, and the concept is to protect the United States from missile attacks. However, experts note that building a similar system in the U.S. would be significantly more complex due to America's size and the types of missiles that would be used in an attack. The scale of such a project would be vastly different from the Iron Dome, requiring a much more sophisticated and extensive system.</p>

However, Israel's attacks have disrupted these efforts, preventing a potential nuclear agreement between the US and Iran, and leaving the Iranian people no longer in control of their futures.</p>

Trump's options include bowing to Netanyahu's pressure and escalating the conflict, holding the course by reiterating that the US is not involved in Israel's attacks, or pulling back and listening to MAGA voices who reject traditional support for Israel. The domestic political factors playing on Trump's mind, particularly the views of his base, will likely influence his decision-making process as the conflict unfolds.</p>
