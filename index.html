        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has imposed sanctions on four International Criminal Court (ICC) judges in response to their decision to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. These sanctions include barring the judges from entering the U.S. and freezing any assets they may hold within the country. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the U.S. will take necessary actions to protect its sovereignty, Israel's sovereignty, and that of other U.S. allies from what it deems illegitimate actions by the ICC. Human Rights Watch has condemned the sanctions, arguing that they aim to deter the ICC from pursuing accountability for alleged war crimes during the Israeli campaign in Gaza, while also highlighting potential U.S. complicity.</p>

          <p>Zia Yusuf's resignation as Reform UK's chairman is significant due to his central role in the party's rise since the general election. Yusuf, a self-made millionaire, contributed financially and helped broaden the party's appeal by being a minority ethnic figurehead. He also played a key role in building the party's infrastructure, but his management style reportedly caused friction within the organization. His departure underscores the challenge Reform UK faces in hiring and retaining staff to build a sustainable, election-winning machine, as past leaders of Farage's parties have struggled with similar issues.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump and Elon Musk have entered into a public feud, with Trump threatening Musk's government contracts and Musk calling for Trump's impeachment and suggesting he appears in unreleased files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The conflict began over Musk's criticism of Trump's legislation, leading to a series of attacks on social media. Musk's actions could have political and personal consequences for Trump and the Republicans, including funding challengers and revealing potentially damaging information, though Trump has attempted to downplay the situation.

          <p>Chinese producers, burdened by overcapacity and weak domestic demand, are offering steep discounts on exports, creating a potential "China shock" for the global economy. While this influx of cheap goods could pressure local industries in other countries, it also offers a silver lining by lowering costs for consumers and easing inflationary pressures. Economists suggest this deflationary trend may provide central banks in inflation-worn economies some relief as they balance lowering living costs with reviving growth amidst rising trade tensions. This situation could pave the way for more rate cuts across Asia as central banks decouple from the Federal Reserve.</p>

          <p>Thomas Mann, a Nobel laureate and literary exile, is remembered as a cultural icon 150 years after his birth, his literary genius reflecting a life spent wandering between diverse worlds, especially after escaping Germany in the early 1930s. Mann's early works explored the struggles of artists and the decline of bourgeois society, while his later writings confronted the rise of Nazism and the German "catastrophe" that led to the Holocaust. He emigrated to the US in 1939 and broadcast radio speeches to Germany, urging resistance against the Nazi regime. With his literature and steadfastness, Mann set a courageous example and a legacy that remains.</p>

          <p>India's central bank has delivered a larger-than-expected 50 basis point cut to its benchmark policy rate, bringing it to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cited softening inflation and slower-than-expected growth amidst global uncertainty as reasons for the move. Despite better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, the central bank held its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%. Given the significant rate cut, the RBI indicated limited room for further monetary policy support and shifted its stance to "neutral" from "accommodative" (not investment advice).</p>

The university argues that the action is a vendetta and not in the interest of the United States, while making contingency plans to support its international students and scholars.

The report analyzes over 800 million job ads and company financial reports, revealing that AI is creating jobs and increasing wages in AI-exposed occupations. Productivity growth has nearly quadrupled in industries positioned to adopt AI, and wages for workers with AI skills are significantly higher. The report suggests that AI enriches automatable jobs by freeing employees for more complex tasks, and can help address workforce gaps in countries with declining working-age populations.</p>

The number of cases recorded as an "E72" (collapsed due to lost evidence) is increasing, with a higher proportion of prosecutions failing due to unavailable evidence each year.

          <p>President Trump's latest travel ban, restricting foreign nationals from 19 countries, has come as little surprise amid a barrage of draconian immigration restrictions during his second term. The administration has already suspended the asylum system, ended temporary legal residency for thousands, and moved to restrict student visas. Experts say this new ban is part of a broader effort to dismantle legal immigration, despite exemptions for certain groups. While the new ban may face legal challenges, it is likely to further separate families and disproportionately affect people seeking refuge, though the chaos isn't as widespread as in 2017.</p>
