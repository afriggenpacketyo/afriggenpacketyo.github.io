          <p>Ukraine reported the loss of an F-16 fighter jet and its pilot, Lt. Col. Maksym Ustimenko, during a massive overnight Russian assault involving over 500 drones and missiles. The pilot successfully downed seven targets before his aircraft was damaged, and he heroically steered the plane away from residential areas before crashing. The large-scale attack prompted neighboring Poland to scramble its own aircraft as a precaution. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy mourned the pilot's death and reiterated urgent calls for more air defense systems from Western partners to counter Russia's ongoing aggression.</p>

          <p>A recent Kyodo News telephone survey reveals that 50% of Japanese voters wish for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition to lose its majority in the upcoming House of Councillors election. The poll, conducted over the weekend, contrasts with the 38.1% of respondents who hope the Liberal Democratic Party and its Komeito party partner retain control. This sentiment indicates significant public dissatisfaction ahead of the crucial July 20 election. The results suggest a challenging political landscape for the current administration as it aims to maintain its legislative power.</p>

          <p>Confusion over airline regulations for smokeless nicotine products has been highlighted by a recent incident where a Delta passenger was instructed to spit out a Zyn pouch. While the TSA permits these products in both carry-on and checked luggage, individual airlines determine their own policies for in-flight use. Delta's contract of carriage explicitly prohibits all smokeless tobacco products, including pouches and gum, a rule that surprised many travelers. The event sparked a debate online, with many users noting the inconsistent enforcement and lack of clarity across different carriers regarding such items.</p>

          <p>Recent international summits have exposed Europe's perceived weakness and lack of unity on the global stage, undermining long-standing discussions about achieving geopolitical independence. This disarray comes at a critical time as the continent prepares for significant diplomatic engagement with China. The article suggests that internal divisions and a failure to meet commitments, such as NATO defense spending targets, have rendered Europe a less influential player. This situation creates a challenging backdrop for the upcoming summit, where Europe's ability to project a strong, cohesive front will be severely tested.</p>

Despite the clear victory, the match raises further questions about the caliber of Paul's opponents, as Chavez Jr. showed little of the form that once made him a middleweight champion.

          <p>A California court has found Samuel Woodward guilty of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement for the 2018 killing of his former classmate, 19-year-old Blaze Bernstein. Prosecutors successfully argued that Woodward, a member of the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division, targeted and stabbed Bernstein to death because he was gay and Jewish. The defense conceded Woodward killed Bernstein but claimed it was an impulsive act of manslaughter provoked by an unwanted sexual advance, an argument the jury rejected. Woodward now faces a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p>

          <p>France is leading a significant investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, positioning it as a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink, but industry experts question its ability to catch up. Eutelsat's OneWeb constellation of 650 low-Earth orbit satellites is vastly outnumbered by Starlink's 7,600, and analysts note that a massive increase in scale and technological upgrades would be required for parity. While the move is seen as a strategic push for Europe's technological sovereignty, Eutelsat is considered more likely to succeed in specialized government and enterprise sectors rather than the mass consumer market currently dominated by its U.S. rival.</p>

Once a heavily militarized front line, it is now a quiet community caught between two powerful political systems. The article suggests that despite its history as a symbol of Taiwanese deterrence, the island's current state reveals the practical limitations of influence for both Beijing and Taipei. It exists in a delicate balance, reflecting the complex and often contradictory dynamics of the broader regional conflict.</p>

          <p>A multi-vehicle collision on Interstate 15 south in San Diego caused a significant traffic shutdown on Saturday night after one car burst into flames. According to the California Highway Patrol, the crash involved at least four vehicles and occurred when one car rear-ended another that was traveling slowly with its hazard lights on. The impact sent one of the vehicles into a highway divider, where it caught fire. At least one person was transported to the hospital, and all southbound lanes were temporarily blocked to allow emergency services to manage the scene.</p>

          <p>In response to the perceived threat from Russia, five NATO countries bordering Russia or Belarus are withdrawing from the 1997 Ottawa Convention, which bans anti-personnel land mines. Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland plan to reintroduce mines as a defensive measure to secure their borders, a move that could create a new, explosive "Iron Curtain." This strategy is highly controversial due to the indiscriminate danger mines pose to civilians long after conflicts end. Advocacy groups have condemned the decision, arguing that lasting security cannot be built on such weapons.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated further progress in his return to the mound, pitching two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During the outing, he recorded the fastest pitch of his major league career, a four-seam fastball clocked at 101.7 mph. This was his third start since returning from elbow surgery, and he allowed one single and one walk while striking out one batter. Despite his solid pitching performance, Ohtani went hitless in four at-bats, and the Dodgers ultimately lost the game 9-5, snapping their five-game winning streak.</p>

          <p>New regulations banning smoking in many public outdoor areas across France went into effect on Sunday, aiming to protect children from secondhand smoke and move toward a "tobacco-free generation." The ban covers beaches, parks, bus shelters, and areas near schools and swimming pools, with violators facing fines up to â‚¬700. The rules, however, do not apply to the terraces of bars and restaurants or to e-cigarettes. Health officials hope the measure will help reduce the country's high smoking rate, where over 30% of adults still smoke.</p>

The article chronicles how the harassment escalated from online abuse to real-world threats, and how Hulme's initial complaints to both the police and the Diocese of Leicester were mishandled. The Bishop of Leicester, Martyn Snow, initially disbelieved Hulme and accused him of witchcraft, highlighting significant institutional failures.

          <p>After a dramatic, hours-long vote, Senate Republicans narrowly advanced President Trump's major domestic spending package, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill," over a key procedural hurdle. The 51-49 vote was secured only after four conservative holdouts, including Sen. Ron Johnson who flipped his vote at the last minute, agreed to advance the bill following negotiations over deficit reduction and Medicaid changes. This sets the stage for a final vote, but passage is not guaranteed as some Republicans remain non-committal. Democrats have vowed to delay the process by forcing a full reading of the nearly 1,000-page bill.</p>
