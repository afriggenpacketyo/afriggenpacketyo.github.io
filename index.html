          <p>The author presents a case against summer, challenging the conventional adoration for the season by arguing that it is overrated. The article claims that summer is excessively hot, boring due to a lack of events, and plagued by the unpleasant month of August. The author humorously suggests that summer's perceived allure is largely due to marketing by the "summer industrial complex," leading to inevitable disappointment. The author contrasts summer unfavorably with autumn and spring, highlighting the former's holidays and the latter's sense of renewal, ultimately concluding that lowering expectations is key to enjoying the season, while also advising the use of sunscreen. The article reflects a contrarian view on a universally loved topic.</p>

          <p>Marcel Ophuls, the German-born filmmaker renowned for his myth-shattering documentary "The Sorrow and the Pity," has died at 97. His most famous work exposed the uncomfortable truth about French collaboration with the Nazis during World War II, challenging the widely accepted narrative of widespread resistance. The documentary, initially banned from French television, interviewed ordinary citizens of Clermont-Ferrand, revealing their complex relationships with the Nazi occupation. Ophuls continued to direct impactful documentaries, including the Oscar-winning "HÃ´tel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie," further cementing his legacy as a fearless and incisive filmmaker.</p>

          <p>Jake Wood, the head of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), has resigned, stating that the organization cannot adhere to humanitarian principles while implementing its Israel-backed aid plan. The plan, supported by the US, involves private contractors delivering aid to Palestinians via Israel-designated distribution sites. Wood cited concerns over humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence as reasons for his departure, highlighting the UN's criticism that the plan would force further displacement and restrict aid access. Despite Wood's resignation, the GHF intends to begin delivering aid, aiming to reach one million Palestinians, while an Israeli official stated the goal is to eliminate the Gazan population's dependence on Hamas.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on China and a potential Republican budget bill are posing a threat to the burgeoning U.S. battery industry, which is crucial for meeting the rising energy demand and balancing renewable energy sources. The tariffs have already increased battery costs, causing some companies to halt imports from China, while the proposed legislation could restrict access to subsidies for battery production and installation. The article notes that companies like LG Energy Solution are investing in U.S. battery production, but uncertainty surrounding trade policy and tax credits is hindering further investment. Without batteries, utilities would need to invest more in expensive power plants and transmission lines to meet peak demand, increasing electricity prices. (not investment advice)</p>

Volvo Cars President and CEO HÃ¥kan Samuelsson stated that these difficult decisions are necessary to strengthen the company's resilience in a challenging automotive industry. The company also cited tariff pressure on the automotive sector as a factor in its decision to withdraw financial guidance for 2025 and 2026.</p>

          <p>An Israeli air strike on a school in Gaza City sheltering displaced families has resulted in at least 54 Palestinian deaths, according to hospital directors. The Fahmi Al-Jargawi School, housing hundreds from Beit Lahia, was struck overnight, with reports indicating that many victims, including children, were severely burned. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed the strike targeted a Hamas and Islamic Jihad command and control center, accusing Hamas of using civilians as human shields. This incident is part of an escalated Israeli offensive in northern Gaza, with the IDF reporting 200 targets hit in 48 hours, while international organizations are expressing concern over the rising civilian death toll.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly attack on Hindu tourists in Kashmir, India has initiated a diplomatic offensive, sending delegations to 33 countries to garner support for its "zero tolerance" policy on terrorism. The delegations are equipped with dossiers detailing Pakistan's alleged involvement in fostering terrorism and linking the April attack to Pakistan-based militant groups. While Pakistan denies any involvement, India seeks to present its strikes on Pakistan as legitimate acts of self-defense under international law. Policy experts suggest this diplomatic push aims to counter Pakistan's narrative and reinforce India's position on fighting terrorism, highlighting the ongoing tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Russia has escalated its attacks on Ukrainian cities, taking advantage of the United States' apparent pullback from diplomatic efforts and military assistance. Recent barrages of drones and missiles have caused numerous civilian casualties, prompting President Trump to criticize Vladimir Putin while also faulting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for "provocative words." Analysts suggest that Russia perceives an opportunity as the U.S. reduces its involvement in the conflict, leading to a more aggressive approach. While the Kremlin expressed gratitude for Trump's efforts to facilitate negotiations, the lack of new U.S. military aid raises concerns about Ukraine's ability to defend itself against the intensified Russian attacks.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is employing a strategy of "legalistic noncompliance" to seemingly adhere to court orders while effectively defying them, according to a recent survey. This involves using weak legal arguments to justify actions that contradict the spirit and intent of judicial rulings. Examples include the Alien Enemies Act litigation, where the administration argued that landing planes in El Salvador did not constitute "removing" individuals, and the Kilmar Abrego Garcia case, where they claimed they had no control over someone in foreign custody despite Trump's ability to intervene. By advancing these arguments, the administration aims to undermine judicial oversight and potentially influence courts to legalize partial noncompliance.</p>

The article also notes the resignation of the head of a US-backed Gaza aid group, citing an inability to adhere to humanitarian principles, and a delay in Trump's threatened tariffs on the European Union.</p>

          <p>Market analysts are cautioning investors to prepare for further volatility despite President Trump's decision to delay imposing tariffs on the European Union until July 9. While the delay has sparked a tentative rally, uncertainties surrounding trade negotiations remain, and the potential for a trade war has not completely dissipated. Experts suggest that the six-week window may not be sufficient to resolve all detailed questions, and the outcome depends on the political will of the U.S. government. The article highlights the EU's capacity to retaliate should significant tariffs be levied, emphasizing the need for continued vigilance in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

Chelsea finished fourth and are looking forward to a Europa Conference League final against Real Betis, however, they need a better goalkeeper and a reliable goalscorer.</p>

          <p>Senior figures in British business report a "chilling effect" on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, with companies "rebranding" these efforts to avoid political scrutiny. This comes as DEI initiatives face a right-wing backlash on both sides of the Atlantic, prompting organizations to reframe policies under terms like "wellbeing," "belonging," and "culture." Experts note that while a full-scale rollback is unlikely in the UK due to the Equalities Act, some US-headquartered firms are scaling back commitments and avoiding public celebration of inclusion work. The trend reflects a growing sensitivity to political pressure and a desire to maintain business operations amid a polarized environment.</p>

          <p>The United States is facing another summer of extreme heat, with forecasts indicating that this year's months will be among the hottest on record. This is amid growing concerns over the impacts of Trump administration cuts to key agencies responsible for forecasting, science, and disaster response. The cuts have led to understaffing and reduced services at federal science agencies, potentially hampering efforts to keep people safe. Experts warn that extreme heat can have cascading impacts throughout society, affecting sleep, mental health, and cognitive function, with the burden disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that the Islamic State (IS) is leveraging the Trump administration's policies and rhetoric for recruitment purposes. IS is capitalizing on Trump's dismantling of the international order, his affinity for Benjamin Netanyahu's government in Israel, and the appointment of Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense. Hegseth's tattoos, which reference medieval crusaders, have been used in IS propaganda to portray the US as a "crusader" state.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the challenges posed by the current administration, America's democracy demonstrates resilience due to several key factors, according to this article. These factors include a robust network of advocacy groups, a powerful and independent judiciary, a constitutional system resistant to rapid change, a diverse and free private press, a federal system of government, and a strong commitment to free speech. The author argues that these elements distinguish the United States from countries where democracy has recently declined, and they provide a foundation for defending American values and institutions. While acknowledging the harm caused by recent actions, the article expresses hope in the enduring strength of America's democratic framework.</p>

Drawing on the concept of "Agua es vida" and the work of writers like Robert Macfarlane and Amitav Ghosh, the author suggests that the climate crisis is not just a problem of emissions but also of the human imagination. The piece highlights the Rights of Nature movement, where countries are enshrining legal protections for natural entities, and emphasizes the importance of time, attention, and humility in understanding our interconnectedness with the environment. By animating the world through language and observation, we can foster a deeper sense of responsibility and connection to the planet.</p>

While the US has Memorial Day to honor fallen soldiers, there are few monuments to the civilians who often bear the brunt of conflict. The author emphasizes that recognizing civilian deaths shows war for what it is: a waste, and can help us appreciate the decline of war as one of humanity's great accomplishments.

          <p>In the five years since the anti-police protests following George Floyd's death, initiatives focused on officer mental health have gained momentum. The protests exacerbated the already poor mental health of officers, bringing the issue to greater public attention and contributing to resignations and burnout. Research shows that police officers are more likely to suffer from cardiac death at a younger age and experience higher rates of depression, PTSD, and substance abuse. States are implementing wellness units, mandated training, and peer support programs to address these challenges, and agencies are creating dedicated wellness rooms for their officers.</p>
