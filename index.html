          <p>Recent mass layoffs at the U.S. State Department have reportedly caused significant confusion and disruption, potentially compromising national security. Sources indicate the cuts, part of a Trump administration reorganization effort, were executed chaotically, with some managers unaware of which staff were dismissed. Key offices, including the one assisting families of employees who die overseas, were unexpectedly eliminated, leaving critical functions unstaffed. The move has been described by current and former officials as poorly planned and damaging to U.S. diplomatic capabilities and morale.</p>

          <p>A package of cryptocurrency regulation bills has moved forward in the U.S. House of Representatives following a record-long, two-day stalemate. The delay was caused by opposition from both conservative and moderate Republicans, raising doubts about the party's ability to unify on a final legislative framework for the crypto industry. Despite late-night negotiations and an intervention from President Trump, the struggle to pass the procedural vote highlighted deep divisions. The outcome of these bills, which address market structure and a potential central bank digital currency, remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>An Emirates flight from Dubai was forced to divert to Taiwan after multiple failed landing attempts in Hong Kong. The Boeing 777, flight EK382, circled over the city before redirecting to Kaohsiung International Airport, where passengers and crew stayed overnight. Flight data indicated at least two unsuccessful landing approaches were made before the diversion was initiated. While not officially confirmed, observers cited by aviation media suggest that challenging weather conditions, including strong winds, may have been a contributing factor in the incident.</p>

          <p>Israel has conducted airstrikes against Syrian military targets in Damascus and southern Syria in response to deadly sectarian clashes in the Suweida province. The violence, which has reportedly killed over 300 people, involves Druze militias and Bedouin tribes, prompting Israeli intervention to protect the Druze community. The U.S. has engaged diplomatically, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio announcing that specific steps were agreed upon to de-escalate the crisis. The Syrian government has begun withdrawing troops from the area as part of a tentative agreement.</p>

          <p>Japanese retail giant Seven & i Holdings saw its stock price plummet by over 7% after Canadian convenience store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard withdrew its $47 billion acquisition offer. Couche-Tard cited a "persistent lack of good faith engagement" from Seven & i's leadership as the reason for terminating the talks. Seven & i, which operates 7-Eleven, expressed disappointment and disputed the Canadian firm's characterization of the negotiations. Analysts suggest that Japanese protectionism and the company's strategic importance to national security made the foreign takeover highly unlikely from the start.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports contracted for a second consecutive month in June, falling 0.5% year-over-year and intensifying fears of a technical recession. The decline was driven by sharp drops in shipments to major partners, with exports to the U.S. falling 11.4% and to China by 4.7%. The data comes as Japan faces a 25% U.S. tariff set to take effect August 1, with no trade deal in sight. Analysts note that Japanese automakers appear to be absorbing the tariff costs to maintain market share, which could further strain the export-dependent economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new official photograph of Queen Camilla has been released to commemorate her 78th birthday. The picture, taken by photographer Chris Jackson, shows the Queen smiling at her private home in Wiltshire. Dressed in a turquoise outfit, she is pictured leaning against a gate in a field. Unlike last year, when her birthday coincided with the State Opening of Parliament, she is expected to celebrate the day privately. The release follows a busy period of public engagements for the Queen and King Charles, who is still undergoing treatment for cancer.</p>

          <p>A new initiative in Nevada is exploring the use of second-life electric vehicle batteries to power energy-intensive AI data centers. Companies like Crusoe and Redwood Materials are creating large-scale energy storage systems by linking together used EV batteries that, while no longer suitable for cars, still retain significant capacity. This approach aims to provide a reliable, renewable power source for the rapidly growing AI industry, which is projected to consume a much larger share of the nation's electricity. The system offers a sustainable alternative to building new gas-fired power plants.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has sharply criticized President Trump's immigration policies, labeling them a "rule of cruelty" designed to terrorize families rather than target violent criminals. His comments followed the Pentagon's decision to withdraw half of the National Guard troops deployed in Los Angeles for immigration enforcement. Newsom argued the deployment was a costly political stunt to appear "tough" and that the troops were largely underutilized. He also repeated a threat to redraw California's congressional maps to favor Democrats if Republicans pursue similar efforts in other states.</p>

          <p>Recent federal immigration raids on workplaces are exposing significant flaws in the E-Verify system, which over a million employers use to confirm hiring eligibility. One Nebraska business owner who used the system in good faith saw over 70 of his employees arrested, with officials stating his business was a victim of large-scale identity theft. Experts argue that E-Verify is easy to fool because it vets documents, not people, allowing fraudulent identities to pass. This creates a "wink-and-nod" system that penalizes compliant employers while failing to stop the use of stolen identities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has passed a bipartisan bill aimed at preventing thousands of veterans from losing their homes to foreclosure. The legislation addresses a gap created when the Department of Veterans Affairs ended a pandemic-era assistance program without a replacement, leaving many veterans with unaffordable options. The new law will allow veterans who have fallen behind on their mortgages to move missed payments to the end of their loan term, making their accounts current. This fix, long sought by housing advocates, provides veterans a crucial safety net available to most other homeowners.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan coalition of 20 states has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for terminating a key federal program for natural disaster mitigation. The suit targets the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA for illegally shutting down the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The states argue that the executive branch overstepped its authority, as the power to end a program funded by Congress lies with the legislature. The lawsuit claims the cuts jeopardize hundreds of critical infrastructure projects and leave communities at a higher risk from natural disasters.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's rationale for clawing back nearly $8 billion in foreign aid is facing scrutiny, as officials and experts question the claims of widespread "waste, fraud and abuse." The administration has provided little public evidence to support its allegations, which were used to justify terminating thousands of USAID programs. Former and current officials report that the review process was a superficial search for politically charged keywords like "gender" or "climate," rather than a thorough investigation into program effectiveness. This has led to accusations that the cuts are politically motivated and not based on evidence.</p>

According to a Wall Street Journal report citing sources familiar with the probe, the cockpit voice recorder captured the first officer asking the captain why he had moved the fuel switches to the "cutoff" position moments after takeoff. This action would have starved the engines of fuel, leading to a loss of thrust. The preliminary report confirmed the switches were moved but did not assign blame, leaving open the question of whether it was intentional or accidental.</p>
