          <p>Executives from Amazon and Nvidia have stated that the demand for artificial intelligence data centers remains robust, despite growing fears of a potential recession. Amazon's VP of global data centers, Kevin Miller, dismissed concerns about paused data center leases, while Nvidia's senior director of corporate sustainability, Josh Parker, indicated that compute and energy demands are only rising due to AI. Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark estimates that 50 gigawatts of new power capacity will be needed by 2027 to support AI, underscoring the substantial growth expected in the AI sector.</p>

          <p>Maurine Gentis, a retired teacher who relies on Meals on Wheels South Texas, is concerned about the Trump administration's dismantling of the government agency overseeing such programs. The administration's overhaul of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has led to layoffs and office closures, raising fears that essential services for people with disabilities and the aging will be severely impacted. Gentis worries that the entire program might collapse, leaving vulnerable individuals without crucial support. President Trump's executive orders are also flagging words like “accessible” and “disability” as potentially problematic, further jeopardizing these programs.</p>

          <p>Robert Crimo III, the perpetrator of the 2022 mass shooting in Highland Park, Illinois, has been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Crimo, who killed seven people and injured dozens more, did not appear in court for his sentencing.

          <p>Alphabet, Google's parent company, is scheduled to release its first-quarter earnings, with analysts anticipating a 10% year-over-year revenue increase. The company faces intensifying competition in the artificial intelligence sector from companies like OpenAI and DeepSeek, as well as potential impacts from President Trump's tariffs on advertiser spending. Google recently unveiled Gemini 2.5 and Gemma 3, its latest AI models, and is also navigating antitrust scrutiny after a federal judge ruled that it holds illegal monopolies in online advertising markets. The company's Waymo unit continues to expand its robotaxi services, and Alphabet agreed to acquire Wiz for $32 billion to enhance its cloud security offerings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed that the seemingly innocuous act of adding polite phrases like "Please" and "Thank you" to chatbot prompts actually incurs significant costs in electricity and server usage. Every interaction with a chatbot costs money and energy, with each additional word increasing the expense. While the exact financial impact is substantial, Altman suggests that the cost is worthwhile, implying that user experience and the perception of AI are valuable considerations. This highlights the complex interplay between technology, user behavior, and resource consumption in the age of artificial intelligence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is seeking Supreme Court approval to enforce his administration's policy prohibiting transgender individuals from serving in the military, while legal challenges continue. The request follows a federal appeals court decision that blocked the ban nationwide, which the administration argues improperly sets policy. Trump's executive order cites concerns about troop readiness, lethality, and cohesion, claiming that transgender identity is inconsistent with military values. The Justice Department argues that the policy classifies based on gender dysphoria, a medical condition, rather than transgender status, warranting judicial deference.</p>

          <p>Billy McFarland, the founder of the infamous Fyre Festival, has announced that he is selling the brand, including its trademarks, intellectual property, and digital assets. McFarland stated that the brand has outgrown his ability to lead it and needs a team with greater resources to reach its full potential. The sale includes a Caribbean Festival Location ready to host Fyre Festival 2, confirming that the repeatedly postponed sequel will not take place as planned. McFarland says this move is the most responsible way to build a global entertainment brand and continue to pay restitution to those who are owed from the first festival.</p>

          <p>U.S. spirit exports hit a record $2.4 billion in 2024, primarily driven by concerns over tariffs and ongoing global trade disputes. The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS) reports that exports to the EU surged by 39% due to fears of a potential return of a 50% tariff on American whiskey imports in 2025. Trump's threats to impose tariffs on French Champagne and other EU spirits have also influenced trade dynamics. While the threat of these tariffs has somewhat diminished due to ongoing negotiations, trade disputes continue to create uncertainty in the sector.</p>
