          <p>Tesla's board has awarded CEO Elon Musk a substantial new stock package valued at approximately $29 billion, despite a Delaware court previously invalidating a similar 2018 plan. This move is seen by some analysts as an effort to secure Musk's leadership until at least 2030 and alleviate shareholder concerns amid the company's declining stock price and profits. The award comes as Tesla faces intensified competition and investor worries over Musk's political engagements and focus on other ventures. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite this, analysts predict Nvidia's market share in China will shrink as local competitors like Huawei rise, a trend fueled by U.S. export controls. The situation is complicated by new security scrutiny from Beijing, which questioned Nvidia about potential chip backdoors, signaling a preference for homegrown technology.

          <p>A new report in The Lancet medical journal describes plastic pollution as a "grave, growing and under-recognized danger," costing the world at least $1.5 trillion annually in health-related economic losses. The review highlights consistent evidence linking plastic chemicals to numerous health issues across all life stages, including impaired reproduction, cognitive decline, and increased risk of chronic diseases like cancer and diabetes. With global plastic production projected to triple by 2060, the report's authors are urging international delegates to agree on a global treaty to mitigate this escalating crisis.</p>

          <p>Approximately 3,200 workers at Boeing's defense unit have gone on strike for the first time since 1996 after rejecting the company's latest contract proposal. The union, representing employees who assemble F-15 fighter jets and missile systems, stated that the offer did not adequately reflect the workers' skill and dedication. This labor action follows a larger strike by Boeing's commercial aircraft machinists last year and occurs despite the company's CEO downplaying the potential impact of a work stoppage on the defense unit's operations.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has sparked a significant online debate with a musical advertisement that satirically portrays the U.K. as plagued by economic problems like high prices and job losses. The ad, titled "Everything is Fine," was praised by some in the fintech and venture capital communities for its critique but drew criticism from others for being self-promotional and misleading. The controversy highlights ongoing tensions between the crypto industry and traditional financial systems, with figures like former Chancellor George Osborne weighing in on Britain's need to embrace crypto innovation.</p>

          <p>A third child, 10-year-old Arielle Buchman, has died from injuries sustained nearly a week after a barge collided with and sank a sailboat in Miami's Biscayne Bay. The sailboat was part of a local sailing camp, and the incident had previously claimed the lives of a 7-year-old and a 13-year-old girl.

          <p>Millions of UK consumers who purchased a car using financing over the last 18 years may be eligible for compensation due to hidden commissions. A recent Supreme Court ruling found that some dealers charged excessive fees or failed to properly disclose them, establishing a precedent for mis-selling claims. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is developing a compensation scheme, with the first payments expected in 2026. For now, consumers are advised to wait for the official scheme rather than using claims companies, which charge a fee for their services.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to fill two major economic positions following the surprise resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler and his firing of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. The move to replace McEntarfer came after a disappointing jobs report and has sparked widespread criticism over fears of politicizing crucial economic data. The Fed appointment is also significant, as it gives Trump an opportunity to install a nominee who aligns with his policy of lowering interest rates, potentially reshaping the central bank's direction.

          <h2>Republican Senators Propose Legislation to Extend Benefits to Gig Workers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican senators have introduced legislation aimed at allowing companies to offer benefits like health insurance and retirement savings to independent contractors without risking worker misclassification lawsuits. The proposal seeks to create "portable benefits" for the large and growing gig workforce, but it is less robust than earlier progressive versions and faces strong opposition from labor unions. Unions argue the move is an employer-friendly way to legitimize worker misclassification, cutting workers off from core protections like minimum wage and the right to unionize, while supporters see it as a necessary update for the modern economy.</p>

          <p>Officials in Soap Lake, Washington, temporarily closed a local dog park after a moose entered the fenced area, prompting a warning for residents to stay away. The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife advised that moose can be defensive and view dogs as threats, sometimes going out of their way to attack them. The incident is part of a broader trend of increasing human-wildlife interactions, often driven by habitat loss and resource scarcity due to climate change. Such encounters pose risks to both animals and humans, highlighting the need for better urban planning and habitat protection.</p>

          <p>An article in The Guardian reports that numerous Latino cultural festivals and events across the United States have been canceled or postponed due to widespread fear of indiscriminate raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Organizers from Kansas City to Los Angeles have made the difficult decision to halt long-standing celebrations to protect their communities from potential targeting. While some events have implemented enhanced security plans to proceed, the climate of fear created by the Trump administration's expansionist immigration policies is forcing a painful choice between cultural expression and community safety.</p>

          <p>India's information technology sector, a major engine of economic growth, is experiencing significant job cuts, raising concerns about the industry's future. While slowing global demand is a factor, analysts point to the growing influence of artificial intelligence in automating tasks and reshaping roles, potentially displacing workers. Major companies like Tata Consultancy Services have announced thousands of layoffs, adding to a strained labor market and prompting calls for India to accelerate workforce upskilling and pivot to higher value-added services to remain competitive.

          <p>Dan Osborn, a union leader and industrial mechanic, is running as an independent for a U.S. Senate seat in Nebraska, challenging Republican incumbent Pete Ricketts. After a surprisingly strong performance in a 2024 race, Osborn is campaigning on a working-class platform, contrasting his life experience with that of the wealthy Ricketts. While Nebraska is a solidly Republican state, Osborn hopes to appeal to voters across the political spectrum who are frustrated with the two-party system. His campaign has prompted political forecasters to watch the race more closely.</p>

          <p>Legal scholars and former prosecutors are expressing alarm that the Department of Justice is being transformed into a political tool for President Trump. This concern follows the ousting of dozens of lawyers who worked on cases involving Trump and his allies, and the launch of new investigations into his political rivals, such as a "strike force" to probe unsubstantiated claims against the Obama administration. Critics argue that these actions, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, undermine the rule of law and prioritize personal loyalty to Trump over constitutional duties, creating a culture of fear within the department.</p>

          <p>A new survey of American children aged 8 to 12 reveals a strong preference for unstructured, in-person play with friends over online socialization or adult-organized activities. However, the study also shows that most children are heavily restricted in their real-world freedoms, with many not allowed to play unsupervised even in their own yards. The authors argue that this lack of independence, driven by parental fears, pushes kids toward their phones as the only space for unsupervised social interaction. They advocate for restoring free play to improve children's mental health and development.</p>

The policy was enacted after officials were barred from the Aspen Security Forum, an event the administration deemed hostile to its values. The author warns that by cutting off engagement with outside thinkers and diverse viewpoints, the military risks groupthink and undermines the strategic thinking necessary for national security, making U.S. forces more like their insular Russian and Chinese counterparts.</p>
