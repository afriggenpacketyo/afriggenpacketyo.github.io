          <p>New research confirms the real-world success of landmark 2015 medical advice that recommended introducing peanut products to infants as early as four months old. The study, published in Pediatrics, analyzed health records and found this guidance has prevented approximately 60,000 children from developing life-threatening peanut allergies. This marks a significant public health achievement, reversing decades of previous advice that had called for delaying the introduction of potential allergens. The findings provide strong evidence that early exposure is an effective preventative strategy.</p>

          <p>France's justice minister stated that a major jewelry heist at the Louvre Museum has created a "terrible image" of the country, highlighting a significant security failure. Thieves stole priceless items, including a necklace Napoleon gave to his wife, in a brazen daylight robbery. Experts have expressed concern that the historically significant jewels will be quickly broken up, with the precious metals melted down and gemstones recut, making recovery nearly impossible. The incident has prompted widespread anger and questions about the security of France's most cherished cultural institutions.</p>

          <p>The fragile ceasefire in Gaza faced a significant challenge as Israeli forces launched retaliatory strikes after two of its soldiers were killed, resulting in at least 38 Palestinian deaths. Despite the deadly exchange, both Israeli officials and Hamas have publicly reaffirmed their commitment to upholding the truce agreement. U.S. President Donald Trump also stated that the ceasefire remains intact, attributing the violation to internal rebel factions rather than Hamas leadership. The incident has, however, led to a temporary halt in aid deliveries to the territory.</p>

A lower court judge had previously ruled that her appointment was unlawful, a decision that could potentially void all actions she has taken since July. The Justice Department is appealing that ruling, arguing that her appointment is valid under federal statute, in a case that has drawn scrutiny due to Habba's prior role as a lawyer for President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>In a meticulously planned robbery, thieves disguised as construction workers used a mobile freight elevator to access a second-floor gallery of the Louvre Museum. They broke through a window and smashed display cases to steal at least nine pieces of jewelry with "inestimable" historical value, including items that once belonged to Emperor Napoleon. The entire heist was completed in approximately seven minutes before the perpetrators escaped on motorcycles, prompting a massive investigation and the temporary closure of the world-famous museum.</p>

          <p>In remarks to the International Monetary Fund, UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has explicitly linked the country's economic struggles to the 2020 Brexit deal. She stated that the UK's long-standing productivity challenge has been "compounded by the way in which the UK left the European Union." This represents a notable shift in the government's public stance, as it openly acknowledges the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecast that Brexit will cause a 4% long-term reduction in the UK's economic potential.</p>

          <p>China's economy grew by 4.8% in the third quarter, aligning with analysts' expectations but slowing from the previous quarter amid a persistent real estate slump. A more concerning sign was the unexpected 0.5% contraction in fixed-asset investment for the first nine months of the year, a development one economist called "rare and alarming." This weakness, especially in the private sector, reflects a lack of confidence and suggests downward pressure on future GDP growth. (not investment advice)</p>

This protein, which is also found in humans, appears to be particularly effective in the rodents, which can live up to 37 years.
