          <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune stated he offered Democrats a procedural vote on extending Affordable Care Act subsidies in an attempt to break the government shutdown stalemate. However, he clarified he could not guarantee the outcome of such a vote and that substantive negotiations would only begin after the government reopens. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer disputed that a formal proposal was ever made, highlighting the deep divisions preventing a resolution. As the shutdown entered its 16th day, both sides remained entrenched, with Democrats demanding healthcare fixes as a precondition for their support on government funding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Debt settlement programs can offer relief by negotiating unsecured debts like credit card balances for less than the full amount owed, but many types of debt do not qualify. Generally, debts backed by government authority or secured by collateral are excluded from these programs. This includes secured loans like mortgages and auto loans, where lenders can repossess the asset, as well as federal student loans, which have their own specific relief options. Tax debts, court-ordered payments like child support and alimony, and legal judgments are also typically ineligible for negotiation through standard debt settlement companies.</p>

          <p>President Trump has revealed plans for a large, classically styled arch to be built in Washington, D.C., to commemorate the United States' 250th anniversary in 2026. Renderings show a monument similar to Paris's Arc de Triomphe, which would be located in a traffic circle near the Lincoln Memorial. When asked who the arch would be for, the president reportedly replied, "Me." The proposal was showcased with models at a fundraising dinner, but the design and approval process, which typically involves the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, is currently stalled due to the ongoing government shutdown.</p>

          <p>In a significant display of military presence, three U.S. Air Force B-52 bombers flew near the coast of Venezuela on Wednesday. The long-range, heavy bombers, which are capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear weapons, departed from Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana for the mission. This action is being interpreted as a deliberate show of force by the Trump administration amid ongoing tensions with the South American nation. The flight was tracked publicly, indicating the overt nature of the military signal being sent to the Venezuelan government and its allies.</p>

          <p>Shares of regional banks, including Zions Bancorporation and Western Alliance, along with investment bank Jefferies, experienced significant declines due to growing fears about bad loans. The concerns were sparked by recent bankruptcies in the auto industry and specific disclosures from Zions about a large loan charge-off and a fraud allegation from Western Alliance. This has led to investor anxiety about a potential "cockroach" problem, where one issue suggests more are hidden, particularly within the opaque private credit market. The sell-off highlights market sensitivity to credit quality issues, even as some analysts suggest the overall industry remains stable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Republican mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa is under no obligation to drop out of the New York City race to help former Governor Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent, defeat socialist Democrat Zohran Mamdani. The author contends that the Democratic Party created its own crisis by implementing voting rules that favored the far-left and failing to rally behind a more moderate candidate. The piece criticizes Cuomo's own progressive record as governor, questioning his credentials as a moderate savior. It concludes that forcing Sliwa to sacrifice his campaign would allow the Democratic establishment to avoid confronting its leftward drift.</p>

This sentiment echoes a similar warning from Delta's CEO and raises concerns about the broader economic consequences of the funding impasse.

The report suggests that companies will absorb only about one-third of this financial burden, with the remaining two-thirds being passed on to consumers through higher prices. These costs stem from direct tariffs, which act as taxes on supply chains, as well as indirect expenses from logistics delays and increased freight charges.

F5 stated that the hackers were in its network for at least a year using malware known as Brickstorm, which is designed for long-term, stealthy access. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California and a coalition of nearly two dozen other states are suing the Trump administration over the cancellation of the $7 billion "Solar for All" grant program. The lawsuit alleges the Environmental Protection Agency unlawfully terminated the program, which was designed to help over 900,000 low-income households install solar panels. The EPA administrator defended the cancellation, calling the program a "boondoggle" and a "grift." The plaintiffs argue the move is a breach of contract, as the funds were already obligated by Congress, and that it illegally hampers progress on clean energy adoption and energy bill relief for working families.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice is reportedly preparing to present a criminal case against former National Security Advisor John Bolton to a federal grand jury in Maryland. This move follows an FBI search of Bolton's home and office in August as part of an investigation into his handling of classified documents. Court papers revealed that agents discovered numerous classified records during the searches. Bolton, who became a prominent critic of President Trump after leaving the administration, has previously denied any wrongdoing regarding his possession of sensitive materials or the publication of his memoir, "The Room Where It Happened."</p>

          <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune announced his intention to move forward with a bipartisan bill to impose new economic sanctions on Russia, stating that "the time has come." The push for a vote gained new urgency following President Trump's recent phone call with Vladimir Putin and a planned meeting between the two leaders. The legislation, which has broad support with 85 co-sponsors, aims to increase pressure on Russia to end its war in Ukraine by imposing heavy tariffs on countries that purchase Russian energy exports. The bill includes a provision allowing the president to waive the sanctions for national security reasons.</p>

Speaking to the London Assembly, he described the uncovered behavior as "vile and shocking" and stated the Met is undergoing the "biggest clear-out" in its history, having already removed over 1,500 officers since 2022. While acknowledging the profound negative impact on public trust, especially for victims of sexual assault, he resisted labeling the force as institutionally racist or sexist, instead focusing on systemic issues causing bias.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's request for U.S.-made Tomahawk cruise missiles is driven by the weapon's strategic capabilities, which could significantly alter the dynamics of the war with Russia. The Tomahawk is a long-range, high-accuracy subsonic missile capable of flying at very low altitudes to evade radar detection, making it difficult for Russian air defense systems to intercept. With a range of up to 1,600 kilometers, these missiles would allow Ukraine to strike key military and industrial targets deep inside Russian territory. While the potential supply of Tomahawks is seen as a major escalation by Moscow, it could also serve as powerful leverage to push Russia toward peace negotiations.</p>

Kennedy Jr. Polis has supported MAHA-aligned policies, such as banning soda purchases with food stamps, framing it as an issue of freedom and fiscal responsibility. However, he has also created distance from Kennedy's more controversial anti-vaccine stances, recently signing an order to ensure vaccine access in Colorado and joining a public-health alliance to counter the HHS secretary. This positions Polis as a unique political figure, selectively aligning with a populist health agenda while rejecting its most extreme elements.</p>

          <p>Guillermo del Toro's new film "Frankenstein" is being praised as a career-best work that reinterprets the classic horror story as a modern allegory for the arrogance of today's tech industry. The review highlights Oscar Isaac's portrayal of Victor Frankenstein as a short-sighted egomaniac, enabled by a venture capitalist-like character played by Christoph Waltz. Jacob Elordi's Creature is depicted not as a monster, but as a tragic figure whose creation reflects the inventor's vanity. The film faithfully adapts the novel's 19th-century setting but infuses it with a contemporary warning about the dangers of unchecked innovation and the creators who are more dangerous than their creations.</p>
