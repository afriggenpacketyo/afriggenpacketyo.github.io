          <p>Amazon's Zoox unit issued a software recall for 270 robotaxis following an April crash in Las Vegas. The recall addresses a defect in the automated driving system that could misjudge other cars' movements, increasing crash risks. Zoox paused operations after the incident but has since resumed after implementing a software update across its fleet, including purpose-built robotaxis and test vehicles. The company stated the root cause was identified through analysis and rigorous testing, emphasizing the updated software's widespread implementation.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to maintain its benchmark interest rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5% at its May meeting, despite pressure from President Trump for a rate cut. The decision comes amid mixed economic signals, including a negative GDP in the first quarter but strong job growth in April. Economists predict the Fed will likely adopt a wait-and-see approach, closely monitoring the impact of tariffs and other administration policies. Borrowers seeking relief on loan and credit card rates are likely to face a wait, with experts predicting potential rate increases in the coming months.</p>

          <p>The FDA has selected Dr. Vinay Prasad, a known critic of COVID-19 vaccine boosters, to head its center for vaccine approvals, a move that has garnered attention due to Prasad's outspoken views on the agency's past decisions. Prasad has criticized the FDA for granting emergency use authorization for COVID-19 vaccine boosters, and has also questioned the need for COVID vaccinations in young children. His appointment comes as the FDA is considering annual updates to COVID-19 vaccines and may require new randomized trials before approving future updates.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has appointed Dr. Vinay Prasad, a vocal critic of COVID-19 vaccine boosters, as the new head of its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). This decision comes as the FDA considers annual updates to COVID-19 vaccines and potentially requiring new randomized trials before approving future shots. Prasad has previously criticized the FDA's emergency use authorizations and expressed concerns about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccinations, particularly for young children, and has even stated that without trials, it is only a matter of time before the FDA approves a vaccine that causes some bad outcome like vaccine-induced narcolepsy.</p>

          <p>Demand for the U.S. automaker’s vehicles slid amid stronger competition from Europe and China and rising anger at Elon Musk’s political forays.\nTesla sales in Germany and Britain fell to their lowest point in more than two years in April, cementing a wider trend of Europeans shunning the U.S. automaker, despite growing demand for battery-powered vehicles in Europe.\nRegistrations of new Tesla vehicles dropped nearly 46 percent in Germany and 62 percent in Britain from a year earlier, although both countries reported increases in the number of electric vehicles sold in the same period, according to statistics released on Tuesday.</p>

          <p>Tesla's vehicle sales in Germany and Britain experienced a significant drop in April, reaching their lowest levels in over two years, reflecting a broader trend of declining European demand despite overall growth in electric vehicle sales. Some experts attribute this decline to the delayed rollout of the new Model Y, while others point to backlash against President Trump's tariffs and controversy surrounding Elon Musk's political views. In contrast, Chinese-made electric vehicles are gaining popularity in Europe, signaling a potential shift in the market.</p>

          <p>Elite law firms are increasingly declining pro bono work on lawsuits challenging the Trump administration's policies, fearing the president's wrath.

The shift has left public interest groups struggling to find legal support for immigration cases, as firms prioritize avoiding potential business repercussions over defending immigrants' rights. The White House has stated that these firms are conducting “harmful activity through their powerful pro bono practices.”</p>
