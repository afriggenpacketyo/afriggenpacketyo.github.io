          <p>Lando Norris secured a dramatic victory in the Miami Grand Prix sprint race, capitalizing on a safety car deployment during his pit stop for slick tires. Oscar Piastri initially led the race after overtaking Kimi Antonelli, but the safety car, triggered by a collision between Fernando Alonso and Liam Lawson, shuffled the order. Max Verstappen, who finished fourth, received a 10-second penalty for an unsafe pit release, dropping him to 17th, further adding to the race's chaotic nature and benefiting Lewis Hamilton. The incident proved costly for Antonelli, hindering his pit stop and impacting his final position in the race.</p>

          <p>Mali's military junta is planning to extend its rule for another five years without elections, with General Assimi Goita seeking to be declared president until 2030. This move follows a "national conference" boycotted by the opposition, which also proposed limiting the number of political parties and tightening conditions for founding new ones. Critics, including Amnesty International, condemn these measures as an attack on democracy and freedom of expression. The junta, which has been in power since 2020, had previously announced a return to civilian rule but has since postponed elections and banned political activities.</p>

New storms are expected to develop from the Carolinas to New York, moving east throughout the afternoon and evening. The storm system is part of an "omega block pattern," creating a sharp contrast in weather conditions across a wide area.</p>

          <p>Slow TV, featuring unnarrated, real-time coverage of long events, has gained popularity as a source of relaxation and connection with nature. Livestreams of events like elk migrations and stork nest observations attract millions of viewers seeking a contrast to fast-paced media. The Great Elk Trek, a three-week livestream in Sweden, drew over 9 million viewers last year, fostering a Facebook group with active discussions. Experts believe slow TV can promote conservationist attitudes and environmental awareness by fostering a deeper connection with nature.</p>

The $35 billion deal, pending regulatory approval, would make Capital One both a credit card issuer and a payment network operator. Capital One's CEO, Richard Fairbank, emphasized that expanding Discover's global presence would incentivize the company to shift more Capital One-branded credit cards away from Visa and Mastercard. The company estimates $2.7 billion in annual synergies by 2027, and global expansion of Discover's network could create a "flywheel effect" for the combined business.</p>
