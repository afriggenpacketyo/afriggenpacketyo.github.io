          <p>A leaked memo indicates that Angela Rayner had proposed tax increases to Rachel Reeves, the UK's shadow chancellor, to raise £3-4 billion annually, prior to the formulation of departmental spending plans. These proposals, which included increasing corporation tax on banks and extending the freeze on the threshold for the 45% tax rate, were ultimately not implemented by Reeves, who instead pursued welfare cuts. Conservative Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride criticized the memo, suggesting it reflected the Labour Party's inclination towards raising taxes, while a government spokesperson declined to comment on the leak. The memo highlights internal debates within the Labour party regarding fiscal policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tim Friede has allowed himself to be bitten by venomous snakes over 200 times, gradually building immunity to multiple types of venom. His unique case has drawn the attention of researchers aiming to develop a universal antivenom. The World Health Organization estimates that venomous snake bites affect millions annually, causing tens of thousands of deaths and disabilities. Current antivenoms are specific to certain venoms and derived from animals, but scientists hope Friede's antibodies can be synthesized into a treatment effective against various snake venoms, improving global access to life-saving medicine.</p>

          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) has announced that its online services will face disruptions until July due to a cyber-attack that occurred over the Easter weekend. The retailer estimates the attack will reduce profits for the current year by approximately £300 million, a significant hit to their expected earnings. CEO Stuart Machin stated that the company is managing a sophisticated and targeted cyber-attack, which initially affected click-and-collect and contactless payments. The ransomware attack is believed to be the work of the Scattered Spider group, utilizing tools from the DragonForce cyber-crime service.</p>

          <p>The Tokyo Metropolitan Government will waive basic water utility charges for households over four months this summer to encourage residents to use air conditioning without concern for costs amid increasingly extreme heat. The supplementary budget bill, totaling 36.8 billion yen, aims to protect residents' lives and daily living as real wages decline due to surging prices. About 8.2 million households are expected to benefit, saving around 5,000 yen on their water bills, though metered water usage will still be charged. This initiative responds to the rising number of heatstroke cases in Tokyo due to climate change.</p>

          <p>Members of the Trump administration have recently discussed the possibility of suspending habeas corpus, a foundational principle of the Constitution that protects people from unlawful detention. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem incorrectly described it as the president's right to deport people. Legal experts clarify that only Congress can suspend habeas corpus, which ensures individuals are not detained without valid legal grounds. The administration's consideration of suspending this right for detained migrants has sparked controversy and debate over executive power.</p>

          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned due to political fallout over comments that he "never had to buy rice" because he received it as gifts, amid public concern over high rice prices. The resignation poses further trouble for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government ahead of a national election. Eto's remarks were seen as out of touch with the economic struggles faced by many Japanese citizens. His successor will be Shinjiro Koizumi, who is expected to address the rising rice prices.</p>

Scientists at the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Centre discovered that high doses of radiation can lead to the growth of existing metastatic tumors, even those not directly exposed to radiation. The research suggests that while radiation therapy can control localized tumors, it may also have unintended consequences on distant metastases. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind this phenomenon.</p>

While many surveys show a gender gap in support of far-right parties, it is young women who stand out as the more politically interesting demographic, as they are turning in ever greater numbers towards the left. Mudde suggests that center-left parties should focus on the priorities and values of female voters rather than chasing an outdated interpretation of the working-class voter.</p>

          <p>Veterinary students are in high demand due to a national shortage of veterinary professionals, driven by high turnover rates, rising student debt, and increased pet ownership. California shelters lack adequate access to veterinary care, leading to overcrowding and euthanizing of adoptable animals. Western University College of Veterinary Medicine is one of only two vet schools in California, with limited student admissions. Veterinarians face high stress, debt, and suicide rates, prompting concerns about their well-being. The corporate-owned clinics see pet care as a viable revenue source, causing prices for visits to increase.</p>
