          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and former U.S. President Donald Trump met inside St Peter's Basilica ahead of Pope Francis' funeral, marking their first encounter since a tense Oval Office meeting. The White House called the 15-minute discussion "very productive," while Zelensky described it as "very symbolic" with the potential for historic significance, especially considering recent peace deal proposals. The meeting, facilitated amidst the somber backdrop of the Pope's funeral, involved discussions on ceasefire, defense, and lasting peace, with Trump's envoy having previously met with Putin to discuss resuming direct talks between Russia and Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Karen Read's admission during an ambulance ride about an argument with John O'Keefe became a central issue in her retrial for his death. Prosecutors aimed to portray the statement as a reference to an argument before O'Keefe's death, while the defense suggested it could refer to an earlier disagreement or angry voicemails. Paramedics testified about Read's demeanor and statements, with conflicting interpretations of her 'last words' to O'Keefe. Read's blood alcohol level was .093% hours after the incident, and jurors visited the crime scene to see Read's SUV in place.</p>

          <p>Republican leaders in Congress are facing a significant challenge in unifying their party around Donald Trump's proposal for a "big, beautiful bill" encompassing tax cuts, border security, and potential cuts to social safety net programs. The bill's ambitious scope and potential impact on the federal deficit have exposed divisions within the GOP, with some lawmakers opposing cuts to programs vital to their constituents. The budget framework for the bill has been passed, but experts note that the plan illustrates how divided the GOP is. The bill could cost as much as $5.8tn for the next 10 years.</p>

          <p>Robert F Kennedy Jr.'s tenure as US health secretary has been marked by significant cuts to public health infrastructure, particularly targeting Covid-19 mitigation efforts. Experts worry that these actions undermine immunization programs and elevate voices critical of established science. The administration defends these changes as a shift toward addressing chronic diseases, but critics argue that dismantling Covid-19 infrastructure weakens overall public health preparedness. The potential removal of Covid-19 shots from the childhood vaccine schedule and the cancellation of key immunization programs are raising alarms among health officials.</p>

          <p>A recent AP-NORC poll indicates that many Americans, including Republicans, are not entirely convinced that President Trump is focusing on the right priorities during his second term. While Republicans largely support Trump, only about half believe he has prioritized the right issues, with concerns arising over foreign policy, trade negotiations, and the economy. Democrats express stronger disapproval, with most believing Trump is focused on the wrong topics and has been a "terrible" president so far. However, Republicans interviewed were particularly fond of efforts to scale back the size of the federal government led by billionaire outside adviser Elon Musk and Trump’s cost-cutting initiative, the Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.</p>

          <p>Mexican drug cartels have transformed into influencers, using social media to shape their public image, spread their influence, and recruit individuals for criminal activities. They post content ranging from displays of wealth and power to humanitarian gestures and brutal acts of violence. This content is used to attract attention, expand into new markets, and establish connections with international supply chains. Social media platforms struggle to effectively moderate cartel activity, leading to concerns about the spread of cartel influence and the limited availability of credible information about their operations.</p>

          <p>This article explores the life and legacy of Aimee Semple McPherson, a religious innovator who thrived in Los Angeles during the 1920s. McPherson, who arrived in L.A. with "10 dollars and a tambourine," founded the Angelus Temple and pioneered Christian radio broadcasting. Her approach of blending theatrical spectacle with the gospel made her a precursor to televangelists and a symbol of reinvention in a city that embraced radical ideas about faith and self-transformation. The article also delves into the scandals that surrounded McPherson, including her mysterious disappearance and subsequent trial, which added to her mystique.</p>

The decision to drop Ruffin is seen by some as a sign of capitulation, while others support it to avoid further division.
