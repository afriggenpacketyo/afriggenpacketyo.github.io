          <p>An appeals court has issued a pause on a judge's order that would have required due process for deported Venezuelans. The Trump administration was set to outline how nearly 140 Venezuelans deported to El Salvador could challenge their expulsion. This pause provides an interim victory for the administration, allowing them to continue deportations without the need to provide due process as previously ordered. The legal battle surrounding the rights of deported Venezuelans remains ongoing.</p>

Meta's strategy mirrors Google and Microsoft's approach of attracting AI talent through large stakes rather than outright acquisitions, potentially avoiding antitrust scrutiny. The move signals Meta's commitment to strengthening its position in the competitive AI landscape.</p>

          <p>President Trump delivered a partisan speech at Fort Bragg, mocking political rivals and encouraging military personnel to jeer at the press.

The author criticizes the silence of senior military officers, questioning their commitment to upholding the values of the armed forces.
