          <p>New research from the think tank Third Way reveals a growing disparity in the American workforce, with college-educated women seeing a significant nine-point increase in participation over the last two decades. In contrast, women without a college degree have experienced less than a one-point gain. The report attributes this divergence to factors like the availability of flexible remote work and better caregiving benefits in white-collar jobs, which are less common in the service-sector roles predominantly held by noncollege women. This trend highlights that recent progress for women in the workplace has not been universally shared.</p>

The discussion arose while he was contesting official job statistics and boasting about his electoral performance in Texas. The article provides context on the 22nd Amendment, which limits presidents to two elected terms, and notes that while some supporters have floated the idea of changing the amendment for nonconsecutive terms, Trump has previously distanced himself from the idea.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has provisionally fined former star fund manager Neil Woodford and his firm a total of nearly £46 million over the 2019 collapse of the Woodford Equity Income Fund. The FCA stated that Woodford and his firm made "unreasonable and inappropriate investment decisions" that increased the fund's holdings in illiquid assets, disadvantaging investors who remained when the fund was suspended. Woodford's firm has disputed the findings, blaming the fund's authorized corporate director for the ultimate losses and intending to appeal the decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Yum Brands reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of Wall Street expectations, largely due to declining same-store sales in the U.S. for its KFC and Pizza Hut chains. Both brands saw a 5% slide in domestic sales, which executives attributed to ineffective value messaging and increased competition. In contrast, Taco Bell continued to perform well with a 4% rise in same-store sales, driven by popular new menu items. The company is undergoing leadership changes at KFC to address its ongoing struggles in the competitive American market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new Social Security Administration (SSA) policy that reroutes calls from local offices to other field offices nationwide is causing significant issues for beneficiaries. Employees and advocates report that callers are often connected with staff who lack the jurisdictional authority to resolve their specific cases, leading to delays and frustration. While the SSA claims the system is designed to reduce wait times and that any office can handle inquiries, union representatives and legal aid attorneys argue it is ineffective and undermines public confidence. The change was implemented with little warning, adding to the confusion for both the public and agency staff.</p>

          <p>The Florida Department of Health is investigating an outbreak that has sickened 21 people who consumed unpasteurized milk from the same farm.

Six of the cases involved children under the age of 10. While the sale of raw milk for human consumption is illegal in Florida, it can be sold as pet food, and officials have expressed particular concern over the sanitation practices at the unnamed farm linked to the outbreak.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of Scott Anderson's new book, "King of Kings," supports the argument that the 1979 Iranian Revolution was not a predetermined outcome but rather a result of historical contingency and miscalculation. The analysis highlights how the Shah's hubris, coupled with the U.S. government's ignorance and inaction, created a power vacuum that Ayatollah Khomeini skillfully exploited. Anderson's work suggests the revolution's success hinged on specific actions and errors in the months leading up to it, rather than a grand, structural cause. The article concludes that understanding this event as an "accident" of history offers a more instructive lesson than searching for a single culprit.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has publicly supported a controversial Republican-led effort in Texas to redraw congressional maps, stating that the party is "entitled to five more seats." His comments came as Texas Democrats fled the state to deny a legislative quorum and block the plan, which they argue is a corrupt attempt to gerrymander districts. Trump also made unsubstantiated claims of gerrymandering in Democratic states like California and Illinois. The move in Texas has intensified the national debate over partisan redistricting, with Democratic governors indicating they may retaliate by redrawing maps in their own states.</p>

          <p>A new congressional map proposed by Texas Republicans is facing criticism for allegedly diluting the voting power of Latinos, particularly in the Austin area. The plan would significantly alter the district of Rep.

Critics contend the map strategically cracks and packs minority voters to secure a partisan advantage for Republicans.

          <p>A federal judge has denied Sean Combs's request for release on bail ahead of his October sentencing hearing, ensuring he will remain in custody. Combs was convicted on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. His defense team argued for his release with a $50 million bond, but the judge ruled that his circumstances had not changed since bail was last denied. The judge cited evidence of violence presented during the trial and deemed Combs a flight risk, concluding that these factors outweighed concerns about his conditions in jail.</p>

          <p>Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has been released on police bail after being arrested in connection with an assault at St Pancras railway station in London. British Transport Police arrested the 42-year-old at Luton Airport upon his return from a trip to Spain. In a video statement, Robinson claimed he acted in self-defense and called for the release of CCTV footage that he says will exonerate him. The victim of the alleged assault sustained serious but non-life-threatening injuries and has since been discharged from the hospital.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation has found that the fatal implosion of the Titan submersible was preventable and resulted from OceanGate's use of "intimidation tactics" to evade regulatory oversight. The 300-page report states the company operated outside established deep-sea protocols and ignored fundamental engineering principles. Investigators also cited a "toxic" safety culture and noted that the vessel's hull had been compromised in previous incidents. The report concluded that OceanGate's co-founder, Stockton Rush, exhibited negligence that contributed to the deaths of the four other passengers.</p>

          <p>Rupert Murdoch has agreed to give President Trump's legal team regular updates on his health to delay being deposed in Trump's defamation lawsuit against him. The lawsuit pertains to a Wall Street Journal article about Jeffrey Epstein.

Under the deal, Murdoch's deposition is postponed until after a judge rules on a motion to dismiss the case, and he must provide a sworn declaration about his current health.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has stated that police guidance on releasing the immigration status and ethnicity of crime suspects "needs to change" to provide more transparency to the public. Her comments follow a case in Warwickshire where two men were charged with the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl, and police withheld their immigration details. The debate reflects concerns that a lack of official information can fuel misinformation and public distrust, as seen after the Southport murders last year. However, others caution that such disclosures could prejudice legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt at historically high levels, financial experts are advising consumers on how to qualify for debt settlement, also known as credit card debt forgiveness. To improve their chances of success, individuals should first organize their finances and obtain their credit reports to understand their total debt load. It is also crucial to document evidence of financial hardship, such as job loss or medical bills, as creditors need to see a verifiable reason to settle for less than the full amount. Finally, experts recommend getting any settlement agreement in writing before making payments. (not investment advice)</p>

The Trump administration has backed Bolsonaro, imposing sanctions on the judge and threatening tariffs on Brazilian imports, actions that supporters hope will pressure Brazil into granting Bolsonaro amnesty. The intervention has been praised by Bolsonaro's followers but decried by others in Brazil as a violation of national sovereignty.</p>
