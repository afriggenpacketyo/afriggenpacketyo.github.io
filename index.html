          <p>The Supreme Court temporarily lifted an injunction blocking the Trump administration's policy of swiftly deporting certain immigrants without prior notice or a chance to contest potential harm.  This decision allows the resumption of these deportations pending appeal.  Justice Sotomayor issued a strong dissent, criticizing the court's action as an abuse of discretion and highlighting instances where individuals were deported despite facing risks of torture or death. The ruling is seen as a victory for the Trump administration's immigration enforcement approach.</p>
