          <p>A recent article explores the potential dangers associated with vaping, highlighting concerns from health professionals about the lack of long-term studies. Rare but serious cases of lung damage, such as "popcorn lung," have been reported, and researchers are finding inflammation and irritation in the lungs of vapers. The article notes that vaping liquids contain various chemicals that, when heated and inhaled, could cause prolonged damage to lung tissue. While vaping is sometimes presented as a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes for adult smokers, the article emphasizes that it carries risks, especially for teenagers whose brains and lungs are still developing. The article also points out that the WHO reports children worldwide aged 13 to 15 use vapes at higher rates than adults.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated the U.S. might soon announce new trade deals, with a potential agreement with the U.K. being the first. The article contextualizes this announcement amidst ongoing economic uncertainty and tariffs imposed by the U.S. on various countries, with China being the most heavily affected. While Treasury Secretary Bessent suggested that deals could be mostly finalized by year-end, some experts believe negotiations will take longer due to the long-term implications of these agreements. The article notes that the U.S. is currently in trade discussions with multiple countries, including Canada, Italy, India, and Japan, and it also mentions that China is not currently engaged in active trade talks with the U.S.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from World Weather Attribution attributes the severity of recent deadly storms and flooding in the Midwest and South to climate change, noting that human-caused global warming made the record-breaking downpours about 9% heavier. The article explains that the storms, which affected states like Kentucky, Tennessee, and Arkansas, were intensified by unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico. Researchers expressed concern about the potential impact of staff shortages at the National Weather Service on future warnings and emergency responses. Additionally, the article highlights the increasing strain on insurance markets as homeowners in high-risk areas face sharply rising premiums. The article concludes that without a rapid shift away from fossil fuels, extreme weather events will likely become more common and intense.</p>

Gates expressed concern about potential setbacks due to cuts in U.S. foreign aid and hopes to persuade President Trump and Congress to restore funding. The article emphasizes that the Gates Foundation's efforts cannot fully replace U.S. foreign aid, which significantly exceeds the foundation's spending.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell after the central bank decided to keep interest rates steady, citing economic uncertainty caused by tariffs. The article notes that Trump wants the Fed to lower rates to stimulate the economy, but the Fed is hesitant due to concerns about potential inflation from Trump's trade policies. Powell responded that the Fed's decisions would be based solely on economic data and not influenced by political pressure. The article also mentions previous market concerns about Trump potentially firing Powell, which were later eased by Trump's statement that he had "no intention" of doing so.</p>

However, it also notes that the deal's impact on the overall British economy may be limited, as trade flows are heavily skewed toward services. The article further explains that the deal is unlikely to be a full-blown free-trade agreement and that the greater threat to Britain is the global trade uncertainty created by President Trump's policies.</p>
