          <p>A China-led international research team analyzed seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, revealing a zone in Mars' crust that suggests the presence of water-saturated rock just a few kilometers beneath the surface. The study, published in National Science Review, indicates that this underground layer could hold a significant amount of water, potentially matching what scientists believe to be Mars' missing water. This discovery could reshape our understanding of Mars' water cycle and the potential for habitable environments on the planet. The research offers new insights into the red planet's geological composition and its capacity to support life.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's offer to mediate the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan has placed India in a tight spot, as India has historically opposed third-party mediation. The offer follows a ceasefire brokered by the U.S. after cross-border clashes. While Pakistan welcomed Trump's offer, India views it as an attempt to internationalize the Kashmir dispute, especially after India's 2019 decision to withdraw the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.

          <p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom released a model ordinance for local municipalities to address homeless encampments and announced new funding for treatment and housing. Newsom called on cities and counties to take action, emphasizing that the state is providing resources. The model ordinance reflects principles including that no person should face criminal prosecution for sleeping outside when they have nowhere else to go, and that encampment policies must prioritize shelter and services. The effort is backed by $3.3 billion in new Prop 1 funding.</p>

          <p>Local authorities in Dalton, Georgia, dismissed traffic charges against Ximena Arias Cristobal, a 19-year-old Mexican-born college student detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Officials determined that the officer had stopped the wrong vehicle. Arias Cristobal is now facing deportation, and her father is also being held by ICE. Her lawyers said she is likely to remain in ICE custody, despite the dismissal of charges, and has a bond hearing scheduled for next week.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans, which offered deportation protections to thousands of people from Afghanistan. The Department of Homeland Security said it will wind down TPS for Afghans on July 12. Over 8,000 Afghans were approved for TPS as of last year. The administration cited an improved security situation and stabilizing economy in Afghanistan as reasons for the decision, drawing criticism from advocates.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reports that House Republicans proposed sharp restrictions on the federal anti-hunger program known as food stamps (SNAP). The proposal aims to limit funding and benefits, requiring states to supply some funding and forcing more beneficiaries to obtain employment. These changes could result in millions of low-income families losing access to the program. Republicans argue that their approach would improve the provision of food stamp benefits while helping to defray the cost of Trump’s tax cuts.</p>

          <p>A shortage of air traffic controllers at a Philadelphia facility that manages Newark's air traffic caused significant flight delays, with as few as three controllers scheduled for duty. The FAA had to delay flights to Newark for up to nearly seven hours. The staffing crisis added strain to an already troubled aviation system. The FAA is grappling with equipment and technology failures, which combined with staffing limitations, have contributed to lengthy delays at Newark. The transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, blamed the Biden administration for "bungling" the move of air traffic control from New York last summer.</p>

          <p>A climate scientist warns that proposed funding and personnel cuts by the Trump administration could end decades of critical scientific research at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The cuts would slash climate research, such as the ongoing collection of CO2 samples, which began with Professor Charles David Keeling. The program collects air from all over the world and is used to create the Keeling Curve, which plots the rise of carbon dioxide. The scientist said turning off a program like this would be like turning off the headlights on a dark street at night.</p>
