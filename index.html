          <p>Warren Buffett announced at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting that he will recommend Greg Abel as his successor for the CEO position at the end of the year. Buffett, 94, stated that while he will still be involved, Abel, currently the vice chairman of non-insurance operations, will have the final say on company operations. This decision, revealed during the meeting, surprised many shareholders, though Abel was designated as the successor in 2021. Buffett emphasized that he would remain available to assist, but Abel, 62, would assume full leadership responsibilities. (not investment advice)</p>

A militia incident in 2020, fueled by false rumors on Facebook, highlighted the dangers of unregulated online information.

          <p>Elizabeth Tamilore Odunsi, a 23-year-old British nursing student studying in Houston, Texas, was found stabbed to death in her apartment days before her graduation. Police were called to her apartment and found her with multiple stab wounds; a man was also found in the apartment with at least one stab wound and was taken to the hospital in critical condition. Odunsi had a TikTok account where she shared her experiences as a Briton living in the US, and her last post described her excitement about graduating and her booked holiday. A fundraiser has been started to repatriate her remains to the UK for burial.</p>

          <p>Two commercial jetliners had to abort landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) due to an Army Black Hawk helicopter violating safety standards. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy called the incident "unacceptable," emphasizing that safety must always come first, especially after a previous mid-air collision near the airport. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the incident, and Duffy plans to discuss the disregard of rules with the Defense Department. Restrictions were placed on helicopter flights near the airport after the deadly January collision, making this recent incident particularly concerning.</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, which could significantly increase prices for new and used vehicles, as well as repairs and insurance. These tariffs, ordered by President Trump, aim to promote domestic manufacturing. The tariffs will affect both domestic and foreign car manufacturers, as most vehicles use components made abroad. Exemptions are in place for parts from Canada and Mexico that meet the requirements of the North American trade agreement. Rising car prices are expected to contribute to overall inflation, and there is concern that some suppliers may be driven out of business due to financial stress.</p>

          <p>Singapore's ruling People's Action Party (PAP) secured another sweeping victory in the general elections, winning 87 out of 97 seats in parliament. The result strengthens the mandate of Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who was facing his first test at the ballot box since taking office last year. The PAP has governed Singapore since before the country became independent from Malaysia in 1965. Living costs and housing availability were key concerns for voters, with the opposition arguing that the government has failed to tackle the cost of living crisis.</p>
