          <p>The United States has warned its trading partners to finalize new trade agreements by August 1 or face the reinstatement of higher tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that letters will be sent to countries, giving them the choice to expedite deals or revert to previous, higher tariff levels. The Trump administration's "maximum pressure" strategy is aimed at securing favorable terms, with ongoing negotiations, particularly with the European Union. While deals have been reached with the UK and Vietnam, the EU faces potential tariffs of up to 50% on its goods if an agreement is not reached. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The death of Daniel Park, a man accused of conspiring in the bombing of a California fertility clinic, is being investigated as a suicide. Park died while in custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles, closing the only prosecution in the case. The incident has intensified concerns about the conditions at the federal facility, with lawyers reporting issues like unmet medical needs and inhumane environments. A 2024 Justice Department report had previously highlighted significant shortcomings in the Bureau of Prisons' emergency response to inmate deaths.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the deadly Texas floods, a dispute has arisen between state officials and the National Weather Service regarding the adequacy of the storm forecast. While the NWS asserts it provided timely flood watches and warnings, including a rare "flash flood emergency" alert, some Texas officials claim the predictions failed to convey the catastrophic scale of the event. Meteorologists note the extreme difficulty in precisely forecasting such rare and intense rainfall. The incident also brings attention to recent staffing cuts at the NWS, which may have impacted its operational capacity.</p>

          <p>According to expert Denis Simon, the future of the US-China Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement (STA) is a crucial bellwether for the overall relationship between the two nations. First signed in 1979, the STA has been a foundational element of bilateral engagement, fostering scientific collaboration and building trust when diplomatic ties were fragile. However, in the current geopolitical climate, the agreement is now viewed through a lens of national security, economic competition, and techno-nationalism. The debate over its renewal reflects broader tensions and concerns about espionage and intellectual property theft.</p>

Forecasters predict rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches, with localized amounts up to 6 inches, creating concerns for potential flash flooding across central and eastern North Carolina. The system is expected to continue weakening as it moves northeast. South Carolina's emergency services had warned residents about the possibility of minor coastal flooding.</p>

          <p>A Domino's Pizza restaurant in Herriman, Utah, was destroyed by a powerful explosion after an SUV crashed into the building and ruptured a gas line. The incident occurred following a three-vehicle accident on Saturday night. Two bystanders rescued the driver and a passenger from the SUV just minutes before it was engulfed in flames and the subsequent blast occurred. No one was inside the restaurant at the time of the crash, and no injuries were reported from the explosion itself, though multiple people from the initial accident were hospitalized.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" includes a provision that bars Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid reimbursements for any health services it provides, not just abortions. Legal experts and reproductive rights activists are warning this will have a devastating impact, particularly in underserved communities where Planned Parenthood is often the only accessible healthcare provider. Critics argue the move is a coordinated effort to restrict reproductive care in increasingly creative ways, affecting access to basic services like vaccinations, prenatal care, and cancer screenings for millions of low-income patients.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FBI reports that homeowners in New Hampshire have lost over $4 million to quit claim deed fraud between 2019 and 2023. In this scam, fraudsters, known as "title pirates," forge documents to illegally transfer property ownership, often targeting vacant lands, vacation homes, or properties owned by the elderly. They then sell the property or take out a mortgage on it without the real owner's knowledge. Authorities are urging homeowners to be vigilant, suggesting they monitor their property records, consider homeowner's title insurance, and report any suspicious activity to protect themselves from this growing form of real estate fraud.

          <p>Following Elon Musk's announcement of a new political party, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the billionaire should focus on his businesses rather than politics. Musk declared the formation of the "America Party" on his social media platform, X, framing it as a response to President Trump's new tax and spending bill, which he called fiscally irresponsible. The move signals a renewed feud between the former allies, with Musk criticizing the bill for increasing the national deficit. Bessent noted that Musk's previous government role was unpopular and that his companies' boards would likely prefer he avoid political activities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Texas are drawing attention to the limitations of forecasting extreme weather events in an era of climate change. Analysis shows the rainfall intensity, with over 10 inches in three hours, was an exceedingly rare event, making precise prediction difficult despite advance warnings from the National Weather Service. The NWS did issue a series of watches and a "flash flood emergency" alert, but the rainfall totals far exceeded initial forecasts. The disaster underscores the complex interplay between warming-enhanced weather patterns, like record moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, and the challenges forecasters face.</p>
