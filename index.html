            <p>In early 2025, Brazil recorded its first trade deficit with China in nearly a decade, primarily due to a surge in Chinese imports, including solar panels and petroleum drilling platforms. This unexpected deficit, reaching $3.2 billion in February, contrasted sharply with Brazil's usual trade surpluses with China. However, by the end of the first quarter, Brazil had recovered, reporting a $700 million trade surplus with China. Analysts attributed the import surge to Brazilian businesses fearing the impact of the growing trade war between the U.S. and China.</p>

            <p>The IRS is considering revoking Harvard University's tax-exempt status following the university's refusal to comply with demands from the Trump administration regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.

Harvard argues that revoking its tax-exempt status would be unlawful and would harm its educational mission.

            <p>Israeli strikes on a tented area for displaced Palestinians in Gaza resulted in at least 37 deaths, according to Gaza's Hamas-run civil defense agency. Witnesses reported that flames spread rapidly between tents, causing numerous casualties, including children. Hamas formally rejected Israel's latest ceasefire proposal, stating its readiness to negotiate a deal involving the release of hostages in exchange for an end to the war. Aid organizations have warned that the humanitarian aid system in Gaza is on the verge of collapse.</p>
