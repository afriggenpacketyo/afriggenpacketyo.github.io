          <p>Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez publicly challenged Tom Homan after he threatened to refer her to the Justice Department for advising migrants on how to avoid deportation. At a town hall in Queens, Ocasio-Cortez asserted her right to free speech and offered guidance to migrants about their constitutional protections. Homan claimed her actions could be illegal and impede ICE's deportation efforts, suggesting she was teaching migrants to evade law enforcement. Ocasio-Cortez also criticized the Trump administration's border security policies, calling the deportation of Venezuelan gang members 'sanctioned kidnappings,' while emphasizing migrants' rights to demand a judicial warrant before allowing ICE to enter their homes or workplaces.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese has secured a second consecutive three-year term as Australia's Prime Minister, marking the first such victory in 21 years. Opposition leader Peter Dutton conceded defeat, acknowledging his party's underperformance during the campaign. Energy policy and inflation were central issues, with both parties recognizing the cost-of-living crisis affecting many Australians. Albanese highlighted improved relations with China, resulting in the removal of trade barriers that had previously cost Australian exporters billions. The election also underscored changing demographics, with younger voters outnumbering Baby Boomers for the first time, prompting both campaigns to address housing affordability.</p>

          <p>SpaceX is seeking to create a new town called Starbase in Texas, potentially transforming a small beach community near Brownsville into a company-dominated municipality. This initiative raises concerns among local residents who fear restricted access to Boca Chica Beach and environmental disruption from frequent rocket launches. SpaceX aims to control the nearby beach and road leading to its spaceport, prompting proposed legislation that could allow Starbase to close these areas on weekdays. While SpaceX promotes the project as an opportunity for economic growth, some residents worry about rising rents, environmental damage, and the loss of a beloved public beach.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese secured a second term as Australia's Prime Minister, a significant win for the center-left Labor Party amid a challenging economic backdrop. The victory was a notable defeat for the conservative opposition led by Peter Dutton, whose campaign faced missteps and association with some of President Trumpâ€™s policies. The election took place against the backdrop of a cost-of-living crisis, with younger voters expressing disaffection with both major parties. Albanese's win suggests a preference for the 'known evil' over the uncertainties presented by the opposition, though it remains to be seen if Labor can maintain its parliamentary majority.</p>

          <p>A new lawsuit seeks to compel New Jersey state police to permit mitochondrial DNA testing on envelopes used in the Lindbergh baby kidnapping case. The case, which involved the kidnapping and murder of Charles Lindbergh's son in 1932, was pinned on Bruno Hauptmann, who maintained his innocence. Researchers believe that saliva on the envelopes could clarify whether Hauptmann acted alone. The state police have cited concerns about damaging the evidence as the reason for restricting access, but the plaintiffs argue that advanced DNA testing is crucial for pursuing truth and historical justice.</p>

          <p>Tech billionaires' embrace of Donald Trump and the far right reflects a deeper, longstanding libertarian ideology rooted in visions of total autocratic control. Fantasies of space colonization, like Elon Musk's Mars project and Jeff Bezos's space stations, allow for visions of corporate control free from government regulation. These leaders' unquestioned faith in AI is linked to a broader myth about the future of technology in general, in which AI's super-intelligent beneficence will render democracy obsolete. The article argues that this unshakable faith leads them to believe the end of this world is nigh, with AI and space colonization leading to utopia, algorithmically guaranteed.</p>

Doctors found a pericardiac cyst the size of an orange growing within the muscle of his heart, compressing his right ventricular outflow tract.

The potential scenarios are endless, requiring companies to consider shifting supply chains, inventory, and product offerings to manage tariff costs.

With almost all bridal gowns made in China or other parts of Asia, the 145% tariff on Chinese imports has roiled the bridal business. An estimated 90% of wedding dresses are made in China, according to the National Bridal Retailers Association. Many of those stores were already struggling to cover expenses like rent and employee wages, and the boutiques' business models have felt squeezed as some customers use them as 'try-on shops,' only to buy a similar, cheaper alternative online.</p>

The Port of Los Angeles is experiencing a cessation of shipments out of China for major retailers and manufacturers, according to its executive director, Eugene Seroka. Experts note that the tariff announcements have created a 'bullwhip' effect across the supply chain. Trump's trade war is different because it is unpredictable and indefinite, shaking global confidence in American economic-policy making. The slowdown in cargo volume is also affecting the trucking industry, leading to potential job losses and economic faltering.</p>

These tariffs, ordered by President Trump to promote domestic manufacturing, follow earlier levies on imported cars. The new tariffs impact vehicles made in the United States, as they often rely on imported components. The administration aims to protect national security by incentivizing domestic production, but automakers and suppliers say relocating assembly lines will take years.

          <p>The author reflects on the transformative power of friendship and showing up for others during times of illness and grief. After being diagnosed with cancer at a young age, the author initially resisted befriending others in similar situations, but eventually found solace and support in friendships with fellow patients. One particular friendship with Anjali, who had a terminal diagnosis, taught the author the importance of being present and offering care. The essay emphasizes that love extends beyond romantic relationships and involves seeing, understanding, and supporting others during challenging times.</p>

          <p>The retrial of Karen Read, accused of murdering her boyfriend John Oâ€™Keefe, is underway in Massachusetts, but the case remains complex due to a botched police investigation and conflicting evidence. Special prosecutor Hank Brennan now leads the prosecution, armed with knowledge of the defense's arguments. The defense, however, has gained a new lawyerly ace card: Victoria George, an alternate juror from the first trial. The article highlights the ongoing debate surrounding key pieces of evidence, including the fitness tracking data from O'Keefe's cellphone and witness testimonies, all complicated by the shoddy investigation overseen by now-fired state trooper Michael Proctor.</p>
