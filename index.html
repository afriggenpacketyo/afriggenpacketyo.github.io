          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made outside the United States, citing concerns about the decline of the American film industry and describing foreign film incentives as a national security threat. Trump stated that he authorized the U.S. Trade Representative to initiate the tariff process, aiming to revitalize domestic film production and counteract what he perceives as messaging and propaganda from other countries. Since returning to the White House, Trump has implemented tariffs on various countries, arguing that such measures will bolster U.S. manufacturers and safeguard jobs, but these actions have led to global economic instability and rising prices worldwide.</p>

          <p>An exhibit at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) headquarters honoring victims of gun violence has been removed, confirmed by the Department of Justice. The exhibit featured portraits of 120 individuals killed by gun violence, accompanied by a digital kiosk containing their biographies, which has also been taken offline. The DOJ stated that the ATF will continue to honor victims of violent crime while preserving the rights of law-abiding Americans, suggesting alternative methods of recognition beyond solely focusing on gun violence. Critics view the removal as a political decision by the Trump administration to undermine the reality of gun violence and roll back firearms regulations.</p>

          <p>The death of a 14-year-old boy, believed to be Layton Carr, in an industrial building fire in Gateshead has deeply saddened his school and community. Fourteen children, aged 11 to 14, were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and later released on bail as the investigation continues. Tributes, including balloons and heartfelt messages, have been left at the scene of the fire, and a GoFundMe campaign has raised over £13,000 for Layton's mother. Local residents reported that trespassing and fires were common occurrences at the disused industrial park, but the scale of this fire was unprecedented.</p>

          <p>Australian markets experienced a slight decline in early trading following Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's reelection, marking his second consecutive term, a rare feat in the country's recent history. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 edged down 0.29%, reversing gains from the previous session, while the Australian dollar depreciated marginally against the U.S. dollar. Trading activity was subdued across most of Asia due to public holidays in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and China. U.S. futures also edged down, contrasting with the strong performance on Wall Street last week, where the S&P 500 achieved its longest winning streak since 2004.</p>

Madison, who left the mansion in 2008, has previously spoken about verbal and emotional abuse during her time there and now advises aspiring models to consider the 'cautionary tales' of others in the industry.</p>

Trump stated that this move aims to house America's most ruthless and violent offenders, symbolizing law, order, and justice. The Bureau of Prisons confirmed it would comply with the order, though the practicality and feasibility of reopening Alcatraz remain unclear, given the National Park Service's control of the island.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney campaigned on an anti-Trump platform, highlighting threats to Canada's sovereignty, while Australia's Anthony Albanese indirectly benefited from an anti-Trump sentiment. In Singapore, the incumbent People's Action Party leveraged concerns about Trump's trade wars to secure voter support.

          <p>As more women turn to egg freezing, some experts caution against relying on the medical procedure, citing costs and no guarantees. Vardit Ravitsky, president of the Hastings Center, worries that women may think egg freezing guarantees a baby. Stories like Evelyn Gosnell's, who froze her eggs three times without success, illustrate the risks. The expense is also a concern, with a single cycle costing upwards of $12,000, plus storage and thawing fees. Ravitsky suggests companies offer policies like paid parental leave to make it easier for women to have babies younger.</p>

Women are turning to egg freezing to increase the chances of having a baby when they're older, and to avoid rushing to find partners. A 2022 study found that 70% of women who froze at least 20 eggs before age 38 had a baby, but success rates dropped off considerably the older women were and the fewer eggs they froze. However, critics caution that egg freezing does not guarantee a woman will be able to have a child.</p>

Egg freezing is expensive, with a single cycle costing an average of $12,000 to $15,000, plus another $500 to $1,000 each year for storage.

          <p>More than half of first-time buyers received financial help from their family to make house purchases last year, according to estimates by estate agency Savills. An average of £55,572 was given in loans and gifts by the so-called bank of mum and dad to buyers. Young buyers faced relatively high mortgage rates in 2024, while also seeing the cost of renting increase. The annual report by Savills suggests that 52% of first-time buyers received assistance from the bank of mum and dad last year, which could also include other donors from the family.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed orders against several law firms, orders with the power to destroy them, prompting concerns about the rule of law. Lawsuits have been a check on the president's power, and many firms and attorneys have been targeted, including Marc Elias. Elias says that for him, it began with the president's personal grudge. Donald Ayer, who argued before the Supreme Court for the Reagan administration, says the idea that the president would issue executive orders aimed at any either specific person or organization and stating that they're being punished because they're doing things that are politically disapproved by the people in power, that-- that is completely unprecedented.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is a medical procedure in which a woman's eggs are harvested, frozen and stored until she is ready to have children. The hope is that the eggs will produce a child, but that outcome isn't guaranteed. The procedure is extremely expensive, especially for the majority of women who don't have insurance coverage for egg freezing from their employer. Doctors sometimes recommend that a woman undergo multiple cycles of egg freezing to increase the number of eggs available for fertilization and implantation later on to up her chances of success, raising the cost even further.</p>

The eight producers in the group, led by Saudi Arabia, agreed to increase output by another 411,000 barrels per day in June. Oil prices in April posted the biggest monthly loss since 2021, as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs have raised fears of a recession that will slow demand at the same time that OPEC+ is quickly increasing supply. Goldman is forecasting that U.S. crude and Brent prices will average $59 and $63 per barrel, respectively, this year. (not investment advice)</p>
