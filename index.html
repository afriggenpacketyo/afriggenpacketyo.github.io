          <p>Stellantis, facing President Trump's new 25% automotive tariffs, temporarily idled assembly plants in Canada and Mexico.  The two-week shutdown in Canada and month-long shutdown in Mexico impacts thousands of workers, including those at supporting U.S. plants.  Stellantis cited the tariffs' uncertainty as the reason for the production pause, while rivals Ford and GM opted for different responses. The temporary shutdown also helps reduce Stellantis' high vehicle inventory.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve faces a difficult policy dilemma due to President Trump's tariffs, which pose risks to both inflation and economic growth.
