          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 14:17:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The largest rail workers' union in the U.S., SMART-TD, has announced its opposition to the proposed $85 billion merger between Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern. Citing Union Pacific's troubling safety record and alleged harassment of workers, the union plans to challenge the deal before the Surface Transportation Board. The union contrasts this with Norfolk Southern's more progressive labor policies. Another union, BLET, has also raised concerns about Union Pacific's labor practices, specifically regarding the use of non-U.S. crews at the southern border.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. negotiators, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have stated that any extension of the current tariff pause with China requires final approval from President Donald Trump. The remarks followed a third round of high-level talks in Stockholm, where Chinese officials indicated an agreement to push for an extension. The current 90-day truce on most U.S. tariffs and Chinese retaliatory measures is set to expire on August 12. If no extension is reached, tariffs are expected to 'boomerang' back to their previous, higher levels, creating significant economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>A gunman killed four people and wounded a fifth in a Midtown Manhattan office building that houses the NFL headquarters before taking his own life. Police sources indicate the shooter, Shane Tamura, appeared to be targeting the league and left a note mentioning chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a brain disease linked to head trauma. The victims included a building security guard, a Blackstone executive, an off-duty police officer, and a Rudin Management employee. The investigation is ongoing, with authorities tracing the shooter's cross-country travel and examining his background.</p>

          <p>Shares of identity management software company CyberArk soared after a report that it is in acquisition talks with cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks for a deal valued at over $20 billion. This potential acquisition highlights the growing importance of cloud security, especially with the rise of AI-related threats and ransomware attacks. If completed, it would be by far the largest acquisition for Palo Alto Networks, which has been actively consolidating the cybersecurity industry under CEO Nikesh Arora. The news caused CyberArk's stock to hit a record high, while Palo Alto's shares saw a slight decline.</p>

          <p>Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham are reissuing 'Buckingham Nicks,' their sole studio album as a duo, originally released in 1973. The album, which was a commercial failure at the time, has become a sought-after collector's item and is credited with leading to their invitation to join Fleetwood Mac. Despite its initial lukewarm reception, the record is considered a crucial piece of evidence of their early folk-rock sound and musical partnership. The remastered version will be released on multiple formats, making it widely available to fans for the first time in half a century.</p>

          <p>A former labor relations counsel at Netflix, Nhu-Y Phan, has filed a lawsuit against the company, alleging she was wrongfully terminated after raising concerns about discrimination and sexual harassment. The suit claims her managers excluded women of color from opportunities and that she faced hostility after reporting a colleague's allegations of sexual harassment. Phan, who had received positive performance reviews, was fired for 'unspecified performance issues.' Her lawyers argue that Netflix's attempt to force the case into private arbitration violates a 2022 federal law designed to protect victims of sexual harassment.</p>

          <p>This opinion article explores the growing frustration within the MAGA movement as its ideological goals often conflict with Donald Trump's personal and unpredictable political style. It argues that unlike Reaganism, which was a coherent philosophy, 'Trumpism' is more of a psychological phenomenon centered on loyalty to Trump himself. The piece highlights instances where Trump has diverged from staunch MAGA positions on immigration, foreign policy, and China, disappointing his most ardent supporters. The author suggests this reliance on a mercurial personality, rather than a fixed ideology, makes the movement inherently unstable.</p>

The absence of a Federal Reserve meeting in August provides a stable period for savers to lock in these rates.

          <p>Starbucks is launching a new 'Green Apron Service' program, a major investment in hospitality aimed at improving the customer experience and boosting sales. The strategy focuses on creating warmer, more engaging interactions between baristas and customers to make visits a regular habit. This initiative is part of CEO Brian Niccol's 'Back to Starbucks' turnaround plan and is supported by new technology for better staffing and faster service. The move comes as the coffee giant faces a competitive consumer environment and aims to reverse a trend of declining same-store sales.</p>

          <p>AstraZeneca's CEO, Sir Pascal Soriot, has fueled speculation that the pharmaceutical giant may move its stock market listing from London to the U.S. by declining to deny such reports. During a press conference, he extensively praised the American market as the global center for innovation and investment in the industry, while highlighting the failings of Europe and the U.K. This analysis suggests the U.K. government should take the possibility of a move seriously, as a defection by its largest quoted company would be a major blow to the London stock market and the nation's life sciences ambitions.</p>

          <p>Ivory Coast's 83-year-old president, Alassane Ouattara, has announced he will run for a fourth term in the upcoming October election. The decision is controversial, as the opposition argues it is unconstitutional, despite a 2020 constitutional change that reset his term limits. Ouattara, a US-trained economist, has overseen strong economic growth but faces criticism for tightening his grip on power. The announcement raises tensions, with fears of a repeat of the deadly violence that marred the 2020 election and the exclusion of several key opposition figures from the race.</p>

          <p>Recent inter-communal violence in southern Syria between Druze and Bedouin-Sunni groups is causing a rise in sectarian tension within the Syrian diaspora in Germany. Syrians living in Germany report an increase in hate speech and division on social media, with conflicts from their home country extending into their communities abroad. Incidents, including a brawl between rival protest groups in Dusseldorf, have highlighted the growing friction. While analysts caution against exaggerating the risk of widespread violence, they note that disinformation and unresolved conflict are fueling high emotions among the large Syrian population in Germany.</p>

The move has been met with strong opposition, including from JFK's grandson, Jack Schlossberg, and is expected to face legal and legislative hurdles.

The law restores key tax provisions, including immediate expensing for R&D and 100% bonus depreciation for capital expenditures, which had been phased out. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate this could unlock billions in free cash flow for these companies, which are heavily investing in AI data centers and infrastructure. This extra liquidity will provide greater flexibility for reinvestment, deepening their competitive advantages in the AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

The states fear the information, including immigration status and home addresses, will be used for mass deportations. The USDA claims it needs the data to combat fraud, but officials have threatened to withhold program funding if states do not comply.

          <p>A CBS News analysis reveals that President Trump's job approval rating has dropped significantly among young Americans since his inauguration, falling from 55% to 28% for those aged 18-29. The decline is most pronounced among less partisan and politically unengaged young people, with young men's approval falling faster in recent months. The analysis suggests this shift is driven by a perception that Trump has not fulfilled campaign promises and that his policies are making them financially worse off. This trend could pose a challenge for Republicans in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections.</p>
