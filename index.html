          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 10:38:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has proposed eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) in his latest budget proposal, echoing similar attempts from his first term. These agencies, along with the Institute of Museum and Library Services, are targeted for elimination as part of efforts to reduce the size of the federal government. Democrats have strongly criticized the proposal, with Senator Jack Reed vowing to fight it. The Trump administration had already begun cutting grants and staff at the NEH and the Institute of Museum and Library Services, and the NEA is now facing similar cuts, as well as a new requirement for grant applicants to promise not to promote ‚Äúdiversity, equity and inclusion‚Äù.</p>

          <p>A recent study in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry suggests that lifestyle choices can significantly lower the risk of dementia, stroke, and late-life depression. The study found that at least 60% of strokes, 40% of dementia cases, and 35% of late-life depression cases are attributable to modifiable risk factors. Dr. Sanjula Singh, the study's lead author, noted that individuals who have experienced a stroke are more prone to developing depression or dementia, and vice versa. The article highlights the top three practices recommended by experts to stave off these brain conditions, emphasizing the interconnectedness of brain health and lifestyle. </p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, speaking at Berkshire Hathaway's shareholder meeting, criticized President Trump's trade policy, stating that "trade should not be a weapon" and that protectionist policies are a "big mistake." He argued that a more prosperous world benefits the United States and emphasized the negative consequences of tariffs, comparing them to "an act of war." Buffett's comments come after the White House imposed high tariffs on imports, causing market volatility. Berkshire Hathaway's first-quarter earnings report indicated that tariffs and geopolitical events have created "considerable uncertainty" for the company. Buffett has been selling stocks for ten straight quarters, increasing Berkshire's cash pile to a record $347 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has repeatedly claimed that grocery and gas prices are falling, but economists say this is misleading. While overall inflation has eased slightly, prices for food have increased since Trump took office, with egg prices soaring. The nationwide average gas price remains relatively unchanged since the beginning of Trump's term, despite a drop in oil prices. Experts suggest that the decline in oil prices reflects expectations of an economic slowdown due to Trump's tariffs, rather than an endorsement of his policies. The article uses data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and AAA to support these claims.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Child and family therapists have identified the top six worries of children that parents often don't realize: social dynamics, social media, big life changes, packed schedules, inconsistency, and trauma. Children are increasingly anxious about fitting in, comparing themselves to others online, and dealing with disruptions to their routines. Over-scheduling and lack of unstructured playtime can lead to chronic stress, while inconsistency in caregiving and conflicting signals from adults can cause discomfort. Trauma, even from seemingly small incidents, can deeply affect a child's sense of safety. The article provides coping strategies for parents to help their children manage these worries, such as naming emotions, practicing deep breathing, and scheduling a 'worry window'.</p>

          <p>Voice of America (VoA) is set to resume broadcasting after a federal appeals court temporarily blocked an executive order by President Trump that aimed to dismantle the broadcaster. The court's decision allows VoA staff to return to the office and restart programming. However, the court ruling upheld the freeze on congressionally approved funds for other publicly funded broadcasters like Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia, which has already led to staffing and content cuts. The US Agency for Global Media, which oversees VoA, has enjoyed bipartisan support due to its role in promoting democracy and US interests by reaching millions in countries with limited independent press.</p>

The survivors were surrounded by alligators and an anaconda, but they managed to stay atop the capsized plane and sustain themselves with cassava flour. A search and rescue mission was launched after the plane disappeared from radar, and the survivors were eventually spotted by local fishermen.</p>

Farage aims to implement a "Doge in every county," mirroring Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, with the goal of slashing council spending. The party plans to target climate change initiatives, Diversity, Equality and Inclusion programs, and remote work arrangements. Reform UK also intends to resist central government efforts to house asylum seekers in their communities, prioritizing essential services like social care and infrastructure. Concerns have been raised about the inexperience of newly-elected councillors, but Reform's deputy leader Richard Tice claims this will be an "advantage".</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the state of Colorado, the city of Denver, and several local leaders, challenging their "sanctuary" policies.

The lawsuit references a controversial apartment complex in Aurora, alleging that Colorado's policies allowed a Venezuelan gang to seize control of the building. Local officials deny these claims, but acknowledge issues at the complex. The suit seeks to invalidate laws that prevent local law enforcement from assisting federal immigration authorities.</p>

While Germany's 16 state governments remain reluctant to implement consistent standards, the state of Hesse plans to ban private smartphones in primary schools and, with limited exceptions, in secondary schools.

          <p>The Trump administration's practice of deporting alleged illegal aliens and gang members to El Salvador, and paying for their imprisonment without conviction, is facing constitutional challenges, primarily focusing on due process. Concerns have also been raised regarding the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on "cruel and unusual punishment," given the harsh conditions in El Salvador's prisons. While deportation alone is not considered punishment, the administration's policy of paying for incarceration in El Salvador raises questions about whether it constitutes cruel and unusual treatment. Legal experts suggest that the Supreme Court should clarify that the government cannot subvert the Bill of Rights by circumventing trials and sentences.</p>

          <p>China is reportedly considering offering to deepen cooperation with the United States in combating the flow of fentanyl, potentially sending a top security official to Washington to facilitate trade talks. This move comes as China and the U.S. are embroiled in a trade war, and Beijing has previously used cooperation on fentanyl as leverage in its relationship with Washington. To demonstrate seriousness, China has tapped Wang Xiaohong, the minister of public security, to lead any such talks with the United States on fentanyl. While China has bristled at accusations that it is responsible for the fentanyl crisis, it is willing to cooperate if the U.S. shows "sincerity".</p>

          <p>At Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholders' meeting, Warren Buffett criticized President Trump's use of tariffs to batter global commerce, stating that "trade should not be a weapon." Berkshire Hathaway is bracing for potential hits from American trade policies. Buffett acknowledged that he had previously proposed an idea to help address trade imbalances, but defended global trade flows, drawing applause. The company reported a 14 percent drop in first-quarter earnings, warning that Trump's trade policies were generating "considerable uncertainty." Berkshire's cash hoard grew to $347.7 billion, as Buffett continued to be a net seller of stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

Carlos Marin, a senior at Milby High School, chose the University of Houston-Downtown to avoid room and board expenses.
