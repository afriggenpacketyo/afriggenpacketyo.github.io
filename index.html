          <p>White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended President Trump's tariffs, claiming they won't significantly raise prices for American consumers because other countries will bear the cost. He stated that over 50 countries have approached the U.S. to negotiate trade deals due to the tariffs. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers countered that the tariffs would increase inflation and reduce consumer spending power, potentially leading to a significant economic downturn. Hassett denied that the market crash was a deliberate strategy to pressure the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.</p>

          <p>The United States is revoking all visas for South Sudanese passport holders and halting the issuance of new visas due to a dispute over repatriation. The State Department accused South Sudan of failing to comply with U.S. efforts to return its citizens, leading to the blanket measure. The move is the first time the Trump administration has targeted a group by citizenship with such a broad restriction. The action comes amid renewed conflict in South Sudan and concerns about the country's stability.</p>

          <p>A fire at The Quay pub in Wivenhoe, near Colchester, was caused by a discarded cigarette. Firefighters were called to the scene after a neighbor noticed the blaze, which had engulfed fencing and an outbuilding. The Essex County Fire and Rescue Service urged smokers to ensure cigarettes are fully extinguished and safely disposed of. The fire was contained before it reached the main pub building, preventing further damage.</p>

          <p>A Bible story about King Josiah, an ancestor of Jesus, may be true, according to a new study. Excavations at Tel Megiddo (Armageddon) reveal an Egyptian presence during Josiah's time, supporting the Biblical account of his death at the hands of Pharaoh Necho II. The findings include Egyptian pottery and Greek vessels, suggesting the presence of Greek mercenaries in the Egyptian army. The discovery provides archaeological evidence that aligns with the Biblical narrative, adding historical context to the event.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance is facing backlash for referring to Chinese people as "peasants" while discussing U.S. trade policies with China.

          <p>President Trump's new tariff regime, built on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, is facing significant implementation challenges. The policy's goals exceed the current federal government's capacity, requiring a well-resourced bureaucracy and interagency coordination. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), already understaffed and underfunded, will struggle to manage the influx of disputes and compliance actions. The lack of a formal rulemaking process and reliance on executive power further complicate the policy's effectiveness, potentially leading to economic distortions and retaliatory tariffs.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a significant downturn, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging over 2,200 points and the Nasdaq entering a bear market. The decline was triggered by concerns over the economic fallout from new U.S. tariffs and the potential for a global trade war. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that the tariffs are likely to increase inflation and slow economic growth. The market downturn erased trillions of dollars in investor wealth, leading to downgrades in U.S. economic growth forecasts.</p>
