        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. schools are increasingly adopting Yondr magnetic pouches to enforce cellphone bans, with over 2.5 million students in 35 states now utilizing them. This initiative directly addresses the widespread issue of classroom distractions, aiming to foster a more focused learning environment and improve student engagement. While the significant cost of these pouches, approximately $25-30 per student, has sparked budget debates in some districts, educators and parents largely support the effort to reduce constant smartphone reliance. Despite initial student resistance and attempts to bypass the system, many report positive social outcomes, underscoring a broader cultural shift towards re-evaluating technology's role in education.</p>

          <p>Aryna Sabalenka, the world number one, secured her second consecutive U.S. Open title by defeating American Amanda Anisimova in a challenging final, marking her fourth Grand Slam victory. This win is particularly significant as Sabalenka had faced defeats in two previous Grand Slam finals earlier in the season, raising questions about her emotional composure in major matches. Despite a strong effort from Anisimova, who improved significantly from her prior major final, Sabalenka ultimately prevailed 6-3, 7-6 (7-3). Her triumph demonstrates a renewed mental fortitude, solidifying her status as a dominant force in women's tennis.</p>

This massive prize follows 41 consecutive drawings without a winner, matching the game's longest streak. The estimated cash value for a single winner opting for a lump sum payment is $826.4 million before taxes. With tickets costing $2 and odds of winning the top prize at 1 in 292.2 million, anticipation is high for the next drawing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A California woman, Laura Lee Yourex, faces five felony charges, including perjury and casting a ballot when not entitled to vote, for allegedly registering her dog to vote. She is accused of submitting two mail-in ballots under her dog's name in the 2021 gubernatorial recall and 2022 primary elections, with one ballot reportedly counted. The investigation began after Yourex reported herself to election officials, who then discovered social media posts detailing her dog's voting activities. If convicted on all counts, Yourex could face a maximum sentence of six years in prison, underscoring the legal ramifications of such electoral misconduct.</p>

This event aimed to position China as a reliable alternative voice for global stability, especially as U.S. credibility is perceived to be wavering.

          <p>Israel's military is expanding operations in Gaza City, a declared Hamas stronghold, and has urged its nearly one million residents to evacuate to a designated humanitarian area in the southern Gaza Strip. Aid groups express grave concerns that such a large-scale displacement will severely worsen the already dire humanitarian crisis, as many Palestinians are too weak or have no safe destination. The military claims the safe zone will include essential services, but previous Israeli declarations of safe zones have reportedly been struck. This comes amid ongoing conflict, significant Palestinian casualties, and a critical lack of food and medical care, exemplified by the story of a severely malnourished toddler evacuated for treatment.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reiterated his threat to deploy troops to Chicago for immigration enforcement and crime crackdown, sharing a social media post evoking "Apocalypse Now" and the "Department of WAR." This follows similar deployments in Los Angeles and Washington D.C., with a federal court having already ruled the Los Angeles deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act. Illinois officials, including Governor JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson, have vehemently opposed these threats, vowing legal action and accusing Trump of authoritarianism. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed plans to target "criminal illegal aliens" in cities like Chicago, signaling an imminent federal intervention.</p>

Her team is expected to leverage bond market volatility to argue against increased borrowing, suggesting any fiscal gaps will necessitate higher taxes or reduced spending.

The indigenous Bedouin Jebeleya tribe, traditional guardians of St Catherine's Monastery, has been forcibly displaced and had homes demolished with little compensation. UNESCO has expressed concerns, urging Egypt to halt developments, but the government defends the project as vital for boosting tourism and the struggling economy, despite its lack of sensitivity to local communities and historical significance.</p>

Eighty-eight postal operators have suspended services to the U.S. because airlines and carriers are unwilling or unable to collect the new duties.

          <p>American AI firm Anthropic has abruptly restricted service access to Chinese-owned entities globally, causing uncertainty for several overseas AI tools backed by China's tech giants. The new policy targets entities over 50% owned by companies headquartered in "unsupported regions" like China, regardless of their operational location. This move impacts platforms such as ByteDance's Singapore-based code editor Trae, which utilizes Anthropic's Claude models, leading to user concerns about service availability and refunds. Other Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and Tencent also offer Claude on their international coding agents, signaling a significant escalation in the ongoing tech war and creating a complex landscape for AI development.</p>

          <p>Singapore is sounding a critical alarm over rapidly rising sea levels, projected to increase by up to 1.15 meters by 2100, threatening to inundate significant portions of the island nation. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong emphasized that "these are life and death matters," as 30% of Singapore lies less than 5 meters above mean sea level, endangering vital infrastructure like airports and power plants. Unlike larger nations, Singapore lacks high ground for retreat, prompting massive investments in coastal defenses like seawalls and land reclamation. This urgent response highlights the global climate crisis, driven by human-caused pollution, which is accelerating sea-level rise and extreme weather events worldwide, demanding immediate action and innovative solutions.</p>

          <p>Eleven people, including women, children, and a baby, are missing after a hippopotamus capsized their narrow, canoe-like boat on the Sassandra River in southwestern Ivory Coast. The tragic incident occurred near the town of Buyo, with only three individuals surviving, and a search operation is currently underway for the missing. Hippopotamuses are known to be highly dangerous, with a 2022 study identifying them as the species most frequently involved in fatal or injurious human interactions in Ivory Coast. This event underscores the inherent risks of navigating local waterways, where handcrafted longboats are often overloaded, making such accidents, including those involving wildlife, unfortunately common.</p>

Health Secretary Wes Streeting criticized Reform for providing a platform for "poisonous lies," leading to a party spokesperson clarifying that while they don't endorse his specific claims, they uphold free speech.

          <p>A U.S. government lab has announced a "game-changing" fusion energy breakthrough, achieving ignition through a self-contained feedback loop called burning plasma using a device named "THOR." The Thinned Hohlraum Optimization for Radflow diagnostic device, developed by a Los Alamos National Laboratory-led team, provides a clearer "window" to observe materials reacting to extreme plasma conditions. This achievement is a significant step towards realizing nearly unlimited, cleaner energy, as fusion does not produce long-lasting nuclear waste or carry meltdown risks, unlike fission reactors. While the technology also has implications for weapons development, the primary focus is on refining this diagnostic system for a sustainable energy future.</p>

          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a suspected double bomber on the FBI's most wanted list, faces extradition to the U.S. after evading capture for 21 years and being found in an isolated cottage in north Wales. San Diego is the prime suspect in a series of 2003 bombings in the San Francisco Bay Area, linked to animal rights extremist groups, which targeted firms with ties to animal testing. Former FBI agents recall "missed opportunities" to arrest him, including a high-speed chase that ended with him abandoning a car containing a suspected "bomb-making factory." His arrest by the UK's National Crime Agency after two decades highlights the persistence of international law enforcement in bringing fugitives to justice.</p>
