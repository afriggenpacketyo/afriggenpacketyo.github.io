            <p>This article challenges the negative stereotypes associated with stepmothers, drawing on historical and cultural examples to illustrate how stepmothers have been portrayed as wicked figures. It argues that these stereotypes can deter single mothers from dating parents due to fears of being perceived negatively by stepchildren. The author suggests that stepmothers should not be limited by these stereotypes and should focus on building genuine relationships with their stepchildren. The piece ultimately encourages mothers looking to date to not let the fear of being a wicked stepmother hold them back.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's economic approval rating has fallen to its lowest point, driven by discontent over tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a CNBC survey. The survey reveals a decline in economic optimism and increased pessimism about the stock market. While Trump's Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents have become more negative about his handling of the economy. Tariffs appear to be a significant factor in the public's discontent, with majorities disapproving of across-the-board tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
