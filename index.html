          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 20:28:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major banks, including JPMorgan Chase, are expressing concern over hidden risks in loans to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs) after regional lenders disclosed substantial losses from alleged fraud. This situation has drawn comparisons to the 2023 banking crisis, prompting investors to scrutinize NDFI exposures, a rapidly growing loan category. The surge in NDFI lending occurred as post-2008 regulations pushed riskier activities outside traditional banking. While some analysts believe the recent stock selloff was an "overreaction" given improving interest rates, the episode underscores potential vulnerabilities in this less-understood financial sector, with calls to avoid companies heavily exposed to such loans.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ESPN host Stephen A. Smith has sparked controversy by suggesting that LeBron James' public confrontations may be influenced by racial considerations. Smith referenced a past incident where James challenged him at a Lakers game, questioning if James would react similarly to a white commentator. Smith defended his prior criticism of James' son, Bronny, as professional sports analysis rather than a personal attack. James, in turn, has emphasized his responsibility to protect his household and players when media commentary becomes overly personal. This article highlights the ongoing tension between sports media and high-profile athletes.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has announced the immediate commutation of George Santos' seven-year federal prison sentence, leading to the disgraced former congressman's release after less than three months. Santos was convicted of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Trump justified his decision by stating Santos was "horribly mistreated" in solitary confinement and praised his consistent Republican voting record, while also comparing him to a Democratic senator. This controversial clemency grant follows a "passionate plea" from Santos and advocacy from Republican representatives, raising questions about political influence in the justice system.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced it handed over all Israeli hostage remains it could recover from Gaza, citing the extensive destruction from Israeli strikes as a hindrance to finding the remaining bodies. The Red Cross has since transferred additional coffins, with at least seven confirmed deceased hostages returned. The complete return of 28 deceased hostages was a cornerstone of the Gaza peace plan, and while Israel has accused Hamas of violating the agreement through delays, senior U.S. advisers urged patience, acknowledging the difficult conditions on the ground.

          <p>Prince Andrew has announced he will no longer use his royal titles, including Duke of York, and other honors, following sustained pressure over his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The decision, made in consultation with King Charles III and the Prince of Wales, aims to prevent continued accusations from distracting the Royal Family's work. This article notes the move comes ahead of the posthumous publication of Virginia Giuffre's memoir, who alleged sexual assault by Andrew when she was a minor, claims Andrew consistently denies. The article also mentions the financial settlement Andrew made with Ms. Giuffre in 2022.</p>
