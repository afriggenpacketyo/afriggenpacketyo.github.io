          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced scrutiny from Republican senators during a congressional hearing regarding his vaccine policies. Several GOP lawmakers, including some who are medical doctors, expressed growing concern and avoided questions about their continued confidence in his leadership. The hearing highlighted deep divisions over immunization policies, with Kennedy defending his skepticism and lawmakers questioning the administration's changes to vaccine access and CDC recommendations. The tense session underscored the political turmoil surrounding public health agencies.</p>

          <p>During a heated Senate testimony, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. affirmed his doubts about vaccine safety and clashed with Democratic senators over COVID-19 shot accessibility. He publicly agreed with a new appointee's claim that mRNA vaccines cause "serious harm," a statement that contradicts broad scientific consensus. Kennedy also denied that his administration's new policies were limiting vaccine access, despite arguments from senators that recent FDA restrictions have created confusion and barriers for patients. The hearing exposed a stark divide on public health science.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order to officially rename the Department of Defense back to its original title, the Department of War. This move is part of a broader administration campaign to instill a "warrior ethos" within the U.S. military, championed by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. The order will initially establish 'Department of War' as a secondary title and directs Hegseth to propose actions for a permanent change. The initiative aims to shift the Pentagon's cultural focus from defense to a more assertive, offense-oriented mindset.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The city of Gloucester, Massachusetts, is experiencing a pervasive "rotten egg" smell caused by large quantities of decaying invasive seaweed. Officials identified the seaweed as Heterosiphonia japonica, which was pushed onto the shore by the strong waves and winds from the recent Hurricane Erin. As the seaweed decomposes in the local estuary without a strong tide to wash it away, it releases hydrogen sulfide gas, creating the unpleasant odor. Residents have expressed significant discomfort, with the smell impacting daily life and upcoming events.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to announce an interest rate cut in September, savers are advised to take strategic actions to lock in high returns on certificates of deposit (CDs). The article suggests that individuals with significant savings should consider adjusting their deposit amount, shopping directly with online banks for better rates, and acting quickly before lenders preemptively lower their offerings. These steps are presented as crucial for maximizing interest earnings in a potentially declining rate environment for the foreseeable future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Daniel Levy's departure as Tottenham Hotspur's executive chairman leaves a complex legacy defined by a stark contrast between off-field success and on-field underachievement. While he successfully oversaw the development of a world-class stadium and training facility, transforming the club's infrastructure and financial standing, his 24-year tenure yielded only two major trophies. This lack of silverware made him a contentious figure among many supporters, who often criticized his perceived lack of ambition in the transfer market. His legacy will be debated as one of a shrewd businessman who modernized the club but failed to deliver consistent sporting glory.</p>

          <p>The UK's Home Office has successfully gained permission to challenge a High Court ruling that allowed the activist group Palestine Action to appeal its proscription under terror legislation. A co-founder of the group had been granted the appeal on the grounds that the ban could breach free speech rights. However, a Court of Appeal judge has now ruled that the government's counter-appeal has a "real prospect of success," scheduling a hearing for late September. The legal battle continues over the government's decision to ban the group following direct action protests.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the federal government's recent equity stake in Intel, framed as an investment, is a troubling step towards creating a U.S. sovereign wealth fund. The author contends that such a fund is inappropriate for a nation with significant debt, unlike resource-rich countries with budget surpluses that typically operate them. The piece warns that a U.S. fund would inevitably become politicized, leading to cronyism, market distortions, and conflicts of interest as the government acts as both regulator and shareholder.

          <p>A new provision in a Republican-backed fiscal package signed by President Trump will allow workers in certain occupations to avoid paying federal income tax on their tips. The Treasury Department has released a preliminary list of 68 qualifying jobs, which includes traditional roles like waiters and bartenders, as well as surprising additions such as plumbers and electricians. The temporary tax break, valid through 2028, has an income cap of $150,000 for individuals and applies to a maximum of $25,000 in annual tipped income, potentially saving eligible workers over a thousand dollars each year.</p>

While ICE policy generally treats schools as sensitive locations, reports of enforcement actions nearby have led to increased absenteeism in some districts. This climate of fear forces families to have difficult conversations with their children and make contingency plans, casting a shadow over what should be a routine time of year.</p>

School immunization requirements for illnesses like measles and polio have been a cornerstone of public health, helping to achieve herd immunity and protect vulnerable populations. While most states allow for medical or religious exemptions, Florida's proposal represents the most significant rollback of vaccine regulations in the U.S., reflecting a growing trend of legislative changes that could lower overall vaccination rates.</p>
