          <p>AI firm Mistral AI has reached a valuation of $14 billion after a Series C funding round led by Dutch chip equipment maker ASML, who invested 1.3 billion euros for an 11% stake. The funding round totaled 1.7 billion euros and included participation from existing investors such as Nvidia, DST Global, and Andreessen Horowitz. This investment more than doubles Mistral's previous valuation of 5.8 billion euros from last year, highlighting the continued influx of capital into the rapidly growing AI sector. Mistral, positioned as a European competitor to OpenAI, focuses on building large language models for AI applications, requiring substantial infrastructure investments. The company's growth signifies Europe's increasing role in the competitive global AI landscape.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thailand's Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra must serve a year in jail, related to a previous corruption case where he initially served only hours in prison before being moved to a hospital. The court deemed his hospital transfer unlawful, stating that his medical condition did not warrant inpatient care, thus requiring him to serve the remainder of his sentence in jail. Thaksin, who dominated Thai politics since his initial election in 2001, was ousted in a 2006 coup and later sentenced to eight years for corruption upon his return to Thailand in 2023. Despite the ruling, Thaksin vowed to continue serving the country and monarchy, while his daughter, Paetongtarn, expressed concern but affirmed the family's good spirits and commitment to the Pheu Thai party.</p>

          <p>The Murdoch family has finalized a succession agreement, positioning Lachlan Murdoch to control the family's media empire, including Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Post. This deal resolves years of internal conflict among Rupert Murdoch and his children regarding the future direction of the family-owned media outlets. Under the agreement, Lachlan will oversee a new trust, while siblings Prudence MacLeod, Elisabeth Murdoch, and James Murdoch will relinquish their shares in Fox and News Corp in exchange for cash. The resolution ends all litigation related to the family trust, ensuring the continuation of the conservative leaning of the media conglomerate after Rupert's passing. This agreement marks the end of a bitter legal battle over control of the vast media empire.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed performance on Tuesday, following gains on Wall Street driven by a tech rally, with Japan's Nikkei 225 reversing course after initially hitting a record high. Market analysts suggest the upcoming leadership change in Japan could lead to new fiscal stimulus, creating both near-term volatility and long-term pro-growth opportunities. Indonesia's Jakarta Composite Index experienced a significant drop after President Prabowo Subianto unexpectedly replaced the finance minister, causing the Indonesian rupiah to weaken. Meanwhile, U.S. markets saw the Nasdaq Composite reach a record high, fueled by gains in tech stocks such as Broadcom and Nvidia, as investors anticipate key inflation data releases this week.</p>

          <p>New league tables ranking the performance of NHS trusts in England have been released, with specialist hospitals like Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust topping the list. The rankings assess trusts on seven areas, including waiting times, cancer treatment, and finances, categorizing them into four performance levels, which aims to identify areas needing urgent support. While Health Secretary Wes Streeting emphasized the goal of ending the "postcode lottery" of care, NHS Providers raised concerns about the metrics used and their potential impact on patient confidence. The government plans to grant top performers greater autonomy and offer support to underperforming trusts, with potential pay incentives for leaders who improve struggling hospitals.</p>

          <p>The populist right, from Washington to Westminster, is attempting to rewrite history to advance its agenda, aiming to dismantle democratic achievements and erode rights for vulnerable communities. In the US, the Trump administration sought to remove "divisive" exhibits from the Smithsonian, while in the UK, Reform UK advocates for a "patriotic" approach to British history, downplaying imperialism and the slave trade. This rewriting of history serves as a narrative tool to justify policies that strip rights from marginalized groups and undermine democratic institutions. Resisting this project requires building cross-communal solidarity and defending the gains of the 20th century against those seeking to erase them.</p>

The letter describes Epstein as an "intelligent, sharp-witted man" who "parachuted" into his life. Mandelson's spokesperson stated that he regrets ever having been introduced to Epstein. The documents, part of a "birthday book" compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell, also include a drawing allegedly signed by Donald Trump, which the White House denies.</p>

          <p>Ethiopia's Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is nearing commissioning, with invitations extended to Nile Basin countries, though Egypt and Sudan's attendance is uncertain. The dam's construction was funded through government bonds and public donations, with Chinese loans supporting auxiliary infrastructure. Downstream neighbors Sudan and Egypt have expressed concerns that the dam could severely impact their water supplies, but Ethiopia dismisses these claims. The GERD project has united Ethiopians and could serve as a model for other African countries, while negotiations on water-sharing continue.</p>

          <p>Police have released the first images of a campsite where Tom Phillips, a New Zealand father on the run, hid with his three children for years. Two of Phillips' children were found at the site hours after he was killed in a shootout with police, with the third child assisting in the search. Phillips disappeared with his children in 2021 after losing legal custody of them, and the children are now in the care of authorities. Authorities are investigating how Phillips evaded capture and obtained firearms, as the case has gripped New Zealand for nearly four years.</p>

Johnson expressed opposition to militarized immigration enforcement, citing concerns about human rights abuses, and urged residents to visit a "know your rights" resource hub.

          <p>A former Meta employee has filed a whistleblower lawsuit alleging that WhatsApp has "systemic cybersecurity failures" that compromise user privacy. Attaullah Baig, WhatsApp's former head of security, claims that Meta retaliated against him after he reported the security issues to leaders, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The suit alleges that approximately 1,500 WhatsApp engineers had unrestricted access to user data, and that the employees "could move or steal such data without detection or audit trail." Meta disputes Baig's allegations, claiming he was dismissed for poor performance.</p>

She offered to collaborate with Sir Keir Starmer to reduce welfare spending, emphasizing the need for both cuts and growth to escape a cycle of rising taxes and precarious public finances. Badenoch cited rising UK borrowing costs as an indicator of a potential crisis, while a Labour Party source criticized her for offering advice after the Conservative government's economic performance. The Conservatives have two key demands for working with Sir Keir, which are maintaining the two child benefit cap and slashing welfare.</p>

Duffy suggested that federal transportation funding is at risk for cities that don’t work to curb violence on public transit, emphasizing President Trump's "zero tolerance" message regarding crime.
