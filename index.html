          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a prominent voice and victim in the Jeffrey Epstein sex-trafficking scandal, has died at the age of 41. Giuffre alleged she was sexually abused by Epstein and his associates, including Prince Andrew, when she was a teenager. Her family stated that she died by suicide, referencing an Instagram post in March where she mentioned renal failure after a car accident. Giuffre's involvement in bringing Epstein's crimes to light and fighting against sexual abuse made her a significant figure in the #MeToo movement.</p>

          <p>A parenting coach who has studied over 200 children identifies the phrase "You're okay" as a dangerous and overused response to children's emotional distress. The coach argues that this phrase teaches children to doubt their emotions, invalidates their experiences, and short-circuits emotional processing. It can also condition children to suppress their emotions to maintain acceptance and rewire their stress response. Instead, parents should validate children's feelings and help them identify, name, and regulate their emotions.</p>
