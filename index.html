          <p>The Bank of Russia has lowered its key interest rate to 20%, marking the first cut since September 2022, signaling a decrease in inflation pressures that President Putin had previously described as "alarming". The decision comes as seasonally-adjusted inflation in April reached 6.2%, a notable drop from the 8.2% average in the first quarter of 2025. While domestic demand continues to outpace the expansion of goods and services, the central bank believes the Russian economy is gradually stabilizing.

          <p>Tesla shares rose by 5% on Friday following a significant drop triggered by a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump.

The conflict arose after Musk criticized Trump's proposed tax and spending bill, leading to a sharp decline in Tesla's market capitalization.

          <p>India's Air Force (IAF) is struggling with an aging fleet and significant delays in defense procurement, leading to public criticism from its chief, Amar Preet Singh.

Crypto ETNs, a type of debt instrument linked to cryptocurrencies, have been prohibited in the UK since 2019 due to consumer protection concerns. The FCA believes that lifting the ban would allow informed choices on high-risk investments, while restrictions on crypto derivatives will remain.

          <p>An analysis of teen movies reveals how they reflect shifting anxieties and moral panics, from rebellious teens to concerns about social media and mental health. Early teen films focused on rebellion and challenging adult authority, while more recent films explore issues like bullying, social media influence, and anxiety. The author suggests that modern teen films are increasingly focused on the struggles of teens to navigate a complex and stressful world. The portrayal of teens in media continues to evolve, reflecting the changing landscape of adolescence.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a slowdown in job growth in May, adding 139,000 jobs as businesses grapple with uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump's trade policies. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics revised down job creation numbers for March and April. The loss of 22,000 federal jobs due to the "department of government efficiency" (Doge) also contributed to the slowdown. Economists are closely monitoring trade talks between the U.S. and China for potential impacts on the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK has changed its position on the Western Sahara conflict, with Foreign Secretary David Lammy stating that Morocco's autonomy plan represents the "most credible" solution. This marks a shift from London's previous support for a UN-led referendum on the region's future. The move aligns the UK with other Western countries that support Morocco's claim, likely angering Algeria, which backs the Polisario Front seeking an independent state. Experts suggest the UK's decision is likely driven by economic interests and growing trade relations with Morocco.</p>
