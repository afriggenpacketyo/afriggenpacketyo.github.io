          <p>The Department of Labor is suspending operations at contractor-operated Job Corps centers nationwide following a transparency report that revealed poor graduation rates and numerous serious incident reports, including sexual assaults, violence, and drug use. The Job Corps program, costing taxpayers $1.7 billion annually, has an average graduation rate of just 32%, with graduates often finding only minimum wage jobs. Officials cite a $140 million deficit for program year 2024, projected to grow to $213 million in 2025, necessitating the pause to save approximately $119 million. The Department of Labor plans to reassess the program's alignment with workforce priorities and ensure students are connected to resources and employment opportunities during the transition.</p>

          <p>The White House has condemned a ruling by a trade court that blocked President Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs, labeling it as "judicial overreach" and urging the Supreme Court to intervene. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt argued that Trump was using his full legal authority to address the threat to national security and the economy posed by trade deficits. Leavitt asserted that the ruling could undermine sensitive diplomatic or trade negotiations, but noted that Trump retains other tariff authorities, such as Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.</p>

Democratic lawmakers have expressed security concerns, suggesting the plane could grant a foreign nation access to sensitive systems, while Republican lawmakers question the ethics of accepting a gift from a foreign government.

The UN reports that negligible quantities of food are reaching the people who need it due to a lack of secure routes for distribution.

The meeting occurred amid ongoing tariff uncertainty and repeated calls from Trump for Powell to lower interest rates, with Trump previously threatening to remove him from his position.

The administration alleges Harvard is hostile to Jewish students and promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, which the university argues is retaliation for exercising its First Amendment rights.

          <p>The Federal Reserve issued a rare statement asserting its independence after Chair Jerome Powell met with President Trump, emphasizing its nonpartisan role in setting monetary policy based on economic data. Powell told Trump that the Fed will set monetary policy to support maximum employment and stable prices, relying solely on objective analysis. The statement highlights the Fed's awareness of Trump's pressure campaign to lower interest rates, as the president has repeatedly criticized Powell's decisions. Trump has called Powell a "fool" for not lowering rates and has even threatened to remove him from his post.</p>

          <p>Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, the renowned Kenyan writer and novelist known for his critique of colonial rule, has died at the age of 87. His career began in 1964 with the novel *Weep Not, Child*, a significant work about a family living in colonial Kenya during the Mau Mau rebellion. He was a strong advocate for writing in local African languages, exemplified by his 1980 novel, *Devil on the Cross*, which was published in Gikuyu. Ngũgĩ's work often explored the disconnection of the elite from their linguistic base and the importance of African languages in contributing original perspectives to the world.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has placed new limits on the scope of federally mandated environmental impact statements for major transportation and energy projects. The decision in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County was 8-0, with Justice Kavanaugh writing for the majority that use of NEPA to stymie energy and infrastructure programs has gotten out of hand. The dispute focused on the purpose of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, which requires federal agencies to study the significant environmental effects of a project. Kavanaugh said the law imposed merely a "modest procedural requirement," not a study of possible impacts far afield from actual construction.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that regardless of climate mitigation strategies, the world’s glaciers are on track to shrink significantly over hundreds of years. Even if global temperatures remained at current levels, glaciers outside of ice sheets would lose roughly one-third of their mass. However, limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius could save about twice as much ice compared to the current trajectory of 2.7 degrees Celsius. The study underscores the importance of ambitious climate measures to preserve glacial ice, as glaciers play a significant role in sea level rise and provide crucial freshwater sources.</p>

          <p>A former personal assistant to Sean Combs, identified as "Mia," testified about a grueling work environment in which she was subjected to sleep deprivation, violence, and multiple instances of sexual assault by her boss. Mia described being thrown against the wall, into a pool, and having an ice bucket dumped on her head, as well as being forced to perform oral sex and being penetrated against her will. Mia's testimony helps establish a pattern of how Mr. Combs treated women, corroborating the account of Casandra Ventura. Combs has pleaded not guilty to all charges.</p>
