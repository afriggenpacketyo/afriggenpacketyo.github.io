          <p>A Los Angeles jury has cleared rapper Cardi B in a lawsuit brought by a security guard who accused her of assault in 2018. The guard, Emani Ellis, sought $24 million in damages, claiming the rapper spat on her and cut her with a fingernail during an altercation at a Beverly Hills medical building. Cardi B, who was pregnant at the time, contended that the guard was filming her against her wishes and invading her privacy. The jury sided with the artist, absolving her of any financial liability in the case.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has strongly opposed President Trump's announcement of plans to send federal agents to Chicago, labeling the president's remarks as "unhinged." Pritzker stated he would not request such assistance and warned that the administration is likely preparing for raids in Latino communities under the guise of targeting violent criminals. The governor expressed concern over the lack of coordination with local and state authorities, suggesting the move is a political maneuver rather than a genuine effort to address violence. Trump has maintained that he has an obligation to intervene to protect the country.</p>

The release of 33,295 pages follows a subpoena from Chairman James Comer, who intends to expand the investigation after meeting with Epstein's victims. Democratic members have noted that a large portion of the files were already public, but the move addresses pressure on the Trump administration to increase transparency regarding the case.

          <p>Following a market downturn, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to maintain confidence in the companies they own for long-term success. He attributed the decline to routine profit-taking in major tech stocks, noting that September is historically a challenging month for the market. Cramer also pointed to investor concerns over a recent court ruling on tariffs and anticipation for the upcoming labor report as contributing factors. He recommended holding onto strong growth stocks like Nvidia and Apple, cautioning against making reactive decisions based on a single day's performance. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zack Polanski's landslide victory as the new leader of the Green Party of England and Wales may reshape the landscape of left-wing politics in the United Kingdom. His blunt, digitally-savvy communication style presents a new challenge for the Labour Party, which is already facing pressure from other factions. Polanski's alignment with figures like Jeremy Corbyn could lead to either collaboration or competition for the same voter base, potentially cannibalizing support among progressive groups.

          <p>Filmmaker Woody Allen described President Trump as "polite" and "a pleasure to work with" during an appearance on Bill Maher's "Club Random" podcast, referencing Trump's cameo in the 1998 film "Celebrity." Allen expressed surprise that Trump pursued politics, while also stating he disagrees with the president on nearly all policy issues and voted for Kamala Harris. The commentary drew criticism, particularly given Allen's own controversial legacy and Trump's contentious presidency. Host Bill Maher, who has also described Trump as "gracious" after a private dinner, played along, further fueling debate about the normalization of the president's behavior.</p>

          <p>President Trump has recently claimed to have ended six or seven wars, suggesting he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize, but foreign policy experts say the record is more complex. The White House cited conflicts involving Israel-Iran, Rwanda-DRC, and India-Pakistan, among others. While the administration played a role in brokering ceasefires and agreements in some of these disputes, experts note that many were not full-scale wars and several conflicts remain unresolved. For instance, tensions between Israel and Iran persist, and violence has continued in the Democratic Republic of Congo despite a peace deal.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has grown to an estimated $1.3 billion, making it the fifth-largest in the game's history. While the odds of winning are 1 in 292.2 million, the take-home amount varies significantly depending on the winner's state of residence due to differing tax laws. States like California and Florida do not tax lottery winnings, allowing a winner to keep more of the prize after federal taxes. In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York, would result in the lowest after-tax payout for the winner. This drawing is the 41st since the last jackpot was won in May.</p>

          <p>The arrest of Irish comedy writer Graham Linehan in Britain for allegedly "inciting violence" has intensified the debate over free speech and hate-speech laws in Europe. Linehan, known for his vocal criticism of transgender activism, was reportedly arrested for a social media post suggesting a hypothetical physical response to a trans-identified male in a female-only space. Critics argue his arrest is an example of overzealous policing and the selective enforcement of vague laws, which they claim are used to suppress disfavored opinions. The incident underscores a wider concern that such laws, intended to protect minorities, are chilling public discourse and creating a perception of two-tier justice.</p>

Instead, the ruling focuses on ending exclusive default-search-engine contracts and requiring Google to share some search data with rivals. The decision was viewed as a significant win for the tech giant, alleviating concerns about a forced break-up of its core assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The government in England is planning to introduce a new law banning the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to anyone under the age of 16. The proposed legislation would apply to all retail points, including shops, cafes, and online stores, targeting drinks like Red Bull and Prime. This move addresses growing concerns from parents, teachers, and health experts about the negative effects of excessive caffeine consumption on young people, which can include headaches, sleep problems, and heart issues. While many supermarkets have a voluntary ban, this law would make the restriction mandatory to protect youth health.</p>

          <p>Veteran Washington D.C. lawyer Abbe Lowell is representing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook in her legal battle against President Trump's attempt to fire her. Lowell has a long history of representing high-profile clients from both political parties, including Hunter Biden, Jared Kushner, and New York Attorney General Letitia James. Known for challenging government overreach regardless of the administration in power, Lowell has framed the case as another instance of the Trump administration weaponizing federal agencies for political retribution. His involvement brings significant legal experience to a case with major implications for the independence of the Federal Reserve.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged a tow truck driver with theft of government property for allegedly driving off with an agent's vehicle during the arrest of a TikTok influencer in Los Angeles. The incident occurred as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were arresting Tatiana Mafla-Martinez, whose arrest was captured on a viral livestream. Authorities allege that Bobby Nunez interfered by towing one of the government vehicles used to block the influencer's car, laughing and recording the pursuing officer with his phone. The case highlights the tense confrontations occurring between the public and federal immigration agents.</p>

          <p>In a landmark antitrust ruling, a federal judge ordered Google to implement significant changes to its business practices but stopped short of forcing a breakup of the company. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google must end its exclusive deals that make it the default search engine on devices and must also share some of its valuable search data with competitors. However, the judge rejected the Department of Justice's most severe proposal to compel the sale of the Chrome web browser, stating a divestiture was not justified. The decision marks a major moment in tech regulation, aiming to curb Google's monopoly power without dismantling its core operations.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will now have access to Graphite, a powerful spyware tool capable of hacking into mobile phones and encrypted apps. The Trump administration lifted a hold on a contract with Paragon Solutions, an Israeli-founded company, that was initially paused under the Biden administration for a compliance review. Civil liberties groups have expressed alarm, as the technology gives a domestic law enforcement agency a potent surveillance weapon previously associated with targeting dissidents and journalists abroad. The decision raises significant concerns about privacy, due process, and the potential for misuse against individuals within the United States.</p>

Kennedy Jr., stating his policies are "endangering every American's health." In an open letter, they condemned his actions, including restricting vaccine access, cutting research funding, and firing thousands of healthcare workers, which they argue could lead to another pandemic. Kennedy, a known vaccine skeptic, defended his tenure by claiming the CDC had lost public trust due to "politicized science" and that his reforms are necessary.
