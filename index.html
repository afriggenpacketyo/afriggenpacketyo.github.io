          <p>The Director General of Deutsche Welle has strongly condemned an incident where Israeli soldiers fired tear gas directly at a DW news crew in the occupied West Bank. The journalists, who were clearly identified with 'PRESS' markings, were documenting the risks faced by media professionals in the region when they were targeted. This event follows a similar attack in July where Israeli settlers targeted another DW team. DW's leadership has called on the Israeli government to ensure the safety of all journalists, emphasizing that press freedom is a fundamental pillar of democracy.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has fired four employees who participated in a protest and sit-in at the office of company president Brad Smith. The demonstration, organized by the group 'No Azure for Apartheid,' was a response to reports that the Israeli military uses Microsoft's Azure cloud platform for surveillance in Gaza and the West Bank. The company stated the terminations were due to serious violations of policy that created safety concerns for other employees. In response to the protests, Microsoft has launched a formal investigation into Israel's use of its technology to ensure compliance with its human rights principles and terms of service.</p>

          <p>A former Justice Department employee, Sean Charles Dunn, who was fired after being accused of throwing a sandwich at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent, has been charged with a misdemeanor.

The U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, Jeanine Pirro, stated that despite the grand jury's decision, her office will pursue the misdemeanor charges and seek the maximum allowable penalties.</p>

During the incident, two men entered the residence through an unlocked door and attacked the nanny with bear spray while the rapper's three children were asleep. The investigation led authorities to a jewelry store where items from Macklemore's home, including a distinguishable Seattle Sounders ring, and other recent burglaries were recovered. The suspect was arrested as part of a broader investigation into high-profile burglaries targeting celebrities and sports figures in the area.</p>

          <p>Hilda Solis, a Los Angeles County Supervisor and former U.S. Secretary of Labor, has officially announced her campaign for a U.S. House seat, contingent on California voters approving new congressional district maps in a November special election. The proposed redistricting, pushed by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to create more Democratic-leaning districts and could be crucial in determining control of Congress.

          <p>Montreal-based luxury fashion retailer SSENSE has announced its intention to file for creditor protection, citing a severe liquidity crisis. The company's CEO pointed to increased trade pressures, particularly President Trump's recent executive order suspending the 'de minimis' exemption, which had allowed for duty-free shipping on U.S.-bound packages valued under $800. This policy change, combined with other market challenges, has created significant financial strain on the popular e-commerce firm. The company plans to continue operations as it undergoes restructuring to safeguard its assets and future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Conservative Party has formally requested an investigation into the tax affairs of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. The request centers on allegations that she may have inappropriately avoided paying a higher rate of stamp duty on the purchase of a flat by declaring it as her main residence. While there is no suggestion of illegal activity, the Tories argue it represents inappropriate tax avoidance for a minister. A spokesperson for Rayner stated that she paid all relevant duties properly and has complied with all tax regulations.</p>

Despite this, consumer spending rose by 0.5%, suggesting Americans are continuing to spend, though many are making cautious trade-offs. The data keeps the Federal Reserve on track for a potential interest rate cut at its September meeting as it balances controlling inflation with supporting a softening job market.

Researchers interpret the toad, an Andean symbol for water and fertility, along with wall carvings of malnourished individuals, as evidence that the population suffered from prolonged drought.

The mid-decade redistricting effort was pushed by the Trump administration as a way to bolster the GOP's slim majority in the U.S. House of Representatives ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Democrats and voting rights advocates have condemned the new map, arguing that it unfairly targets and marginalizes voters of color. Multiple lawsuits have already been filed to challenge the legality of the new districts.</p>

          <h2>Michigan Governor Calls Special Election for State Senate Seat That Could Result in a Tied Chamber</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has scheduled a special election for a state Senate seat that has been vacant for nearly nine months. The election is critical because the Democrats currently hold a slim 19-18 majority in the chamber. If a Republican wins the seat, the Senate will be tied, giving the GOP the ability to block the Democratic governor's legislative agenda during her final year in office. Republicans had heavily criticized Whitmer for the long delay in calling the election, accusing her of trying to protect her party's narrow majority.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is in a state of turmoil after a chaotic week that saw its director, Susan Monarez, fired after less than a month on the job. In her place, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has appointed one of his top advisors, Jim O'Neill, a non-scientist with a background in tech investment. The shakeup prompted the immediate resignations of three other top CDC leaders, including the chief medical officer, who cited ethical concerns over the new, anti-science direction of the agency and a desire to make a strong statement of protest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to cut $5 billion in foreign aid that Congress has already allocated by using a rare budgetary maneuver known as a "pocket rescission." By requesting to claw back the funds so late in the fiscal year, the money could expire before Congress has time to act. The move, which has not been tried in nearly 50 years, effectively circumvents the legislative branch's power of the purse. Lawmakers from both parties have condemned the action as a potential violation of the law and an undermining of the appropriations process.</p>

          <p>Generative AI has become deeply integrated into the educational landscape, with high school and college students now using it for a wide array of academic tasks. This normalization has created a significant challenge for educators, many of whom are also using AI for tasks like curriculum planning. The article explores this new reality as a breaking point for traditional pedagogy, as the technology erodes the value of standard assignments like essays. This shift is forcing a broader conversation about the purpose of education and whether it should adapt by focusing more on practical skills or by reinforcing traditional critical thinking.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has canceled the Secret Service detail for former Vice President Kamala Harris, seven months after she left office. While former vice presidents are legally entitled to six months of protection, this period can be extended by the president, as was reportedly done by former President Joe Biden before his term ended. The decision to withdraw her security has been criticized by prominent Democrats as a politically motivated and vindictive act. The administration has not provided a detailed reason, though a recent threat assessment reportedly found nothing to warrant an extension.</p>

          <p>A UK Court of Appeal has overturned a High Court injunction that would have forced the removal of 138 asylum seekers from The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex. The initial injunction was granted to the local council, which argued the hotel's use as asylum accommodation breached planning rules, following a series of large protests. However, the appellate judges ruled the original decision was "seriously flawed" because it failed to consider the significant challenge of relocating the migrants. The asylum seekers will now remain at the hotel pending a full hearing on a permanent injunction.</p>

This statement suggests a potential warming of ties between the two most populous nations, which have experienced significant diplomatic and military tensions in recent years. Modi's comments come as India continues to navigate its complex geopolitical position, balancing its wariness of China's growing power with its own strategic relationships, including with the United States and its allies in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

He contrasts his son's first day with his own starkly different childhood education in a rural Ugandan "church school" with a dirt floor and no windows. The author reflects on his journey, the generosity of the American family who adopted him, and the profound sense of gratitude he feels for the opportunities now available to his child. It is a personal story of sacrifice, hope, and the dream of a better future coming full circle.</p>

          <p>For senior homeowners looking to tap into their home's equity without sacrificing a low mortgage rate, several alternatives to refinancing exist. A reverse mortgage, available to those 62 and older, converts equity into payments for the homeowner, with repayment deferred until the owner moves or passes away. Home equity loans offer a lump sum at a fixed interest rate, which have recently been declining. Alternatively, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) provides a flexible credit line with variable rates, allowing homeowners to borrow only what they need. (not investment advice)</p>
