          <p>House Republicans have introduced legislation proposing $880 billion in cuts, largely to Medicaid, to offset $4.5 trillion in tax breaks, touching off a major political battle over healthcare. The cuts, which Republicans say will eliminate waste and fraud, include new work and eligibility requirements for Medicaid. Democrats warn that these changes will cause millions of Americans to lose healthcare coverage, with a preliminary estimate suggesting 8.6 million people could become uninsured over the next decade. The article notes uncertain political prospects for the bill given internal GOP divisions and Trump's prior promises to protect Medicaid.</p>

          <p>A significant power outage in Spain, Portugal, and southern France has ignited a debate about the role of renewable energy in ensuring energy security. The blackout, which affected the entire Iberian Peninsula, disrupted services and stranded thousands. While Spanish authorities are investigating the cause, some observers have suggested that the region's reliance on wind and solar power may have contributed to the issue. However, the Spanish Prime Minister and grid operator maintain that record levels of renewable energy were not responsible for the blackout, sparking further discussion on the stability of green energy sources.</p>

The elections, which will determine the composition of the Senate and House of Representatives, are seen as pivotal for the political future of Duterte's daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, who faces impeachment. The article highlights the potential impact of the elections on the Duterte family's continued hold on key positions in the country.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have released a plan that would cut Medicaid health coverage for millions of poor Americans and increase healthcare costs for others, while stopping short of deeper overhauls. The proposal, part of a larger bill enacting President Trump's agenda, aims to reduce federal spending by $912 billion over a decade, with $715 billion coming from Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. The legislation includes work requirements for Medicaid eligibility and increased paperwork, but excludes policies that would create large holes in state budgets. Democrats immediately criticized the package as an attack on vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>Wildlife experts are exploring the possibility of reintroducing elk to the East Midlands and the UK for the first time in approximately 3,000 years. The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Wildlife Trusts have secured funding to conduct feasibility studies into their return, considering elk a 'keystone' species that can enhance habitats for other wildlife. Challenges include gaining public acceptance and conducting disease risk assessments. The successful reintroduction of beavers in parts of the UK could serve as a guide for this project, with initial plans to keep elk and beavers in the same enclosure.</p>

          <p>Bridgend council in Wales has faced criticism for a PowerPoint presentation intended for use in schools that appeared to endorse strangulation during sex. The presentation included a slide stating, 'It is never OK to start choking someone without asking them first,' raising concerns among experts and politicians. While the council claims the slide was part of a draft version and was removed following feedback, critics question why such content was ever deemed appropriate. The Welsh government has clarified that non-fatal strangulation is dangerous and illegal, and Bridgend council stated that the slide was intended to stimulate debate before advising participants about the dangers.</p>

The government's attempts to defang the movement have failed, and protesters are now calling for early elections.

Israeli PM's office said it had not committed to any ceasefire but only to a 'safe corridor' for Alexander's release, while preparing to intensify fighting. Alexander, 21, was captured by Hamas militants during the 7 October attack and is believed to be the last living captive with US nationality in Gaza.</p>
