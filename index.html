          <p>Political analyst Charles M. Blow reflects on the shifting mood in America regarding pluralism and racial justice. He notes that corporate sponsors are becoming hesitant to support Juneteenth-related activities, signaling a "Great Blackout" in some quarters. Blow cites examples such as the dismantling of the Black Lives Matter Plaza street mural in Washington, D.C., and the removal of Harriet Tubman's image from a National Park Service page. He observes that multiple cities have cancelled Juneteenth celebrations, indicating that America's youngest national holiday is caught in the crossfire of culture wars. The analyst finds that this represents a sad new reality for America. </p>

          <p>Following citywide Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, Los Angeles is experiencing heightened tensions and protests, leading to calls for "mass mobilization." President Trump has ordered the deployment of at least 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles County after clashes between immigration authorities and demonstrators. The protests were sparked by ICE officers executing search warrants at multiple locations and reports of migration detentions outside various stores. Advocates for immigrants' rights and community members express fear and outrage over the federal law enforcement actions. </p>

          <p>Fresh photographs of China’s two sixth-generation fighter jets, the Chengdu J-36 and Shenyang J-50, have revealed more clues about the warplanes, including their potential cruising capacity and ability to work with combat drones. The latest image of the larger J-36 fighter, which started circulating on social media on Saturday, offers the closest look at the mysterious jet so far. Peter Layton said the latest image confirmed the J-36’s three weapons bays – one large and two smaller – and the dorsal intake for the third engine. That suggests it is there to provide the additional thrust needed for cruising at supersonic speeds – something two engines alone probably cannot achieve, according to Layton.</p>

          <p>The government is considering introducing tougher online safety measures to limit the amount of time children can spend on social media. Proposals include a two-hour cap on the use of individual social media apps and a 22:00 curfew. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said he was looking at the "addictive nature of some of the apps and smartphones."
