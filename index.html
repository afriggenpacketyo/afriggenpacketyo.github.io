          <p>President Trump has ordered an investigation into former President Biden's administration, focusing on the use of an autopen to sign presidential documents and allegations of a "conspiracy" to conceal Biden's cognitive decline. The investigation will examine whether Biden's aides used the autopen to abuse presidential signature power and deceive the public about Biden's mental state. Biden has refuted the claims, calling them false and a distraction. Presidents have used autopens for decades, and a 2005 Justice Department opinion stated they are legal for signing bills into law.</p>

          <p>Negotiations over Iran's nuclear program face uncertainty as the U.S. and Iran clash over the terms of an interim agreement. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rejected the proposal, vowing not to halt uranium enrichment on Iranian soil. This stance contrasts with President Trump's assertion that the agreement would prohibit any enrichment. Optimism has cooled, with an Iranian official calling the U.S.' proposed terms "unreasonable, greedy and unconventional."</p>

          <p>President Trump has barred most international students from entering the United States to study at Harvard University, escalating the administration's conflict with the Ivy League school. The proclamation suspends entry for foreign students unless their entry is deemed in the national interest, and it directs the Secretary of State to consider revoking visas of current student visa holders. The order claims Harvard is no longer a trustworthy steward of international student programs, citing failures to report disciplinary records and ties to researchers in China. Harvard has responded, calling the order an illegal retaliatory step violating their First Amendment rights.</p>

An essential feature of the evolution of birds was the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift.</p>

          <p>Drug safety experts are advising women using weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro to stop if they are trying to conceive, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding. There are concerns that these medications could harm an unborn baby, although the exact effects are not yet known. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) advises women to use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward. There are also concerns that the weight-loss injections may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives.</p>
