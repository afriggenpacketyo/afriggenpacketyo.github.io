          <p>A federal judge, appointed by Donald Trump, has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice against the entire Maryland federal judiciary. The lawsuit challenged a standing order that temporarily prevented the deportation of undocumented immigrants for at least one day after they filed a legal challenge to their detention. The judge stated that the dispute was nonjusticiable and that the judges were absolutely immune from the lawsuit, criticizing the executive branch's 'unprecedented and unfortunate' effort to 'smear and impugn' individual judges. The article highlights the ongoing tension between the executive and judicial branches regarding immigration policies. This ruling underscores the judiciary's independence in such inter-branch conflicts.</p>

Factors like credit score, income stability, and home equity play crucial roles in determining eligibility and interest rates.

Trump cited allegations of mortgage fraud against Cook, which her lawyer, Abbe Lowell, contends lack factual or legal basis. Cook maintains that Trump lacks the authority to fire a Fed governor 'for cause' under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which typically requires malfeasance while a board member. This article highlights a potential legal battle that could reach the Supreme Court, raising questions about the independence of the Federal Reserve and presidential powers.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the mortgage interest rate forecast for fall 2025, with experts anticipating potential slight declines despite the Federal Reserve's September meeting. While the Fed may cut the federal funds rate, mortgage rates are more closely tied to the bond market. Analysts project rates could fall closer to the 6% mark by the end of the year, a significant psychological barrier that could attract a 'flood of buyers.' However, increased demand could also push home prices higher, creating a double-edged sword for prospective homebuyers. The article advises consumers to shop around and maintain good credit.

          <p>The student housing market is experiencing a notable shift, with luxury amenities losing their appeal as consumers become more concerned about the economy. Rent growth has slowed significantly, and average advertised asking rents have decreased, indicating operators are struggling to lease inventory. Robert Bronstein, CEO of Scion, a major student housing owner, notes a trend where both lower-end and higher-end students are opting for more affordable, functional housing over new buildings with lavish features like hot tubs. The article highlights a growing preference for practical amenities like co-working spaces over recreational ones.

          <p>Poundland, the UK budget retailer with 800 stores and 14,700 staff, has successfully avoided administration after the High Court approved its turnaround plan.

The rescue deal involves a significant cash injection of £90 million from private equity firm Gordon Brothers, a three-year extension on loan repayments, and rent reductions for unprofitable stores. The article highlights Poundland's commitment to stabilizing the business by revamping ranges, lowering prices, and streamlining operations, despite previously announcing 68 store closures.
