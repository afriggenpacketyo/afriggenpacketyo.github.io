          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter, appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1990, passed away at his home in New Hampshire at the age of 85. Souter often sided with liberal justices, frustrating Bush and other Republicans, and his relatively early retirement allowed President Barack Obama to appoint Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Roberts noted that Souter served the court with great distinction and wisdom for nearly 20 years, continuing to serve on the U.S Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit after his retirement. Justice Souter's death marks the end of a long career in public service.</p>

          <p>A pro-Palestinian rally at Brooklyn College turned chaotic on Thursday, resulting in physical altercations between demonstrators and police, multiple arrests, and an officer deploying a Taser. The unrest followed the arrest of 80 people at Columbia University after a pro-Palestinian demonstration occupied a portion of the main library, prompting university officials to call in the police. Tensions escalated as demonstrators exited the college grounds and gathered outside the Tanger Hillel House, leading to further arrests and aggressive actions by officers. College officials stated that the demonstrators violated college policy by setting up tents and that the safety of the campus community remains paramount.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to make an uncontrolled reentry into Earth's atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft never reached its intended destination of Venus and has been orbiting Earth for over five decades. Experts predict that parts of the spacecraft, built to withstand Venus's harsh atmosphere, may survive reentry, potentially resulting in a half-ton metal object falling from the sky. While the risk of the spacecraft hitting someone is low, space debris crashing back to Earth could pose a growing problem for aircraft.</p>

          <p>Japan Rugby League One is planning to alter its player registration rules to ensure domestic players receive more playing time. Starting from the 2026-27 season, at least eight of the fifteen players on each team must meet certain conditions, such as being Japanese-born, and be on the pitch simultaneously during a match. The new system will divide Category A players into "A1" and "A2," with A1 players being from Japan and A2 potentially including players from other countries, even those who have played for the Brave Blossoms. This change aims to promote the development and visibility of Japanese rugby talent within the league.</p>

          <p>David H. Souter, a Republican appointed to the Supreme Court by President George H.W. Bush, died at 85, having served for 19 years and becoming a key member of the court's liberal wing. Souter, a private and intellectual man, retired at 69 to return to New Hampshire, allowing President Barack Obama to appoint Sonia Sotomayor to fill his seat. He surprised conservatives with his alignment with liberal justices, leading to disappointment among Republicans who had hoped for a more conservative vote. Despite being appointed by a Republican president, Souter's judicial philosophy emphasized a Constitution that could evolve over time to encompass concepts not explicitly mentioned in the text, such as the right to privacy.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that the severe storms in the central Mississippi valley in early April, which caused significant death and destruction, were made more likely and intense by the burning of fossil fuels. The storms dumped record rainfall across eight states, resulting in catastrophic flooding and substantial economic damages estimated between $80 billion and $90 billion. The study found that human-caused climate change increased the rainfall intensity by about 9% and made such events 40% more likely. The analysis also points to the critical role of the National Weather Service in issuing timely warnings, despite facing budget cuts and staff layoffs.</p>

The poll results reveal that 54% of California registered voters think Newsom is prioritizing his potential presidential candidacy over addressing problems within the state.

          <p>President Donald Trump suggested he might lower tariffs on China to 80% ahead of crucial trade talks, though this rate remains significantly higher than desired by investors and businesses. The Treasury Secretary is scheduled to meet with Chinese counterparts in Switzerland, but it is uncertain whether Trump intends this as a long-term tariff or a negotiation tactic. China is a major U.S. trading partner, and recent data shows a sharp decline in goods moving from China to the U.S., raising concerns about price increases and potential shortages. The talks are not expected to yield a full trade deal but aim to establish stability for future negotiations.</p>

The U.S.-Canadian border is the longest international border globally, shaped by treaties between 1783 and 1925, largely following the 49th parallel. While technically man-made, the border has real-world consequences and is actively monitored in many areas, with historical significance to Indigenous territories and trade routes.</p>

          <h2>Fetterman's Defenders Accused of Hypocrisy</h2>

          <p>Conservatives are being accused of hypocrisy for defending Senator John Fetterman despite evidence of his unfitness for office, mirroring how liberals previously defended President Joe Biden. A recent profile in New York magazine detailed concerns about Fetterman's mental health, prompting conservatives to dismiss the story as a politically motivated hit piece due to his recent rightward shift. Critics argue that conservatives are ignoring evidence of erratic behavior and mental health struggles, similar to how some liberals downplayed concerns about Biden's cognitive decline. This hyper-partisan approach prioritizes defending one's own side over upholding consistent standards.</p>
