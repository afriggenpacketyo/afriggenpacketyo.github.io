            <p>Secretary of State Rubio asserts the U.S. government's right to revoke visas of individuals who pose a threat to national security or violate U.S. laws. This includes those who support terrorist activities or compromise foreign policy interests. Rubio emphasizes that visiting America is a privilege, not an entitlement, and the U.S. will not hesitate to act decisively against those who seek to harm the nation or its citizens. The policy aims to safeguard national security by continuously monitoring visa holders and revoking visas when necessary.</p>

            <p>Beijing and northern China experienced severe gales, leading to the cancellation of hundreds of flights and suspension of train services. Wind gusts reached up to 93 mph, the strongest in Beijing in over half a century, prompting authorities to issue an orange alert and advise residents to stay indoors. While some damage to vehicles and fallen trees were reported, no injuries occurred as most residents heeded the warnings. The strong winds originated from a cold vortex system over Mongolia and are expected to subside by Sunday.</p>

            <p>The Church of England's commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2030 is facing criticism from clergy and wardens who claim it is harming rural churches. Restrictions on new oil or gas boilers have left many churches without heating, putting parishioners' health at risk and causing attendance to decline. The cost of green alternatives, coupled with falling attendance, is exacerbating the problem, leading some churches to break the law to protect their congregations. The Church maintains it is working to support parishes in becoming more energy efficient.</p>

            <p>Tourism officials in Los Angeles are increasingly worried about the potential adverse effects of Trump's global tariffs and immigration policies on travel to the city. Concerns are rising about price increases, supply chain disruptions, visa cancellations, and deportation threats. Canadian tourists, a significant source of revenue, are boycotting American products and canceling travel plans due to Trump's policies. Hoteliers are bracing for price increases on goods and services, and businesses are canceling conferences due to economic pressures, creating an uncertain environment for the local tourism industry.</p>

            <p>Following Stephen A. Smith's renewed interest in running for president, the columnist compares him to FDR, arguing that he needs to be more like Roosevelt and less like Trump. The author suggests Smith needs more than celebrity and mass media popularity to be president, but rather real solutions and clear policy. The author emphasizes the need for policy discussions and clarity, drawing a contrast with Trump's vague promises and reliance on personal attacks. The author concludes that governing requires more than a big personality.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that migrants facing deportation have the right to a hearing before being removed from the United States. This decision places a check on President Trump's power to arrest and deport individuals alleged to be members of foreign crime gangs. The court affirmed that all persons, including non-citizens, are entitled to due process of law, ensuring they have an opportunity to appeal to a judge before deportation. While the ruling is likely to slow the pace of removals, questions remain about the administration's compliance and the extent to which judges can block deportations.</p>

Advocates argue that eradicating TB is possible with adequate funding and that recent cuts could lead to a significant increase in TB cases and deaths globally.</p>

The appointment comes at a critical time as the Bureau of Prisons grapples with issues such as preventable deaths, overuse of solitary confinement, and the holding of immigrant detainees.</p>

            <h2>Crows Exhibit Geometric Intuition, Challenging Human Uniqueness</h2>

            <p>A new study reveals that crows possess the ability to distinguish shapes exhibiting geometric regularity from those that do not. This is the first time this capability has been demonstrated in a non-human species. Researchers tested crows' ability to identify outlier shapes in a group, finding they could discern differences in right angles, parallel lines, and symmetry. This discovery suggests geometric abilities may be more widespread in the animal kingdom than previously thought.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging the constitutionality of the recently enacted federal wealth tax. The tax, which levies an annual tax on the net worth of individuals exceeding $100 million, has been met with legal challenges arguing it violates the Constitution's apportionment clause. The outcome of the case could have significant implications for federal tax policy and the government's ability to address wealth inequality. The court's decision is expected to be closely watched by both sides of the political spectrum. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Industry analysts predict that the global semiconductor shortage, which has plagued various sectors including automotive and electronics, will begin to ease by late 2025. Increased investment in chip manufacturing capacity and a slowdown in demand for certain consumer electronics are cited as factors contributing to the expected improvement. However, ongoing geopolitical tensions and potential disruptions to supply chains remain risks that could impact the recovery timeline. Companies are advised to continue diversifying their sourcing and managing inventory levels carefully. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Federal Reserve has indicated it may raise interest rates at its June meeting, citing concerns about persistent inflation and a strong labor market. The move would be aimed at cooling down the economy and bringing inflation back to the Fed's target level. However, some economists worry that raising rates too aggressively could trigger a recession. The Fed's decision will depend on incoming economic data and the evolving outlook for inflation and employment. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A new study published in a leading medical journal has found a strong association between long-term exposure to air pollution and an increased risk of cognitive decline, including Alzheimer's disease. The study, which followed thousands of participants over a decade, suggests that air pollution may contribute to brain inflammation and damage. Public health officials are calling for stricter air quality standards and measures to reduce pollution in urban areas. Individuals are advised to take steps to protect themselves from air pollution, such as using air purifiers and avoiding strenuous activities during peak pollution times.</p>

This accusation comes amid discontent over the government’s handling of the diplomatic crisis involving the Panama Canal. Donald Trump's confirmation that US military personnel had been deployed to Panama, and the increase of US military presence at three former US bases in the country, has prompted outrage. The opposition party views this as a threat to Panama's sovereignty and a return to unwelcome historical intervention.</p>
