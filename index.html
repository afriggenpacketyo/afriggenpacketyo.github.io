          <p>Oghenochuko Ojiri, an art expert who has appeared on the BBC's Bargain Hunt, pleaded guilty to failing to report a series of high-value art sales to Nazem Ahmad, who is suspected of financing Hezbollah. Ojiri, owner of the Ramp Gallery in London, sold artwork worth ¬£140,000 to Ahmad between October 2020 and June 2022. The court heard that Ojiri was aware of Ahmad's sanctions by US authorities and discussed this with others, but did not notify police as required by the Terrorism Act 2000. He is not a member of BBC staff, works as a freelance presenter and has not worked on BBC programmes since 2023.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin marked the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany with a large military parade in Moscow, with Chinese President Xi Jinping in attendance. Putin used the event to project himself as a global leader despite Western efforts to isolate him following the invasion of Ukraine, and to highlight an emerging alliance with China. In his speech, Putin briefly mentioned the war in Ukraine, framing it as a continuation of Russia's historical defense of its national interests. The parade featured military hardware and personnel, but the ongoing conflict in Ukraine has exposed the limits of Russia's military strength and economic stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite tariffs imposed on imported aluminum by the U.S. government, the domestic aluminum sector is failing to revive due to high electricity prices. The tariffs have reshaped global trade flows and increased costs for American consumers, but have not spurred domestic production. Rising electricity prices in the U.S. make it difficult for smelters to compete with those in Canada, Norway, and the Middle East, which have access to cheaper, long-term power contracts. Hydro CFO Trond Olaf Christophersen noted that the artificial intelligence boom and data centers are increasing competition for power, making it unlikely for new aluminum smelters to be built in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Escalating conflict between India and Pakistan in Kashmir has led to the suspension of the Indian Premier League (IPL) for a week and the relocation of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) to the United Arab Emirates. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) suspended the IPL amid the conflict, while the Pakistan Cricket Board moved the remaining PSL matches after claims of an Indian drone falling inside a stadium complex. Relations between the countries mean their cricket teams do not compete outside of global events, and recent blocking of social media accounts of prominent cricketers further strains the relationship.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's denials during his 2024 campaign, his administration's policies closely align with Project 2025, an ultraconservative playbook.

Critics argue that these policies are pushing the U.S. closer to an authoritarian regime. While some policies have faced resistance in the courts and Congress, activists are working to resist Trump's agenda and maintain a unified front against Project 2025.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent decline in fatal opioid overdoses in California, public health experts are concerned about President Trump's cuts to federal funding for addiction treatment programs. These cuts threaten key harm reduction measures, such as increased availability of naloxone and fentanyl testing kits, which have been credited with turning the tide. Simultaneously, local authorities are re-embracing a more traditional approach to fighting crime, including pursuing longer prison sentences for drug offenders. Experts warn that harsher penalties on drug users can increase the risk of overdose, as people are more likely to use alone and in secret.</p>

          <p>A contributor argues that President Trump's administration's targeting of restaurants associated with political opponents is not a new phenomenon, as previous administrations have also politicized law enforcement. The author contends that both sides of the political divide must accept a paradigm of mutually assured destruction to restore normalcy in domestic politics. The author believes that a short-term escalation is needed to achieve long-term stasis, suggesting that some noses must be bloodied to deter future politicization of law enforcement. The author does not care that ICE is targeting restaurants because other politicians have done things which are just as bad.</p>

The author suggests that a renewed expansion of the child tax credit would be a simple first step, as it helps reduce child poverty. A one-time bonus is not enough, as it would not address the systemic neglect that is the status quo for child care, maternity leave and child poverty.</p>
