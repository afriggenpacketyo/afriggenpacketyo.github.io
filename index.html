          <p>Volvo Cars, owned by China's Geely Holding, will reduce its workforce by approximately 3,000 positions, primarily impacting office-based roles in Sweden, as part of an 18 billion Swedish kronor cost and cash action plan. The company cites a challenging period in the automotive industry as the reason for the job cuts, aiming to improve cash flow and lower costs. The action plan, launched in April, includes reductions in investments and redundancies across its global operations. Volvo's CEO, H√•kan Samuelsson, acknowledged the difficulty of these decisions but emphasized their importance in building a stronger and more resilient company.</p>

          <p>The Japan Sumo Association's Yokozuna Deliberation Council unanimously recommended Onosato for promotion to yokozuna, sumo's highest rank, after he secured his second consecutive championship. The formal ratification will occur at a JSA meeting on Wednesday, making the 24-year-old the second active yokozuna alongside Hoshoryu. Onosato expressed his commitment to learning and understanding the responsibilities of a yokozuna, while Tadamori Oshima, head of the council, noted the dignified manner in which Onosato wrestled under pressure. This promotion is the fastest under the six-tournament calendar introduced in 1958, and Onosato dedicated his championship to the people of Ishikawa Prefecture, particularly those affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake.</p>

          <p>Finland has summoned Russia's ambassador to address an alleged airspace breach by two Russian military aircraft near Helsinki. The incident occurred off the coast of Porvoo, approximately 50 kilometers east of Helsinki, and is currently under investigation by Finnish authorities. Tensions between the two countries have increased since Finland joined NATO in 2023 following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and Helsinki has warned of growing security threats along its 1,340-kilometer border with Russia. Finland plans to increase its defense spending to at least 3% of GDP by 2029 and restructure its military in response to these perceived threats.</p>

          <p>A new book, ‚ÄúOriginal Sin,‚Äù co-authored by Alex Thompson and Jake Tapper, alleges that Joe Biden's aides planned for him to make only occasional public appearances during a second term, with unelected White House aides running the country. The book claims that advisers considered having Biden use a wheelchair during the campaign but deemed it politically unfeasible. Thompson stated that the aide rationalized this plan by suggesting that voting for a president is also voting for the aides around him, even if those aides are unelected. The book suggests that the belief that Donald Trump poses an existential threat to democracy led to the rationalization of potentially undemocratic actions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has postponed the imposition of 50% tariffs on European Union goods until July 9, following a call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. This decision provides additional time for trade negotiations between the U.S. and the EU to avert a potential trade war. Market analysts warn that volatility remains high, and the delay may not be sufficient to resolve all outstanding issues. While the EU is prepared to advance talks, uncertainty persists regarding the Trump administration's specific demands, and the EU is unlikely to be intimidated by aggressive negotiating tactics.</p>

          <p>Businesses are reportedly rebranding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives to avoid unwanted political attention, as DEI efforts face a right-wing backlash. Organizations are reframing policies as ‚Äúwellbeing,‚Äù ‚Äúbelonging,‚Äù and ‚Äúculture‚Äù to resist attacks while still promoting talent and addressing inequalities. Some US-headquartered firms are scaling back commitments and avoiding public celebration of inclusion work. Experts believe a full-scale rollback is unlikely in the UK due to the Equalities Act, but many ethnic minority professionals feel muzzled and fear job loss if they raise race-related concerns.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns about democratic erosion during Donald Trump's second term, America's democracy possesses several resilient traits. These include a robust network of advocacy groups, an independent judiciary, a constitutional system resistant to rapid change, a diverse and free press, a federal system of government, and strong free speech protections. These factors differentiate the U.S. from countries where democracy has recently declined, providing a stronger defense against authoritarian actions. While acknowledging the harm caused by Trump's actions, the author argues that these institutional strengths make the American system more defensible and worth preserving.</p>

          <p>Five years after the anti-police protests following George Floyd's death, initiatives aimed at improving officer mental health are gaining traction. The protests exacerbated existing mental health issues among law enforcement officers, leading to increased resignations and burnout. Research indicates that police officers face higher rates of depression, PTSD, and substance abuse compared to the general public. States like New York, New Jersey, California, and Texas are leading officer wellness initiatives, with larger agencies creating dedicated wellness units and mandating training, and the tone of the article is based on the improvements being made to officer mental health.</p>

          <p>Russia has escalated its attacks on Ukrainian cities, launching a massive aerial bombardment following President Trump's apparent shift away from seeking a cease-fire. Trump has criticized Putin's actions but has not approved new military assistance for Ukraine, leading to concerns about Kyiv's ability to defend itself. Analysts suggest Russia perceives an opportunity as the U.S. reduces its involvement, and Ukraine is running low on interceptor missiles. The Kremlin has expressed gratitude for Trump's past efforts to negotiate between Russia and Ukraine, but the situation remains dire as Russian forces continue to advance.</p>
