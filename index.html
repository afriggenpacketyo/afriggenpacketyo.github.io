          <p>In a "Face the Nation" interview, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia expressed deep concern over a potential government shutdown, emphasizing the negative impact on his state's large federal workforce. He criticized the president for focusing on political retribution rather than negotiating a funding deal, referencing the recent resignations of two U.S. attorneys in Virginia who allegedly resisted political pressure. Kaine also addressed foreign policy, supporting the creation of a Palestinian state and urging the president to oppose Israeli annexation of the West Bank during an upcoming meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, a major storm in the Atlantic, is being monitored for a potential and rare interaction with the nearby, newly formed Tropical Storm Imelda. This phenomenon, known as the Fujiwhara effect, involves two storms circling a common center, which can lead to one absorbing the other or both altering their paths. While meteorologists consider this outcome unlikely due to the significant difference in strength between Humberto and Imelda, the possibility remains. Humberto is expected to stay at sea, while Imelda is projected to bring heavy rainfall to the Bahamas and the southeastern U.S. coast.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has officially suspended his campaign for reelection, citing relentless media speculation and the withholding of campaign funds as insurmountable obstacles. His withdrawal transforms the race into a three-way contest between Democrat Zohran Mamdani, independent Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Adams' term has been marked by a federal corruption investigation and low poll numbers, which ultimately undermined his viability. In his announcement, Adams maintained his innocence regarding the charges and expressed pride in his service to the city.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto has rapidly strengthened into a powerful Category 5 storm, churning in the Atlantic Ocean south of Bermuda. While no immediate watches or warnings are in effect, officials in Bermuda are urging residents to closely monitor the storm's progress as it may bring hazardous conditions within days. The storm is expected to remain a major hurricane for several days, generating large swells that could cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast. It is the eighth named storm of the season, followed closely by Tropical Storm Imelda, which threatens the southeastern U.S. with heavy rain.</p>

          <p>The emcee for the Ryder Cup, comedian Heather McMahan, has stepped down after leading a profane chant against European golfer Rory McIlroy. The incident is part of a larger pattern of unruly fan behavior at the event, which has included persistent heckling of McIlroy and his wife, leading to two spectator ejections. European captain Luke Donald stated that some fan behavior had "crossed the line," while U.S. captain Keegan Bradley defended the crowd's passion. McMahan has since apologized for her role in the incident at the Bethpage Black course in New York.</p>

          <p>Moldova held a pivotal parliamentary election that is seen as a referendum on the nation's future alignment with either the European Union or Russia. Pro-EU President Maia Sandu accused Russia of "massive Russian interference," including spreading disinformation and buying votes to sway the outcome in favor of pro-Moscow parties. The election pits Sandu's Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) against the pro-Russian Patriotic Electoral Bloc in a tight race. The results will determine the country's geopolitical direction as it grapples with the war in neighboring Ukraine, economic pressures, and endemic corruption.</p>

Responding officers engaged the suspect in a gunfight, resulting in the suspect's death.

          <p>The new Paul Thomas Anderson film "One Battle After Another," starring Leonardo DiCaprio, debuted at the top of the box office with a domestic take of $22.4 million. The opening weekend performance met industry expectations for the adult drama, which has generated significant awards buzz and strong critical reviews. The film's success is another victory for Warner Bros., which has had a string of box office hits this year, including "A Minecraft Movie" and "Superman." This strong slate has reduced the financial pressure on this more artistically ambitious, $130 million project.</p>

          <p>European golfer Viktor Hovland has been forced to withdraw from his Sunday singles match at the Ryder Cup because of a persistent neck injury. As a result, his scheduled match against Harris English of the U.S. has been declared a half, with each team receiving half a point. The withdrawal extends Europe's commanding lead to 12-5, bringing them closer to retaining the trophy. Hovland, who is from Norway, had an MRI on Saturday evening after the injury flared up, leaving him too stiff to compete in the final day's play.</p>

          <p>The Danish government has issued a temporary ban on all civilian drone flights after a series of unidentified drones were spotted near airports and military facilities. The ban will be in effect from Monday to Friday, coinciding with an EU summit being held in the country. The repeated drone sightings, which previously caused the closure of Copenhagen's airport, have been described as part of a "hybrid attack," with suspicion falling on Russia. To enhance security for the summit, a German air defense frigate has been deployed to assist with airspace surveillance in Copenhagen.</p>

          <p>In a close referendum, Swiss citizens have narrowly voted in favor of introducing a voluntary electronic identity system, with 50.4% supporting the measure. This revised proposal, which passed after a similar plan was rejected in 2021, keeps the system entirely in government hands and stores data decentrally on users' smartphones to address privacy concerns. Supporters argue the digital ID will streamline online transactions and bureaucratic processes, while opponents remain worried about potential data misuse and surveillance. The vote contrasts with plans in countries like the UK, where a mandatory digital ID is being considered.</p>

          <p>Turkey is facing a severe public health crisis, with its diabetes prevalence nearly doubling over the past two decades to become the highest in the European region, affecting over 16% of its adult population. Public health experts attribute the dramatic increase to lifestyle factors, including poor diet, lack of exercise, and high consumption of starch-based sugars. Critics point to inadequate government health and food policies, as well as a high rate of undiagnosed cases. With obesity rates also the highest in Europe, experts are calling for urgent, systemic changes in public health strategy, including promoting healthier school meals.</p>

Business leaders and politicians express concern that the rolling list of included products undermines trade stability and imposes unpredictable costs.
