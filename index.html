          <p>U.S. department stores are starting to implement price hikes on items like apparel and footwear due to President Trump's tariffs. Data analysis from DataWeave shows a notable increase in prices since May, with footwear costs rising as much as 4% at some retailers. The trend is influenced by new trade agreements, such as the one with Vietnam imposing a 20% tariff, which directly impacts companies like Nike and Lululemon that manufacture there. While retailers have tried to absorb the costs, the financial pressure is now increasingly being passed on to consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

While President Trump has hailed them as heroes who "obliterated" Iran's program, military officials are citing security risks associated with public identification. The visit occurs amid a dispute over the mission's effectiveness, with an initial Defense Intelligence Agency assessment suggesting a more modest setback for Iran's nuclear ambitions than the administration later claimed.</p>

          <p>The United States has established a new trade deal with Vietnam, imposing a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports, a significant reduction from a previously threatened 46% levy. President Donald Trump announced the agreement, which also includes a steeper 40% tariff on goods that are made in other countries, like China, and trans-shipped through Vietnam. In return, Vietnam will reportedly grant U.S. products full market access with zero tariffs. The deal affects numerous major brands that have manufacturing hubs in Vietnam, which had become a popular alternative to China for production.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has publicly backed Chancellor Rachel Reeves, stating she is doing an "excellent job" and will remain in her post for years. The statement came after Reeves was seen wiping away tears in the House of Commons during a challenging Prime Minister's Questions session. A spokesperson for the chancellor attributed the moment to a "personal matter," and Starmer insisted it had no connection to recent political controversies or welfare U-turns. The event sparked widespread discussion and support for Reeves from colleagues across the political spectrum.</p>

The president is personally involved in the negotiations, acting as the administration's "best closer" to ensure the legislation, a centerpiece of his second-term agenda, gets passed.

While the vote is largely symbolic and not expected to pass, it highlights growing frustration within Brussels over the Commission's recent decisions.

These consumers are reportedly spending less due to concerns over President Trump's stringent immigration policies and potential job losses. Broader consumer fears about inflation and the economy were also cited as contributing factors to the weaker-than-expected sales performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a bill to more than double the state's annual film and television tax credit program, increasing the cap from $330 million to $750 million. The move is a major effort to make the state more competitive and prevent film and TV productions from leaving for more lucrative incentives in other states and countries. Industry unions and leaders praised the decision, stating it will help stimulate production that has slowed due to strikes, studio cutbacks, and other challenges, ultimately helping to get more people back to work.</p>

          <p>While Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) can be an attractive way to borrow, this article advises homeowners to be aware of several fees that can significantly increase their total cost. These charges can include upfront application and appraisal fees, annual maintenance or inactivity fees, and closing costs similar to a traditional mortgage. Borrowers may also face early termination penalties if they close the line of credit within the first few years. To minimize these expenses, consumers should shop around, compare offers, and ask lenders about potential fee waivers. (not investment advice)</p>
