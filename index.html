          <p>An African Union (AU) helicopter crashed at Mogadishu's international airport, killing three of the eleven people on board. The aircraft, which belonged to the Ugandan Air Force, was part of the AU's peacekeeping mission aimed at stabilizing the region and combating the Islamist group Al-Shabaab. According to a Ugandan military spokesperson, munitions on board detonated upon impact, injuring three civilians and destroying nearby structures.

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the former criminology student accused of killing four University of Idaho students in 2022, has pleaded guilty to all charges. As part of the plea agreement, he will be spared the death penalty and instead receive four consecutive life sentences plus ten years for burglary, waiving his right to appeal. The decision has brought mixed reactions from the victims' families, with some supporting the plea for closure while others condemned the prosecution for making a "deal with the devil" without securing a full confession or the location of the murder weapon.</p>

          <p>Homeowner's insurance premiums are projected to rise in all 50 states, with a national average increase of around 8%, according to data from Insurify. The surge is driven by an increase in severe natural disasters like wildfires and floods, which leads to higher payouts from insurance companies. States like Louisiana and California are seeing particularly sharp increases of 28% and 21% respectively, reflecting a national trend that impacts even states not typically prone to coastal or wildfire risks. This trend is making homeownership more expensive and is a growing factor in the overall cost of living. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>House Republican leaders are struggling to secure enough votes to pass the final version of a massive domestic policy bill, a key part of President Trump's second-term agenda. The legislation, which includes significant spending on border security and defense while cutting health care programs, faced changes in the Senate that have alienated some conservative House members. With a narrow majority, GOP leadership is contending with potential holdouts from the House Freedom Caucus and moderates, who are concerned about the Senate's alterations.

          <p>An investigation into the fire that caused a near-total shutdown of Heathrow Airport has revealed critical findings about its cause and preventability. The report from the National Energy System Operator (NESO) identified moisture causing a short-circuit in a transformer as the likely cause. Crucially, it was discovered that National Grid, the operator of the substation, had been aware of a fault indicating an "imminent" risk since 2018 but failed to perform necessary maintenance. The report also noted that while Heathrow had three grid connections, it knew that the failure of one would necessitate a shutdown.</p>

          <p>President Trump is intensifying pressure on Republican lawmakers to support his major budget bill, threatening political consequences for those who dissent. The article highlights the retirement of Senator Thom Tillis and the opposition from Senator Susan Collins as examples of the risks faced by moderates who defy the party line. This hardline approach may create opportunities for Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections, particularly in swing states like North Carolina and Maine. The conflict illustrates a broader tension within the GOP, where loyalty to Trump could potentially alienate moderate voters and jeopardize key seats.</p>

          <p>This article details the severe consequences that occur when a credit card issuer closes an account due to missed payments. Beyond the initial late fees, a closure leads to a significant drop in credit score, as it increases the cardholder's credit utilization ratio and signals high risk to other lenders. The outstanding debt does not disappear; it is often sold to a collection agency, leading to persistent collection efforts and potential legal action. The article advises those in this situation to contact the creditor to negotiate a payment plan and consider professional debt relief options.</p>

These sterile males then mate with wild females, whose eggs consequently do not hatch, causing the population to collapse over time.

          <p>An analysis suggests that the Trump administration's major spending bill will hobble the U.S. economy by dismantling clean energy initiatives and promoting fossil fuels. The legislation rolls back key investments from the Inflation Reduction Act, such as tax credits for EVs and renewables, while introducing new credits for coal. This policy shift comes as energy demand is rising, and it throttles the cheapest and most quickly deployable energy sources. Experts warn this will lead to higher electricity prices, reduced productivity, and will cede global leadership in the growing clean energy sector to other nations like China.

          <h2>Seven Signs That Credit Card Debt Settlement Could Be a Viable Option</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines seven indicators that suggest credit card debt settlement might be a suitable strategy for individuals overwhelmed by their balances. These signs include minimum payments consuming over 20% of take-home income, making no progress on the principal balance, and considering borrowing from retirement accounts to cover debt. Other red flags are maxed-out credit cards, using cash advances to pay other bills, and having debt triggered by uncontrollable events like job loss. The article presents settlement as a potentially faster resolution than traditional credit counseling for those facing unmanageable debt.</p>

          <p>Amid recent air traffic control (ATC) outages and a projected record-breaking Fourth of July travel period, airlines and pilots are highlighting their extensive training and redundant systems designed to ensure safety. Pilots are trained from early in their careers to handle communication loss by using backup radio frequencies, a text-based messaging system, and specific transponder codes to signal an issue. Furthermore, all airliners are equipped with a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) that autonomously communicates with other aircraft to prevent mid-air collisions. While these measures maintain safety, ATC disruptions inevitably lead to significant flight delays.</p>

          <p>Legal experts suggest that federal prosecutors "overreached" by charging Sean "Diddy" Combs with racketeering, a complex charge typically used for organized crime, which ultimately led to his acquittal on the most serious offenses. While the jury convicted Combs on two lesser counts of transportation for prostitution, they did not find sufficient evidence for a criminal enterprise under the rigid Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. The defense successfully argued that while Combs engaged in a "swinger" lifestyle and domestic violence, his actions did not constitute a coordinated criminal conspiracy, a difficult standard for prosecutors to meet.</p>
