NASA aims to return astronauts to the moon before China and is diversifying its options due to SpaceX's Starship delays.

          <p>The National Trust for Historic Preservation has urged the Trump administration to halt demolition for a planned White House ballroom annex, citing fears it will "overwhelm the White House itself." In a letter to key commissions, the non-profit group called for public review processes to be completed before construction proceeds. Other architectural organizations have echoed concerns about the proposed 90,000-square-foot addition's scale and its potential disruption to the White House's classical design. This article highlights the cultural and historical debate surrounding the controversial renovation project.</p>

They clarify that cold water doesn't enhance shine, and no product can repair damaged hair or split ends, which only a haircut can fix. Furthermore, they stress that hair doesn't "self-clean," requiring regular washing to prevent oil and bacteria buildup, and dry shampoo is merely a temporary fix, not a substitute for washing.
