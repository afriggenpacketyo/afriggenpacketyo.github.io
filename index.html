          <p>A federal immigration agent discharged their firearm at a vehicle during an enforcement operation in San Bernardino, California. The driver later contacted police, stating that masked men had shot at him, unaware they were federal agents. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson claimed the driver attempted to run down two officers, prompting the agent to fire in self-defense, a claim disputed by a video of the incident. The San Bernardino police responded but did not assist with immigration enforcement due to the California Values Act, leading to a dispute between local and federal authorities.</p>

Born in Serbia, Tana was a professional soccer player and actor before opening his restaurant in 1964, which became an institution frequented by stars like Elizabeth Taylor and George Clooney. Though he sold the establishment in 2009, its classic "red-sauce" Italian-American fare and old-world charm have ensured its enduring legacy in Los Angeles's cultural and culinary landscape. The restaurant remains a beloved fixture, known for its consistent staff and discreet service.</p>

          <p>A planned visit by a U.S. trade delegation to New Delhi has been called off, signaling a pause in negotiations as trade frictions between the two nations escalate. This development occurs as the U.S. has imposed significant tariffs on Indian exports, with an additional 25% duty set to take effect, partly as a penalty for India's purchase of Russian crude oil. India has criticized these measures as unfair, highlighting that U.S. and EU nations also continue to trade with Russia. The U.S. is India's largest single export partner, making the outcome of these talks crucial for the Indian economy. (not investment advice)</p>

It is lashing the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with heavy rain and strong winds, causing some power outages and downed trees. While the storm is forecast to remain offshore, staying between Bermuda and the U.S. mainland, it will generate large waves and life-threatening rip currents along the East Coast next week. Authorities have issued tropical storm watches for the Turks and Caicos Islands as the storm continues its northwest trajectory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A long-standing traffic engineering guideline known as the "85th percentile rule" is being reconsidered by some states and federal agencies. This rule suggests setting speed limits based on the speed that 85% of drivers naturally travel at, effectively letting the fastest drivers dictate the legal speed. Critics argue this creates a dangerous feedback loop where speeds continually increase, especially in urban areas with pedestrians and cyclists. Amid rising traffic fatalities, officials are now encouraging a more context-sensitive approach that considers road usage, crash history, and pedestrian safety, moving away from a sole reliance on driver speed.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new method that makes biological tissues, including brains, transparent, allowing for unprecedentedly clear 3D imaging of their internal structures. The technique creates what is described as "ionic glassy tissue," which preserves the organ's original shape and enhances the brightness of fluorescent dyes used to highlight specific cells. This process not only produces highly accurate and vivid images but also allows the tissues to be stored long-term at low temperatures without degradation. The breakthrough offers a powerful new tool for studying the complex inner workings of organs.</p>

          <p>Following a summit in Alaska, former President Donald Trump is reportedly supporting a proposal from Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine. The plan would involve Russia taking full control of Ukraine's Donbas region, which includes Luhansk and Donetsk, in exchange for freezing the current front lines elsewhere. This represents a significant shift, as Trump is now pushing for a permanent peace agreement rather than a ceasefire, a move that aligns with Putin's stated goals. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has consistently rejected ceding territory, is scheduled to meet with Trump at the White House.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is heading to Washington for a high-stakes meeting with Donald Trump, facing a precarious diplomatic situation. Following Trump's summit with Vladimir Putin, the U.S. president abruptly abandoned the call for a ceasefire, instead advocating for a direct peace agreement based on a Russian proposal that would require Ukraine to cede more territory. This shift has alarmed Kyiv, which fears Russia will use prolonged negotiations to press its military advantage while the conflict continues. Zelenskyy must navigate the talks carefully, presenting himself as willing to seek peace while resisting pressure to accept a deal that compromises Ukrainian sovereignty.</p>

While not all bites lead to illness, they carry the risk of transmitting diseases like Lyme disease, which affects nearly half a million Americans annually.

The case went cold for over two decades until genetic genealogy linked Miller's DNA to the crime scenes. Miller's defense admitted he was the killer but argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming severe childhood abuse by his mother caused him to develop dissociative amnesia. The judge acknowledged the abuse but ultimately found him guilty, handing down the death penalty for the brutal crimes which included sexual assault and dismemberment.</p>

          <p>A proposed Chinese design for a hypersonic drone carrier revives a concept once explored by NASA, featuring a single, centrally mounted "scissor wing" that rotates as the aircraft accelerates. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, ideal for takeoff. As it approaches supersonic speeds, the wing pivots to a 45-degree angle to mitigate shock waves, and at hypersonic speeds of Mach 5, it aligns parallel with the fuselage, turning the entire aircraft into an efficient "waverider." This innovative design aims to solve the aerodynamic compromises between low-speed efficiency and high-speed performance.</p>

The article outlines five common triggers: a lifetime of always being "good" and repressing one's true self, the burnout from perfectionism, having poor boundaries from a "parentified" childhood, being in an abusive or emotionally neglectful marriage, and experiencing a recent significant loss. These factors can create an internal void or breaking point, making an affair seem like a form of escape, rebellion, or a chance to finally feel alive or valued.</p>

          <p>A former software CEO, Mike Conner, has completed a five-year, multi-million-pound renovation of Thorne Island, a derelict Napoleonic fort off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales. After buying the abandoned island for £555,000 in 2017, he undertook the immense challenge of making it habitable, which involved cutting through 16 feet of rock for plumbing and bringing in materials by helicopter. The historic fort, once built to defend against French attacks, is now a unique private venue with 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and a nightclub. The renovated island is now back on the market for £3 million.</p>

          <p>With children at home for the summer, many parents are facing the challenge of rising food costs and are adopting creative strategies to manage their budgets. The article highlights several tips, including meticulously planning meals, buying reduced "yellow sticker" items to freeze for later, and organizing the fridge to use up food before it expires. One parent portions out snacks for each day to prevent them from being eaten all at once. These tactics help families stretch their resources, especially as the absence of subsidized school meals adds significant financial pressure during the holiday period.</p>

          <h2>U.S. State Department Halts Medical Visas for Gazan Children Following Far-Right Online Campaign</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 19:58:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. State Department has abruptly stopped issuing visitor visas for children from Gaza seeking urgent medical care in the United States. This decision followed an online pressure campaign by Laura Loomer, a far-right activist, who misrepresented videos of injured children arriving for treatment as a security threat. The move has been condemned by humanitarian groups like the Palestine Children's Relief Fund, which called the decision "dangerous and inhumane," as it cuts off a lifeline for children in a region with collapsed medical infrastructure. The charity has brought thousands of children to the U.S. for care over the past 30 years.</p>
