          <p>Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng conveyed a positive outlook on China's economy as he prepares to lead trade negotiations with US officials in Switzerland. He emphasized the country's economic progress and growing confidence, while also inviting foreign financial institutions to expand their businesses in China. These talks mark the first official trade negotiations between China and the US since President Donald Trump's return to office, raising hopes for de-escalating trade tensions between the two economic superpowers. The meeting is highly anticipated as a potential step toward resolving the ongoing trade war.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are employing powerful Earth-based instruments, including the world’s largest radio telescope and advanced radar systems, to investigate water ice distribution at the moon’s south pole. The study estimates that ice constitutes no more than 6% of the material within the top 10 meters of lunar soil. These findings could help select landing sites for future lunar missions and inform the design of a China-led research base on the moon. The use of China’s newly built incoherent scatter radar in Sanya alongside the FAST telescope represents a creative approach to investigating water abundances on the moon.</p>

          <p>According to The New York Times, Britain is set to become the first country to sign a trade deal with the U.S. after the US announced tariffs against friends and foes alike in April. It is uncertain if both sides will sign a finalized deal or a framework for an agreement that they would continue negotiating in the coming months. The U.K. was spared the higher "reciprocal" tariffs when Trump announced his "Liberation Day" duties, although it was still hit with the baseline 10% levy. The agreement marks a potentially significant shift in global trade relations.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted worksite enforcement operations at over 100 businesses in the Washington, D.C., area. The operations aimed to ensure businesses comply with U.S. immigration and employment laws, with no arrests made during the visits. ICE agents requested I-9 forms to verify employee identities and employment authorizations, prompting some restaurants to close preemptively. The Restaurant Association Metropolitan Washington expressed deep concern over the impact on local businesses and the economy, highlighting the significant role of immigrants in the restaurant workforce.</p>

          <p>Apple is seeking a stay on a recent court decision in its case against Epic Games, arguing that required changes will cost the company "substantial sums." The ruling ordered Apple to stop imposing commissions on in-app purchases made through web links inside iPhone apps. Apple claims the ruling is punitive and that civil contempt sanctions can only coerce compliance, not punish non-compliance. The company argues that developers are already using the order to reduce consumer choice and damage Apple's business.</p>

          <p>US Vice-President JD Vance said Russia's demands to end the war in Ukraine are excessive, with President Trump possibly agreeing. Trump has nominated wellness influencer Dr Casey Means for surgeon general, replacing Janette Nesheiwat. Means is associated with Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump's vaccine skeptic health secretary, though she has largely avoided his views on vaccination. The Trump administration continues to shape its policies and personnel, signaling potential shifts in key areas such as international relations and public health.</p>

          <p>China will use a recently passed law supporting its private economy as a springboard for growth, officials said. The non-state sector is becoming increasingly crucial as the country looks inward for economic momentum amid trade tensions with the United States. The law clearly defines the legal status of the private economy and the government’s support for it. This legislation is expected to unleash the internal momentum and creative vitality of the private sector, addressing challenges in fair market competition, equal market access, financial support, and legal protections.</p>
