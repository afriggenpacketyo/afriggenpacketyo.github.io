          <p>This article discusses the efforts to conserve jaguars in Sonora, Mexico, by changing their image from threats to valuable ecosystem members. The Northern Jaguar Project (NJP) compensates ranchers for jaguar sightings on their land, creating a financial incentive for protecting the cats and their prey. This program, called Viviendo con Felinos, has expanded the protected area for jaguars and shifted local attitudes toward coexistence. The article highlights the cultural shift among ranchers who now appreciate the role of jaguars in the ecosystem, contributing to the stability, if not growth, of the jaguar population in the region.</p>

          <p>China has voiced strong concerns over President Trump's proposed Golden Dome missile defense system, arguing that it violates the Outer Space Treaty and could escalate the militarization of space. Chinese Foreign Minister Mao Ning stated that the project has a strong offensive nature and poses risks to international security and arms control. While acknowledging that both China and Russia have offensive weapons in space, Mao accused the U.S. of prioritizing offensive space dominance. The Kremlin suggested that the Golden Dome project could prompt discussions on strategic arms control between Russia and the U.S.</p>

          <p>Jay Emmanuel-Thomas, a professional footballer, has pleaded guilty to involvement in a plot to smuggle £600,000 worth of cannabis from Thailand into the UK. He was arrested after 60kg of cannabis was discovered in suitcases at London Stansted Airport. Emmanuel-Thomas, who previously played for Arsenal, Aberdeen, and Ipswich Town, was subsequently sacked by his Scottish club. Two other individuals initially charged in connection with the case had their charges dropped after an investigation of Emmanuel-Thomas's mobile phone revealed they believed they were importing gold, not cannabis.</p>

          <p>UK health officials have detected West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes for the first time, though they emphasize the risk to the general public remains very low. Fragments of the virus were found in mosquitoes collected in Nottinghamshire in 2023. While the virus can cause serious illness in some individuals, most infected people experience minor or no symptoms. Health authorities attribute the detection to climate change and other factors pushing mosquito-borne diseases further north. There have been no human cases of West Nile virus acquired within the UK to date.</p>

          <p>Major American retailers are facing challenges as they navigate the financial impact of President Trump's tariffs while attempting to avoid public conflict with the White House and alienating customers. Companies like Target and Home Depot are trying to mitigate tariff effects through supplier negotiations and product selection adjustments, rather than broad price increases. This follows warnings from Walmart about potential price hikes and criticism faced by Amazon and Mattel for considering tariff-related cost adjustments. The situation highlights the delicate balance retailers must strike between managing costs and maintaining customer loyalty amid ongoing trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are attempting to overturn California's law phasing out gas-powered vehicles by 2035, utilizing the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to strike down regulations with a simple majority. Democrats argue this move undermines the Senate filibuster and prioritizes the oil industry over public health. Republicans contend they are protecting the Senate's power and preventing a nationwide electric vehicle mandate. The House has already voted to overturn the waivers, setting up a contentious battle in the Senate over environmental policy and Senate rules.</p>

          <p>Both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have proposed eliminating federal taxes on tips, a policy that experts argue is misguided. While seemingly pro-worker, this proposal is viewed by many as a subsidy for businesses rather than a meaningful tax cut for low- and middle-income families. Critics suggest that eliminating taxes on tips could depress service sector wages and incentivize employers to rely more on tips instead of providing a fair base wage. Experts argue that raising the minimum wage and abolishing the subminimum wage for tipped workers would be more effective solutions. </p>

          <p>A recent inflation surprise suggests the economic outlook could be gloomier than previously anticipated, with rising energy and water bills contributing to the highest inflation rate in a year. Although pay rises are outpacing price increases for many workers, concerns remain that service inflation, particularly in areas like restaurant meals, is higher than the Bank of England would prefer. The government's policies also risk adding to inflation, prompting economists to believe that inflation could inch up further in the coming months and that the Bank of England may only cut interest rates once more this year.</p>

          <p>Andriy Portnov, a pro-Russian former politician from Ukraine, was shot dead outside his children's school in Madrid. According to reports, unidentified gunmen shot Portnov in the back and head before fleeing. Portnov was a senior aid to former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich, who was ousted in 2014. In 2021, Portnov was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department for allegedly using his influence to buy access and decisions in Ukraine's courts and undermining reform efforts.</p>

          <p>Tax cuts pushed by the Trump administration are exacerbating debt and deficit concerns among bond investors, influencing interest rates. The 10-year Treasury yield has risen above 4.5 percent, and the 30-year yield has jumped above 5 percent, reflecting deficit worries. Investors are concerned that the proposed tax bill will add to the federal deficit, leading to more borrowing and potentially demanding higher interest rates. Some economists warn that rising interest expenses could create problems across markets, as the cost to service the government's debt continues to grow.</p>

          <p>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has dismissed farm minister Taku Eto after Eto made a controversial remark about receiving so much rice from supporters that he doesn't buy any. The comment sparked public outrage amid soaring rice prices, dealing a blow to Ishiba's already unpopular government. Ishiba appointed Shinjiro Koizumi, a popular former Environment Minister, as the new agriculture chief. The scandal comes as Ishiba prepares for a House of Councillors election and faces increasing public dissatisfaction with the government's handling of rising rice prices.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has suggested that a "fundamental regime change" may be underway in financial markets as investors reassess the riskiness of U.S. assets, potentially due to trade tariffs. The ECB's Financial Stability Review noted recent market volatility stemming from U.S. trade policies, with atypical shifts away from traditional safe havens like US Treasuries and the US dollar. This could indicate broader shifts in global capital flows with far-reaching consequences for the global financial system. The ECB also highlighted elevated valuations and strong uncertainty as key factors to consider.</p>

It confirms that Biden has an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, making it incurable but controllable with drugs. The article explores why Biden’s P.S.A. levels were not tested regularly after 2014 and discusses the guidelines for prostate cancer screening in older men. Medical experts say while the cancer is not in his brain, it will likely be the cause of his death unless something else kills him first.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor announced that the top-selling RAV4 SUV will be redesigned to be exclusively offered as a hybrid model, eliminating the traditional gas engine. The 2026 Toyota RAV4 will feature a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine with hybrid technologies. The move is driven by the popularity and growing customer demand for hybrid models, as well as to meet fuel economy regulations. The automaker expects to continue growing its hybrid offerings, despite the industry's push for all-electric vehicles. Tariffs are a concern as most RAV4 sales come from vehicles built in Canada.</p>

          <p>Despite pledging to halt funding for fossil fuels, Japan remains a major public financier of oil and gas projects, particularly LNG, while simultaneously promoting a fossil fuel phase-out in Asia.

Japan benefits from access to LNG supply and reselling surplus LNG, but these investments contradict its climate pledges.

          <p>Israel declared this week that it was expanding its ground offensive in Gaza, vowing to seize large areas of the enclave to force Hamas's surrender. This escalation comes amidst new cease-fire negotiations and pressure from the Trump administration for a truce. However, Britain, France, and Canada have issued rare public reprimands of Israel, denouncing the widening military offensive. Satellite images show Israeli military activity near the border, but details about the offensive are scarce. The Israeli military has said that it has struck more than 670 targets. The blockade has caused widespread hunger and deprivation among Palestinians in Gaza.</p>
