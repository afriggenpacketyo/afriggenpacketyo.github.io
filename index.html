          <p>Several major U.S. cities are preparing for the possible deployment of the National Guard by President Trump to address crime, despite data showing that crime rates have decreased. Local leaders in Chicago and Baltimore have expressed strong opposition, planning legal challenges and viewing the move as a political intimidation tactic. In contrast, Louisiana's Republican governor has welcomed the potential federal assistance, highlighting a sharp partisan divide on the use of military personnel for domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has acquired a significant ownership stake in Intel, a strategic move to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing amid intense competition with China. This initiative, funded by the CHIPS and Science Act, aims to mitigate national security risks by reducing reliance on foreign chip suppliers like Taiwan's TSMC. While praised as a vital step for supply chain security, experts express concern that government involvement could lead to political pressure influencing Intel's corporate decision-making.</p>

          <p>Mumbai's traffic noise problem is worsening as drivers increasingly adopt louder, after-market car horns to navigate the city's chaotic streets. This trend contributes to severe noise pollution that surpasses WHO safety levels, creating significant public health concerns like hearing loss. Despite laws against excessive honking, enforcement remains a low priority for traffic police, and some car manufacturers are even adapting their horns to the unique demands of the Indian market.</p>

          <p>An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid at a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia resulted in the arrest of 475 workers, primarily South Korean citizens. Officials stated the individuals were working illegally in violation of their short-term visitor visas, framing the operation as a measure to protect American jobs. The raid has prompted a diplomatic response from South Korea, which has invested heavily in U.S. industries, while immigration lawyers argue some of those detained were present for legitimate business meetings.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) represents a significant gathering of Asian powers like China, Russia, and India, it lacks the foundational economic institutions to create a new world order. The author suggests that political declarations are insufficient without a comprehensive framework akin to the Bretton Woods agreement that structured the post-war Western world. For the SCO's influence to be transformative, it must establish complex trade and financial systems to prevent further global fragmentation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis by Oxford Economics suggests that China's current campaign against "involution," or destructive price-cutting, will likely be less effective than its 2015 supply-side reforms. The report argues that despite official criticism of this practice, the government is not positioned to enact the necessary large-scale production cuts or significant consumer stimulus. This indicates that resolving China's deep-seated supply and demand imbalances will be a much more challenging and indirect process than in previous economic interventions.

          <h2>Trump's Punitive Tariffs on India Signal a Challenging New World Order for Modi</h2>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Trump administration's steep tariffs on Indian exports represent a significant setback for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's foreign policy. The author contends that these actions reveal a shift in Western geopolitics, where even large nations like India are treated as clients rather than partners in an increasingly protectionist world. The article suggests that India must reassess its westward tilt and embrace its traditional non-aligned stance of "strategic autonomy" to navigate this new, more hostile global landscape.</p>

          <p>France is facing a political crisis over its government's budget-cutting plans, which are aimed at controlling the nation's massive public debt of €3.35 trillion. As the country with the largest budget deficit in the EU, its inability to pass austerity measures has financial markets concerned, leading to higher borrowing costs. Economists worry that if the eurozone's second-largest economy loses control of its finances, it could pose a significant risk to the stability of the entire currency union.

          <p>British newspaper front pages are dominated by the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and the subsequent cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Media outlets describe the situation as a "meltdown" and a "chaotic" attempt by Starmer to regain control amid falling poll numbers and the rise of the Reform UK party. Commentators view the sweeping changes as a "big gamble," questioning whether moving ministers to new roles will improve government performance, while noting Rayner's departure is a significant blow.</p>

          <p>Lord Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the United States, is set to deliver a speech praising former President Trump as a maverick "risk taker" whose political instincts identified widespread anxieties in Western societies. In a strategic move, Mandelson will draw parallels between the mandates of Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer for "national renewal." The speech is interpreted as an attempt to fortify the special relationship and counter the influence of Reform UK's Nigel Farage, who has aligned himself with Trump's MAGA movement.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Kiko, a powerful Category 4 storm with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph, is currently moving across the Pacific Ocean on a path toward Hawaii. While no coastal warnings are in effect yet, forecasters anticipate that swells from the storm will reach the islands by the weekend, creating life-threatening surf and rip currents. In preparation for potential impacts, including heavy rain and high winds early next week, Hawaii's acting governor has declared a state of emergency to mobilize resources.</p>
