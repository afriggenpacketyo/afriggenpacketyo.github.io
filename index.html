          <p>The Republican National Committee (RNC) concluded the first half of 2025 with a substantial financial advantage, holding $80.7 million compared to the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) $15.2 million. This $65.6 million cash-on-hand gap is significantly wider than in the 2018 midterm cycle, reflecting the RNC's strong fundraising efforts aligned with former President Trump. While the DNC, under new leadership, has increased its fundraising compared to the post-2016 period, it still faces a considerable challenge in closing the financial gap ahead of the upcoming elections.

          <p>The ongoing trade war and tariff uncertainty are disproportionately affecting smaller and secondary U.S. ports, from California to the Gulf Coast. Shippers are rerouting cargo to larger ports like Los Angeles to meet tariff deadlines, causing significant volume decreases at ports such as Oakland, Jacksonville, and New Orleans. This shift is creating economic strain and job losses in the communities reliant on these smaller ports, with officials describing the situation as a market recalibration rather than a temporary dip.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Americans face record credit card debt, debt management programs offer a solution for those seeking to regain financial control without taking on new loans. To qualify, individuals generally need to meet three main criteria: a steady and sufficient income, a manageable amount of unsecured debt within program limits, and a strong commitment to the program's rules. These requirements ensure that participants can make consistent payments and are prepared for the lifestyle changes necessary for success, such as closing credit accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Investigators have executed a search warrant on a boat in Marina del Rey as part of the ongoing probe into the deaths of three Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department bomb technicians. The deputies were killed when military-grade hand grenades, which they had collected from a Santa Monica storage unit, detonated at a training facility. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is assisting the complex investigation, which aims to determine the origin of the explosives and the cause of the fatal blast.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With rising college costs, many students rely on federal loans, but these come with specific borrowing limits designed to prevent excessive debt. The maximum amount a student can borrow depends on factors like their dependency status, year in school, and whether they are an undergraduate or graduate student. For example, a dependent first-year undergraduate can borrow up to $5,500, while the aggregate lifetime limit for undergraduates is $31,000. These caps often mean students must seek additional funding, like private loans, to cover the full cost of attendance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A dispute has emerged between NHS England and the British Medical Association (BMA) over staffing levels during an upcoming five-day doctors' strike. NHS England has instructed hospitals to avoid canceling non-urgent care, a departure from previous strike protocols. The BMA warns this policy will stretch non-striking doctors too thin to safely cover emergency services, thereby putting patients at risk. The conflict arises as talks continue between the government and the union to avert the walkout over a long-running pay dispute.</p>

Fateh, who was the first Somali American elected to the state senate, campaigned on a platform of affordability and building a "city that works for all of us," though the incumbent's campaign is appealing the endorsement process.</p>

The Justice Department's recommendation of only one day in prison has drawn sharp criticism from Taylor's family attorney, who called it an insult and a betrayal of justice.</p>
