          <p>This article explores the often-overlooked connection between personal finance choices and their impact on the climate crisis, highlighting how pensions, investments, and banking decisions can inadvertently support fossil fuel projects. Sustainable alternatives are available, but many people are unaware of the significant role their money plays in funding the fossil fuel industry. Experts emphasize the difficulty in precisely quantifying personal finance's contribution, but stress that banks use our money to grow their business and attract investors. Shifting to green finance alternatives is a way for customers to send a message, but more power lies in citizens demanding politicians regulate the financial sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's disapproval, Russia and Ukraine have continued their drone attacks on each other's territories, marking over three years of ongoing conflict with no ceasefire in sight. Ukrainian officials reported shooting down a significant number of Russian air attack vehicles, while Russia claimed to have neutralized Ukrainian drones. Trump has expressed dissatisfaction with Putin's actions, citing civilian casualties, and has criticized Zelenskyy's statements, blaming him for causing problems. The Kremlin maintains that Putin's decisions are necessary for Russia's security and is monitoring the peace process. The Ukrainian leaders are appealing to Trump to impose tougher sanctions on Moscow to push the Kremlin to downgrade its maximalist war goals, but those requests have so far gone unanswered. Optimism is low due to the ongoing attacks and lack of diplomatic progress.</p>

          <p>The University of Tokyo is considering a program to temporarily accept international students from Harvard University if they are affected by potential U.S. government restrictions. This initiative follows a similar program launched in 2022 to support researchers and students displaced by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, providing research labs and accommodation free of charge. The U.S. government's move to potentially end Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students is under review following a temporary injunction issued by a U.S. federal district court. The Japanese university is currently exploring the details of how such a program would be implemented.</p>

          <p>An Israeli military strike on a Gaza school housing displaced Palestinians has resulted in dozens of deaths, sparking international condemnation. The Israeli military claims it targeted Hamas militants operating within a command and control center embedded in the school area, while taking steps to minimize civilian harm. This incident follows a recent Israeli missile strike that killed nine children from a doctor couple's family, further intensifying international outrage. Spain has called on its allies to halt arm supplies to Israel for use in Gaza, reflecting growing concerns over the ongoing military campaign and civilian deaths.</p>

          <p>The LEVA robot, developed by ETH Zurich, is designed to autonomously navigate environments and handle heavy cargo, combining wheels and legs for versatile movement. LEVA utilizes GPS, lidar sensors, and cameras to perceive its surroundings, enabling it to avoid obstacles and align itself for cargo pick-up and drop-off. What sets LEVA apart is its ability to load and unload cargo boxes without human intervention, securing boxes weighing up to 187 pounds using powered hooks. This technology could lead to faster, more reliable deliveries, reduced labor costs, and increased efficiency in various industries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the Trump administration's attacks on Harvard University, including revoking its certification to host international students and freezing research funds, as retaliation for the university's refusal to comply with demands regarding viewpoint diversity. The author argues that these actions represent a weaponization of the state against those who incur the administration's displeasure, instilling fear and undermining the rule of law. The author emphasizes the need for universities to stand together and for the public to understand the broader implications of these attacks, which damage American soft power and hinder scientific progress. The author also notes that, despite conservative efforts to stoke resentment towards higher education, a majority of Americans disapprove of Trump's approach.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the issue of overdiagnosis in modern medicine, as discussed in Dr. Suzanne O'Sullivan's new book, "The Age of Diagnosis." O'Sullivan argues that the eagerness to diagnose and preemptively screen patients is creating problems, as many diagnoses come with a huge amount of uncertainty. She advocates for "slow medicine," in which doctors and patients take time to develop a relationship, monitor symptoms, and take great care before naming a condition. While acknowledging the risk of missing aggressive diseases by slowing down, O'Sullivan believes that doctors have erred too far in the other direction, creating a different set of problems for patients.</p>

          <p>Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is facing criticism for accepting campaign contributions from the oil industry, despite his previous environmentalist credentials. Villaraigosa, now running for governor, defends his support for the oil industry by warning of rising gas prices due to refinery closures, arguing for an "all-of-the-above" energy approach. This stance has upset some environmental groups, who accuse him of violating a pledge not to accept campaign contributions from oil companies. Villaraigosa argues that the economy is different than in 2018, and working-class Americans are being hammered by the rising cost of living, which is a major factor in recent Democratic losses.</p>

          <p>An Austrian court has overturned former Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's conviction for giving false testimony to a parliamentary inquiry. Kurz was convicted in relation to statements he made to a parliamentary inquiry in 2020, where he downplayed his role in appointing executives for the ÖBAG state holding company. The three-member panel of judges acquitted Kurz, who had argued that he was interrupted during his testimony. Kurz is still under investigation for corruption in a separate case.</p>

          <p>Russia has escalated its assaults on Ukrainian cities, coinciding with a perceived step back in U.S. diplomatic and military support. Recent intense aerial bombardments have resulted in numerous casualties, while President Trump has expressed disapproval of Putin's actions but has not committed to providing military assistance to Ukraine. Analysts suggest that Russia is capitalizing on the reduced U.S. involvement, as Ukraine faces shortages of interceptor missiles and Russia upgrades its arsenal. A former top commander of Ukraine’s military has warned of a difficult future for the country, emphasizing the need for continued resources and strength to resist Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on China and proposed tax bill are threatening the growth of the U.S. battery industry, which depends on Chinese components and federal subsidies. Domestic factories that make batteries to store power for America’s rising energy demand depend on Chinese components and federal subsidies. Tariffs have already caused battery costs to rise sharply, and the Republican budget bill could restrict access to subsidies for making and installing rechargeable batteries. This uncertainty is causing companies to delay projects and put off new contracts, potentially hindering the country's ability to meet rising power demand and transition to renewable energy sources.

          <p>This article explores the history of electric vehicles, noting their popularity in the early 20th century before being overtaken by gasoline-powered cars. The author draws parallels between the challenges faced by early electric vehicles and the current political and market forces undermining their growth. The article notes that the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are working to undercut the growth of electric vehicles, impose a new tax on them and swing federal policy sharply in favor of oil and gasoline. The author states that while these changes probably wouldn’t kill electric vehicles, they could set the industry back years.</p>
