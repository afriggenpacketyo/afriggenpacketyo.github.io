        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding President Trump's executive order to limit birthright citizenship, focusing on whether federal district court judges can issue nationwide injunctions. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued against nationwide injunctions, claiming they create an unfair legal playing field for the government. Justices Sotomayor, Gorsuch, Barrett, and Jackson raised concerns about limiting injunctions and the potential for unlawful executive orders to remain in place too long. The court also considered whether limiting injunctions would create a chaotic system requiring individual lawsuits across the country. The ultimate decision could impact the scope of judicial power over presidential policies.</p>

          <p>After several high-profile Republicans declined to run for key Senate seats in 2026, questions have arisen about the party's ability to recruit competitive candidates. Seats in Georgia and Michigan are considered toss-ups, while Minnesota and New Hampshire lean Democratic, and Maine and North Carolina lean Republican. Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia and former Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire both passed on Senate bids. Some Republicans worry about recruiting centrist candidates who can appeal to statewide voters, while others downplay the significance of these decisions, pointing to Trump's continued popularity in some states.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Payday loans, marketed as quick fixes for financial emergencies, can quickly spiral into unmanageable debt due to high interest rates and aggressive repayment terms. Defaulting on a payday loan can lead to additional fees, aggressive collection tactics, damage to credit scores, and even lawsuits. Debt relief options such as debt consolidation, credit counseling, debt settlement, and bankruptcy can provide avenues for borrowers to regain control of their finances. Seeking help from certified credit counselors or debt relief professionals can be a crucial step in breaking the payday loan cycle.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in a case challenging birthright citizenship, but the focus was on whether federal district court judges can issue nationwide injunctions. Several justices expressed skepticism about the Trump administration's argument against such injunctions. Justice Brown Jackson raised concerns that limiting injunctions would create a "catch me if you can" system of justice. The case stems from Trump's executive order barring automatic citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to parents who entered the country illegally or were on temporary visas.</p>

          <p>A Trump administration initiative to arrest undocumented migrants for trespassing on a newly declared "national defense" zone along New Mexico's border with Mexico is facing legal challenges. A federal judge dismissed charges against nearly 100 migrants, citing a failure to prove the migrants knew they were entering a restricted military area. The situation has created confusion among locals, with concerns raised about access to public lands and the potential for encounters with active-duty troops. The judge's ruling highlights questions about the scope of the military's authority and the enforcement of immigration laws in the region.</p>

          <h2>Missouri Lawmakers Move to Repeal Abortion Protections Enacted by Voters</h2>

          <p>Missouri lawmakers passed a voter referendum that, if approved, would repeal protections for abortion rights and restore a ban on nearly all abortion care in the state. The move comes just six months after Missouri voters approved an amendment enshrining the right to reproductive freedom in the state constitution. If it passes, HJR 73 would prohibit abortions, except in cases of medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, or sexual assault. The initiative will appear on the November 2026 ballot unless Gov. Mike Kehoe calls a special election sooner than that.</p>

          <p>Tax relief programs can help taxpayers tackle unpaid IRS tax debt, which can be especially burdensome given economic uncertainty and high interest rates. Options include installment agreements, penalty relief, Offers in Compromise, Currently Not Collectible status, and filing or amending returns. Installment agreements allow taxpayers to pay over time, while penalty relief may reduce the amount owed. Offers in Compromise can settle debt for less, and Currently Not Collectible status can temporarily halt collection activities. Amending an incorrect return can also lower tax liability.

          <p>Oil prices experienced a downturn following President Trump's remarks in Doha, Qatar, indicating progress in negotiations for a nuclear deal between the U.S. and Iran. The anticipation of such a deal raised the prospect of increased Iranian crude oil exports, potentially adding up to 1 million barrels per day to the market. This development prompted a negative market reaction, though analysts suggest that OPEC+ may mitigate the impact by adjusting their supply strategies. The potential for a U.S.-Iran nuclear agreement is expected to significantly influence global oil markets.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article examines the growing debate over "debanking," where financial institutions close accounts or deny services based on political positions or risk assessments. While there is bipartisan concern, there is disagreement on what to do about it. The Trump administration is considering measures to address the issue, including an executive order and reviving a "fair access" rule. However, critics argue that debanking is often a result of legitimate risk management, not political discrimination. The article highlights the complexity of balancing free-market principles with concerns about fairness and access to financial services.</p>
