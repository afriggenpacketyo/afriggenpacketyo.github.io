          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal is churning off the southeastern U.S. coast, prompting tropical storm warnings for parts of the Carolinas, from the South Santee River to Surf City, North Carolina. With maximum sustained winds of 60 mph, the storm is expected to make landfall before sunrise on Sunday. The National Hurricane Center has warned of heavy rainfall, potential flash flooding, minor storm surge, and life-threatening surf and rip currents along the East Coast. Chantal is the third named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season.</p>

          <p>In a jailhouse interview, Robert Baker, who pleaded no contest to murdering beauty executive Fabio Sementilli, adamantly claimed his former lover and the victim's wife, Monica Sementilli, was not involved in the crime. Baker, sentenced to life without parole, stated that Monica "didn't know s***" about the murder plot, a claim that stands in stark contrast to the prosecution's case against her. Despite his assertion, Baker remained guarded on other details, often deferring answers until after Monica's trial. His potential testimony was a key point of interest for the defense.</p>

          <p>An Alvarado, Texas, police officer was shot in the neck on Friday night while responding to a report of a suspicious person near the Prairieland Detention Facility, an ICE center. The officer was transported to a hospital and later released. Following the shooting, several armed suspects who had fled the scene were apprehended with the help of multiple law enforcement agencies. In response to this and similar incidents, the Trump administration has stated it is taking a "zero tolerance" approach to assaults on federal officers and property.</p>

          <p>Monica Sementilli has been found guilty of orchestrating the 2017 murder of her husband, famed beauty executive Fabio Sementilli, in a case of lust, greed, and deception. Prosecutors successfully argued she conspired with her lover, racquetball coach Robert Baker, to kill Fabio and stage it as a robbery to collect on a large life insurance policy. Key evidence included Monica providing Baker with security system credentials and her suspicious activity on the day of the murder. Despite her defense team's arguments and her daughters' support, a jury convicted her of murder and conspiracy.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Study Reveals Genetic Influence on Brain's Information Processing Balance</h2>

          <p>Researchers in China have discovered that genetic factors play a significant role in shaping the brain's "criticality," which is the crucial balance between neural excitation and inhibition. This balance is known to be essential for the brain's ability to process information effectively. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, established a link between brain criticality and cognitive functions, suggesting a shared genetic foundation. These findings open new avenues for understanding brain function and the biological basis of potential neurological dysfunctions.</p>

          <p>In a surprising turn, prosecutors dropped all charges against Barry Morphew just days before he was set to stand trial for the murder of his wife, Suzanne, who vanished in 2020. The dismissal came after a judge sanctioned the prosecution for repeatedly failing to turn over potentially exculpatory evidence, including DNA from the crime scene linked to an unknown male in other sexual assault cases. Prosecutors stated they needed more time to locate Suzanne's body but could refile charges later. Morphew's defense attorneys maintained his innocence, criticizing the prosecution's handling of the case.</p>

During the war, Iran acknowledged over 900 deaths and significant damage to its nuclear facilities, retaliating with hundreds of missiles fired at Israel.

After being exposed with recorded evidence, MI5's subsequent internal reviews were found to have withheld key information and misrepresented facts.

          <p>Australian police have arrested and charged a 34-year-old man with reckless conduct endangering life and other offenses after he allegedly set fire to the doors of a Melbourne synagogue while worshippers were inside. The incident, which Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned as a "cowardly" act of antisemitism, occurred while people were inside for a Shabbat meal. No one was injured in the blaze, which was contained to the entrance. The attack is part of a rising wave of antisemitic incidents in Australia since late 2023.</p>
