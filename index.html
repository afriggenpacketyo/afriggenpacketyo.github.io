        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CNBC investigation has found that Walmart's rapid expansion of its third-party online marketplace has led to significant issues with counterfeit products and fraudulent sellers. The report details how relaxed vetting processes, aimed at competing with Amazon, allowed sellers to use stolen identities of legitimate businesses to list fake and potentially dangerous items, particularly in health and beauty categories. Shoppers, trusting the Walmart brand, have unknowingly purchased these counterfeit goods. In response to the findings, Walmart has stated its commitment to trust and safety and has reportedly begun tightening its seller verification procedures for certain product categories.</p>

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released after being detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months. The couple, who had lived in the country for decades running a charity, were freed following mediation by Qatar. Their family had publicly campaigned for their release, citing the couple's deteriorating health and harrowing prison conditions. The Taliban never disclosed the reason for their detention. The UK Foreign Office continues to advise against all travel to Afghanistan, noting that its ability to provide support to British nationals there is severely limited.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In her upcoming memoir, "107 Days," Kamala Harris reveals moments of frustration with Joe Biden during the presidential campaign, describing herself as "angry and disappointed" by his actions. One detailed incident involves Biden calling her just before a crucial debate with Donald Trump to discuss unsupportive power brokers, a move she felt was self-centered and distracting. The book also touches on her concerns about Biden's campaigning abilities and voice, and recounts an awkward exchange where Jill Biden questioned her family's loyalty. The memoir exposes underlying tensions and a sense that Harris's own accomplishments were sometimes downplayed by the president's team.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 06:13:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio has warned that the United States is facing a major fiscal crisis due to excessive government spending and spiraling debt, which he describes as "unsustainable." Speaking at a forum, Dalio argued that this situation risks devaluing major global currencies, making assets like gold and other non-fiat currencies more reliable stores of value. He suggested that investors should consider diversifying their portfolios by allocating around 10% to gold. Dalio noted that while the U.S. dollar may remain a primary medium of exchange, its value as a wealth repository is diminishing amid a global supply-demand imbalance for government debt.

          <p>A UK cabinet minister has rejected President Donald Trump's suggestion that the British military should be used to stop asylum seekers crossing the English Channel. Trade Secretary Peter Kyle stated that the military's focus is on national defense, while the UK Border Force is specifically responsible for policing the country's borders. The comments came after Trump, during a state visit, advocated for using military force to handle illegal migration. Meanwhile, the UK government is proceeding with its "one in, one out" deportation deal with France, which aims to deter the dangerous crossings organized by smugglers.</p>

          <p>Apple's new iPhone 17 lineup went on sale worldwide, drawing significant crowds in major markets like Beijing and London. The launch is a critical test for the company as it faces intensified competition from local brands in China, such as Huawei and Xiaomi, and navigates investor questions about its artificial intelligence strategy. Early sales indicators in China appear positive, with one e-commerce platform reporting that first-minute preorders surpassed the entire first-day volume of last year's model. The new models, including the iPhone 17 Pro and the thinner iPhone Air, are seen as key to maintaining Apple's market share and proving its continued innovation.</p>

McWhorter was last seen at a shopping mall in a Portland suburb, where she had reportedly been offered a ride by a man in a white pickup truck.

Experts note that as large retailers enter the resale market, they often use fast-fashion marketing tactics that can encourage overconsumption, undermining the core principle of sustainability. Studies also show that secondhand purchases do not always replace new ones, and the most effective way to reduce fashion's environmental impact remains wearing clothes for a longer period, regardless of whether they were bought new or used.</p>

          <p>Eddie Conyers, at 97 years old, is celebrating over 60 years of involvement with the University of Alabama's legendary football program. Having served as a practice referee under iconic coaches like Bear Bryant and Nick Saban, Conyers has been a constant presence for 12 of the team's 18 national championships. Originally recruited by Bryant in 1962 to help reduce in-game penalties, he became a beloved figure known for his good humor and mentorship.

          <h2>Fatal Stabbing on Charlotte Transit Highlights National Shift in Public Transit Crime</h2>

          <p>The recent fatal stabbing of a Ukrainian refugee on Charlotte's light-rail system has drawn national attention, including from President Trump, to the issue of public transit safety. While data shows that public transportation remains overwhelmingly safe, there appears to be a shift in the nature of crime, with a notable increase in assaults nationwide since the pandemic, even as thefts have declined. Criminologists suggest this trend reflects broader societal issues like homelessness and inadequate mental health services, which transit systems are ill-equipped to solve on their own. In response to the attack, Charlotte officials have increased police presence within the transit system.</p>

          <h2>Wildfire Smoke Contributes to 40,000 U.S. Deaths Annually, Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Nature quantifies the severe health impact of wildfire smoke, estimating it already contributes to approximately 40,000 deaths in the U.S. each year. The research links climate change to increased fire activity, projecting that by mid-century, smoke concentrations could double or triple, becoming a new norm. The analysis found that higher smoke exposure leads to an increased death rate, with effects lingering for up to three years, as fine particles exacerbate chronic conditions like heart and lung disease. Experts warn that adaptation strategies, such as air filtration and clean air centers, will be crucial for public health in an increasingly smoky future.</p>

          <p>The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) has filed a lawsuit to force the U.S. Department of Education to process loan forgiveness for borrowers who have met their legal obligations under existing programs. The union argues the department is unlawfully delaying debt cancellation for public service workers and those on income-driven repayment plans who have completed the required 20-25 years of payments. The department blames the delays on legal confusion surrounding the now-halted SAVE plan, created by the previous administration. With a congressional provision making loan forgiveness tax-free set to expire in 2026, the delays could result in significant tax bills for affected borrowers.</p>

          <p>Two decades after Israel's unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip, Israelis are intensely debating the decision's consequences and the prospect of re-establishing settlements. The 2005 withdrawal of 8,000 settlers was intended as a step toward peace but was followed by Hamas's takeover of the territory in 2007. Many, including former settlers, now argue the move created a vacuum that enabled the October 7th attacks, while others, like aides to former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, maintain that remaining in Gaza would have led to an even worse security disaster. Amid the current war, some hard-line Israeli government ministers are openly calling for resettlement, a deeply divisive issue within Israeli society.</p>

He asserted that the invasion has backfired by strengthening Ukrainian identity and expanding NATO.

          <p>Italian driver Fabio Barone has set a new world record for the fastest speed achieved by a car on the deck of a moving ship. Racing a modified Ferrari SF90 along the 774-foot flight deck of an Italian aircraft carrier, Barone reached a top speed of 101.9 mph. The attempt, which took place off the coast of Civitavecchia, required immense precision to accelerate to record speed and then brake safely before reaching the deck's end. After the successful run was verified by an official timekeeper, Barone's team announced they would submit the result to Guinness World Records for official certification.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan has decided to maintain its policy interest rate at 0.5%, a move that was widely expected by economists. The decision comes as Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes volatile fresh food prices, fell to 2.7% in August, its lowest level since November 2024 and the third consecutive monthly decline. While inflation remains above the central bank's 2% target, the easing trend and global economic uncertainty have reinforced the BOJ's cautious approach. The bank is prioritizing stability rather than premature tightening, in contrast to central banks in the U.S. and Europe that are now cutting rates.</p>
