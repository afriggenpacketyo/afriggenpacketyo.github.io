          <p>Long-serving Democratic Representative Jerry Nadler of New York has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026. In an interview, the 78-year-old congressman cited the necessity for "generational change" within the Democratic party as a primary reason for his decision. Nadler, who has been in Congress since 1992 and previously chaired the House Judiciary Committee, stated that watching the 2024 election outcome convinced him that a younger successor might better address the political challenges facing the country, including the rise of what he termed "incipient fascism."</p>

          <p>Following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China, former President Donald Trump sharply criticized the trade relationship between the United States and India, labeling it a "totally one sided disaster." In a social media post, Trump claimed India imposes excessively high tariffs on U.S. goods, hindering American businesses, and referenced a past offer from India to cut tariffs that he deemed too late. This statement comes amid escalating trade tensions, including U.S. tariffs imposed on India for its purchase of Russian oil, which has strained diplomatic relations.</p>

          <p>Chinese state broadcaster CCTV has hinted that new, improved versions of its YJ-21 and DF-17 hypersonic missiles could be featured in an upcoming Victory Day parade in Beijing. A military commentator on the network highlighted the potential debut of an air-launched variant of the YJ-21, which could be deployed from bombers outside enemy air defense zones. This development suggests China is working to create a versatile family of land-, sea-, and air-launched hypersonic weapons, enhancing its strategic military capabilities, though an air-launched version has not been officially confirmed as in service.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region were mostly higher as investors processed developments from the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin. However, sentiment was tempered by uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy after a federal appeals court ruled that many of President Trump's global tariffs are illegal. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw gains, as did South Korea's Kospi, which rose despite data showing a slowdown in consumer price inflation.

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has arrived in China by train to attend a military parade in Beijing commemorating the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. He is expected to join Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, marking the first time the three leaders, who are often viewed as adversaries of the U.S., will gather at the same event. This visit, Kim's first to China since 2019, occurs as North Korea continues to deepen its military and economic ties with Russia while relations with the U.S. and South Korea remain stalled.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation is using advanced facial recognition technology to potentially solve the nearly 50-year-old mystery of Imam Musa al-Sadr's disappearance. A photograph of a corpse, taken in a secret Libyan mortuary in 2011, was analyzed by experts at Bradford University, who determined a "high probability" that the body is that of the revered Lebanese Shia cleric who vanished in Libya in 1978. The finding supports the theory that Sadr was executed, possibly on the orders of then-leader Muammar Gaddafi, and contradicts the long-held belief by some of his followers that he is still alive.</p>

          <p>A commentary article highlights a growing trend among some Anglo-American intellectuals who are drawing parallels between the current state of their countries and the Soviet Union in the 1980s. The piece references an opinion in The Telegraph which argues that Britain's managerial class exhibits a similar political rigidity and fear of questioning obsolete dogma as the late Soviet establishment. The author suggests that while the comparison may be debatable, the mere existence of such concerns warrants serious attention, as the decline of the West could have profound global consequences.</p>

The court's decision centered on the president overstepping executive authority, stating that the power to levy tariffs rests with Congress.

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a Eurasian political and security bloc including China, Russia, and India, has decided to establish a new development bank. The move is aimed at insulating the ten member nations from risks associated with the U.S. dollar-dominated global financial system and accelerating key infrastructure projects. According to analysts, creating this concessional lender is a logical step for the group to enhance economic cooperation and reduce their reliance on Western-led financial institutions. The bank's establishment was officially announced following the SCO summit.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has announced his intention to award Rudy Giuliani the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. The announcement came two days after Giuliani, a longtime political ally, was seriously injured in a car crash. In his statement, Trump praised Giuliani as the "greatest Mayor in the history of New York City." The decision is notable given Giuliani's recent legal troubles, including being disbarred and criminally charged for his role in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.</p>

          <p>A new study has precisely dated the "Petralona cranium," a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave, to be at least 286,000 years old. This new minimum age, determined using advanced uranium-series dating techniques, places the skull firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era and helps resolve decades of debate. The findings suggest that the individual, likely belonging to the species Homo heidelbergensis, was part of an archaic human population that coexisted with, but was distinct from, emerging Neanderthals. This discovery provides crucial new insights into the complex and branching history of human evolution in Europe.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has announced a "decent chance" that the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, could be visible across much of the United Kingdom in the coming days. The increased visibility is due to a fast-moving coronal mass ejection from the sun, which could push the celestial display further south than usual. While visibility will depend on clear skies and low light pollution, the Midlands may have the best viewing conditions. Officials advise that Monday and Tuesday nights offer the best opportunity for a rare and memorable sighting for many in the UK.</p>

          <p>The recent transfers of Alexander Isak to Liverpool and Yoane Wissa to Newcastle have sparked a debate about the growing power of players to force moves. Both strikers refused to train and issued public statements demanding to leave their clubs, ultimately securing lucrative deals on deadline day. This contrasts with the case of Marc Guehi, who remained professional at Crystal Palace but saw his desired move to Liverpool collapse. The article explores the contentious issue, with some commentators calling the players' actions "despicable" while others argue clubs are "hypocritical" given their own lack of loyalty.</p>

          <p>Despite setting new age-related records at the US Open, questions remain about Novak Djokovic's physical durability as he seeks a 25th Grand Slam title. The 38-year-old has played himself into good form but has been hampered by various physical issues throughout the tournament, calling for a trainer in nearly every match. This follows a pattern from other recent Grand Slams where injuries affected his performance. As he prepares to face No. 4 seed Taylor Fritz, against whom he holds a 10-0 record, his biggest challenge may be whether his body can withstand the strain of the tournament's final stages.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that President Donald Trump is holding back on imposing more severe sanctions on Russia over the war in Ukraine for strategic reasons. Despite Russia continuing its attacks and ignoring calls for peace talks, Trump has refrained from deploying a "big bazooka" of economic punishments. According to analysts, this hesitation stems from two key factors: Trump's desire to be seen as a peace-broker who can bring both sides to the table, and a broader U.S. concern that completely isolating Russia would push it further into a strategic alliance with China, strengthening Beijing's global position.</p>
