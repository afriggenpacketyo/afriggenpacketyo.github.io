          <p>A former member of the British Parachute Regiment, known only as Soldier F, has been found not guilty of murder and attempted murder in connection with the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Londonderry. The judge acknowledged that paratroopers had shot unarmed civilians but concluded the evidence against this specific soldier fell short of the standard required for a conviction. The verdict has been met with disappointment from the victims' families, who have campaigned for justice for over five decades, while veterans' groups welcomed the judgment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The viral trend of matcha-infused cocktails, popular for their vibrant color and perceived health benefits, may be misleading consumers. Bartenders report that drinks like the matcha latte have become bestsellers, particularly among health-conscious Gen Z customers. However, nutrition experts caution that while matcha itself contains antioxidants, mixing it with alcohol largely negates its positive effects. The appeal seems to be a combination of the drink's visual novelty and the allure of a 'better-for-you' alcoholic beverage.</p>

          <p>Spanish authorities have confirmed through DNA analysis that a body found in the Turia river belongs to a man swept away during the catastrophic floods in Valencia in October of last year. The discovery brings a somber conclusion to one of three missing person cases from the disaster, which claimed over 230 lives. The tragic finding comes as the region prepares to mark the one-year anniversary of the floods amid ongoing public anger over the government's handling of the emergency response.</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. rose by 1.5% in September, reaching the highest pace in seven months, largely attributed to a decline in mortgage rates. According to the National Association of Realtors, this uptick in sales occurred despite stubbornly high prices, with the median home price increasing 2.1% year-over-year. Housing inventory saw a slight increase but remains historically lean, continuing to exert upward pressure on prices across most of the country.</p>

          <p>Climate scientists are monitoring a severe marine heatwave, nicknamed the 'blob,' in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, where August temperatures were 2.5°C above preindustrial levels. This phenomenon is expected to fuel more thunderstorms, disrupt marine ecosystems, and could lead to increased flooding in the Pacific Northwest. While its effects are most pronounced on the coast, the heatwave may also contribute to more severe winter weather in eastern North America later in the season.</p>

The practice of shutting down became more common after legal opinions from then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti established that agencies could not operate during a funding gap. The report notes that President Ronald Reagan's administration oversaw eight shutdowns, the most of any presidency, highlighting the evolution of this political tool over the past four decades.</p>

          <p>Despite earlier trade tensions, the U.S. and the European Union have found common ground in their response to the war in Ukraine, recently announcing complementary sanctions against Russia's energy sector. According to the U.S. Ambassador to the EU, this united front is intended to increase pressure on Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the conflict. This alignment marks a significant improvement in transatlantic relations, which had been strained by tariff disputes at the beginning of Trump's second term.</p>

          <p>This article explores the financial readiness of a 61-year-old man and his wife who have accumulated $1.5 million in savings and are debt-free. While their savings are well above the median for their age group, financial planners note it may fall short of the commonly recommended eight to ten times their annual income. The analysis considers various strategies, such as one spouse continuing to work, delaying Social Security benefits, and diversifying into alternative assets to ensure their retirement funds last.

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has recorded at least 20 detainee deaths this year, marking the deadliest year for the agency since 2004. This spike coincides with a significant increase in the detainee population, which is now approaching 60,000 people. Former officials and advocates warn that the combination of a larger population, decreased oversight, and persistent difficulties in staffing medical teams is creating a riskier environment and will likely lead to more deaths in custody.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent actions, including canceling a planned summit with Vladimir Putin and imposing new sanctions on major Russian oil companies, suggest a significant shift in his diplomatic strategy regarding the Ukraine war. After previous efforts focused on engagement failed to produce a breakthrough, the administration appears to be moving from a "carrot" to a "stick" approach. This change reflects growing frustration in Washington with Russia's unwillingness to compromise on its core demands for ending the conflict.</p>

          <p>A Cuban man deported from the U.S. to the African nation of Eswatini is now on a hunger strike that his lawyer says is life-threatening. The man has been held in a maximum-security prison for over three months without charge as part of the Trump administration's third-country deportation program. His case highlights the severe criticism faced by the program, which rights groups argue denies due process to individuals who have completed criminal sentences in the U.S. for offenses like murder and sexual assault.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is facing widespread backlash after stating that many people in Germany and across Europe are "afraid to move around in public spaces" due to migrants. Critics from opposition parties and even his own coalition partners have accused him of using racist, far-right rhetoric and fueling social division. Merz has defended his comments, asserting that he was addressing a genuine problem and telling reporters to ask their own daughters about safety in cities.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that contrary to its public rhetoric of deregulation, the U.S. government is heavily involved in regulating the foundational building blocks of artificial intelligence. Citing national security concerns, both the Biden and Trump administrations have implemented stringent export controls on advanced AI chips and other core components to maintain a strategic advantage over rivals like China. This strategic intervention at the hardware level reveals a policy of controlling AI's core infrastructure while allowing a lighter touch on consumer-facing applications.</p>

          <p>A high-profile national inquiry into grooming gangs in England and Wales has been thrown into disarray after four women resigned from its survivor liaison panel. The resignations were driven by concerns that the inquiry's focus might be diluted to cover broader child exploitation, a lack of trust in the proposed candidates for chairperson, and criticism of Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips. The turmoil has stalled the crucial investigation, causing further distress for abuse survivors seeking accountability.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis of satellite imagery and IDF-released footage suggests that the Israeli military is establishing a control boundary significantly deeper inside Gaza than was indicated on maps related to the recent ceasefire deal. Physical markers for the so-called "Yellow Line" have been placed hundreds of meters further into the strip in at least two areas, creating a de facto buffer zone. This discrepancy raises serious questions about the terms of the agreement and the safety of Palestinian civilians near the new boundary.</p>
