          <p>China is preparing to host a global summit focused on women's rights, expected to take place in October, while simultaneously promoting President Xi Jinping's views on gender equality and traditional family values. The government asserts that significant progress has been made in advancing women's rights over the past decades, positioning itself as both an advocate and an active participant in global gender equality efforts. However, sources indicate that domestic grassroots NGOs are unlikely to be invited unless they are sponsored by overseas entities. This context raises questions about the scope and inclusivity of the upcoming event, as official narratives appear to contrast with the experiences of local activists.</p>

          <p>A specialized UK Ministry of Defence unit, nicknamed the "war detectives," has successfully identified the remains of two Scottish soldiers more than 100 years after they went missing during the Battle of Loos in World War One. The investigation began after construction workers in France discovered over 100 bodies, with artifacts like regimental badges and unique tramway buttons providing crucial clues. Through meticulous genealogical research and DNA matching with living relatives, the team confirmed the identities of Lance Corporal Gordon McPherson and Lieutenant James Grant Allan. The soldiers were recently laid to rest with full military honors, bringing long-awaited closure to their families.</p>

          <p>The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) is demanding urgent action from the UK's Department for Education (DfE) over what it calls the "failing" Teachers' Pension Scheme. The union reports a surge in complaints from its members, citing significant payment delays that have left retirees in financial distress, excessive call wait times, and unresolved queries. While the DfE acknowledges the frustration and is working to resolve the issues, the union argues that a 2018 legal judgment and a lack of capacity have overwhelmed the system. The problems highlight systemic issues affecting one of the UK's largest retirement schemes, which serves two million members.</p>

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is set to deliver a speech on restoring the "warrior ethos" to hundreds of high-ranking military commanders at a rare gathering at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia. This unusual assembly brings together generals and admirals from around the world to hear Hegseth's vision and new standards for the U.S. military. The summons has generated speculation among officials, particularly as the reason for the meeting was not disclosed in the invitations. The event raises questions about logistics, costs, and the specific policy changes the Secretary intends to implement to reshape the military's culture and conduct.</p>

          <p>One year after Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic flooding and landslides in Western North Carolina, volunteer pilots are reflecting on their critical role in the immediate aftermath. With roads washed out and communication lines down, these pilots were among the first to witness the scale of the devastation, conducting rescue missions and delivering essential supplies. Groups like Total Flight Solutions and the Carolina Aviators Network coordinated dozens of helicopter and plane flights, rescuing over 100 people and dropping off necessities like medicine and food. Their efforts, supported by organizations like the United Cajun Navy, were vital in reaching stranded residents before larger-scale relief could arrive.</p>

          <p>The cost of policing ongoing protests in Epping, Essex, is expected to reach £1.7 million by October, according to the local police, fire and crime commissioner. The demonstrations began after an asylum seeker, Hadush Kebatu, was charged and later jailed for sexual offences, leading to significant public disorder outside the hotel where he was staying. Essex Police have made 32 arrests in connection with the unrest, which has at times turned violent, injuring eight officers. The substantial financial burden falls entirely on the local police force, as government assistance is only available if costs exceed a much higher threshold, creating a public service dilemma.</p>

          <p>South Korea is confronting a severe demographic crisis as its birth rate, currently at 0.748, remains one of the lowest in the world and far below the 2.1 replacement level needed to sustain its population. Economic analyses warn this trend could trigger a prolonged downturn by the 2040s, potentially erasing decades of economic growth and causing the economy to contract. The shrinking workforce is already placing immense pressure on the national pension system and reducing the pool of available military personnel, creating significant long-term challenges for the nation's security and prosperity. Despite over $270 billion spent on incentives, government efforts have failed to reverse the decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Startup founders are sharing their experiences of navigating the emotional and professional challenges of business failure and finding new paths forward. The high-pressure "hustle culture" of entrepreneurship often leads to a crisis of identity when a venture shuts down, forcing founders to confront disappointing investors and laying off employees. Some who return to corporate life face a stigma, though many argue that their entrepreneurial experience makes them highly capable employees with a broad understanding of business operations. Ultimately, many founders find that reframing success around purpose and mission, rather than purely financial outcomes, is key to building resilience and bouncing back from setbacks.</p>

Iran's president condemned the move as illegal and unjust, coming after Iran increased its nuclear activities following the U.S. withdrawal from the agreement in 2016. The reimposition of sanctions adds significant strain to an already volatile situation, despite recent confirmations that IAEA inspections have resumed at Iranian nuclear sites.</p>

England, the world's best-funded team, provides its 32 players with full-time contracts and state-of-the-art support, backed by a robust domestic league. In contrast, Canada's players earn a fraction of that amount and the national team relied on a million-dollar fundraising campaign to finance their World Cup preparations. Despite this financial gap, Canada has performed exceptionally, demonstrating that clever, targeted preparation and leveraging players' experience in England's league can challenge a financial powerhouse.</p>

          <p>Newly released files from the estate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein contain references to billionaire Elon Musk and the UK's Prince Andrew. The documents, turned over to the House Oversight Committee, include a 2014 calendar entry about a potential visit by Musk to Epstein's island and a 2000 flight manifest listing Prince Andrew as a passenger alongside Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. While the records do not imply wrongdoing or knowledge of criminal activity, they provide further insight into the extensive network of powerful individuals connected to Epstein. Democrats on the committee are pushing for the release of more documents to aid investigations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government is facing a potential shutdown as Congress has only four days to pass a funding bill, with Republican and Democratic leaders at an impasse. Republicans are pushing for a straightforward temporary extension, while Democrats insist on including protections for Affordable Care Act subsidies. A shutdown would halt non-essential government services, furlough hundreds of thousands of federal employees, and delay the release of key economic data, such as the monthly jobs report. With the deadline fast approaching, the political brinksmanship increases the likelihood of a lapse in government funding, which would have widespread impacts on services and programs across the country.</p>

          <p>New York's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has confirmed that Shane Tamura, the gunman responsible for killing four people in a Midtown Manhattan shooting, had low-stage Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). Tamura, a 27-year-old former high school football player, left notes referencing the brain disease and requesting his brain be studied, suggesting a potential link between his condition and his violent actions. CTE is a degenerative brain disease caused by repeated head trauma, and while its direct link to such behavior remains under study, the diagnosis provides a crucial, albeit tragic, context to the incident and fuels the debate over sports-related head injuries.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has ordered the deployment of Justice Department agents to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities nationwide following a series of attacks and threats. The directive came after a fatal shooting at an ICE office in Dallas, the latest in a spike of violent incidents targeting the agency. Bondi also instructed Joint Terrorism Task Forces to investigate these attacks as potential domestic terrorism, vowing to pursue the most serious charges against those involved. This move signals a significant federal escalation in response to growing protests and clashes surrounding the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>Dr. Ian Roberts, the superintendent of Des Moines Public Schools, was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, who stated he was in the country illegally and had existing weapons charges. At the time of his arrest, officials reported he was in possession of a loaded handgun and cash. The school district, which was unaware of a 2024 removal order against him, described Roberts as an integral part of the community, while DHS labeled him a "criminal alien." The arrest of the high-profile educator, a former Olympic athlete for Guyana, has sparked protests and highlights the ongoing impact of the Trump administration's stringent immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>Director Emerald Fennell aims to capture the "primal, sexual" feeling she experienced when first reading 'Wuthering Heights' as a teenager in her upcoming film adaptation. Speaking at a festival in author Emily Brontë's hometown, the Oscar-winning director of 'Saltburn' described her profound connection to the novel's complicated and devastating romance. The film, starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, has already generated buzz with an erotically charged trailer that hints at a highly stylized gothic interpretation. Fennell explained that adapting a book that means so much to her has been a huge responsibility and an intense, almost masochistic, creative exercise.</p>
