          <p>The White House has asserted that Canada "caved" to pressure from President Trump by rescinding its planned digital services tax that would have impacted major U.S. tech companies. The reversal occurred after Trump threatened to halt trade negotiations, with top economic aide Kevin Hassett suggesting other countries with similar taxes could face U.S. opposition. The move is presented as a significant victory for American tech firms and workers, clearing the way for trade deal talks to resume. (not investment advice)</p>

The legislation, which increases the deficit by an estimated $3.3 trillion over a decade, combines spending increases for defense and border security with cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court will hear a case challenging the legality of federal limits on coordinated spending between political parties and their candidates. The case, brought by Republican campaign committees, argues that these caps on "coordinated party expenditures" violate the First Amendment's free speech protections.

          <p>The Senate's draft of President Trump's major spending bill introduces a new excise tax on wind and solar projects, a move that could significantly hinder the renewable energy industry. The provision, aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing by penalizing the use of components from countries like China, is projected to raise consumer energy prices. In addition to the new tax, the bill accelerates the phasing out of existing clean energy tax credits. The proposal has drawn criticism from the renewable energy sector and manufacturing unions.

          <p>The U.S. is on track for one of the deadliest years in its immigration detention system following the recent deaths of two men in ICE custody. With 13 deaths reported in the 2025 fiscal year so far, the total could surpass figures from recent years. Advocates and attorneys attribute the rise to deteriorating conditions within a system strained by aggressive deportation efforts and overcrowding, with detention facilities operating far beyond their stated capacity. The increasing number of fatalities raises serious concerns about the state of federal immigration detention.</p>
