          <h2>Israel to Resume Ceasefire Negotiations Despite Calling Hamas's Demands 'Unacceptable'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 18:14:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Israeli government has agreed to send a negotiating team to Qatar to continue ceasefire talks, even as it deemed Hamas's latest proposals "unacceptable." Hamas had issued what it called a "positive response" to a U.S.-mediated framework for a 60-day truce and hostage exchange, but requested changes that Israel rejected. The development comes amid U.S. diplomatic pressure for a deal to halt the nearly 21-month conflict. The article also notes ongoing controversy surrounding the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an aid organization backed by the U.S. and Israel.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Representative Mark Green of Tennessee officially announced his resignation from Congress, further shrinking the already slim Republican majority in the House of Representatives. His departure leaves the GOP with a 219-212 majority, potentially creating more challenges for Speaker Mike Johnson in passing legislation. Green, who chaired the Homeland Security Committee, stated he is returning to the private sector to start a business focused on competing with the Chinese Communist Party. His seat in the solidly Republican district is expected to be filled in a future election.</p>

          <p>Two American aid workers from the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) were injured in a grenade attack at a food distribution site in Khan Younis. The GHF and the U.S. State Department accused Hamas of the attack, though no evidence was immediately provided. This incident occurred as Israeli airstrikes killed at least 14 more people, and other Palestinians died while trying to access food aid. The violence underscores the perilous conditions in Gaza, even as fragile ceasefire negotiations show some signs of progress.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is renewing efforts to curb the influence of Chinese drone manufacturers through executive orders, but faces significant challenges due to China's commanding position in the global market. While Washington has previously attempted to limit the use of Chinese drones over security concerns, firms like DJI remain world leaders, making their products difficult to remove from commercial and industrial supply chains. Industry insiders view the latest US move as a potential negotiating tactic but warn that a ban could significantly raise costs and disrupt operations for American businesses that rely on the technology.</p>

          <p>Bobby Jenks, the dominant closer for the 2005 World Series champion Chicago White Sox, has died at the age of 44 after a battle with stomach cancer. Jenks burst onto the scene in 2005, securing the final out to end the White Sox's 88-year championship drought. An All-Star in 2006 and 2007, he set a record by retiring 41 consecutive batters in 2007. After struggling with addiction, which cut his career short, Jenks became sober in 2012 and was remembered by the team as an iconic member of the White Sox family.</p>

The move comes after Musk's vocal opposition to a major spending bill and his declaration that the country needs a party that "actually cares about the people."

          <p>Brazilian table tennis star Hugo Calderano, the 2025 World Cup champion, will miss a major tournament in Las Vegas due to a visa issue with the United States. Calderano, who also holds a Portuguese passport, was informed he was no longer eligible for the U.S. visa waiver program because he had competed in Cuba in 2023 for Olympic qualifying events. An attempt to secure an emergency visa was unsuccessful due to time constraints. The incident highlights potential travel complications for international athletes ahead of major US-hosted events like the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.</p>

          <p>As per his own instructions, the autobiography of legendary American author Mark Twain is being published a century after his death in 1910. The highly unconventional memoir was not written but dictated by Twain over four years, allowing him to speak freely on any topic he chose, resembling a modern blog. The work contains his uncensored, and often sharp, opinions on figures like President Theodore Roosevelt, his raw grief over his daughter's death, and his reflections on his life and times. Twain imposed the 100-year embargo to ensure he could be completely candid without hurting living individuals.</p>

          <p>A highly competitive qualifying session for the British Grand Prix has set up the prospect of a thrilling six-car fight for victory on Sunday. Red Bull's Max Verstappen narrowly took pole position ahead of McLaren's Oscar Piastri, with just 0.23 seconds separating the top six drivers from Red Bull, McLaren, Mercedes, and Ferrari. Teams have opted for different car setups, with Red Bull prioritizing straight-line speed while rivals focus more on cornering grip. This strategic divergence, combined with the close pace and a chance of rain, promises an unpredictable and exciting race at Silverstone.</p>

          <p>Metropolitan Police arrested 29 people in London on Saturday on suspicion of offenses under the Terrorism Act for demonstrating in support of Palestine Action. The protest in Parliament Square occurred just as the proscription of the group came into effect, making it a criminal offense to show support for the organization. The UK government banned Palestine Action following a history of criminal damage, including a recent incident causing millions in damages at an RAF base. The ban was challenged unsuccessfully in court by the group's co-founder.</p>

More than 600 firefighters are battling the fire, which is being fueled by heat and wind and is primarily threatening the Carrizo Plain National Monument, home to endangered species.

          <p>President Donald Trump is facing condemnation from Jewish groups after using the antisemitic term "Shylock" to describe some bankers during a rally in Iowa. The word, derived from a villainous Jewish moneylender in Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," is a long-standing ethnic slur. The Anti-Defamation League called the president's use of the term "very troubling and irresponsible." When questioned, Trump claimed he was unaware of the term's offensive connotations, stating he understood it to simply mean a moneylender who charges high rates.</p>
