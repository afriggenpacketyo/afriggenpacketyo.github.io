          <p>Lucy Connolly, a Conservative councillor's wife, had her appeal dismissed after being jailed for 31 months for inciting racial hatred in a social media post where she called for "mass deportation" and urged followers to "set fire" to hotels housing asylum seekers. The tweet was viewed 310,000 times before deletion. Judges at the Court of Appeal ruled that the original sentence was not manifestly excessive, reinforcing the consequences for inciting racial hatred online. The case highlights the serious legal repercussions for online hate speech and incitement to violence.</p>

          <p>Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, will be released from prison four months early after his sentence for contempt of court was reduced. He was jailed for ignoring an order not to repeat false allegations about a Syrian refugee who successfully sued him for libel. The High Court accepted that Yaxley-Lennon had shown a "change in attitude" and assured compliance with the injunction, leading to the reduction of his sentence. Despite an "absence of contrition or remorse," the judge considered his assurance of future compliance sufficient to warrant the sentence reduction.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study has traced the ancestor of animals and plants to a hydrogen-metabolizing cell that existed before the Great Oxidation Event, which occurred at least 2.1 billion years ago. The study, published in Nature, suggests that the last common ancestor of eukaryotes lived around 2.72 billion years ago under oxygen-deficient conditions. Eukaryotes are cells or organisms characterized by a membrane-bound nucleus and are the foundation of complex, multicellular life. Understanding the origins of eukaryotes can provide insights into the evolution of life and potentially have implications for the exploration of life in outer space.</p>

          <p>The Northern Jaguar Project in Sonora, Mexico, is working with ranchers to protect jaguars by paying them for photos of wild cats taken on their land. This program, Viviendo con Felinos, aims to change the perception of jaguars from threats to valuable ecosystem features. Ranchers earn money for photos of jaguars, ocelots, pumas, and bobcats, incentivizing them to protect these animals. This initiative has expanded the protected area for jaguars and fostered a cultural shift among ranchers, making them more tolerant of the cats' presence and the losses they may cause.</p>

          <p>Retired four-star admiral Robert Burke was convicted on corruption charges for steering a $355,000 contract to a company in exchange for a lucrative job. After retiring from the Navy in 2022, Burke began working at the company for $500,000 a year and unsuccessfully tried to secure another contract for the firm.

Home Depot aims to maintain current pricing levels across its product range, with over half of its products sourced from the U.S. The company has also diversified its import sources, reducing reliance on China, and expects no single country outside the U.S. to account for more than 10% of purchases by next year. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's plan to increase prices in response to higher tariff costs.</p>

          <p>Economists and policy experts are raising concerns that a Republican-backed tax and spending bill moving forward in the House could add trillions to the U.S. deficit. The proposed tax breaks are projected to significantly outweigh any savings from spending cuts, potentially leading to higher debt levels. Moody's Ratings downgraded the nation's debt, citing the bill's potential to add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit over the next decade. Critics within the Republican party also argue the bill fails to adequately address the country's spending trajectory.</p>

          <p>World Sevens Football (W7F), a new seven-a-side series, aims to capitalize on the growing popularity of women's football by offering a faster, more dynamic format and significant financial rewards for players. The series, backed by a $100 million investment, features shorter matches on smaller pitches to attract younger fans. While the inaugural event has faced criticism for schedule conflicts with domestic leagues, organizers emphasize a player-centric approach and substantial prize money. The new league hopes to promote women's football and provide players with better opportunities and recognition.</p>

          <p>President Vladimir Putin is prioritizing Ukraine's capitulation over normalizing relations with the United States, potentially limiting Russia's economic prospects. Despite President Trump's openness to economic rapprochement, it is contingent on peace in Ukraine, which could confine Russia to economic stagnation. Putin's strategy is likely driven by the belief that time is on his side, with oil prices stabilizing and the Russian economy continuing to expand. Russia's military is also ramping up for another large-scale summer offensive, indicating a continued focus on military objectives over economic gains.</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary trade truce, Chinese exporters are continuing to diversify away from the U.S. market due to the lasting impact of the intense trade war. A survey found that 95% of Chinese exporters plan to increase exports to markets outside the U.S., anticipating a continued "decoupling" between the two countries. Many firms expect a decline in export turnover this year due to U.S. tariffs, even after the recent tariff reduction. This shift reflects a long-term strategy to reduce reliance on the U.S. market and mitigate risks from trade tensions.</p>

          <p>President Trump's cuts to foreign assistance are jeopardizing infrastructure projects in Africa that align with U.S. priorities, such as an overpass in Ivory Coast financed by the American people. The administration is shifting towards a "trade, not aid" policy, prioritizing commercial diplomacy and deals. However, experts argue that agencies like the Millennium Challenge Corporation, which funds large infrastructure projects in select countries, have boosted commercial diplomacy and directly benefited U.S. interests. The future of these projects remains uncertain, despite their potential to strengthen American influence.</p>

          <p>Emergency departments in the United States are facing a crisis due to the increasing number of patients "boarding" in ER beds while awaiting placement in traditional hospital wards. This leads to overcrowded waiting rooms, compromised patient care, and increased frustration among staff. A study shows that boarding has negative effects on the training of young doctors, reducing their ability to manage patients and handle department surges. The root causes are complex and systemic, including financial pressures on hospitals, an aging population, and limited access to primary care and aftercare services.</p>
