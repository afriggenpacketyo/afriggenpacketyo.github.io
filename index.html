          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to resume distributing funds allocated for EV chargers to 14 states that had sued to challenge the freeze on these funds. The lawsuit was filed after the Department of Transportation paused the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, citing the need for revised guidance. The judge's preliminary injunction includes a seven-day pause for a potential appeal by the administration. The states argued that the delay hindered their efforts to cut transportation-related carbon emissions, while the Department of Transportation stated the Biden-Buttigieg NEVI program guidance was a disaster and failed to deliver EV chargers.</p>

Rutte later defended his use of the term, describing Trump as a "good friend" and praising his decision to strike Iran and broker a ceasefire.

          <p>A judge ordered Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador and later returned to the U.S., to be released from prison while he awaits trial on federal charges. Despite the court order, Abrego Garcia is likely to be immediately taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which has stated he must be deported regardless of the outcome of his criminal trial. The U.S. government accuses him of transporting migrants without legal status from Texas to other parts of the U.S. since 2016, to which he pleaded not guilty on June 13. Abrego Garcia's attorneys deny accusations that he is a criminal and a member of the MS-13 gang.</p>

He cited an assessment from Israelâ€™s Atomic Energy Commission, which said the U.S. strike on Fordo rendered it "inoperable." Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth echoed Trump's sentiment, stating that Iran's nuclear program is obliterated.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) clarified on social media that Waffle House IDs will not be accepted as valid identification for travel. This response came after a flight passenger posted a photo of their Waffle House ID on X, jokingly suggesting it was a "realest ID" alternative to REAL ID. The TSA emphasized that the Waffle House ID does not comply with federal rules. This follows a previous TSA announcement advising travelers not to use Costco cards as identification, highlighting the agency's efforts to ensure compliance with REAL ID requirements which took effect on May 7.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s growing influence over federal vaccine policy is raising concerns, as he replaced the members of the advisory panel with his own picks, some of whom share his anti-vaccine views. This panel makes vaccine recommendations that are usually adopted by the federal government and followed by pediatricians and schools. The medical community is mobilizing to produce alternative vaccine guidance to counter Kennedy's influence, but this may create confusion. Kennedy's claims about the harms of vaccines have been continually debunked, but his views may now be smuggled into official federal recommendations.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City mayoral primary is analyzed for insights into Democratic politics. Mamdani's success is attributed to his charisma, ability to communicate effectively, and populist messaging about affordability. He focused on containing costs for ordinary New Yorkers while combating the interests that inflated them. His win also suggests that attacking an opponent as insufficiently pro-Israel is not a surefire strategy, reflecting a shift in Democratic views on the Israel-Palestine conflict. This victory also increases the likelihood of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez winning in 2028.</p>

          <p>Shares of Flagstar, the rebranded name of New York Community Bancorp, declined after Zohran Mamdani's apparent victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary. Mamdani promised to freeze rent increases in stabilized units, potentially impacting the profitability of multi-family rental properties. Analysts estimate that a significant portion of Flagstar's multi-family loan portfolio is exposed to New York rent regulations. Office-focused real estate stocks with New York City exposure also faced pressure, with SL Green Realty and Vornado Realty Trust experiencing declines.</p>

Data from the early days of the operation indicated that a majority of those arrested had never been charged with or convicted of a crime.

The proposal aims to reduce the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, which regulates the amount of capital banks must hold.

However, Governors Adriana Kugler and Michael Barr opposed the move, arguing it would primarily benefit shareholders rather than increase Treasury intermediation.
