          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 16:01:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Marvell Technology's stock fell sharply after the chipmaker's fiscal second-quarter data center revenue failed to meet analyst expectations. Despite overall revenue jumping 58% year-over-year, driven by AI demand, the company provided a lackluster forecast for the upcoming third quarter, projecting revenue slightly below consensus estimates. CEO Matt Murphy attributed the flat sequential data center guidance to the non-linear growth patterns of large infrastructure build-outs by cloud providers. The uncertainty led some analysts to downgrade the stock, citing concerns over the company's near-term AI growth prospects and a need for more clarity on its customer pipeline.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies player Kyle Schwarber made baseball history by hitting four home runs in a single game against the Atlanta Braves, becoming just the 21st player in MLB history to do so. The performance set a new franchise record with nine RBIs and propelled him to the top of the National League's home run leaderboard with 49 for the season. Schwarber's historic night was pivotal in the Phillies' dominant 19-4 victory. He joins Mike Schmidt as the only other Phillies player to accomplish this feat, which last occurred in 1976, marking a memorable moment for the team and its fans.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles classical music station KUSC-FM has laid off eight employees after a significant reduction in federal funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The parent company, Classical California, which also operates San Francisco's KDFC, confirmed it lost $1.1 million in support due to cuts enacted by the Republican-led Congress and the Trump administration. The stations, owned by the University of Southern California, are the most-listened-to classical stations in the U.S. and are now appealing directly to listeners for contributions to address the budget shortfall and maintain their 24-hour classical music programming.</p>

          <p>Meta announced it is temporarily modifying its AI chatbot policies for teenage users as it faces a Senate investigation into potentially inappropriate conversations. The company is training its AI to avoid generating responses related to sensitive topics like self-harm and to prevent romantic discussions, instead directing teens to expert resources. This move follows a report that internal documents permitted "sensual" conversations with minors, which Meta has since called erroneous. Advocacy group Common Sense Media recently issued a risk assessment advising against teen use of the AI until fundamental safety failures are addressed by the company.</p>

          <p>The Director General of Deutsche Welle (DW), Peter Limbourg, has called on the Israeli government to protect journalists after Israeli soldiers fired tear gas directly at a DW news crew in the occupied West Bank. The team was documenting the risks faced by media professionals when they were targeted, despite wearing protective gear clearly marked with "PRESS." This incident follows a separate attack in July where Israeli settlers threw stones at another DW team.

          <p>Microsoft has terminated the employment of four workers who participated in a protest against the company's ties to the Israeli military. The firings followed a break-in and sit-in at the Redmond, Washington office of company president Brad Smith, organized by the advocacy group 'No Azure for Apartheid.' The protesters demanded Microsoft sever its contract with Israel, citing reports that its Azure cloud platform is used for surveillance of Palestinians. While Microsoft has launched an investigation into the use of its technology, it condemned the employees' actions as unacceptable violations of company policy that created safety concerns.</p>

          <p>Seattle police have arrested a 29-year-old man in connection with the June home invasion and robbery at the residence of rapper Macklemore. During the incident, two men entered the home through an unlocked door and used bear spray on the nanny while the rapper's three children were present. The investigation, a collaboration between multiple law enforcement agencies, led to the discovery of stolen items, including a distinctive Seattle Sounders ring, at a local jewelry store. The suspect was initially arrested for a separate robbery, and authorities are investigating links to other high-profile burglaries targeting celebrities in the area.</p>

CEO Rami Atallah pointed to the recent suspension of the de minimis exemption by the Trump administration, which had previously allowed for duty-free shipping of packages under $800 to the United States. This change, combined with tighter liquidity and a lender's move to sell the company, created insurmountable financial pressure.

The request centers on allegations that she may have inappropriately avoided paying a higher rate of stamp duty on a property purchase by declaring it as her main residence. Tory Party chairman Kevin Hollinrake has asked the prime minister's standards adviser to determine if Rayner broke ministerial rules, calling the situation "hypocritical tax avoidance."

          <p>The latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data revealed that U.S. inflation remained persistent in July, with the annual rate holding at 2.6%. Core PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, ticked up to 2.9%, remaining stubbornly above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Despite this, consumer spending rose by 0.5%, suggesting resilience, though many are making cautious trade-offs on discretionary purchases. While analysts believe the new data still allows for a potential interest rate cut in September, the persistence of inflation highlights the delicate balance the Fed must strike between controlling prices and supporting a weakening job market.

Based on newly discovered fossils from Morocco, the herbivorous dinosaur was covered in long, bony spikes that were uniquely fused directly to its rib bones, a feature unseen in any other known vertebrate. This elaborate armor, which researchers have likened to a "punk rocker," challenges previous theories about the evolution of ankylosaurs. Scientists had previously believed that their defensive armor developed gradually over time, but this early specimen suggests a far more complex and bizarre beginning.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is suing President Donald Trump to block his attempt to fire her from the central bank's board. In court, Cook's lawyers argued her removal was based on unsubstantiated allegations of mortgage fraud and lacked the legally required "cause" for dismissing a Fed governor. They characterized the move as a politically motivated attack on the Fed's independence, part of Trump's broader effort to influence its interest rate policies. The Justice Department countered that the president has broad authority to remove federal officials, setting the stage for a significant legal battle over presidential power and central bank autonomy.</p>

          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, has been reelected in a landslide victory, four years after white officials allegedly locked him out of town hall and prevented him from serving. In 2020, Braxton became mayor-elect after running unopposed, but the incumbent government refused to recognize his authority. Following a federal lawsuit and settlement over the town's decades-long practice of appointing officials without elections, this week's vote was the first held since the 1960s. Braxton's decisive win is seen as a significant turning point for democratic governance in the small, majority-Black town.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed into law a new congressional map that heavily favors Republicans, a move pushed by President Trump to bolster the GOP's majority in the U.S. House. States typically redraw maps only once per decade, making this mid-decade redistricting highly contentious. Experts predict the new map could allow Republicans to flip up to five seats in the 2026 midterm elections. Democrats and voting rights groups have condemned the map, arguing it unfairly marginalizes voters of color, and have already filed legal challenges against it, setting the stage for a protracted court battle.</p>

          <p>The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum plans to temporarily close its "Americans and the Holocaust" exhibit for an "upgrade," sparking concern among some staff about potential content changes. The exhibit, which offers a critical view of the U.S. response to Nazi Germany, will close after Labor Day until February 2026. This comes after President Trump's executive order to eliminate "anti-American" content from museums and his replacement of several museum board members. While the museum states the closure is for maintenance and there are no editorial changes planned, some staff fear the move could be part of a broader overhaul.</p>

          <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has called a special election for a state Senate seat that has been vacant for nearly nine months, setting up a high-stakes contest. The seat, formerly held by a Democrat, is crucial as Democrats currently hold a slim 19-18 majority in the chamber. A Republican victory would result in a tied Senate, potentially allowing the GOP to block parts of Whitmer's legislative agenda in her final year as governor. Whitmer had faced criticism for the long delay in calling the election, which will now take place with a primary in February and a general election in May 2026.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is facing a leadership crisis following the firing of its director, Susan Monarez, after less than a month in the role. Her dismissal by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was followed by the resignations of three other top CDC leaders, including the chief medical officer, in protest. Kennedy has appointed one of his top advisors, Jim O'Neill, as acting director, a move that has drawn concern as O'Neill is not a physician or scientist. The shakeup reflects a significant shift in the agency's direction and has prompted calls for congressional oversight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a move to cut $5 billion in foreign aid funds that were previously approved by Congress for the current fiscal year. The White House is using a rare budgetary maneuver known as a "pocket rescission," which requests the cancellation of funds so late in the fiscal year that they may expire before Congress can act. The proposed cuts target programs at USAID and the State Department, including funding for international peacekeeping and democracy promotion. The move is expected to face legal challenges and has drawn criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans for circumventing Congress's constitutional power of the purse.</p>

          <p>As a new academic year begins, the first cohort of high school and college seniors who have had access to generative AI for their entire careers is entering its final year. The technology has been widely adopted by students for various tasks, leading to a normalized and often unchecked usage that many educators have not fully grasped. This has created a state of "pedagogical debt," where existing teaching methods are proving inadequate. Educators are now debating the future, with some advocating for a return to fundamental critical-thinking skills while others push for a more practical, skills-based curriculum that incorporates AI.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has officially canceled the Secret Service detail for former Vice President Kamala Harris, seven months after she left office. While law mandates six months of protection for former vice presidents, the term can be extended by presidential directive, which former President Joe Biden had reportedly done for Harris. The decision has been criticized by some Democrats as politically motivated retribution. However, other sources suggest the move may be a standard reallocation of resources for the Secret Service, which faces a heavy workload protecting current officials and preparing for major international events.</p>

          <p>A UK Court of Appeal has overturned a High Court injunction, allowing asylum seekers to remain at the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex. The initial ruling would have forced their relocation by September 12, but Lord Justice Bean found it was "seriously flawed" for failing to consider the difficulty of finding alternative accommodations. The case arose after Epping Forest District Council argued the hotel's owner breached planning rules, a move prompted by local protests. The appeal court's decision is a significant development in the ongoing legal and political battles over housing asylum seekers in hotels across the country.</p>
