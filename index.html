        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government measures will empower police chiefs to automatically dismiss officers who fail background checks, aiming to boost public confidence in policing following scrutiny after Sarah Everard's murder. The reforms, making background checks a legal requirement for all officers, address concerns that some officers who fail vetting checks remain in their positions on full pay. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper emphasized that these rules are essential to restoring trust in policing, ensuring only officers of the highest standards wear the uniform. The changes are supported by the National Police Chiefs' Council, providing clear routes to remove individuals who fall below expected standards after a High Court ruling left policing in a 'hopeless position'.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in New Jersey's Ocean County has prompted mandatory evacuations for residents in Ocean Township, Lakewood, and Lacey Township, spreading across thousands of acres and threatening over a thousand structures. The fire, which began at the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area, has already damaged several businesses and led to the deployment of helicopters and planes to drop water on the flames. While no injuries have been reported, thousands have been evacuated and are being sheltered by the Red Cross at Southern Regional High School and Manchester Township High School. The cause of the fire is under investigation, and officials are urging the public not to fly drones in the affected areas as crews work to contain the blaze.</p>

          <p>Tesla is proceeding cautiously with its entry into the Indian market, according to CFO Vaibhav Taneja, due to high import tariffs and luxury taxes that could double the price of Tesla vehicles in India. Despite India's interest in Tesla establishing a base in the country, protectionist policies pose significant challenges for the EV maker. CEO Elon Musk recently discussed collaboration on technology and innovation with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, signaling ongoing negotiations to address these obstacles. Tesla views India as a promising market with a large middle class but acknowledges the need to carefully navigate the complex regulatory landscape. </p>

          <p>More than 7 million Canadians have already cast their ballots in advance for the upcoming federal elections, setting a new record for early voter turnout. This represents a 25% increase compared to the previous election in 2021, with about a quarter of eligible voters participating early. The election is taking place amidst an ongoing trade war with the U.S. and concerns about President Trump's comments regarding Canada's sovereignty.

          <p>Chinese state-backed energy firms and private gas distributors may need to renegotiate long-term LNG procurement contracts with U.S. providers due to the escalating trade war and tariffs. Trade flows of U.S. LNG to China have ceased since February 10, following Beijing's imposition of tariffs on the fuel in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Although the U.S. has supplied a relatively small portion of China's LNG imports, Chinese buyers hold numerous long-term contracts with U.S. producers, and the volumes were expected to increase significantly. In the short term, the majority of LNG expected to be delivered to Chinese clients this year could be resold to buyers in other markets.</p>

          <p>China is focusing on strengthening research integrity and upgrading punishments for academic misconduct to support its innovation push, according to an opinion piece in the People's Daily. The article highlights that despite efforts to improve research integrity, academic dishonesty remains frequent due to weak penalties. It argues that such violations waste resources, undermine fair competition, and damage the international reputation of China's scientific community. This emphasis on academic integrity comes as China accelerates its hi-tech drive and aims for technological self-sufficiency amid increasing competition with the United States.</p>
