          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a suspect in two 2003 San Francisco Bay Area bombings linked to animal rights extremism, is facing an extradition hearing to be returned to the United States after 21 years as a fugitive. The FBI's most wanted terrorist was apprehended in a remote Welsh cottage last year, having evaded capture despite previous "missed opportunities" by agents who found bomb-making materials in his abandoned car. Prosecutors seek his return to face federal charges for maliciously damaging and destroying property with explosives, although no one was injured in either attack. His eventual capture underscores the FBI's enduring commitment to pursuing individuals on their most wanted lists, regardless of the time elapsed.</p>

          <p>Global financial markets are bracing for a week marked by heightened volatility, particularly within the bond markets across the UK and Europe, following unprecedented yield movements. Political uncertainty in France, including the potential for snap elections, is amplifying investor concerns ahead of a crucial sovereign debt rating review by Fitch on September 12. The European Central Bank is scheduled to meet on Thursday, where interest rates are widely expected to remain at 2%, and President Christine Lagarde will likely address the French economic situation. This period underscores a significant confidence crunch impacting international investors and the broader economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taiwan is swiftly advancing its long-range strike capabilities through the development of a new class of low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), often referred to as suicide drones. This strategic initiative, dubbed a "high-low" approach, seeks to provide more affordable yet effective alternatives to traditional cruise missiles, thereby strengthening Taiwan's defensive capabilities against potential threats from mainland China. The project involves a significant collaboration with the US, specifically with Kratos’ Unmanned Systems Division on the Chien Feng IV system, which is reportedly progressing rapidly. These drones are anticipated to have a range exceeding 1,000km, enabling them to strike deep inside mainland China, with a public debut expected later this month.</p>

          <p>Sky-watchers across much of the UK are preparing for a spectacular total lunar eclipse this evening, which will transform the full Moon into a striking "Blood Moon" as it passes through Earth's shadow. While the full eclipse occurs between 18:30 and 19:52, visibility in the UK depends on moonrise times, with eastern areas getting the longest view. This celestial event, caused by Earth's position directly between the Sun and Moon, allows sunlight to refract through Earth's atmosphere, casting a reddish hue. It offers a rare chance to witness the mechanics of the solar system, with the next UK-visible eclipse not until 2026.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, in collaboration with X-energy, have made a significant breakthrough in developing advanced nuclear fuel, known as TRISO pebbles. These uranium-packed pebbles are touted as the "most robust nuclear fuel on Earth," designed to be safer and more efficient than traditional fuel rods, as they cannot melt in a reactor. This innovation is crucial for powering a new wave of advanced nuclear reactors expected by 2030, aiming to reduce US dependence on foreign high-assay, low-enriched uranium supplies. While challenges like cost and waste storage remain, the potential for stable, low-carbon energy supporting renewables is immense.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that world leaders who attempt to appease Donald Trump consistently face negative outcomes, citing examples like India's Modi, France's Macron, and the EU's von der Leyen. The author contends that Trump's relationships are personal and impermanent, driven by ego rather than policy, leading to broken pledges and lopsided deals. The article urges UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to abandon his "Trump-whisperer act" ahead of an upcoming state visit, suggesting that resistance, as demonstrated by leaders like China's Xi and Brazil's Lula, is a more effective strategy for dealing with the former US president. The author views the UK's current approach as a descent into "colonial subservience."</p>

Quarterback Nico Iamaleava voiced his profound frustration, emphasizing the team's urgent need for increased effort and improvement. The game, plagued by numerous penalties and strategic missteps, undoubtedly heightens the pressure on coach DeShaun Foster early in his second season at the helm.</p>

          <p>A collaborative US-China research team has pioneered an innovative method for launching millimeter-scale robots by harnessing the energy released from collapsing vapor bubbles, a phenomenon known as cavitation. This ingenious technique involves rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, which causes surrounding water droplets to boil and trigger the formation of vapor bubbles. Once these bubbles expand to a critical point, they suddenly collapse, rapidly releasing energy and generating a powerful force capable of launching the tiny jumpers up to 1.5 meters into the air. By meticulously controlling the light flow, scientists can precisely direct how and where these micro-robots launch from a wet surface, and can even enable them to swim, opening new avenues for robotic mobility and demonstrating cavitation as an efficient launching mechanism.</p>

          <p>Heather Hall, a college teacher and mother of two from South Carolina, has been identified as the American victim among the 16 fatalities in Lisbon's recent deadly funicular crash. Hall, an instructor specializing in literacy and special education at the College of Charleston, was in Lisbon to deliver a presentation at a conference. Her family fondly remembered her as a "tireless advocate for equity, representation, and belonging," who "passed away doing what she did best — living life fully, boldly, and with a heart wide open to the world." Investigators have since determined that a cable along the 140-year-old railway snapped, leading to the derailment and the tragic loss of life for individuals of multiple nationalities.</p>
