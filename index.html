          <p>Novo Nordisk secured a significant legal victory against compounding pharmacies, limiting their ability to market cheaper, unapproved versions of Wegovy and Ozempic. A federal judge rejected a bid by these pharmacies to continue making copies during a legal challenge over drug shortages. The ruling upholds the FDA's determination that the semaglutide shortage is resolved, allowing the agency to target pharmacies making compounded versions. This decision follows Novo Nordisk's aggressive legal actions to protect patients from health risks posed by illegitimate semaglutide drugs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite economic challenges, China believes it has the advantage in its trade war with the U.S. China needs American dollars less than the U.S. needs Chinese goods, minerals, and industrial inputs. America's allies are unwilling to join the trade war, and the political damage is less severe for the Chinese Communist Party than for the GOP. China can offset the impact of lost sales to Americans by boosting domestic spending and increasing exports to other countries.</p>
