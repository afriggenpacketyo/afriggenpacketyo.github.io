          <p>Over 50 Afghans, recently deported from Iran, were killed in a tragic bus crash in Afghanistan's Herat province. The bus, en route to Kabul, collided first with a motorcycle and then with a fuel truck, causing it to erupt in flames. This incident occurs as a large number of Afghans are returning from Iran and Pakistan, many forcibly, amid ongoing humanitarian crises in their home country. The victims were traveling from the Islam Qala border crossing when the fatal accident occurred.</p>

          <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has updated its immunization schedule, recommending the Covid-19 vaccine for children as young as six months, a stance that conflicts with the Trump administration's federal guidance. The CDC's advisory committee, which was recently restructured, advises "shared clinical decision-making" for this age group rather than a universal recommendation. The AAP's decision has drawn criticism from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who accused the organization of being influenced by pharmaceutical companies and undermining the CDC's process. This disagreement could impact insurance coverage for the vaccine for young children.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, is churning off the U.S. East Coast, generating warnings of dangerous rip currents and potential life-threatening flooding from Florida to New England. Although the storm is not expected to make landfall, its large size is causing significant coastal impacts, with mandatory evacuations ordered for parts of North Carolina's Outer Banks. The Category 2 hurricane, with winds of 105 mph, has already caused power outages in Puerto Rico and prompted beach closures in several states. Officials are urging residents and visitors to exercise extreme caution near the water.</p>

          <p>Boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. has been deported from the United States to Mexico, where he is wanted on charges related to arms and drug trafficking, as well as alleged ties to the Sinaloa Cartel. The deportation occurred nearly two months after his loss to Jake Paul and followed a U.S. arrest for overstaying his visa. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum confirmed his arrival in Mexico to face the charges. Chávez Jr., who has a history of legal issues and drug addiction, was deemed an "egregious public safety threat" by U.S. authorities due to his criminal record and suspected cartel affiliations.</p>

          <p>Texas State Representative Nicole Collier, a Democrat, has filed a legal petition alleging she is being illegally confined within the state Capitol. After Democrats returned to Texas following a walkout to block a GOP-led redistricting plan, they were assigned police escorts to ensure their presence for a legislative session. Collier refused the escort and remained in the Capitol, where she was allegedly told she would be subject to arrest if she left. Her lawyers argue that while the law allows compelling absent members to attend, it does not permit detaining members who are already present.</p>

          <p>Boston Mayor Michelle Wu has publicly rebuked the Trump administration's threats to prosecute leaders of "sanctuary jurisdictions" and withhold federal funding. In a press conference, Wu declared that "Boston will not back down," asserting that the city follows the law and will not be coerced into changing its immigration policies. The Department of Justice, under Attorney General Pam Bondi, had sent letters to Boston and other cities demanding compliance with federal immigration enforcement efforts. Wu's response criticizes the administration's approach as an attack on cities designed to distract from its own failures.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to issue an executive order to end mail-in voting before the 2026 midterm elections, claiming the practice is "corrupt." However, legal experts assert that the president lacks the constitutional authority to dictate how states conduct their elections. The U.S. Constitution grants state legislatures the power to determine the "times, places and manner" of holding elections, with a secondary role for Congress, but not the executive branch. Trump's move follows his long-standing, unproven claims of fraud associated with mail-in ballots, despite the method being widely used in both Democratic and Republican-leaning states.</p>

          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has discovered a new, small moon orbiting Uranus, temporarily designated S/2025 U1. The satellite is estimated to be only about six miles in diameter, which likely explains why it was not detected by the Voyager 2 spacecraft during its 1986 flyby. This discovery brings the total number of known moons around the ice giant to 29. Researchers believe the complex system of small inner moons and faint rings around Uranus suggests a chaotic evolutionary history. The new moon will be officially named by the International Astronomical Union, following tradition.</p>

The author contends that it is possible for Chinese citizens to condemn the brutality of the wartime Japanese military while simultaneously embracing modern Japanese culture, such as anime and manga. The piece pushes back against overseas criticism that such commemorations are a form of hostile education. It posits that remembering the past is about understanding history and honoring resilience, not about fostering vengeance against the Japanese people of today.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approach to negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine appears to prioritize the process of holding meetings over the substantive details of a peace agreement. Following summits with both Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump's focus has been on arranging a trilateral meeting to "get it finished," while European leaders and Zelensky are more concerned with specifics like cease-fires and security guarantees. This analysis suggests Trump's method, which treats diplomacy as a sequence of steps, overlooks the complexities of the conflict, including Putin's apparent disinterest in a deal.

Kangethe, an accountant and father to three U.S. citizen children, sees leaving his family in Michigan as the "safest option" to avoid being sent to a detention center. His story highlights the personal toll of the U.S. immigration system and the difficult choices some undocumented individuals face.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's stock increased by 3% after the retailer maintained its full-year sales outlook, projecting a 2.8% growth in total sales. This occurred even though the company's second-quarter earnings and revenue fell slightly short of Wall Street's expectations for the first time since 2014. The company noted that while homeowners still exhibit a "deferral mindset" regarding large projects due to economic uncertainty, it saw momentum build throughout the quarter, with big-ticket transactions rising. Home Depot is also expanding its focus on professional contractors through acquisitions like SRS Distribution to drive future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the Democratic Party seeks a new, positive vision following recent electoral setbacks, a philosophy known as "abundance liberalism" is gaining traction among party elites. Championed by writers like Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, this approach advocates for overcoming bureaucratic hurdles to build more of what society needs, such as clean energy, infrastructure, and especially affordable housing. However, the article suggests this pro-development stance can be politically treacherous. It points to high-powered suburbs as places where such policies often face strong local opposition, highlighting the challenge of translating the abundance vision into practice.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared his intention to combat what he terms "woke" content in the nation's museums, specifically calling out the Smithsonian Institution. He has instructed his lawyers to use the same playbook his administration has employed against colleges and universities, which has involved threatening to withhold federal funding to force policy changes. Trump criticized museums for focusing on negative aspects of American history like slavery, demanding they instead highlight "Success" and "Brightness." This move signals a potential new front in the culture wars, with the Smithsonian's federal funding as a likely point of leverage.</p>

This follows Newcastle's rejection of a £110 million bid from Liverpool for the Swedish international.
