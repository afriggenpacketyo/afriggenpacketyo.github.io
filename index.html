The Polish president mainly has a ceremonial role, but can veto government bills, command the armed forces, influence foreign policy, and propose new legislation. Donald Tusk's pro-EU coalition government's reform attempts have been repeatedly blocked by the current conservative incumbent, Andrzej Duda. </p>

          <p>Students could face subject "cold spots" if universities are not allowed to collaborate more to deliver courses, according to a new report. A government review of higher education funding is underway in England, and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) supports collaboration where possible in a challenging financial situation for the sector. Universities UK found reluctance to collaborate due to concerns about breaking business laws. Greater collaboration could help institutions cut costs and become more efficient, but more clarity is needed to prevent universities from making isolated decisions about course closures or mergers.</p>

The charity's new report calls for a notification system to ensure authorities are aware when a child moves into temporary accommodation. More than 164,000 homeless children are currently living in temporary accommodation across England, and families are being displaced due to a lack of affordable housing. The government says it is investing ¬£1bn in homelessness services this year to help families trapped in temporary accommodation.</p>

The law, yet to be implemented, aims to increase black ownership of land, but faces opposition from political parties and lobby groups who argue it threatens property rights. The government says the law provides for compensation in most cases and is needed to rectify historical imbalances. Legal experts suggest expropriation without compensation would occur in rare circumstances, such as when land is unused or abandoned.</p>
