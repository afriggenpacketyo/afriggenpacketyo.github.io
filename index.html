          <p>The supermarket Iceland is introducing a new initiative to combat rising retail theft by offering customers a £1 credit for reporting shoplifting incidents. The company's executive chairman stated that theft costs the business £20 million annually, impacting its ability to lower prices and invest in staff. To receive the reward, customers must alert a staff member to a theft in progress, which is then verified, though apprehension of the suspect is not required. This program launches as police-recorded shoplifting offenses in England and Wales have reached their highest level in over two decades.</p>

          <p>Russian troops have achieved limited tactical gains in Ukraine's Donetsk region just days before a summit between Presidents Putin and Trump in Alaska. Analysts suggest Russia may leverage these battlefield advances to gain a strategic advantage during negotiations, a risk Ukraine's President Zelenskyy has acknowledged. The developments create a tense backdrop for the high-stakes discussions, with the U.S. and its European allies closely watching to see if their interests will be protected amid the ongoing conflict. The situation highlights the precarious military balance as diplomacy proceeds without Ukraine at the table.</p>

          <p>Shares of semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials fell over 10% after the company issued a disappointing forecast for the current quarter. While its fiscal third-quarter results surpassed estimates, the company projected future earnings and revenue significantly below analysts' expectations, citing macroeconomic uncertainties and reduced visibility, particularly in its China business. The company noted that potential U.S. tariffs and a large backlog of pending export license applications are creating headwinds, expecting a decline in revenue driven by reduced demand from China.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to lift a lower court's order that restricts how federal agents can conduct immigration raids in Los Angeles. The contested injunction prohibits law enforcement from stopping or detaining individuals based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. While the order still allows these factors to be considered alongside other evidence, it has reportedly reduced immigration arrests. The case raises questions about the judiciary's ability to impose broad restrictions on law enforcement tactics, a practice the Supreme Court has historically discouraged.</p>

Danish brand Pandora reported an 8% rise in U.S. sales for the second quarter, while ultra-luxury group Richemont also saw a significant jump in its Americas sales. This trend is occurring despite challenges like potential tariffs, a weakening dollar, and rising costs of precious metals like silver and gold. While the U.S. market remains robust, industry leaders acknowledge that these economic pressures could eventually impact consumer demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Republicans have sharply criticized Governor Gavin Newsom's announcement to move forward with a new state redistricting plan, labeling it a politically motivated power grab. The governor's announcement, which included social media posts mocking President Trump, was met with accusations that he is undermining the state's independent Citizens Redistricting Commission.

          <p>Shares of online real estate company Opendoor surged approximately 10% following the resignation of CEO Carrie Wheeler. Her departure comes after an intense pressure campaign from investors, including hedge fund manager Eric Jackson and co-founder Keith Rabois, who were dissatisfied with the company's turnaround efforts. Opendoor, which went public via a SPAC in 2020, has struggled with rising interest rates and a difficult housing market, though its stock has seen a recent resurgence. The company has named its technology chief as an interim leader while it begins a search for a new CEO.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its plan to lay off over 1,400 employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The 2-1 decision lifts a previous injunction that had blocked the workforce reduction, which would leave the agency with only about 200 staff members. The administration aims for a more streamlined bureau, but critics and the employees' union argue the cuts would cripple the CFPB's ability to perform its congressionally mandated duties to protect consumers. The ruling is a significant step in the ongoing effort to reshape the agency created after the 2008 financial crisis.</p>

This affordability contrasts sharply with coastal markets like San Jose, where the median mansion is valued at $6.5 million. The more affordable large homes are typically older, and their availability reflects broader regional housing market trends where overall costs are lower compared to the rest of the country.</p>

Protests erupted last month after a resident was charged with sexual assault, leading to disturbances and multiple arrests.

For a $3,000 balance, the minimum monthly payment typically ranges from $55 to $85, depending on the issuer's calculation method, which often combines a percentage of the balance with accrued interest. Simply paying the minimum is a costly strategy that can prolong debt for years due to compounding interest.

While government ownership of private enterprise is typically avoided, proponents argue it is necessary to ensure a reliable domestic supply of critical technology. The news caused Intel's stock to climb, with shares on track for their best week in over 25 years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified from a tropical storm into the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, with forecasters predicting it could become a major hurricane over the weekend. Currently a Category 1 storm, Erin is located east of the Leeward Islands and is moving west-northwest. While it is expected to bring heavy rain and dangerous surf to parts of the Caribbean, its forecast path currently shows it curving northward and remaining offshore of the U.S. East Coast. The storm's development comes as the hurricane season approaches its typical peak period from mid-August to mid-October.</p>

          <p>Associated British Foods (ABF), the owner of the Kingsmill bread brand, has announced an agreement to purchase its rival Hovis. The merger would create the largest bread producer in the United Kingdom, surpassing current market leader Warburtons. ABF plans to implement cost-cutting measures to make the combined entity profitable, as both brands have faced declining sales amid shifting consumer preferences toward specialty breads and lower-carbohydrate diets. The deal, which is valued at an estimated £75 million, will require approval from the UK's competition regulator to proceed.</p>

          <p>A loud sonic boom was heard across several counties in England, including Essex, Cambridgeshire, and London, causing houses to shake. The Royal Air Force confirmed that three Typhoon fighter jets were launched from RAF Coningsby to intercept a civilian aircraft that had lost communication with air traffic control. Communications were successfully re-established, and the plane was safely escorted to Stansted Airport. A sonic boom occurs when an aircraft exceeds the speed of sound, and the noise generated widespread reports on social media from residents who thought an explosion had occurred.</p>

          <p>All-rounder Jacob Bethell, at 21 years old, is set to become the youngest man to captain England in international cricket. He will lead an understrength T20 squad for a three-match series against Ireland in September, as regular captain Harry Brook and other key players are being rested. The appointment is a significant show of faith in Bethell, who has had limited playing time this summer but is highly regarded by England's selectors. The record for the youngest captain was previously held by Monty Bowden, who was 23 when he led the team in 1889.</p>

          <p>The UK's largest bioethanol plant, Vivergo Fuels in Hull, will start closing down operations after the government declined to offer a rescue package to the sector. The company, along with another major plant in Redcar, had warned that a recent US-UK trade deal removing tariffs on imported ethanol had made their businesses unviable. The government stated that providing taxpayer funds was not in the national interest and would not solve the industry's long-term issues. The closure will result in redundancies and could impact thousands of jobs in the supply chain.</p>
