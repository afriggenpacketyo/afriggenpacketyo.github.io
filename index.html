          <p>The Department of Justice has placed an attorney on indefinite paid leave after he struggled to defend the government's position in a lawsuit involving a Maryland man who was wrongly deported to El Salvador. The attorney, Erez Reuveni, was reportedly cited for a "failure to zealously advocate" for the government's interests during a hearing where he couldn't provide details surrounding the deportation or justify the administration's actions. Attorney General Pam Bondi emphasized the requirement for DOJ attorneys to advocate zealously for the United States and warned of consequences for failing to do so. The government is seeking to appeal the judge's order to facilitate the man's return.</p>

          <p>The central U.S. is reeling from days of severe storms, tornadoes, and widespread flooding, resulting in at least 15 deaths and significant infrastructure damage. Torrential rain has caused rivers to swell to major flood stages, prompting flash flood emergencies in multiple states. Interstate commerce is also affected, with potential shipping and supply chain delays due to flooding in major cargo hubs like Louisville and Memphis. The National Weather Service is facing staffing challenges, which are hampering their ability to manage the crisis effectively, and Kentucky has been particularly hard-hit, with numerous road closures and evacuations.</p>

Discussions are underway in European capitals about the EU's role in a multipolar world, especially after decades of benefiting from the U.S.-led Western order.

One honored the birth of a child, while another appears to commemorate the Aussie rock band AC/DC.

          <p>President Donald Trump dismissed concerns about the stock market decline following tariff announcements, predicting a market boom and significant inflows of capital. He compared the market's decline to a patient’s operation and said, “I think it’s going very well, it was an operation... It’s a big thing. I said this would be exactly the way it is. We have $6-$7 trillion coming into our country, and we have never seen anything like it.” He imposed a blanket 10% tariff on all trading partners and levied more duties on the countries he described as “bad actors”. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3Ci&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C/i&#x3E;</p>

          <p>Somerset's Tom Banton smashed an unbeaten 344 against Worcestershire, setting a new record. Banton set the tone, moving from his overnight score of 84 to post his fourth first-class century in quick time from 124 balls, glancing Tom Taylor off his legs to raise that landmark with his 20th four. Worcestershire deployed seven different bowlers during the session, but Ben Allison was the only one to inconvenience the batsmen. Ethan Brookes afforded Worcestershire overdue relief when taking a brilliant return catch to end Rew's five and-a-half hour innings, after which Banton took centre stage during a dramatic final hour.</p>

          <p>An animal rights group has criticized ITV for its coverage of the Grand National after Broadway Boy suffered a heavy fall, with the group accusing the broadcaster of a "cowardly refusal to replay the 25th fence where Broadway Boy fell, while commentators gushed over racing’s welfare standards”. Initial fears for his life eased later as he got to his feet and was returned to the stables.

          <p>The article examines the viral morning routine of fitness influencer Ashton Hall and its implications for modern masculinity. While seemingly benign, the routine promotes a conservative gender philosophy that reinforces traditional roles and male dominance. The author argues that such content, though less overtly misogynistic than figures like Andrew Tate, subtly normalizes regressive ideas and contributes to a broader shift towards conservatism among Gen-Z men. It is a subtle lean towards patriarchy, which wears its motivations more lightly while feeding into our many new channels of misogyny.</p>

          <h2>Economists Question Trump's Tariff Formula</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists are raising concerns about the formula used by President Donald Trump to calculate tariff rates, arguing that it is based on flawed assumptions. They say the formula relies on an elasticity rate that is lower than it should be in practice, leading to inflated tariff rates. One report found that the trade-weighted average tariff rates used to justify the tariffs are higher than they are in reality. These concerns suggest that the economic rationale behind Trump's tariffs may be questionable. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3Ci&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C/i&#x3E;</p>

          <p>A 9-year-old boy in Kentucky died after being swept away by floodwater while walking to his school bus stop, despite a flash flood warning in effect. The Franklin County School System is under scrutiny for not canceling classes on Friday, despite the widespread flash flood warning and the fact that the district had already canceled two school bus routes earlier that morning. Some residents say Gabriel’s death was a tragic accident with no one at fault, some parents blame the school district for not delaying or canceling classes Friday – despite the widespread flash flood warning.</p>
