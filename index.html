          <p>Columbia University will pay $221 million to the federal government to resolve investigations into alleged anti-discrimination violations and antisemitism on campus. The agreement, which includes a $200 million payment over three years, restores approximately $400 million in federal research grants that the Trump administration had withheld. While the university does not admit wrongdoing, it has implemented reforms such as banning identity-concealing masks and will be subject to oversight by an independent monitor. The deal has drawn mixed reactions, with some praising the reforms and others criticizing the university for capitulating to political pressure.</p>

          <p>Tensions at the disputed border between Thailand and Cambodia escalated into an armed clash, with both nations accusing the other of initiating the conflict. The exchange of fire occurred near the Ta Muen Thom temple, a site of recent friction, and resulted in at least two Thai soldiers being injured. Cambodia's defense ministry stated its troops acted in self-defense against Thai aggression, while Thailand claimed Cambodian soldiers fired first after a drone incursion. The incident marks a significant deterioration in bilateral relations, which are at their worst in over a decade following other recent border incidents.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has declared the Trump administration's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship unconstitutional, affirming a lower court's decision. The ruling from the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals represents another significant legal setback for the policy, which aims to deny citizenship to most individuals born on U.S. soil. The court agreed that the order would cause irreparable harm by depriving a class of people of their citizenship rights. This legal battle is expected to continue, likely heading to the Supreme Court for a final determination on the principle embedded in the 14th Amendment.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve, a move that marks a significant escalation in his public pressure campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell. This will be the first official visit by a sitting president to the central bank in nearly two decades, breaking with the long-held tradition of respecting the Fed's political independence. The visit is seen as a remarkable symbolic challenge to the institution's autonomy, as Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates. This direct confrontation raises concerns about the future of independent monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major study suggests that walking just 7,000 steps per day can substantially lower the risk of serious health issues like dementia, cancer, and heart disease. Published in The Lancet Public Health, the research indicates this may be a more achievable and evidence-based target than the widely promoted 10,000-step goal, which originated from a 1960s marketing campaign. The findings show significant health benefits compared to lower activity levels, with many advantages leveling off after 7,000 steps. Researchers hope this more realistic benchmark will encourage more people to track their steps as a practical way to improve their overall health.</p>

          <p>Five Australian women who were subjected to invasive strip-searches at Doha's airport in 2020 have won a crucial legal victory, allowing them to proceed with their lawsuit against Qatar Airways. An Australian federal court overturned a previous ruling that had dismissed the case, finding that the airline could potentially be held responsible under international travel laws. The women were removed from a flight and examined after a newborn was found abandoned in the airport. Their lawsuit seeks damages for unlawful physical contact and false imprisonment, and the case is now expected to proceed to trial.</p>

          <p>A rare, vibrant purple sea snail, Janthina janthina, has been discovered on a La Jolla beach, a species not typically seen in Southern California. These pelagic snails float on the open ocean using a self-secreted bubble raft and are usually found in warmer subtropical waters. Researchers at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography noted this is the first local sighting in a decade and it coincided with unusually warm offshore water temperatures. While a direct link to climate change is not confirmed, scientists will monitor for more appearances if warm water trends continue, suggesting the snails could be an indicator of changing ocean conditions.</p>

While regulators aim to make it harder for children to access adult material, concerns remain about user privacy and the effectiveness of these checks.

This export surge was partly fueled by companies expediting shipments ahead of potential U.S. trade tariff adjustments.

          <p>A report indicates that plans for a military strike in Yemen, shared on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s Signal account, originated from a classified email marked “SECRET/NOFORN.” This undercuts the Pentagon's insistence that no classified information was shared on the commercial messaging app. The Pentagon's Inspector General is investigating whether Hegseth personally sent the messages, which included sensitive operational details like takeoff times and bombing schedules. The incident has raised serious questions about operational security and the appropriate use of commercial communication apps for sensitive government matters, with the Pentagon yet to clarify its official policy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed three executive orders aimed at shaping the U.S. artificial intelligence industry, including one specifically targeting what he termed "woke Marxist lunacy" in AI models. The order requires federal funding recipients to ensure their AI systems are politically neutral and free from "ideological dogmas" like diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Other orders focus on accelerating the permitting process for data center construction and promoting the export of American AI technology. The actions are part of a broader administration plan to assert U.S. dominance in AI while removing regulatory hurdles and addressing conservative grievances about tech bias.</p>

          <p>The United States has finalized new trade agreements with Indonesia and the Philippines, which will see imports from the two nations face a 19% tariff while U.S. exports to them will be duty-free. Analysts suggest this move is an indirect strategy to counter China's economic influence by reshaping regional supply chains and securing access to resources like rare earth minerals. However, the effectiveness of this strategy may be limited, as Chinese companies have been proactively localizing their production within Southeast Asia over the past several years. This reduces their reliance on the transshipment hubs that previous U.S. policies targeted. (not investment advice)</p>

Over 70% of teens have used AI companions, with many reporting daily interactions to discuss everything from mundane decisions to serious personal issues. While some teens find it helpful, researchers and experts are concerned that over-reliance on AI could hinder the development of crucial real-world social skills, critical thinking, and emotional resilience. They worry that AI, which is always available and non-judgmental, could replace human relationships and exacerbate youth loneliness.</p>

          <p>In the first six months of the Trump administration's second term, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is on track for its highest number of annual deportations since 2014. Internal figures show nearly 150,000 deportations, projecting to over 300,000 for the year, driven by a broad mandate to crack down on illegal immigration. However, this pace still falls significantly short of the administration's stated goal of one million annual deportations, underscoring operational and legal constraints. With an unprecedented funding increase, ICE plans to hire more agents and expand detention capacity, suggesting enforcement could intensify further. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite this, median home sale prices hit a record high in June, driven by homeowners with low-interest mortgages who are reluctant to sell.

          <p>An analysis of the Trump administration's new AI Action Plan suggests it heavily favors the interests of major technology companies by prioritizing rapid, unregulated development. The plan, which aims for "global AI dominance," proposes stripping away environmental and state-level regulations to accelerate the construction of data centers and energy infrastructure. Critics argue the plan was effectively "written by and for tech billionaires," adopting many policy recommendations from firms like OpenAI and Anthropic. This approach bets on innovation by removing roadblocks but risks pushing the nation toward a potential tech bubble bust if the technology's promises don't materialize.</p>
