          <p>Millions of student loan borrowers were promised an interest-free break, but some are still seeing their debt grow, with one borrower reporting an unexpected $3,000 in interest. It is unclear how widespread this issue is, but a spokesperson for the Education Department stated that those enrolled in the SAVE Plan remain in a forbearance that is not accruing interest. Higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz advises borrowers to check their loan history and contact MOHELA if their debt has grown since July 2024. MOHELA has posted a notice stating that the interest notice is not a bill and no action is needed, but the situation has caused confusion and concern for borrowers. This highlights the need for clear and accurate communication regarding student loan policies.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Don Bacon has voiced his opposition to President Donald Trump's proposed rescission measure, which includes cuts to global health programs, particularly those related to AIDS prevention. Bacon emphasized his support for funding medicine and preventing AIDS, citing it as a "noble program" and a legacy of George W. Bush. The White House official stated that the rescission package aims to eliminate wasteful programming without affecting life-saving assistance. Bacon has previously demonstrated independence from Trump, such as voting against renaming the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. Bacon's stance reflects a willingness to challenge party lines on issues he believes are important.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republicans are pushing for tax cuts by arguing that safety net programs are rife with waste and abuse, and that recipients are not working hard enough; however, the majority of aid recipients who can work are already employed, and those who aren't are often ill, disabled, or caring for family. The safety net programs could be improved by reducing red tape and disincentives to upward mobility, but Republicans are driven by the unfounded belief that poverty is due to bad moral character. Three in ten Americans rely on some form of federal aid to live, including nearly half of all children, while another 41% of US households make too much to qualify for public safety net benefits but still not enough to survive. Shaping policy around false stereotypes prevents policymakers from working together on real solutions, as people living in poverty want economic independence.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party hopes to resolve the controversy surrounding the winter fuel payment policy. Rachel Reeves initially limited the payment to pensioners receiving pension credit or means-tested benefits, saving £1.5 billion annually. This decision sparked criticism and complaints from Labour MPs and voters, particularly during local elections. The government has since reversed course in three stages, adjusting the threshold and expanding eligibility for the upcoming winter. Some suggest the initial decision reflected genuine concerns about the Treasury's financial state, while others believe the government could have handled the situation better from the start.</p>

          <p>The city of Glendale, California, has ended its 18-year contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to hold detainees, citing public safety, transparency, and community trust as core values. The decision follows rising tensions over immigration raids in the Los Angeles area and reports that Glendale continued the contract despite California's sanctuary state law. The city maintains its agreement complied with state law but acknowledges the divisive public perception of the ICE contract. The move is praised by immigrant rights advocates, who see it as a step toward rebuilding trust in the community, while the city recognizes it will make visitation more difficult for some families.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented policies and used rhetoric that portray transgender individuals as inherently dishonest or dishonorable. This stance marks a shift from Trump's earlier, more moderate comments on transgender issues. Actions such as prohibiting trans people from military service and considering the withdrawal of Medicaid funding for gender-affirming treatments have been criticized. The administration's approach is seen as divisive and out of touch with the majority of Americans who believe that discrimination against trans people exists. Critics argue that the administration's actions are not about fairness but about waging a polarized fight against a vilified enemy.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of NIH officials have signed a letter to Director Jay Bhattacharya, condemning recent changes that have thrown the agency into chaos. The letter criticizes the firing of thousands of workers and the rescinding of funding from numerous research projects. Officials express concern that the agency is becoming a "weapon of the state," used to punish institutions and censor science. The letter, titled the Bethesda Declaration, is modeled after Bhattacharya's own Great Barrington Declaration, hoping he will recognize their concerns. The scientists express concern that the Trump administration is interfering with legitimate scientific research for political reasons.</p>
